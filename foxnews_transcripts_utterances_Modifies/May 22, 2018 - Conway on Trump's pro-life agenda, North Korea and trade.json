Good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" We have an amazing show for you tonight of course beginning with a double shot of Newt Gingrich. First he lays in on the latest dark revelations about the deep state as we learn every more sordid details about the Obama administration weaponized the Intel community into a political hit machine. Then Newt will discuss tonight's angle about the GOP's tremendous reversal of fortune and what the party must do to avoid losing any seats in November. Plus Kelly-Ann Conway is here on the big stories of the day including President Trump making a fantastic pro-life speech before the midterms tonight and a shifting timeline on his meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. But first, the latest details on the Russian investigation are beginning to make Watergate look like child's play. The revelations of the Obama era political targeting grow more ominous by the day. The FBI is under increasing pressure tonight to explain why it was surveilling the Trump campaign as a number of people contacted by informants continues to increase. Sam Clovis, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page were targeted, the latter responding last night on the Angle.",

Don't go away.  The GOPs reversal of fortune. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Just three months ago three reputable polls had the democrats up at 15 points in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Well not anymore. Reuters latest Generic Ballot polls should hearken Republicans. At the beginning of March Democrats enjoyed more than a 10-point advantage. Nearly 45% saying they'd vote for a Dem and only 33% said they would pull the level for Republicans. But now the GOP has taken the lead. The latest online polls shows 39% of registered voters saying they would vote Republican and just 36.7% supporting a Democrat showing a six-point shift. So why is turnaround happening? Because Republicans pretty much staying on offense and supporting, generally not undermining the President on key issues. By working to keep this economy going, dismantling the regulatory super state that hurts our innovators and entrepreneurs, by not dragging us into more serious military conflicts, by refusing to buckle on immigration, at least so far. The GOP is actually gaining momentum. According to the Cook Political Report, California's 39th and 49th districts have both shifted from lean Democratic to Toss-up. Nebraska's second district moved from Toss-up to Lean Republican. And South Carolina's fifth district moved from likely Republican to solid Republican. So as you can imagine this has thrown the Democrats into a full on frothy panic. The party of failed ideas has issued a new anti-corruption message. That's what's going to drive the midterms for them and they hope it's going to bring them success. Now it's often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so I wonder what plagiarism get's you? Democratic leaders in a new memo kind of seem to be channelling Trump. They're writing this, \"The American people are sick of getting a raw deal from Washington\". Well if this all sounds vaguely familiar, it is.",

Same party that circled the wagons around Hillary Clinton's pay to place game at the state department where Blackberry phones were smashed and hard drives were erased by Bleachbit. Oh let's not forget the party of Debbie Wasserman Schultz who while running the DNC employed an IT specialist who tried to flee to Pakistan after he wired money there, many federal prosecutors say was obtained illegally. A member of federal grand jury indicted them on four counts last summer bank fraud and conspiracy charges. And this is the party, by the way, that's going to root out corruption. The Clintons and their political spawn are so unscrupulous that supporters of Bernie Sanders filed a class action lawsuit against the DNC for rigging the primaries in Hillary's favour. Don't you get that an air of desperation has begun to settle over the Democrats? Because they thought that they were guaranteed a strike electoral gold in November. Congressman Al Greene, he's a Texas Dem, is promising that if they that they take control the house, \"There's good a likelihood there will be articles of impeachment brought against the President\". That's it? That's your plan? How's that going to grow a voter's 401ks or keep our manufacturing boom going. Impeachment is not a pro-growth platform kids. And if that doesn't get up the vote well then some miserable foot soldiers hope that attempts at comedy will.

Perhaps a dangerous one during the Obama administration. Let's turn to Newt Gingrich to react to the latest revelations about the deep state's misdeeds. Mr Speaker it is great to see you but my goodness this is wild. You have this person, a professor in England who is making these contacts various members of the Trump team throwing the whole timeline into question.

This is somebody who invites Papadopoulos overseas and gives him a grant or a stipend for a foreign conference.

We all know what it is like Sol said, this is spy or multiple spies but some other questions have not been answered here like did this professor in London also have contact with Simpson? What role did he play in that? What role did British intelligence authorities, some of who are close to this professor in London, were they alerted about this intelligence operation or alleged intelligence operation on foreign soil. The fact that the timing which has very carefully been cultivate by the Democrats, by Comey, by other former FBI people who have been sent out onto the media but actually we are talking about potentially May as Caputo has said, and even earlier. And so you can't have a cover-up without there being a crime. There's no crime to cover-up. The only thing that should be, the only revisionist history going on here is the Democrats quickly retreating ad scrambling and trying to sow-up (puscation) about their true intentions and when we talk about comparing this to Watergate. Watergate was the President being involved potentially in the cover-up of something that occurred at a very low level. This is a completely different situation, this is an administration, the Obama administration which is known for calling James Rosen a criminal and using that to spy on him.

On the other hand, you know me Laura, I've been on this show, I've defended Bob Mueller. I've defended Rod Rosenstein. I think that Bob Mueller should be allowed to take as long as he like to finish up his case. But the problem with the other side is its all, black and white for them. There can't be anything wrong with what the Obama people did and it's very clearly, anybody who knows the criminal law system, the intelligence system knows that this was highly improper. When you open up a Logan act case, Sally Yates, this is my obsession.

You've gone from Whitewater to the blue dress song now we've gone to the taxi medallion, this is where we've gotten. I think we have to wrap this up, but thank you both. In a moment on tonight's angle, I am going to spell out why the GOP has leapt ahead of the Democrats in the polls and Newt Gingrich will tell us what the GOP must do keep this momentum going and avoid the pitfalls that may be ahead. Don't go away. The GOPs reversal of fortune. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Just three months ago three reputable polls had the democrats up at 15 points in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Well not anymore. Reuters latest Generic Ballot polls should hearken Republicans. At the beginning of March Democrats enjoyed more than a 10-point advantage. Nearly 45% saying they'd vote for a Dem and only 33% said they would pull the level for Republicans. But now the GOP has taken the lead. The latest online polls shows 39% of registered voters saying they would vote Republican and just 36.7% supporting a Democrat showing a six-point shift. So why is turnaround happening? Because Republicans pretty much staying on offense and supporting, generally not undermining the President on key issues. By working to keep this economy going, dismantling the regulatory super state that hurts our innovators and entrepreneurs, by not dragging us into more serious military conflicts, by refusing to buckle on immigration, at least so far. The GOP is actually gaining momentum. According to the Cook Political Report, California's 39th and 49th districts have both shifted from lean Democratic to Toss-up. Nebraska's second district moved from Toss-up to Lean Republican. And South Carolina's fifth district moved from likely Republican to solid Republican. So as you can imagine this has thrown the Democrats into a full on frothy panic. The party of failed ideas has issued a new anti-corruption message. That's what's going to drive the midterms for them and they hope it's going to bring them success. Now it's often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so I wonder what plagiarism get's you? Democratic leaders in a new memo kind of seem to be channelling Trump. They're writing this, \"The American people are sick of getting a raw deal from Washington\". Well if this all sounds vaguely familiar, it is."

These are the people that brought you Obama's weaponised IRS to targeted conservatives years ago. Same party that circled the wagons around Hillary Clinton's pay to place game at the state department where Blackberry phones were smashed and hard drives were erased by Bleachbit. Oh let's not forget the party of Debbie Wasserman Schultz who while running the DNC employed an IT specialist who tried to flee to Pakistan after he wired money there, many federal prosecutors say was obtained illegally. A member of federal grand jury indicted them on four counts last summer bank fraud and conspiracy charges. And this is the party, by the way, that's going to root out corruption. The Clintons and their political spawn are so unscrupulous that supporters of Bernie Sanders filed a class action lawsuit against the DNC for rigging the primaries in Hillary's favour. Don't you get that an air of desperation has begun to settle over the Democrats? Because they thought that they were guaranteed a strike electoral gold in November. Congressman Al Greene, he's a Texas Dem, is promising that if they that they take control the house, \"There's good a likelihood there will be articles of impeachment brought against the President\". That's it? That's your plan? How's that going to grow a voter's 401ks or keep our manufacturing boom going. Impeachment is not a pro-growth platform kids. And if that doesn't get up the vote well then some miserable foot soldiers hope that attempts at comedy will.

I think there's no better time than maybe in the 80's during Reagan. So it's time to double down on the accomplishments. Support the President's populous pro-growth agenda. The GOP at the same time must also avoid any self- inflicted wounds before the midterms. Promoting or passing an amnesty plan or going weak on China. That could actually dishearten base. It could break faith for the blue collar workers who swept the President and the GOP into office, and it could again, if you stand with them. And that's the Angle.

Anthony List, wanted him to sign this letter to activate the grassroots. He said we need some promises, some commitments from the Republican nominee. So he looked at the letter. It talked about partial-birth abortion, making the Hyde amendment permanent, signing the pain capable unborn act into law if it reached his desk, certainly moving, as he just did tonight, the funding from clinics that provide abortions to those that provide true women's health services like mammograms and screenings and other services. So he looked at it and he said that's all fine, but where is all that stuff about Hillary Clinton? And he added stuff about Hillary Clinton. I'm going to give you a copy of the letter, and he signed it. And it went on and on about how extreme she is, that she would take the baby out of its mother's womb an hour before."

The president talks extensively about the $500 billion trade deficit we have with China. At the same time we are happy that in some of these negotiations in Beijing and here last week, Laura, at the White House, that China signals a move to buy more ag, buy more energy, for example.

Let's debate that question with Obama and Clinton campaign alum Michael Starr Hopkins and Monica Crowley of the London Center for Policy Research. Great to see both of you. Michael, let's go with you, because I find this interesting because I get it. They want to get Trump out of office. They don't like Trump. Trump is for them the devil. You just got to get rid of Trump. But remember the 1998 deal, Republicans, they went too far on impeachment and then they end up getting their clocks cleaned in the midterm there and lost ground. Where do you stand on the impeachment issue? MICHAEL STARR HOPKINS, CONTRIBUTOR, \"THE HILL\": I think Donald Trump has lost some moral authority to lead. And so I think Democrats eventually will bring article of impeachment against the president. But I think the commentator earlier was correct, Democrats only get one shot to do it. And so when Democrats bring them they have to be based on facts and a half to be able to support those. Luckily Donald Trump is the gift that keeps on giving, and whether it's Cohen or Flynn, Kushner or his comments in Charlottesville, Democrats are going to have a lot to add to these articles of impeachment."

And the blowback is fast and fierce. This is all that the Democrats have.

Are wages rising? And in all cases, it's really good. That's why Trump's numbers are going up. I think this Mueller thing, Michael, I'm honestly trying to analyze this, not as a partisan but as an analyst. I don't think it's resonating with people. I get it on the left, I get how they're all fired up about this, but just saying Kushner, Manafort, Cohen, that's like a law firm. That doesn't mean anything to end of nomadic anyone."

The Quinnipiac polls, impeachment, 71 percent favor, Democrats, no, 21 percent, don't know, don't know the zip code they live in, eight percent. They want this president impeached and I think the Republicans are going to run with that message in the midterms and say if you want this economy to keep going, you want this president to continue to advance economic interests, you've got to turn out to vote.

So the Democrats, step one is reaching for impeachment. The Democrats do not have a strong economic message. In fact I don't think they have an economic message at all. And over the last eight years of President Obama's tenure, everything that he put in to place economically and national security wise is being undercut, if not full out in reverse and removed this president. What the president is doing is putting the lie to the statist ideal that was represented by President Obama and by the Democrats, and there's no way that they can counter that because the proof is what the American people are living on the ground every single day.
