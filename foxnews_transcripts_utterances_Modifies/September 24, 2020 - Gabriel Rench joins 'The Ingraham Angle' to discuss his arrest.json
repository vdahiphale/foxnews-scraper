      "sentences": "But rather a Molotov cocktail used by these animals against the police. And we all know this, two police officers were shot in Louisville last night. The suspected shooter, Lorenzo Johnson, age 26 - there is his mug shot. Now, he was charged on multiple counts but not for attempted murder, at least not yet. Officer Robinson Desroches, an African-American, is still in the hospital tonight. He is expected to recover.   But Major Aubrey Gregory who was shot in the hip, he just walked into the department roll call Thursday morning to a round of applause. Sean and I were talking about, that's the real America and it's awesome. Now, as we get closer to the election, it is interesting, is it not, to see things moving, may be moving with the events, moving with the recognition of what's really been happening. And things usually do, right, they tighten, even when the polls don't always reflect what's happening on the ground. But on the betting market site, Predict It - check it out, President Trump is now favored to win 240 electoral votes, remember you need 270 to win. Now, you look at the RCP approval trends for President Trump since June 30th, which might give you a sense of where things are headed. Now, back on June 30th, he was upside down in his approval by 15 points. But after the summer of love, that number has been cut in half. And the new ABC News- Washington Post poll has a pro-Trump friend in Florida where he is up four points and in Arizona where he is up one point.   Now, the Fox and the Quinnipiac polls show that the Ohio race is anyone's call at this point. Trafalgar Group has Michigan, plus one for Trump, very close there. OK, let's keep this going now. So if Trump carries Florida, North Carolina and Arizona along with the other states that he is already expected to win, he'll have more than 250 electoral votes. Now at that point, the only way for Democrats to win would be to sweep Pennsylvania and the Midwest with mail-in ballots. The Democrats have gamed the South, believe me. They see this coming, which is why they are trying to delay the count in the Midwest for as long as they can. So think about this. After being the punch line for liberal elites for years and years, the Midwest finally has its moment in 2020. If you're from Wisconsin and you're an independent, but Trump's tweets bug you, OK, I get it. But focus on what matters - your family, their future, your and their safety, and prosperity. The 2019 economic numbers, we've gone through this, are irrefutable proof that Trump's policies work. Yet liberal mayors and governors have done their darndest to screw it all up.  Now, COVID of course brings out the worst in the already underperforming politicians. And the Midwest poster boy for failure is Illinois Governor J.   B. Pritzker. Of course to Joe Biden, Illinois counts as a shining example of success. The liberal billionaire Governor is a genius. And Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot, she's a courageous trailblazer. Well, that's the Democrats' ideal Midwest city. Chicago - high taxes, pro-pot, anti-gun, anti-business. Here's how Illinois Policy Institute's Adam Schuster describes that's slide. In 1980, Illinois has $4.5 billion in unfunded pension debt and a perfect credit rating. Today, Illinois has nearly $140 billion in unfunded pension debt and its credit rating is just one notch above junk status.  That debt now eats $31 of every $100 taxpayer dollars sent to the State. Now, Illinois is so anti-business that it ranks only above New York and California on Chief Executive Magazine's list of most anti-business states.  So, if Illinois was a fabulous place to live and start a business, why has its population been declining now for six years straight? And in Chicago, if Chicago is the place to be, why did the Obamas spend all their time in their other homes and rarely visit there? Now the fact is, if you live in the Midwest and if you vote for Biden, you're voting for the policies that ran Illinois into the ground. If you are from Wisconsin, from Iowa, or Michigan, why would you want to follow Illinois' lead?  Think of it this way - one party, the Republicans, have already shown that they know how to help you. Trump really is just all about returning power to people, the people - the American people, and that means respecting your freedom to live your life, raise her family, and yes, pursue your happiness. On the other hand, Chicago-style Democrats, they are not up at night worrying about any of that. After all, why would they? Their supporters think that you are a bunch of racists who are destroying the planet. So, more freedom for you means less control for them. They don't like that at all. Now, Governor Pritzker seems to relish wielding his expanded authority under COVID. His state's hospitals and ICUs are well within manageable levels, but he still won't let kids play sports.",

So forget Biden's homespun tales; his puppet masters don't like Midwest values. Consider the makeup of the Democrat Party leadership today.

The Midwesterners know that Biden will bring back outsourcing, open the borders, cater to the AOC crowd and suck up to China.  But if you vote for Trump, you're going to send a message that even the swamp cannot ignore, which is the following - In America, the people come first, and that's the angle.

But as soon as it is left-wingers in his coalition are out there harassing people at restaurants or burning things down or perhaps shooting police officers as we saw in Louisville last night, well then the movement that they are linked to, the broader ideological movement they are lined to, he refuses to condemn. It's one thing to condemn generically violence and looting. I was told by the way that when Donald Trump did that back in Charlottesville, that was not enough. He had to specifically condemn one specific ideology, which by the way he kind of - he absolutely did actually in his text.

Having said that, the facts are that people like me are reading as much as we can, we are trying to do the best we can because the truth is critical here. We are in a pandemic and it's a bit of tragedy and 200,000 people have died. On the other hand, the truth - the facts have evolved since this started. This is not March.  We know a lot about this disease; we know who to protect; we know who has high risk and we know who does not have high risk. And when you get facts that are sort of partial truths, I think it's very damaging. The American people are very afraid.

They only last for months usually and what we see here is that we make an assessment of how many people have been exposed by doing this test for antibodies. But it turns out, the literature has shown that there's a lot more than that population that is actually resistant to the infection because of either T-cell response from this infection or a T-cell immunity from a related similar virus. And this is very important because the statement that 90 percent of people are still susceptible would make me afraid if I was one of those 90 percent, but it's actually untrue. And when you look at all the data, whether it's from Sweden or Singapore or La Jolla or University of Washington, all over the country - and now we see it from Japan where most of the immunity for this virus is felt to be due to T-cell immunity and it explains a lot, it explains a lot about perhaps why children have very, very low risk from this.

Ages 20-49, 99.98 percent. 50-69, it's 99.5 percent. Even if you're over 70 or older, the survival rate is 94.6 percent. This is not to say, it's still not a horrible tragedy; it is. How many people died; it is a horrible tragedy. But, those statistics, do they not indicate, Dr. Atlas, that schools should be opened, sports should be played, and we've got to get back to normal life here? People just don't even know these stats.",

Amy Coney Barrett's friends and family speaking for the first time to our own Raymond Arroyo about the woman and the mother they know, and they respond to the anti-Catholic, anti-Christian smears being circulated by the media. Also, Dr. Scott Atlas on why the schools should open and how he schooled the White House press corps on COVID. I know you didn't see that. And a man arrested on camera for singing church songs outside without a mask. OK, both are here tonight. But first, the Midwest big choice, that's the focus of tonight's angle. These scenes playing out over the last 24 hours, Sean and I were just talking about it, across our country show us once again just how much is at stake on November 3rd. So we saw that diners at St. Pete, Florida in a restaurant there, outside, they were treated this way by BLM thugs who don't believe you have a right to be happy, ever."

      "utterance": "But rather a Molotov cocktail used by these animals against the police. And we all know this, two police officers were shot in Louisville last night. The suspected shooter, Lorenzo Johnson, age 26 - there is his mug shot. Now, he was charged on multiple counts but not for attempted murder, at least not yet. Officer Robinson Desroches, an African-American, is still in the hospital tonight. He is expected to recover. But Major Aubrey Gregory who was shot in the hip, he just walked into the department roll call Thursday morning to a round of applause. Sean and I were talking about, that's the real America and it's awesome. Now, as we get closer to the election, it is interesting, is it not, to see things moving, may be moving with the events, moving with the recognition of what's really been happening. And things usually do, right, they tighten, even when the polls don't always reflect what's happening on the ground. But on the betting market site, Predict It - check it out, President Trump is now favored to win 240 electoral votes, remember you need 270 to win. Now, you look at the RCP approval trends for President Trump since June 30th, which might give you a sense of where things are headed. Now, back on June 30th, he was upside down in his approval by 15 points. But after the summer of love, that number has been cut in half. And the new ABC News- Washington Post poll has a pro-Trump friend in Florida where he is up four points and in Arizona where he is up one point. Now, the Fox and the Quinnipiac polls show that the Ohio race is anyone's call at this point. Trafalgar Group has Michigan, plus one for Trump, very close there. OK, let's keep this going now. So if Trump carries Florida, North Carolina and Arizona along with the other states that he is already expected to win, he'll have more than 250 electoral votes. Now at that point, the only way for Democrats to win would be to sweep Pennsylvania and the Midwest with mail-in ballots. The Democrats have gamed the South, believe me. They see this coming, which is why they are trying to delay the count in the Midwest for as long as they can. So think about this. After being the punch line for liberal elites for years and years, the Midwest finally has its moment in 2020. If you're from Wisconsin and you're an independent, but Trump's tweets bug you, OK, I get it. But focus on what matters - your family, their future, your and their safety, and prosperity. The 2019 economic numbers, we've gone through this, are irrefutable proof that Trump's policies work. Yet liberal mayors and governors have done their darndest to screw it all up. Now, COVID of course brings out the worst in the already underperforming politicians. And the Midwest poster boy for failure is Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker. Of course to Joe Biden, Illinois counts as a shining example of success. The liberal billionaire Governor is a genius. And Chicago's Mayor Lori Lightfoot, she's a courageous trailblazer. Well, that's the Democrats' ideal Midwest city. Chicago - high taxes, pro-pot, anti-gun, anti-business. Here's how Illinois Policy Institute's Adam Schuster describes that's slide. In 1980, Illinois has $4.5 billion in unfunded pension debt and a perfect credit rating. Today, Illinois has nearly $140 billion in unfunded pension debt and its credit rating is just one notch above junk status. That debt now eats $31 of every $100 taxpayer dollars sent to the State. Now, Illinois is so anti-business that it ranks only above New York and California on Chief Executive Magazine's list of most anti-business states. So, if Illinois was a fabulous place to live and start a business, why has its population been declining now for six years straight? And in Chicago, if Chicago is the place to be, why did the Obamas spend all their time in their other homes and rarely visit there? Now the fact is, if you live in the Midwest and if you vote for Biden, you're voting for the policies that ran Illinois into the ground. If you are from Wisconsin, from Iowa, or Michigan, why would you want to follow Illinois' lead? Think of it this way - one party, the Republicans, have already shown that they know how to help you. Trump really is just all about returning power to people, the people - the American people, and that means respecting your freedom to live your life, raise her family, and yes, pursue your happiness. On the other hand, Chicago-style Democrats, they are not up at night worrying about any of that. After all, why would they? Their supporters think that you are a bunch of racists who are destroying the planet. So, more freedom for you means less control for them. They don't like that at all. Now, Governor Pritzker seems to relish wielding his expanded authority under COVID. His state's hospitals and ICUs are well within manageable levels, but he still won't let kids play sports."

That's 200 more murders than during the same reporting period last year. Overwhelmingly, the killings take place in Chicago and most victims are black.

So forget Biden's homespun tales; his puppet masters don't like Midwest values. Consider the makeup of the Democrat Party leadership today. You have Biden, Harris from California, Schumer from New York, Pelosi from California, and AOC from New York. Is there any Midwesterners in there? Neither do (ph) I. The Midwesterners know that Biden will bring back outsourcing, open the borders, cater to the AOC crowd and suck up to China.

He did it a little bit when he was running against Bernie Sanders. He was just the default, not Bernie Sanders. But now, he won't condemn Antifa by name; he will not condemn Black Lives Matter by name; and now he won't even answer some questions about whether he wishes to end the filibuster ad states to the senate willy-nilly of a sheer majority, or pack the Supreme Court of the United states, which means he is tacitly promising transformational change.

Joe Biden proclaims that he is going to be some sort of gradual push into change, but people who are behind him are not looking for anything gradual. They see him as an obstacle to change or at the best, may be some of facade that they can push aside when the time is right.

But as soon as it is left-wingers in his coalition are out there harassing people at restaurants or burning things down or perhaps shooting police officers as we saw in Louisville last night, well then the movement that they are linked to, the broader ideological movement they are lined to, he refuses to condemn. It's one thing to condemn generically violence and looting. I was told by the way that when Donald Trump did that back in Charlottesville, that was not enough. He had to specifically condemn one specific ideology, which by the way he kind of - he absolutely did actually in his text. Now, you have Joe Biden generically condemning violence and the media have declared it - well, I mean, I guess we're done here, there's nothing more to see."

Honestly I just want to say, I emphasize with the American People who have been told conflicting information from a variety of sources, some of whom should know all the facts, but not everybody knows the data. Not everyone is hands-on with reading the data and the Media has done a poor job of explaining - allowing the data to be brought forward. Having said that, the facts are that people like me are reading as much as we can, we are trying to do the best we can because the truth is critical here. We are in a pandemic and it's a bit of tragedy and 200,000 people have died. On the other hand, the truth - the facts have evolved since this started. This is not March. We know a lot about this disease; we know who to protect; we know who has high risk and we know who does not have high risk. And when you get facts that are sort of partial truths, I think it's very damaging. The American people are very afraid. No one wants to be afraid and the way to calm fear is to actually know the data and explain it very clearly and logically."

Could you explain that very quickly for us, so people will understand that? We don't currently test for T-cell immunity, but a lot of my medicine cabinet thinks we should be, because that would allay a lot of fears."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ATLAS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean there's basically two broad categories of immunity, one has to do with B cells and that antibodies, and the other is T cells and that is actually immunity that lasts longer. It turns out that antibody tests are done and we see how many people have antibodies, but antibodies are transient. They only last for months usually and what we see here is that we make an assessment of how many people have been exposed by doing this test for antibodies. But it turns out, the literature has shown that there's a lot more than that population that is actually resistant to the infection because of either T-cell response from this infection or a T-cell immunity from a related similar virus. And this is very important because the statement that 90 percent of people are still susceptible would make me afraid if I was one of those 90 percent, but it's actually untrue. And when you look at all the data, whether it's from Sweden or Singapore or La Jolla or University of Washington, all over the country - and now we see it from Japan where most of the immunity for this virus is felt to be due to T-cell immunity and it explains a lot, it explains a lot about perhaps why children have very, very low risk from this. It explains perhaps why people in Asia didn't have as much of a problem because they had prior coronavirus exposure."

Here are the survival rates for different age groups, the best estimates at present, these are Government numbers. From ages 0-19, the survival rate if you get the infection is 99.997 percent. Ages 20-49, 99.98 percent. 50-69, it's 99.5 percent. Even if you're over 70 or older, the survival rate is 94.6 percent. This is not to say, it's still not a horrible tragedy; it is. How many people died; it is a horrible tragedy.

It's low risk for young adults like college students, extremely low risk. And this data is known, it's proven all over the world and I really help Americans take the time to listen to some of these epidemiologists from Stanford, Harvard, Oxford, you know, Cambridge. These are some of the best epidemiologists in the world. The data is out there and we don't all have to be paralyzed with fear.

After it got extended to January 1st. We all went out there. I had no clue. I did not think I was going to be arrested. I did not think I was going to be cited. And so we are singing the songs. We just started singing the songs, and they come up to me and my mom first. And then the guy standing next to me was my friend, and I put my arm around him and said this is my friend, and that's why they proceeded to arrest me. But here's the deal, the mayor on September 5th, was at a religious ceremony officiating it with no mask on, not social distancing. The mayor on September 2nd was at a public gathering -- excuse me, a little private party, about 50, 60 people there, with no mask on and not social distancing. When I was getting released from the jail, when the deputies were releasing them from the jail, I looked across the office on the other side, and our deputies were in the office not --"

And so now when we test that tyranny, when we come up and test that tyranny, it pushes them to actually bring force to the issue, and that's why they arrested me. The cops did not want to arrest me. They did not want to arrest me. The officer didn't want to arrest me. The deputies at the county jail did not want to arrest me, and yet this is what tyranny forces the issue."

That's what we're being told in my county, the emperor has no clothes on. And I have to say the emperor has clothes on.

But I think now - - although she is still a good leader, I think now, I would say today, that her role is unity and love, because she just makes such an effort, despite her busy schedule, despite everything that she has to juggle, her love for people is remarkable. Amy, I feel like has an incredible wisdom. She and Jesse actually together have an incredible wisdom and patience. Amy was always very quick to admit a mistake, to come back, apologize, and want to try to fix it."

But what I can say from my experience, though I'm not actively member right now, some of my fondest memories are of the friendships that I had growing up, for the activities that we did. We did have prayer time together, and that has been an inspiration, honestly, to me as an adult. And I still maintain friendships with those very friends who I grew up with in the People of Praise. So I think really what people need to know is this isn't a crazy group. My experience with it has been that these are people who deeply care about one another and about other people."

It's just weeks until Election Day, and this all has my next guest asking, is Joe OK? Joining me now is David Marcus, correspondent for \"The Federalist.\" David, wonderful to see you tonight. The most shocking part of Biden's disappearing act is the lack of curiosity from the press corps, and even a defense from the media, saying he's just doing debate prep. DAVID MARCUS, \"THE FEDERALIST\" NEW YORK CORRESPONDENT: No, this has become bizarre. It's like Joe Biden is Sandy Koufax and every other day is Yom Kippur. That's just, it's not going to work. A big reason why we have presidential campaigns, especially with older candidates, is to make sure that these people are fit for what is a growing and rigorous job. The only thing Joe Biden looks fit for right now is the early bird special at Luby's. I think he might need a teleprompter to order because he'd get unusually difficult questions, like would you like a salad with that? So I don't know how anybody can be confident right now that this man is capable of being president of the United States. I certainly am not."

The fact that they won't do that and put this story to bed, and instead they seem to be putting him to bed at 9:00 in the morning, it's going to raise questions for voters.
