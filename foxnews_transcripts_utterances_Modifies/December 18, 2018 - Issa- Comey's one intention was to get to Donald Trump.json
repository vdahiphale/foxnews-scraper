Flynn was discouraged from having a lawyer and not formally warned that false statements could be prosecuted. A critical moment came when Flynn told the court that he knew when the FBI asked him about the Russian ambassador in a December 2016 conversations about sanctions that his lies would be criminal and punishable. The judges chastised him for actions in the West Wing, including lies to the Trump transition team.  Quote: I can't hide my disgust, my disdain for your criminal offense, Judge Emmet Sullivan said. Not only did you lie to the FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration. Judge Sullivan, who said he also had concerns about the FBI handling of the Flynn interview, questioned the basis of the case, asking the special counsel lawyer whether the Flynn phone call with the Russian ambassador was criminal. After a long pause, the government lawyer said it might be a violation of the Logan Act. The judge noting unauthorized contact between U.S. officials and foreign governments is rarely prosecuted.  President Trump tweeted \"good luck\" to Flynn before the sentencing and after his aides slammed Flynn's treatment by the FBI.",

This judge took an incredible left turn, right turn, and U-turn talking about treason, he talked about whether Flynn possibly was involved as a foreign agent when he worked in the White House, none of which was before him.

Flynn decided to cooperate all the way, the government moved for no incarceration, that was his position, too, and then they throw this curveball at the end which was appropriate. But as a curveball on the government misconduct if you want to withdraw the plea, not if you want to continue to be a cooperator. Judge Sullivan was left with no place to go in a sense. As you say, he correctly -- he offered Flynn the opportunity. Flynn had to withdraw it before the sentencing. I thought Flynn should have withdrawn his plea a long time ago.

When the judge seems inclined to agree that this was an interrogation, not custodial that requires Miranda, but once they suggested, don't bring a lawyer to me, that's the nuance that kicks in Miranda, but now, does it tell you that Flynn is still fearful of Mueller and that his son possibly is the reason?",

That is a crime.  Judge, with regards to what happened today, it's very, very clear. I was on the transition team with General Flynn, I worked in the White House with General Flynn.

Flynn was discouraged from having a lawyer and not formally warned that false statements could be prosecuted. A critical moment came when Flynn told the court that he knew when the FBI asked him about the Russian ambassador in a December 2016 conversations about sanctions that his lies would be criminal and punishable. The judges chastised him for actions in the West Wing, including lies to the Trump transition team."

Not only did you lie to the FBI, you lied to senior officials in the incoming administration. Judge Sullivan, who said he also had concerns about the FBI handling of the Flynn interview, questioned the basis of the case, asking the special counsel lawyer whether the Flynn phone call with the Russian ambassador was criminal. After a long pause, the government lawyer said it might be a violation of the Logan Act. The judge noting unauthorized contact between U.S. officials and foreign governments is rarely prosecuted. President Trump tweeted \"good luck\" to Flynn before the sentencing and after his aides slammed Flynn's treatment by the FBI."

And joining us now with analysis of today's big breaking news, the author of \"The Russia Hoax,\" Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, and criminal defense attorney David Schoen. You know, when a judge is scheduled to sentence a defendant in any criminal case, normally, what happens is the judge sentences on that particular crime for which the defendant is convicted and appearing before him. This judge took an incredible left turn, right turn, and U-turn talking about treason, he talked about whether Flynn possibly was involved as a foreign agent when he worked in the White House, none of which was before him. Where is this judge coming from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, he all but begged Flynn to withdraw his plea. And when Flynn refused to do so, there was this Jekyll Hyde to transformation of Judge Emmet Sullivan and he began to lash out at Flynn with these unfounded accusations and honestly, you know this -- it's outrageous for a federal judge to make an accusation of treason against someone when treason has absolutely no application. In the end, the judge withdrew it and apologized."
    },

      "utterance": "Right, right, this is unheard of."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "And he was not only wrong about the law, but he was fundamentally wrong about some of the key facts of the case and prosecutors actually had to correct him, that Flynn wasn't a Turkish agent when he was at the White House. And the judge seemed confused, or he actually hadn't read the file yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "By David Schoen, we know that he read the file. This is the judge, he wanted to know where that 302 of Michael Flynn was, when he didn't get it in 48 hours, he said, I want it on Monday. He gets a 302. And to me, that is his reasoning for saying, he's constantly acting, asking as Gregg just said, do you want to withdraw your plea? Then he goes after the guy. What's your interpretation today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVID SCHOEN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Listen, Emmet Sullivan is one of the most respected judges around. After the Ted Stevens case, he said I do want with this kind of government misconduct. But Flynn's lawyers played it cute in a sense. What's their theory of the case? You always have to have a consistent theory. Flynn decided to cooperate all the way, the government moved for no incarceration, that was his position, too, and then they throw this curveball at the end which was appropriate. But as a curveball on the government misconduct if you want to withdraw the plea, not if you want to continue to be a cooperator. Judge Sullivan was left with no place to go in a sense. As you say, he correctly -- he offered Flynn the opportunity. Flynn had to withdraw it before the sentencing. I thought Flynn should have withdrawn his plea a long time ago. I don't believe he committed a crime and if he did, it was a manufactured crime, and as Jim Comey said, Comey got away with what he pulled on Flynn."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, we still don't know -- hope springs eternal, Sara Carter. And given what we know about Jim Comey lying again, cardinal Comey, which is absolutely not stunning at all, but he talks about the fact that it was McCabe who suggested that Flynn get a lawyer and then the 302 of McCabe makes it clear that McCabe is the one who said, you don't need a lawyer, it will only take more time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, absolutely, Judge. I was there at the courthouse today and I want to talk about a few things that relate to Comey as well. You know, when they talked to the prosecutor, one of the things that they said was, you know, about the Logan Act and the prosecutors brought that up. Well, could this have been a crime? Well, maybe the Logan Act, and the judge laughed after that. But then you look at Comey's testimony and he says, the reason we want to question Flynn was because of Vice President Mike Pence, because Vice President Pence made a statement that we knew not to be true. But they never go to Vice President Pence and say, these aren't true. Instead, they send two agents. There is no attorney for Flynn, and he's out there talking to them at the request of McCabe, and Comey keeps getting caught in lie after lie, or he keeps changing his testimony."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, the amazing part, Gregg, is when the judge seems to be pushing Flynn, do you want to withdraw your plea, everything we had seen up to this point, he was game for that."

      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "He was."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "He was game. But now, here is my concern. If he has already cooperated to the point where the government says we want no incarceration, why do we need him to work for the next 90 days on the case of his partners, who were charged for Foreign Agents Registration Act?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "It has absolute nothing to do with Trump-Russia collusion. Nothing. And, you know, this is the judge who said he was deeply concerned about the FBI's interview with Michael Flynn and the impropriety of it all. They lied to him, that was the basis for it. And then they encouraged him not to get a lawyer. The judge said he was also puzzled by the papers in front of him presented by Robert Mueller's team. As if to say, why are you prosecuting a guy when these papers here tell me that he told the truth, according to the agents who interviewed him? It was all going rather splendidly for Michael Flynn until, as David appropriately points out, he refused to withdraw his plea. I agree with David. He should have withdrawn his plea. It's very hard for a judge to vacate it if the defendant insists on pleading."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Although the judge can, and I might have done it. But, David, I mean, that brings us precisely to the point. Why would a man, where the government is saying, I'm not going to ask for incarceration, all right? They were already on the record for that. When the judge seems inclined to agree that this was an interrogation, not custodial that requires Miranda, but once they suggested, don't bring a lawyer to me, that's the nuance that kicks in Miranda, but now, does it tell you that Flynn is still fearful of Mueller and that his son possibly is the reason?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "That's exactly what it tells me. And again, I think his lawyers made a mistake here. But you can't be half in and half out. Flynn is going to have to continue to cooperate with these folks because that's what his agreement provides. But, yes, I think they turn the screws to Flynn from the start. His family was at risk. He lost everything financially. This is a man who served his country with great distinction and great honor. And this is what he's been brought to, not because he committed a crime, but because they put him in a room, did not believe his answers, and created a crime. Can you imagine if they held Mr. Comey to the same standard? How many crimes he would be prosecuted for the lies?"

That really is a federal crime and they've never pursued this, they've never went after this. And as far as I know, there is no open case to go after them. So, I think we need to question that first and foremost and hopefully something will come up in the future."

One of the things that seems to continuously come back at us is, James Comey lying or being inconsistent in terms of his own answers regarding the same thing. So, for example, we've got James Comey saying, it has to be a coincidence that after the tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch, there just happened to be a meeting between the justice on the FBI, but there was never anything mentioned about this."

That is a crime. Judge, with regards to what happened today, it's very, very clear. I was on the transition team with General Flynn, I worked in the White House with General Flynn. The call to the Russian ambassador was utterly legal. That was Mike Flynn's job. The contents of the conversation were likewise utterly legal, requesting potentially the Russian ambassador's support in a vote at the U.N. to prevent Israel from being boycotted. How is that illegal? But the FBI had the full transcript of the discussion, so why did Jim Comey send those agents to the White House in flagrant denial of the White House counsel procedure? It was a classic entrapment ploy."

Flynn is President Trump's puppet. I mean, sometimes I wonder if we are watching the same news. In fact, the prosecutor is even said that that's not appropriate treason in this situation. And yet, the overreach is nonstop!"
    },

Nothing was done there. Yes, he failed to register as a foreign agent. Yes, he lied to the FBI, and whether it is entrapment or not, remember that James Comey had one intention clearly before Donald Trump was president, and afterwards, which was to get to Donald Trump. You could see it in everything he did. He didn't keep Flynn from becoming a national security advisor, which he potentially could have done with the transcript if it was so volatile. He certainly could have told the president that Flynn was misleading or lying to people, which could have affected his being fired sooner and certainly in the name of national security would have been the right thing to do. James Comey, from day one, has been a corrupt cop trying to get to the president and it shows in everything he has done, including what he failed to do, which was to be honest to both Barack Obama and to President Trump when he was talking about what he knew, when he knew it, and what should be done in the name of national security."

He wrote an op-ed piece supporting the Turkish government. We are not at war with Turkey no matter how much we dislike Erdogan. Secondly, this totally spurious Logan Act charge against the national security advisor. If the Logan Act were about a serious crime, John Kerry should be doing 20 to life right now for his secret negotiations with Iran after he left office and when the Trump administration came into power.

Let's face it. Two years ago, James Comey did not tell the president things he should have told him because he was trying to indict the president.

Rod Rosenstein, we have to recall this -- Rod Rosenstein made him special counsel to investigate the president the day after Rod Rosenstein escorted him to the White House to interview for the job of FBI director again. Robert Mueller crashed and burned in that interview. The president said, no, I need new blood, you're not going to be the new director. Less than 24 hours later, Rod Rosenstein makes him the special counsel to investigate the manner in front of him he failed to get his own job back? How could he be an impartial investigator?

Over the last two years, we had ten Senate Democrats in state that President Trump won. It was in their interest to find common ground with the president. Going into the 2020 elections, there are two. Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan. There are less Democrats now willing to work with the president on border security, on health care, on the economy. Why?

Lawmakers in Washington refused to fix the problem, that they promised to fix back then. But funding the wall has never been a real big problem here. And the real problem is, the will to actually do the hard work of putting up the wall and taking those votes. The only thing we have found out in the last two weeks is Democrats that are coming into control the House and Senate in Congress have vowed to shut the government down instead of doing something about fixing the border. And whether you call it a wall or a fence, or what President Trump described it as through these tweets that you just read, whatever you call it, it's a barrier that prevents people from illegally crossing into the United States. And Democrats have made it very clear that they are on the side of opposing that and President Trump and Republicans have made it clear that they are on the side of supporting that. And even Democrats who supported, say, the 2006 Fence Act which did basically the same thing, which is to build a barrier which will keep you from sneaking into the country illegally, even a lot of those Democrats have now been pulled by the left-wing of their party over into this no borders, anti-ICE sanctuary city crowd that opposes doing anything about the border."

Golsteyn admitted during a job interview with the CIA that in 2010 he killed a suspected Afghan bomb-maker. The Army launched an investigation, stripped Golsteyn of his Special Forces patch and Silver Star but did not charge him.

There was a - two marines killed by a Taliban bomb-maker that the CIA identified. Captain Golsteyn's Special Forces team found this guy, captured him, and because there was not a detention center on an intel center nearby, turned him over to the Afghans. The Afghanis surprised, released his terrorist. Captain Golsteyn's team found him again and killed him. They killed him in combat in a massive war that did the exact right thing. The problem is that the - some in the army think, no, he should have been turned back again. Here's the problem.

And clearly this individual had both. Golsteyn should have never seen this guy again. He should've been taken off the battlefield and processed up through.

They have to stop that before 2020. And that's what these people will do. These are not your JFK democrats. These are radicals. They have gavels in their hands now, very powerful committees.
