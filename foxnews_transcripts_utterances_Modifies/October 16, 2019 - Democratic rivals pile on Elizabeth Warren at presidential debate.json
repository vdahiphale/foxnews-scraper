Donald Trump was falsely accused of being a Russian colluder without any evidence. CNN never has actually said that Donald Trump was falsely accused without any evidence after two and a half years. So, that is funny and that's a perfect example of media bias. Also interesting, let's just switch the names because I'm going to start doing this just for fun. Imagine the minute Trump selected, Don Jr. gets a sweetheart deal on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, and then the president demands the guy investigating the corrupt Ukrainian gas company is fired and withhold aids, and then the guy gets fired. And then when they ask about him about it, you guys talked about it, they say no. We never brought it up. And by the way, I was just doing my job. Look elsewhere.  Do you think the media would accept Donald Trump's and Don Jr. explanation for that? Absolutely not, and that's why it's so crooked. And the fact that Biden comes out and tells CNN that his job in Ukraine was to root out corruption, OK? Well, then your son goes and joins the board of the most corrupt gas company in Ukraine?

I also think, though, that it showed in those that pivoted to actionable, achievable policy. That's why they stood out. So that would be Klobuchar with opioids. Mayor Pete with Medicare for All. Who is going to pay for it? Biden to an extent. When he brought up Obamacare. That's what made them stand out and that they use those moments to say, OK, but enough of that for a second.

The question is whether or not people like Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg were able to gain sufficiently that if Biden were to collapse or go away for some reason, they would then occupy this middle lane, which is the moderate lane. But, again, I don't agree that they did anything at the moment to either regain some of the loss -- support to that we've seen Elizabeth Warren gain in terms of her rise, or to knock out Joe Biden.

I think that when she was attacked by the majority of the other candidates on stage, it really illustrated more in those moments about them than her, with the exception of her failure to account for who is paying for Medicare, or who would pay for Medicare for all. And also, her foreign policy incompetence, which he talked about pulling all of the troops away from the Middle East, she ignored the eight bases we have there. And I think the situation right now in Syria is really illustrating to voters that we need a commander-in-chief that has that type of foreign policy competence. And that's why, in my opinion, Biden and Mayor Pete shown in that specific regard which brings me to who I think the winner was last night, which was totally Mayor Pete by a landslide. I think he came out swinging, but it didn't seem inauthentic. It was the same amazing orator, but more in sync. And he pivoted a lot of the topics to I think a better perspective for the force, for the trees, 538 has him the highest increase now of Democratic voters that are switching over. And he shot past Kamala. And I also think that he's attracting the never- Trumpers. My loser, Tulsi, a hundred percent."

I don't think there's any question about that. It's just that she won't admit that it may mean that you also increase some taxes on the middle class.

It was a false accusation that was made against Biden, and now you have a situation where people are saying, oh, Joe Biden respond to this, respond to this.

Donald Trump was falsely accused of being a Russian colluder without any evidence. CNN never has actually said that Donald Trump was falsely accused without any evidence after two and a half years. So, that is funny and that's a perfect example of media bias. Also interesting, let's just switch the names because I'm going to start doing this just for fun. Imagine the minute Trump selected, Don Jr. gets a sweetheart deal on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, and then the president demands the guy investigating the corrupt Ukrainian gas company is fired and withhold aids, and then the guy gets fired. And then when they ask about him about it, you guys talked about it, they say no. We never brought it up. And by the way, I was just doing my job. Look elsewhere. Do you think the media would accept Donald Trump's and Don Jr. explanation for that? Absolutely not, and that's why it's so crooked. And the fact that Biden comes out and tells CNN that his job in Ukraine was to root out corruption, OK? Well, then your son goes and joins the board of the most corrupt gas company in Ukraine? They fire the prosecutor looking into the corrupt gas company. And, as a matter of fact, corruption in Ukraine increased under Joe Biden's watch. That's why Zelensky was elected. He ran on an anti-corruption platform."

I do think that last night in the debate that one of the things that Democrats have learned is that attacking each other on stage doesn't work, or at least it doesn't work for long. Kamala Harris went after Joe Biden in that first debate, and she was popular for about 26 hours. Julian Castro went after Biden, and that last for 26 hours. So they're very happy to allow Donald Trump to be the one that beats up on Joe Biden, because then they don't have to. I do think for Biden, he could pull a Newt Gingrich and just go after the moderators, Juan. I think you'll remember that. And then that becomes the story, like, I've had it with you. I can't take it anymore. The other thing is Biden doesn't do any one-on-one interviews, so there's not a lot of ways to be able to dig in a little bit deeper.

To me, this grumpy smile that he has, and that orchestrated attempt at arousing climax at the end, you could see it coming and you felt that the sympathy clap was like a nurse -- you know, clapping for gramps because he finished the peas.

But if you took Trump's personality out of the mix, they'd have absolutely nothing to say, nothing about his achievements on jobs, economy, peace, because those are pretty good, which is why they had to stick to a game of who hates Trump more."

I also think, though, that it showed in those that pivoted to actionable, achievable policy. That's why they stood out. So that would be Klobuchar with opioids. Mayor Pete with Medicare for All. Who is going to pay for it? Biden to an extent. When he brought up Obamacare. That's what made them stand out and that they use those moments to say, OK, but enough of that for a second.

So that's a pretty steep thing for any politician to ignore, especially if you're in a Democratic Party debate. The other big news has been that Pelosi says, she is not going to have a vote on whether or not to begin impeachment proceedings. And you have to stop and say, well, why would that be? Because the President and the Republicans are saying this is a process thing. It's not fair to the poor President. And clearly, Nancy Pelosi saying, she's an equal branch of government.

And they whine because Trump is mean on Twitter. I mean, it's just so pathetic. And her attack was so meek, and Warren handled it perfectly.
