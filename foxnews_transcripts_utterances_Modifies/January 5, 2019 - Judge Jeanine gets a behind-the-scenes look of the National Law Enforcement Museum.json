Promising his impeachment with absolutely no facts to support the charge, violating the very Constitution you just swore to uphold. And by the way, show me where in the Constitution, Rashida, it says you can impeach a President because you hate him? The greatest nation on earth, through its largesse opens its doors and lays out the welcome mat for your mother and father who I'm sure thank God when they got here and you get to the national stage and call the Commander-in-Chief a \"mother effer\" in a public forum? Demanding impeachment? Who are you?  Well for one, we know you're a Democrat and a socialist and as Winston Churchill said, \"Socialism is a philosophy of failure. The creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy,\" and although Palestinians from your homeland may be waving flags for you, you're an American in the U.S. Congress representing Americans, madam, not Palestinians.   Your dance should be one with and under the American flag and you have promised to vote against all U.S. military aid to America's sole partner in the Middle East, Israel because they discriminate against Palestinians. Discriminate? You don't like Israel. Okay, I have an idea. When the Palestinians and the PLO support the United States like Israel does, then we won't need to send them money and in case you didn't know, Hamas is a designated terrorist organization that was birthed in Palestine. Are you really against racism? Or just Israel? Like your friend Linda Sarsour, do you just want Israel eliminated from the river to the sea? A primer -- do what you were elected to do, stand up for your country and your constituents - Americans - I repeat, Americans want a strong economy so they can get a job, put food on the table, pay their rent or mortgage. They want safety and security for their families. They want the law to be applied equally, applied the same with no one above it and no one below it. Your constituents want legislators who will work and not waste time or taxpayer dollars and instead, work toward those goals instead of engaging in personal vendettas against the President.   But the hypocrisy is not just yours, it's your party's new MO. They talked a good game -- civility, working together, working for the American people, not focusing on hate -- and no surprise, their first order of business on their inaugural day as the majority party in the House was about hating President Trump. Democrat Congressman Brad Sherman of California wasted no time introducing Articles of Impeachment against President Trump. Right when we've got the best jobs report this country has seen in nearly a decade. Does that make sense to you Rashida? And your fellow Democrats Steve Cohen of Tennessee has already introduced a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Electoral College; yet another blatant attempt to violate and upend the Constitution. The Democrats' hatred of the President is astonishing. Their hypocrisy is astonishing. You Democrats just hate the President. Congressman Hank Johnson compared Trump to Hitler this week. You call him an \"mf'er\" because you don't like the way he talks, but you don't have the guts to follow through with your claim. When you're confronted by the press, you whimper away and run from the American media.  Did Nancy rein you in, Rashida? The President is improving the economy, making us safer and yes, building a wall and you want to impeach him? Is this what we can look forward to for the next two years? The old impeach 45? You want Donald Trump out of office? Be careful what you wish for. He's not the only one who could be voted out in 2020.   And that's my open. If you like my \"Opening Statements,\" you'll love my new book, \"New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And joining me now by phone with reaction to my opening statement and all the developing news this week, counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway.

The President has made very clear on Twitter and in his public statements and in the Rose Garden yesterday, in the Cabinet meeting for 95 minutes, on live TV two days earlier. He's made clear, border security as a mechanism may mean many different things including a wall. But let's get it done. So many Presidents have talked about securing the border. Chuck Schumer himself is on tape saying illegal immigration is bad. We have to get border security, but they voted for the Secure Fence Act in 2006, Jeanine, you know what?

She and Secretary of Pompeo negotiated this terrific deal with Mexico so that those who are coming up here can get asylum in Mexico and just wait there while their claims of fear are being processed by the United States. Mexico has offered work visas. They offer them safety. They've offered them obviously food and safe passage and yet, they're saying \"No, no, no.

I can't drive through that or crawl over it or under it or around it.\" That's a serious thing.  And so you need a physical barrier; in some places it may be a wall and maybe the steel slats and maybe electronics. We're going by what the brave men and women who are exhausted and overtaxed and overworked right now. I'm trying to absorb this new influx of family units and unaccompanied minors, who by the way aren't running away from Customs and Border Patrol, they are running towards them. CBP tells me. They are running toward them, saying, \"Help me. Where do I go? What do I do?\" And so those steel slats that you saw, it feels more expensive than concrete, let's face it, but let's get that $5.6 billion package. It's a modest investment of our border security at the House, pass it - Chuck Schumer has to find the ten votes. He has to find the ten votes to get this done and put it on the President's desk.

Promising his impeachment with absolutely no facts to support the charge, violating the very Constitution you just swore to uphold. And by the way, show me where in the Constitution, Rashida, it says you can impeach a President because you hate him? The greatest nation on earth, through its largesse opens its doors and lays out the welcome mat for your mother and father who I'm sure thank God when they got here and you get to the national stage and call the Commander-in-Chief a \"mother effer\" in a public forum? Demanding impeachment? Who are you? Well for one, we know you're a Democrat and a socialist and as Winston Churchill said, \"Socialism is a philosophy of failure. The creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy,\" and although Palestinians from your homeland may be waving flags for you, you're an American in the U.S. Congress representing Americans, madam, not Palestinians. Your dance should be one with and under the American flag and you have promised to vote against all U.S. military aid to America's sole partner in the Middle East, Israel because they discriminate against Palestinians. Discriminate? You don't like Israel. Okay, I have an idea. When the Palestinians and the PLO support the United States like Israel does, then we won't need to send them money and in case you didn't know, Hamas is a designated terrorist organization that was birthed in Palestine. Are you really against racism? Or just Israel? Like your friend Linda Sarsour, do you just want Israel eliminated from the river to the sea? A primer -- do what you were elected to do, stand up for your country and your constituents - Americans - I repeat, Americans want a strong economy so they can get a job, put food on the table, pay their rent or mortgage. They want safety and security for their families. They want the law to be applied equally, applied the same with no one above it and no one below it. Your constituents want legislators who will work and not waste time or taxpayer dollars and instead, work toward those goals instead of engaging in personal vendettas against the President. But the hypocrisy is not just yours, it's your party's new MO. They talked a good game -- civility, working together, working for the American people, not focusing on hate -- and no surprise, their first order of business on their inaugural day as the majority party in the House was about hating President Trump. Democrat Congressman Brad Sherman of California wasted no time introducing Articles of Impeachment against President Trump. Right when we've got the best jobs report this country has seen in nearly a decade. Does that make sense to you Rashida? And your fellow Democrats Steve Cohen of Tennessee has already introduced a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Electoral College; yet another blatant attempt to violate and upend the Constitution. The Democrats' hatred of the President is astonishing. Their hypocrisy is astonishing. You Democrats just hate the President. Congressman Hank Johnson compared Trump to Hitler this week. You call him an \"mf'er\" because you don't like the way he talks, but you don't have the guts to follow through with your claim. When you're confronted by the press, you whimper away and run from the American media. Did Nancy rein you in, Rashida? The President is improving the economy, making us safer and yes, building a wall and you want to impeach him? Is this what we can look forward to for the next two years? The old impeach 45? You want Donald Trump out of office? Be careful what you wish for. He's not the only one who could be voted out in 2020. And that's my open. If you like my \"Opening Statements,\" you'll love my new book, \"New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And joining me now by phone with reaction to my opening statement and all the developing news this week, counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway.

We've had this increase from single males coming from Mexico, which was the vast, vast majority of illegal aliens trying to come to the country.

If we're talking about whether to call it a wall or something else, call it something else, but secure the border. In some places, it'll be a wall, in some places it may be steel slats. It may be electronic and technology. It may be exactly what Customs and Border Patrol says they need. The President has made very clear on Twitter and in his public statements and in the Rose Garden yesterday, in the Cabinet meeting for 95 minutes, on live TV two days earlier. He's made clear, border security as a mechanism may mean many different things including a wall. But let's get it done. So many Presidents have talked about securing the border. Chuck Schumer himself is on tape saying illegal immigration is bad. We have to get border security, but they voted for the Secure Fence Act in 2006, Jeanine, you know what? Let them call the Secure Fence Act of 2019 if it will make them feel better. But let's get it done."

She and Secretary of Pompeo negotiated this terrific deal with Mexico so that those who are coming up here can get asylum in Mexico and just wait there while their claims of fear are being processed by the United States. Mexico has offered work visas. They offer them safety. They've offered them obviously food and safe passage and yet, they're saying \"No, no, no. We need to get to America.\" This President is saying come legally. We have a humanitarian crisis at the border. If these people really cared about the kids, they would work with the President and the Vice President and our team and if you care about those kids, you want to deter them from taking this perilous journey and we need border security. We need physical barriers that you can't climb over, crawl under, drive-through or walk around."

Now, what's your showing now on the screen, it's very important. The President said design a steel slat barrier. What you see here would be very effective in deterring folks from taking that journey to begin with, if they saw that this is what they're going to face, they're going to say, \"Well, hold on. I can't drive through that or crawl over it or under it or around it.\" That's a serious thing. And so you need a physical barrier; in some places it may be a wall and maybe the steel slats and maybe electronics. We're going by what the brave men and women who are exhausted and overtaxed and overworked right now. I'm trying to absorb this new influx of family units and unaccompanied minors, who by the way aren't running away from Customs and Border Patrol, they are running towards them. CBP tells me. They are running toward them, saying, \"Help me. Where do I go? What do I do?\" And so those steel slats that you saw, it feels more expensive than concrete, let's face it, but let's get that $5.6 billion package. It's a modest investment of our border security at the House, pass it - Chuck Schumer has to find the ten votes. He has to find the ten votes to get this done and put it on the President's desk.

We've seen that they've now filed a bill to make it mandatory that candidates for President file their taxes and make those public. We see that they want to impeach the President.

Because if that's the way you came to Washington, which is starting off by telling your son that you're going to impeach the \"XX mf'er\" because of it, that's not what you were elected to do.

Now, today we see in Knoxville, Tennessee - the son of the Fire Chief there killed by an illegal immigrant just in the last 48 hours, another horrific story. The Democrats are never going to do it. The thing that the President needs to do is he needs to use every tool available to him as the Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Services to go and enforce our laws by putting the military on our southern border, by having them build the wall if they need to and have some Federal judge come in and try and stop him from doing that and we'll litigate this to the Supreme Court.

And as we go forward, it just stuns me that the Democrats are digging their heels in when they have said the exact opposite several years back, but I think it's interesting when the President tweeted the picture of a fence, not so much a wall and Kellyanne took great pains to kind of just say, \"Oh, it doesn't matter if it's a wall or a fence or whatever.\" I get the sense that they're trying to change the semantics or the lingo so that maybe they can get something passed and you can see what the President tweeted out not so much a wall, but more a barrier or a fence."

And if that means it's a see-through steel slat barrier and if that's what they want and that's what they should get.

But you know, the President stays in Washington. He doesn't take a vacation and your old employer, Chuck Schumer is on vacation. Nancy Pelosi is in Hawaii.

I would like to see this economy continue, but the one thing that's going to trip it up is a prolonged government shutdown especially as we head into tax return season when people need to file their returns and then spend that money that helps our economy. The President needs to open the government right now, do whatever it takes. I heard Kellyanne a little while ago backing off a physical structure, talking about technology. That's something we can work with because I think the Democrats believe in border security.

I love this this new line by the Democrats, you know, we don't need a barrier, we need technology. I was in the security arena for a long time. I'm not patting myself on the back, it's just a fact. We use walls and security you know why? They stop people from moving and they allow us to control access. Chris doesn't know anything about security, so he won't tell you that. But I ask a simple question of every Democrat that says this - I say, if walls don't work, why do we use them at the White House? Why are they all around Capitol Hill and obstructive barriers? Why are - why do we use them in banks surrounding vaults? Why? And they can't answer basic simple questions because they don't know."

There's never been a ladder and a rope that hasn't crept a wall when it was unmanned. So we need technology, not a wall. Walls are old technology. Didn't work.

You aren't in security, I get it, you don't understand this stuff, but you talk about it anyway. When you're involved in access control, we are not looking for a perfect solution.

      "utterance": "Look, that particular scene, I have to say I find it to be quite funny, but I'm kind of in the camp now where I think we actually have to stop mocking her and start to really understand what's happening here. First and foremost, she's constantly presenting herself even in that interview as a little girl. She comes across like she's 16 years old. She is not. Because we keep calling her the youngest person in Congress, it allows her to play the part of victim, like she's some girl on the playground who keeps getting bullied. She is not. She's a 30-year-old adult woman who was talking about dangerous ideas. She is talking about socialism. She's talking about ideas that were once pushed by Stalin and Lenin. And we have to start talking about her position because this is something that is actually extremely alarming in America. She is not being bullied because she's young. She's not being bullied because she's the youngest person in Congress. People are actually holding her to task because she knows absolutely nothing and she's made it to Capitol Hill."

But I want to move on from that to her saying something about and the \"60 Minutes\" interview on taxes. Take a listen."

      "speaker": "OCASIO-CORTEZ",
      "utterance": "Once you get to like the tippy tops on your ten millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more."

      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "Okay, so first and foremost, I'm going to point against the way that she presents herself, \"the tippy top.\" I don't know why she's speaking like that, she's a 30-year-old adult woman, but she does not understand economics whatsoever and unfortunately, a lot of these interviewers aren't hitting hard back at her and asking her to explain her positions. If she wants to 60%, you know, in terms of people's salary, she should start with her own. She's making $174,000.00. I suggest that we take 70% of hers."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

      "speaker": "OCASIO-CORTEZ",
      "utterance": "I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security. That is radical."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "First and foremost, she should know that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican and she's representing the opposite party. I think she knows absolutely nothing about American History, absolutely nothing about World History. Forget history, she doesn't even understand world current affairs, otherwise she wouldn't be pushing forth socialism as we understand it's completely made Venezuela an absolute mess and those people are actually fleeing those countries trying to come into our own. Again, this is a woman that has arrived into the spotlight and I'm happy that in America, you can do that if you work hard, but her policies are alarming and she's extremely uneducated and that is why she is constantly under attack by the media."

I mean, she said some things that weren't so nice about Pelosi and we see Rashida Tlaib, the one who called the President and an \"m effer,\" which just blows my mind. She's now running for cover when the press comes after her. Do you think Ocasio-Cortez is someone who can be reined in by Nancy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OWENS",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. Here's one thing you have to credit the left with. They never go against each other. They're like zombies.  They're in lockstep. No matter what the other person does, they never go after each other and attack one another in the media. So they'll come together for the sake of trying to destroy Trump. They will be in lockstep focused on trying to destroy Trump, trying to go after Republicans and trying to go after the GOP. I think that that's what we're going to see here."

Take a look."

Three hundred and sixty officers, Federal state, local, tribal and territorial who lost their lives in the line of duty. One hundred and twenty nine of those officers died last year. The others died earlier in history, but their stories have been forgotten and our research efforts uncovered them. They will be forgotten no more."

These are wanted posters from yesteryear and over here, we have three skeletons. This is one of my favorites because ultimately, you, the investigator has to determine what type of weapon was used to kill each of these individuals."

All of them working together, many multiple agencies working the same crime."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, and then what this wall does is you touch it, it tells you the crime, the agency and the resolution and it takes you through the actual investigation. That is fascinating."

      "utterance": "Yes, right, right. So if you want to get a - find out about a Virginia hostage situation, when a homicide suspect takes hostages, he's already wanted for murder. You can view the crime line and then the police agencies involved and, wow, Customs Border Protection and U.S. Marshals. It's amazing. There is a very complex web."

Thousands of mourners turned out today in Northern California to say goodbye to police officer, Ronil Singh, the hard-working man of the law was shot to death on the day after Christmas by an illegal. Before today's funeral, Officer Singh's flag-draped casket was honored by passers-by and residents in the town of Newman, California which officer Singh, an immigrant himself served so honorably. We here at \"Justice\" send our thoughts and our prayers and our gratitude to Officer Singh's wife and his five-month-old son. May he rest in peace. Thanks for watching tonight. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American Way. \"The Greg Gutfeld Show\" is coming up and I'll see you next Saturday night. Thanks for being with us.
