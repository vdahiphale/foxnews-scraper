But I think one of the big challenges for Michael Bloomberg here is that he hasn't been campaigning in these states, like a lot of the other candidates, the early primary states, for months and months, like others have. And there was a march poll in Iowa among Iowa Democratic caucus-goers, and that one found Michael Bloomberg had a negative-11 percent approval rating, net approval rating. So he's going to have a challenge, even though he does have the resources, in appealing to these early stage voters, which ultimately do decide a lot of the direction of the primary after states start voting. There's also a concern about whether he will be able to amass the number of polls and Democratic individual donors needed to make the primary debate stage. So, depending on his strategy, he might be trying to run an unconventional campaign, which could further turn off voters and add to the negative perception of him being a billionaire trying to buy the election, as some of the Democratic contenders have alleged.",

Meanwhile, as you mentioned, we're continuing to sift through those transcripts over here. We're learning some brand-new details about the transcripts released just a couple of hours ago, Neil. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's testimony largely focused on making the case there was a deal in the works between President Trump -- excuse me -- between Trump administration officials and Ukraine's government. Asked, \"Do you think the president was trying to get the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden?\" Vindman answers: \"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see where the game would be for the president in investigating the son of a political opponent.\" Also released today, transcripts for Fiona Hill. She was really the first to report that John Bolton was trying to distance himself from the unofficial policy channel many witnesses have now said was being run by Rudy Giuliani. Hill says: \"Rudy Giuliani was a hand grenade that was going to blow everybody up.\" She also adds: \"The more you engage with someone who is spreading untruths, the more validity you give to those untruths.\" Hill also says Bolton told her he -- quote -- \"wanted no part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\" So, some brand-new perspectives on how the Trump administration was really managing U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine. Lastly, Neil, I want to just mention to you, tomorrow's a Saturday but it's also the deadline for Republicans to get Democrats their list of -- wish list of witnesses they want to publicly testify as part of this next phase in the impeachment investigation. So look out for that tomorrow.",

The new development this afternoon, an attorney for John Bolton and Charles Kupperman, who was John Bolton's former deputy NSC director here at the White House, Chuck Cooper sent a letter to the general counsel of the House of Representatives outlining the reasons why Bolton and Kupperman wanted to go to federal court to get an opinion whether they should comply with the subpoenas that were issued to them. In one tantalizing paragraph in this letter, Cooper writes about Bolton that he was -- quote -- \"personally involved in many of the events, meetings and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\" The committees withdrew the subpoena for Kupperman and didn't issue one to John Bolton, because they didn't want to wait until the court date in December to hear from them. They thought that they were coordinating with the White House to try to delay the proceedings. Well, this letter is to say they were not coordinating with the White House. The White House knew nothing about what they were doing. And how serious can this impeachment inquiry possibly be if you don't want to wait a couple of weeks to hear from people who actually talked to the president about this? The president himself was dismissing the inquiry again today as he was on his way out of the White House down to Atlanta for a big event there, saying that he told his acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and the Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for foreign policy programs, Mark Sandy, to ignore subpoenas to appear today because he didn't want a validate what he called a corrupt process. The president said he's also been watching the transcripts that have been released and is not worried about anything he has read or heard so far. Here's what he told me:",

Currently, our temps all across the Great Lakes are just right around the freezing mark, 37 in New York, not that bad down across South Florida. Tampa and points to the south, you're not that bad. But I tell you what. We're around 21 degrees colder than we were yesterday at this time in Raleigh. Big warmup right now across parts of the Plains. In fact, Rapid City, you are 20 degrees warmer than you were. But watch what happens. We had this Arctic air that's up around the Arctic, where it should be. It's going to dive down kind of in pulses. About three different cold fronts will move through throughout the next seven days. And, each time, the cold will get progressively colder. Here's your temps for Saturday. You see the cold air in place, not that bad, Kansas City 62. Then we see the dive down on Sunday, that next batch of cold air coming in. By the time we get to Monday, we're only at a high of 36 in Amarillo. And by the time we get to Tuesday, that cold air is going to settle way down in across parts of the South.

This is something that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could have blocked, because the Intelligence Committee is a select committee, but she didn't block that. And Jim Jordan is now on that committee.

He's potentially in because he's tired of this, well, pile-on, as Charlie said. So is he tapping a nerve other Democrats are ignoring? Let's go to Emily Larsen and Steve Moore and Danielle McLaughlin. Danielle, what do you think of that, that while the passion on the left certainly seems to me with the Elizabeth Warrens and Bernie Sanders, someone like a Michael Bloomberg speaks to a group that feels it's getting slighted?

There's been research recently showing that the persuadable voters, people, for example, who switched between President Obama and President Trump, are still folks who are looking for a more moderate candidate. We see that, both ends of the spectrum, whether it's left or right, in primaries tend to get the earring, because primary voters tend to be at one or the other ends of the spectrum. But, at the end of the day, Democrats have to do a little bit of navel-gazing, I think, and think about not only who can win a primary, but who can win against President Trump, who can take those independents, who can take moderate Republicans. And somebody like Biden or a Bloomberg or a Cory Booker or perhaps a Kamala Harris probably has a better chance against, in the general populace, than maybe one of the far-left progressive candidates."

He's a successful billion -- businessman who's employed tens of thousands of people, made billions of dollars, made shareholders wealthy. I mean, what the heck is wrong with that, Neil? I mean, I'm not a big fan of Michael Bloomberg's, but the fact is, what a resume the guy has.

Leon Cooperman, the big investor, saying, let's not forget that I generate and have generated a good deal of philanthropy and activities. Others who talk about Ken Langone and these others who have made and created whole industries that have hired thousands, hundreds of thousands over the years, that that's their pitch, and they're getting a little annoyed that somehow they're hanging onto ill-gotten gains.

But I think one of the big challenges for Michael Bloomberg here is that he hasn't been campaigning in these states, like a lot of the other candidates, the early primary states, for months and months, like others have. And there was a march poll in Iowa among Iowa Democratic caucus-goers, and that one found Michael Bloomberg had a negative-11 percent approval rating, net approval rating. So he's going to have a challenge, even though he does have the resources, in appealing to these early stage voters, which ultimately do decide a lot of the direction of the primary after states start voting. There's also a concern about whether he will be able to amass the number of polls and Democratic individual donors needed to make the primary debate stage. So, depending on his strategy, he might be trying to run an unconventional campaign, which could further turn off voters and add to the negative perception of him being a billionaire trying to buy the election, as some of the Democratic contenders have alleged."

I tell you, I talk to Democratic operatives, and why this is significant, is Democratic operatives are looking at this field and they believe they have a bunch of C-minus candidates, frankly, and they are looking for some alternative. Maybe it is Michael Bloomberg. Maybe it's Michelle Obama. But I do think you're going to see other entrants into this race.

Meanwhile, as you mentioned, we're continuing to sift through those transcripts over here. We're learning some brand-new details about the transcripts released just a couple of hours ago, Neil. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's testimony largely focused on making the case there was a deal in the works between President Trump -- excuse me -- between Trump administration officials and Ukraine's government. Asked, \"Do you think the president was trying to get the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden?\" Vindman answers: \"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see where the game would be for the president in investigating the son of a political opponent.\" Also released today, transcripts for Fiona Hill. She was really the first to report that John Bolton was trying to distance himself from the unofficial policy channel many witnesses have now said was being run by Rudy Giuliani."

Lastly, Neil, I want to just mention to you, tomorrow's a Saturday but it's also the deadline for Republicans to get Democrats their list of -- wish list of witnesses they want to publicly testify as part of this next phase in the impeachment investigation.

The new development this afternoon, an attorney for John Bolton and Charles Kupperman, who was John Bolton's former deputy NSC director here at the White House, Chuck Cooper sent a letter to the general counsel of the House of Representatives outlining the reasons why Bolton and Kupperman wanted to go to federal court to get an opinion whether they should comply with the subpoenas that were issued to them. In one tantalizing paragraph in this letter, Cooper writes about Bolton that he was -- quote -- \"personally involved in many of the events, meetings and conversations about which you have already received testimony, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\" The committees withdrew the subpoena for Kupperman and didn't issue one to John Bolton, because they didn't want to wait until the court date in December to hear from them. They thought that they were coordinating with the White House to try to delay the proceedings. Well, this letter is to say they were not coordinating with the White House. The White House knew nothing about what they were doing. And how serious can this impeachment inquiry possibly be if you don't want to wait a couple of weeks to hear from people who actually talked to the president about this? The president himself was dismissing the inquiry again today as he was on his way out of the White House down to Atlanta for a big event there, saying that he told his acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and the Office of Management and Budget's deputy director for foreign policy programs, Mark Sandy, to ignore subpoenas to appear today because he didn't want a validate what he called a corrupt process. The president said he's also been watching the transcripts that have been released and is not worried about anything he has read or heard so far."

President Trump said this morning he wants to put it out there.

Now, all this at a time when a lot of people say, should the United States president be meeting with Erdogan at all, or any nefarious character? Well, there's precedent for that.

I think the president, what he's doing is good. We -- the more all Americans are included in every component of the political process speaks to the greatness of the country, any time we can expand that. The problem here is that the president has, unfortunately, used language in the past that will -- we will have a lot of difficulty in erasing, even with an eraser, with the words unemployment drop, because I think some harsh and painful words are just kind of hanging out here across the country as it relates to African-Americans and some other minorities."

Nobody, I hope, is excited and playful about what happened. But I don't know about whether there's going to be some retribution to Democrats who supported it or not. But I think that the charge -- there are two explicit things in the Constitution as it relates to impeachment. And they were and are bribery and treason. And so I think everything else comes under the little -- the banner of high crimes and misdemeanors. I think this could be misdemeanors, but it also could be bribery. And so I think the best thing to do is get all of the facts out. I'm not going to make a declaration that I'm going to vote for impeachment because I don't like Donald Trump.

But we need to get ready. Take a look at a map. Show you what's going on. It's already cold. The first patch of air has settled down in across much of the country. However, it is going to get much, much colder as we move forward in time. Currently, our temps all across the Great Lakes are just right around the freezing mark, 37 in New York, not that bad down across South Florida. Tampa and points to the south, you're not that bad. But I tell you what. We're around 21 degrees colder than we were yesterday at this time in Raleigh. Big warmup right now across parts of the Plains. In fact, Rapid City, you are 20 degrees warmer than you were. But watch what happens. We had this Arctic air that's up around the Arctic, where it should be. It's going to dive down kind of in pulses. About three different cold fronts will move through throughout the next seven days. And, each time, the cold will get progressively colder. Here's your temps for Saturday. You see the cold air in place, not that bad, Kansas City 62. Then we see the dive down on Sunday, that next batch of cold air coming in. By the time we get to Monday, we're only at a high of 36 in Amarillo. And by the time we get to Tuesday, that cold air is going to settle way down in across parts of the South. And if you have got the cold air, sometimes, you get precipitation that freezes. Take a look at that. We're going to have snow definitely across the Great Lakes and interior sections of the Northeast by next week, coastal letters probably still rain -- Neil."

And that's why, today, the Republicans made the bold move of putting Jim Jordan on that committee. They want aggressive attack dogs on that committee, so they can counterpunch to the Democrats. This is something that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could have blocked, because the Intelligence Committee is a select committee, but she didn't block that. And Jim Jordan is now on that committee. The other thing that we're looking for right now at this hour is, there could be an update on potential requests for Republican witnesses at those hearings. They have until about 11:20 tomorrow morning, Neil."
