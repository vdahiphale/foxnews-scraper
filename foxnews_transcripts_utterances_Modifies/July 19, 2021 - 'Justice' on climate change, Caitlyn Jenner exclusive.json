It his never ending campaign to put America last and cement her image as a racist, oppressive nation, the Biden administration has invited the United Nations Human Rights Council that includes China, Russia, Cuba, and Venezuela to judge whether America is a racist nation. This was Secretary of State Tony Blinken justifying his actions.",

We can't sweep our shortcomings under the rug or pretend they don't exist. We need to face them openly and honestly, even if that's ugly, even if that's painful. That's how we live up to our values.",

      "sentences": "And now Blinken even went beyond that, urging all U.N. member states to join in this effort to confront the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, and xenophobia. Blinken added that the invitation to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues was a first step in a plan to issue a standing invitation to all U.N. experts who report on Human Rights issues in the United States. Now, let me see if I have this straight. You invite people from the U.N. who hate the United States to come here on our soil to judge us without concern for their bias, their hatred, their prejudice, and their outright opposition, and hostility to a democracy to judge us? Never in history has this ever happened. You invite China that has one million Uighurs in concentration camps to judge us. Cuba that's arresting journalists, beating and killing demonstrators who simply want food and liberty to judge us. Venezuela who tortures her own citizens, and Russia run by a former KGB Intel agent where enemies of the government are poisoned or just disappear to judge us. Why? What's in this for you? Who do you work for? You invite our enemies to visit the United States and investigate whether there are Human Rights issues stemming from the George Floyd murder? compile information and quote, \"report back to the world.\" Are you stupid or crazy? You ask people with dirty hands to judge the most freedom loving nation in the world. The country where people from those nations risked their lives to come here, and you invite them to address America's systemic racism against Africans and people of African descent in the context of law enforcement? Doesn't your Department of Justice do that? Why are you looking to corrupt foreign governments to judge if we're racist? Why don't you just write the report now? We all know what the narrative you want to cement is and what the report will ultimately say. It's the United Nations simply putting its imprimatur on your 1619 Project. And by the way, how are you going to compile this information? Under what authority do foreigners collect additional information? Will they be going into police departments around the country demanding statistics and information? Will they be doing interviews? Do police have the right to refuse to answer questions by members of foreign countries? Under what authority do they even receive the information? Who will review the information to find out whether there is evidence to support their final report? And have you no confidence in the American system of justice? The one that after a jury trial of his peers convicted Derek Chauvin of murder? That's not enough for you. What about the Federal government that's monitoring several police departments around the country? That's not enough for you. You need communist China's input? Communist Cuba's approval? You're like an idiotic, simplistic, naive, woke loser. You're not doing anything but creating division nationally and internationally. And speaking of Cuba, why aren't you taking measures if you're so into protecting the rights of the downtrodden and making sure that no one suffers from bias? Why aren't you supporting the Cuban people 90 miles away from our shore? Why is your Homeland Secretary Mayorkas saying not only the Cuban refugees should not come here, but if they do, they'll be returned? Are you in favor of Cuba, a Marxist communist nation supported by another Marxist organization, Black Lives Matter? Why would you let people from the southern border in, but not the Cubans? Could it be the Cubans are Republicans, and they will turn Florida, a solid red, so you have to stop them? You invite a scandal-ridden organization, the United Nations with its own history of corruption to come here and judge us? The United Nations that has over 100 resolutions condemning the State of Israel, the one democracy in the Middle East? The same United Nations with its peacekeeping force that failed to stop the massacre of more than 8,000 men and boys by Bosnian forces? The same United Nations with its oil for food scandal, or sex abuse scandals by U.N. peacekeepers in Haiti occurred? The U.N. where millions of dollars in cash were funneled to aid North Korean leader Kim Jong-il? Everyone knows what the United Nations is.",

Now, you may think the endgame here will be the U.N. labeling the United States as a racist, oppressive nation. That certainly will happen. But it goes beyond identifying the United States as a racist nation and cementing the Democrat narrative. They will recommend reparations. This week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet urged a wide range of reparations over racism and has urged countries to fully fund a wide range of reparation measures to address the legacies of slavery, colonial rule, and racial discrimination. Yes, it will go beyond identifying the United States as a racist nation. The drumbeat has begun, and reparations are next. And that's my open.

He's very distressed about what's going on in Cuba. It breaks his heart that the border is so broken, and inflation is rampant. I met with him and Kevin McCarthy. The President is all in in helping Kevin take back the House. He is working well with Rick Scott to make sure we get the Senate Majority. But here's what I can tell you about President Trump. He is heartbroken as to what is going on in our country and the world at large. He thinks he can fix it, and he told me he has unfinished business.

He thinks he has a plan to fix it. It worked before, it will work again. And he told me there is some unfinished business in terms of what he would like to do as President for the nation to get us on a sustainable, better footing. When you look at Trump's four years compared to Biden's six months. I like our chances to win the House and the Senate in 2022, and to take back the White House in 2024.

Joe Biden's administration is in freefall. The border is broken, rampant inflation, crime in the streets, radical Islam is on the rise. The President has a hell of a story to tell about what he did for this country, and more importantly, what he can do. This is the party of Donald Trump, if you think otherwise, you're in for a rude awakening. I think he's going to lead us to victory in 2022 in the House and the Senate, and I will be shocked after spending two days with him if he doesn't run again for President because he believes he has unfinished business as President of the United States and he believes he can put the country in a better position than Biden has it and I agree with him.",

One of the worst is the so-called bootleg fire in Oregon that has now scorched more than 430 square miles. That's a hundred square miles larger than the area of New York City. At least 67 homes and 117 outbuildings have gone up in flames. The fire is so big and so fast that it is moving four to five miles a day. And a state of emergency is in effect in Northern Arizona due to the flooding that followed the museum fire. Heavy rain complicating cleanup efforts there, runoff from the burnt scar caused flash flooding that sent two feet of water and debris into nearby towns.

It his never ending campaign to put America last and cement her image as a racist, oppressive nation, the Biden administration has invited the United Nations Human Rights Council that includes China, Russia, Cuba, and Venezuela to judge whether America is a racist nation. This was Secretary of State Tony Blinken justifying his actions."

    {
      "speaker": "ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE",
      "utterance": "For the United States to be a credible force for Human Rights around the world, we have to face the realities of racism and hatred here at home. We can't sweep our shortcomings under the rug or pretend they don't exist. We need to face them openly and honestly, even if that's ugly, even if that's painful. That's how we live up to our values."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And now Blinken even went beyond that, urging all U.N. member states to join in this effort to confront the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, and xenophobia. Blinken added that the invitation to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues was a first step in a plan to issue a standing invitation to all U.N. experts who report on Human Rights issues in the United States. Now, let me see if I have this straight. You invite people from the U.N. who hate the United States to come here on our soil to judge us without concern for their bias, their hatred, their prejudice, and their outright opposition, and hostility to a democracy to judge us? Never in history has this ever happened. You invite China that has one million Uighurs in concentration camps to judge us. Cuba that's arresting journalists, beating and killing demonstrators who simply want food and liberty to judge us. Venezuela who tortures her own citizens, and Russia run by a former KGB Intel agent where enemies of the government are poisoned or just disappear to judge us. Why? What's in this for you? Who do you work for? You invite our enemies to visit the United States and investigate whether there are Human Rights issues stemming from the George Floyd murder? compile information and quote, \"report back to the world.\" Are you stupid or crazy? You ask people with dirty hands to judge the most freedom loving nation in the world. The country where people from those nations risked their lives to come here, and you invite them to address America's systemic racism against Africans and people of African descent in the context of law enforcement? Doesn't your Department of Justice do that? Why are you looking to corrupt foreign governments to judge if we're racist? Why don't you just write the report now? We all know what the narrative you want to cement is and what the report will ultimately say. It's the United Nations simply putting its imprimatur on your 1619 Project. And by the way, how are you going to compile this information? Under what authority do foreigners collect additional information? Will they be going into police departments around the country demanding statistics and information? Will they be doing interviews? Do police have the right to refuse to answer questions by members of foreign countries? Under what authority do they even receive the information? Who will review the information to find out whether there is evidence to support their final report? And have you no confidence in the American system of justice? The one that after a jury trial of his peers convicted Derek Chauvin of murder? That's not enough for you. What about the Federal government that's monitoring several police departments around the country? That's not enough for you. You need communist China's input? Communist Cuba's approval? You're like an idiotic, simplistic, naive, woke loser. You're not doing anything but creating division nationally and internationally. And speaking of Cuba, why aren't you taking measures if you're so into protecting the rights of the downtrodden and making sure that no one suffers from bias? Why aren't you supporting the Cuban people 90 miles away from our shore? Why is your Homeland Secretary Mayorkas saying not only the Cuban refugees should not come here, but if they do, they'll be returned? Are you in favor of Cuba, a Marxist communist nation supported by another Marxist organization, Black Lives Matter? Why would you let people from the southern border in, but not the Cubans? Could it be the Cubans are Republicans, and they will turn Florida, a solid red, so you have to stop them? You invite a scandal-ridden organization, the United Nations with its own history of corruption to come here and judge us? The United Nations that has over 100 resolutions condemning the State of Israel, the one democracy in the Middle East? The same United Nations with its peacekeeping force that failed to stop the massacre of more than 8,000 men and boys by Bosnian forces? The same United Nations with its oil for food scandal, or sex abuse scandals by U.N. peacekeepers in Haiti occurred? The U.N. where millions of dollars in cash were funneled to aid North Korean leader Kim Jong-il? Everyone knows what the United Nations is."

But it goes beyond identifying the United States as a racist nation and cementing the Democrat narrative. They will recommend reparations. This week, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet urged a wide range of reparations over racism and has urged countries to fully fund a wide range of reparation measures to address the legacies of slavery, colonial rule, and racial discrimination. Yes, it will go beyond identifying the United States as a racist nation. The drumbeat has begun, and reparations are next. And that's my open.

I'm nervous he didn't play this well. But the President is worried about our country. He is mad as hell about what Blinken is doing, having the U.N. come in here and judge America. He's very distressed about what's going on in Cuba. It breaks his heart that the border is so broken, and inflation is rampant. I met with him and Kevin McCarthy. The President is all in in helping Kevin take back the House. He is working well with Rick Scott to make sure we get the Senate Majority. But here's what I can tell you about President Trump. He is heartbroken as to what is going on in our country and the world at large. He thinks he can fix it, and he told me he has unfinished business. So, I will be shocked if he doesn't run for President in 2024."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I think he's all in to make sure we take back the House and the Senate and stop this craziness of the reconciliation package -- cradle to grave socialism. You know, spending like drunken sailors, inflation going through the roof, the border is completely lost here. So, the bottom line is, the President really is very upset by what he is seeing. He thinks he has a plan to fix it. It worked before, it will work again. And he told me there is some unfinished business in terms of what he would like to do as President for the nation to get us on a sustainable, better footing. When you look at Trump's four years compared to Biden's six months. I like our chances to win the House and the Senate in 2022, and to take back the White House in 2024. Joe Biden's administration is out of control, and every day that passes and we appreciate Trump policies more and more."

And you know, he is also going out and he is making speeches. He is supporting candidates and indicating he is not supporting other candidates. He's a force on the campaign trail as well."

We have a lot of talented people in the Republican Party, but I can tell you this, if President Trump runs in 2024, he will be the nominee of this party. His policies are standing the test of time. Joe Biden's administration is in freefall. The border is broken, rampant inflation, crime in the streets, radical Islam is on the rise. The President has a hell of a story to tell about what he did for this country, and more importantly, what he can do. This is the party of Donald Trump, if you think otherwise, you're in for a rude awakening. I think he's going to lead us to victory in 2022 in the House and the Senate, and I will be shocked after spending two days with him if he doesn't run again for President because he believes he has unfinished business as President of the United States and he believes he can put the country in a better position than Biden has it and I agree with him."

At least 67 homes and 117 outbuildings have gone up in flames. The fire is so big and so fast that it is moving four to five miles a day.

They do not borders -- take this marginalized community and have a platform to try to make it better. So, honestly, I feel like, now is the time to do something with that. And to me, it's an advantage. Me personally, I think, running for Governor, it's kind of an advantage. Why? Because I'm at peace in my heart. I don't have any of these issues anymore.

She can't get out of it. She's an unsophisticated person who just wants to live a normal life. But you've got to see the kind of money that the father is getting. He is getting a quarter million to just run her affairs and her legal team that she is paying to represent the dad just billed her $1.5 million for eight months, Judge, $1.5 million for eight months, and they have four lawyers on the case that are charging more than $1,000.00 an hour.

The good guy who is now repping Britney used to be a Federal prosecutor. So he is going to come in guns blazing, big experience, and he's going to free Britney and that's a good thing because Judge, as you said, she is not incapacitated.

He identify himself as a as a lover of Communist China, and that is because he is trying to follow the money. I agree with Tomi, he is transparent, but he is trying to follow the money because that Chinese money is what drove LeBron James and John Cena to say whatever the Chinese wants.

And a source familiar with the sales arrangement says that the New York gallery owner who is showing Hunter Biden's paintings will have the ability to reject offers, but he is saying that neither Hunter Biden nor the White House or President Biden will have -- none of them will have any idea of who is buying the paintings, and that according to a White House official, any buyer's identity will be kept secret by the gallery owner. Now Tomi, do you think that that will be the case that the New York gallery owner will not tell Hunter who gave him a half a million dollars for his for his artwork, so-called?"

      "utterance": "Yes, come on now. I think we know that that is not the truth. But what's amazing to me, Judge, is that this man is not hiding in a hole somewhere. I mean, after the text messages, after the laptop, after all the things that we've seen of Hunter Biden, we've seen way too much of Hunter Biden, by the way, more than I'm comfortable with. The fact that he is not hiding in a hole, the fact that he is so brazen, going out there and selling his artwork. It just goes to show that the Democrats, they are shameless. The Biden administration, they are shameless. They don't care what the appearance of this is. They don't care at all because they know they can get away with anything they want. Now, he is selling paintings, so-called paintings. I mean, this guy, really? I've got to give him credit for his hustle, but it's really disgraceful."

He is allowed to make money, millions of dollars in which he is not qualified to make and more importantly, he gets a pass on all of his misconduct. It's an embarrassment. Don't ever talk about the Trump family ever again, Democrats, because you have public enemy number one in Hunter Biden."

Look, former head of the F.B.I., what's his name -- Louis Freeh gave $100,000.00 in trust for Biden's grandchildren so that he could join Hunter in doing business with him. I mean, this is so sick, this deep state. Anyway, Tomi, Leo -- Tomi, I'm going to see you at Turning Point, is that right?"
