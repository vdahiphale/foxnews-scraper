In Washington, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor of The Federalist and Fox News contributor. And in New York, Jessica Tarlov, senior director at Bustle Trends and also a Fox News contributor.  Mollie, President Trump enjoying just a tsunami of media criticism for denouncing bigotry, denouncing violence on many sides but not naming the people who carried out these attacks including the car that rammed into a crowd. The driver charged with murder and that's white nationalist. What's your take?",

This was a nationwide rally of white nationalist and at best they were able to gather just a couple hundred people.   So there's two different ways of looking at this. Either you do think you give it wall-to-wall coverage, you very much elevate this tiny marginal group or other people would say, that's exactly what they want. They want that kind of coverage. They want to provoke conflict. They want to provoke quite dramatic interaction and maybe the media shouldn't be playing into that quite so much.",

He spent years criticizing Barack Obama for not saying radical Islamic terrorism.  And we know exactly why Barack Obama refused to do that. He didn't want to alienate moderate population of Muslims. But there are no moderate neo- Nazi. They do not exist. It is purely an extreme ideology and so I think the media actually hasn't gone too far. And as our viewers at home, and if you were listening to what Karl Rove in the past hour with Maria Bartiromo, he said it was disappointing that this was a moment where the president could have gone out there and said the appropriate things, the moral thing which is to condemn this group by their name just as his daughter did this morning on twitter.",

He also explicitly condemns racism. He explicitly talks about the need for people to love one another. I don't think that the full statement is being included here and I think the media has kind whipped themselves into a frenzy in a way that doesn't match with the rest of the country. I'm glad we just heard reference to other violent rallies. And the country has experienced in recent years a lot of violent rallies and they are on different fringe sides. They're not fringe, just fringe right. There's also fringe left, and we've seen violent rallies in Ferguson, in Charlotte, in Baltimore and Portland and Oakland and Milwaukee and Minneapolis and New York and many other places.   And people I think understand that there are these fringe elements that are convincing themselves about being violent toward their fellow American and that's not something that is just in one political enclave.

This is news worthy.  It is absolutely news worthy that North Korea which has been on a pass to this point for decades going through several administrations, does have some of these capabilities. But we need to also still remember how to cover these things a little bit more balanced. I mean, North Korea is a country that has interests.  They aren't likely to actually bomb the United States or Guam or Japan or South Korea because the moment they do that, as all these presidents have said, they would be utterly annihilated.

And with that, CNN fired him as a contributor. Nazi salutes are indefensible, a network spokesperson says. Lord says CNN caved over a joke and violated his free speech rights, but hey, wait a minute. There is no first amendment right to have a network contract if you say dumb stuff. Sieg heil, why even go there? David Letterman has pretty much gone underground since giving up the CBS late show. Once in a while you will see him in an interview with a picture of that big beard, but now he'll be resurfacing with a new show for Netflix. True, it's just six episodes of an interview series slated for next year but that underscores why Netflix is so successful. Letterman clearly doesn't want to do another season on network television so this lets him dip his toes in the digital waters without needing a massive audience and people can watch whenever they want. This is why outfits like Netflix and Amazon Prime videos and others are landing more big names. Well, that and the fact that they're spending big bucks.

Plus, from British politics in London to Fox News here in California, Steve Hilton says the American media are out of touch. Is he right? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"MediaBuzz.\" The aftermath of yesterday's violent protest in Charlottesville has eclipsed at least briefly the confrontation with North Korea. Joining us now to analyze the coverage here in L.A., Christina Bellantoni, assistant managing editor of politics of the Los Angeles Times. In Washington, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor of The Federalist and Fox News contributor. And in New York, Jessica Tarlov, senior director at Bustle Trends and also a Fox News contributor. Mollie, President Trump enjoying just a tsunami of media criticism for denouncing bigotry, denouncing violence on many sides but not naming the people who carried out these attacks including the car that rammed into a crowd. The driver charged with murder and that's white nationalist. What's your take?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, the media are very much focusing on this story, this horribly tragic story which has now led to the death of a woman who was run over by a man driving car. A man who I think appears to be related to this white nationalist movement so it's a very significant story. At the same time you see the media trying to sort of push and hype the story. This was a nationwide rally of white nationalist and at best they were able to gather just a couple hundred people. So there's two different ways of looking at this. Either you do think you give it wall-to-wall coverage, you very much elevate this tiny marginal group or other people would say, that's exactly what they want. They want that kind of coverage. They want to provoke conflict. They want to provoke quite dramatic interaction and maybe the media shouldn't be playing into that quite so much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But Jessica, by making Donald Trump the focus of this protest that turned utterly violent, protest that he had nothing to do with, aren't some critics in the media also being divisive?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think the media does play a divisive role in what's going on in today's society, but I do think that this was an incredibly important moment for the president of the United States to step up and to call these domestic terrorists exactly what they are, which are white supremacists and neo-Nazis. He spent years criticizing Barack Obama for not saying radical Islamic terrorism. And we know exactly why Barack Obama refused to do that. He didn't want to alienate moderate population of Muslims. But there are no moderate neo- Nazi. They do not exist. It is purely an extreme ideology and so I think the media actually hasn't gone too far. And as our viewers at home, and if you were listening to what Karl Rove in the past hour with Maria Bartiromo, he said it was disappointing that this was a moment where the president could have gone out there and said the appropriate things, the moral thing which is to condemn this group by their name just as his daughter did this morning on twitter."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right, I was going to mention it. Christina Bellantoni, it's been just 24 hour since this awful violence. Death toll is now three. Three dozen people injured, and the whole story turns to Trump's response. The lead story of \"Politico\" this morning, \"Trump fails to condemn white supremacist in statement on (INAUDIBLE) for violence."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BELLANTONI",
      "utterance": "It's the president of the United States, and so his words do matter. His words will get the focus, you know, we're going to talk about that with North Korea. What's important here is condemning violence no matter who is perpetrating it. And the president should have called him out by name. And his Republican colleagues and Democrats across the aisle all said you should have named this organization. You should have strongly condemned it. But the idea that anybody who would endorse any kind of violence is wrong at any levels of government and this is a moment, this is like a tinder box, right. We have seen this across the country, violence, now it's getting even more severe with people dead. People need to condemn violence no matter where it's happening, whether it's at rallies or with Democrats or Republicans or white nationalists and the president leads by example."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The president did do that, Mollie. Let me just jump in, sorry to cut you off. I personally think it would have been better if he had mentioned white nationalists as his daughter Ivanka did. Now, we did go through this as Jessica points out with Barack Obama who also got criticized heavily for refusing to call out radical Islamic terrorists and I think he should have done that. What explains this extraordinary level of media coverage on presidential language?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, first off I feel like people are responding to something to something they believe Donald Trump did or didn't say as oppose to what he actually said. They take this first line of lengthy statements he gave on the violence and they just take that one statement where he says there is violence on both sides or something to that effect. He also explicitly condemns racism. He explicitly talks about the need for people to love one another. I don't think that the full statement is being included here and I think the media has kind whipped themselves into a frenzy in a way that doesn't match with the rest of the country. I'm glad we just heard reference to other violent rallies. And the country has experienced in recent years a lot of violent rallies and they are on different fringe sides. They're not fringe, just fringe right. There's also fringe left, and we've seen violent rallies in Ferguson, in Charlotte, in Baltimore and Portland and Oakland and Milwaukee and Minneapolis and New York and many other places. And people I think understand that there are these fringe elements that are convincing themselves about being violent toward their fellow American and that's not something that is just in one political enclave. It's actually a problem we have across the spectrum and it's actually a good idea then for a president to speak to all of those things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "But Mollie, I take your point actually and I realize that there's this fringe. Obviously the vast majority of white people in this country are not white supremacists or neo-Nazis. But don't you agree that this was a great opportunity for the president to make his views clear on this specific group when every other Republican was doing as well. This isn't a bipartisan issue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Hold on Jessica. Jessica hold on, let me turn this back to the press. It seems like to the extent that the president did repeatedly and forcefully condemned bigotry and violence maybe with the specific language that you or others may have preferred, but the press doesn't have much interest in that. They only wants to make what he didn't say in the story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Yes, I understand that and as I said in my initial statement, I do think that the media plays a divisive role here. I just happen to think that they haven't gone too far in asking questions about why the president of the United States chose not to use that language today. I agree there are fringe groups of all types across the country who rally and who get violent and it should all be condemned. But at this moment, I don't know why the press is wrong to be asking a president who was a leader in the birther movement for instance, why he isn't using the explicit language when his own daughter is and when his wife has to be the first person from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to come out and condemn it with her tweet yesterday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right, the White House says the president was the first to in fact that there was point of violence between protesters and counter- protesters. Let's pull back the camera a little bit to Christina. Obviously, if there's violence in the protest we have to cover it, but there were already lots of TV cameras there in Charlottesville, Virginia for the possibility that something might go wrong. Do the media pay too much attention in general to these fringe groups?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BELLANTONI",
      "utterance": "It's a really important question newsrooms have. During the Republican National Convention there were some white nationalists there and the L.A. Times spent some time talking to them asking them their motivations and we got a lot of criticism why would you give any headlines to this movement, but part of it is understanding. This is an element of society. It doesn't matter what the percentage is. This is out there. And so, trying to understand motivations, get them to be able say like this is what it's about. It's a very delicate situation, but it is important to listen and maybe and maybe that can solve some problems if you get the information out there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right, that's a fair point. Let me now turn to the Korea situation. The president didn't just talk about fire and fury, he kept talking about the confrontation with Kim Jong-un. Here's what he said in an impromptu news conference with reporters."

You had Bill Clinton talk about how we could end North Korea. You had Barack Obama saying we have the capacity to destroy North Korea. John McCain when he was running for president said we could annihilate North Korea if the ever attacked us. So the idea that what Donald Trump said was somehow outside the norm of our frankly, all too common rhetoric regarding North Korea is not borne out by that historical perspective."

And then I star to see all the quotes of the past few decades in context and understand it. I think it reason that the media undermines him in this instance and in a lot of instances is that they don't trust him, and that's the fundamental problem here. When we saw that other members of the cabinet clearly did not talk to him about the language he was going to use and they were caught by surprise from Rex Tillerson, what --"

I mean, his words are on for 30 seconds and then there are a bunch of pundits talking afterwards about what he meant and whether his worst than Kim Jong-un.

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well first of all there always seems to be a little bit of a rush to war that we see in particularly broadcast media. You might have remembered when we struck Syria, there was such excitement about that. And I think people -- the media have gotten into patterns of kind of escalating rhetoric even as they are condemning what the president said and not thinking through some of the serious consequences of what a global conflict with North Korea would be like. This is news worthy. It is absolutely news worthy that North Korea which has been on a pass to this point for decades going through several administrations, does have some of these capabilities. But we need to also still remember how to cover these things a little bit more balanced. I mean, North Korea is a country that has interests. They aren't likely to actually bomb the United States or Guam or Japan or South Korea because the moment they do that, as all these presidents have said, they would be utterly annihilated. So, it's a little bit more complicated situation. What do they want with this nuclear power? That wasn't covered well."

      "utterance": "Yes, I know. I didn't agree with that and I totally agree to what Mollie just said there. I think there has been a lot of this blown up and if you listen to the experts, they are saying that, yes, there's an increased likelihood of a conflict but it's nowhere near kind of the fire and brimstone that we're hearing and obviously then saying fire and fury may play into that. What I think has been interesting is to see the effect on the American public in terms of polling. Now, over 50 percent say that they would be willing or think that it's a good idea to actually go into a conflict with North Korea, and that is a substantial change and I think due to the media coverage like Brian Williams trumping it up, to use the Trump word."

Look, it might be ridiculous that we would need to face and what would you do in the events of a nuclear blast. People are asking these questions. So, how do we approach it from a very clear-eyed journalistic perspective to report information so people can inform themselves, take that home to their children who are asking these questions? Take that into their school where people are asking these questions and that's what you just have to try to do, to be as sober about it as you can and get the facts out there without being hysterical. No one wants to delight in this type of coverage."

We like to cover what's happening right at this moment, but this is a story that really should have had more coverage going back to the 90's when Jimmy Carter made his trip to North Korea and worked out the terms of this nuclear arrangement. He actually kind of sabotaged Bill Clinton in so doing, and this is not, you know, this is not something that all began six months ago when Donald Trump was inaugurated president. This is a story decades in the making and this is a regional issue that goes back even longer.

They are the aggressor here and this is much more as Mollie pointed out, a regional issue than it is one for us so I understand the concerns especially for those on the West Coast. I think the media does need to play a role here in getting the facts out, something that they say that they are concerned with at the highest level if they want to push back on the White House saying that they've been spreading bad information and the media should be spreading good information or true information -- that's what I mean by good there about the actual --"

Damore said in an interview he's not a sexist and accused Google of illegal retaliation in a complaint with the National Labor Relations of what he said, people got offended because Silicon Valley is getting, quote, a progressive echo chamber and his comments go against the lefts ideology.

Even his understanding of what social science says about the differences between men and women can be argued with. But the overall memo was how about how to increase -- how to do a better job with diversity program and how to deal with the reality that men and women are different. This is a thing that many people in the media don't actually accept or they try and fight against all the time. Men and women are these things. They're different. They have on average differences that show up in all sorts of scientific analysis, and this isn't a bad thing. This is actually I think a good thing and women and men have on average different strength and they are going to choose different career paths and they're going to choose to be in those career paths in different ways and that is anathema to a lot of people in the media."

He did and then he got fired. I don't know if that's milking it to be upset about it. At the same time, I think it resonates with so many people because a lot of people in the country feel like they're not free to talk through different issues to engage to disagree, to differ with what some (INAUDIBLE) viewpoints are.

The vice president called the piece, quote, disgraceful and offensive to me, my family, and our entire team. The allegations of the article are categorically false and represent just the latest attempt by the media to divide this administration. What the paper said was that veep created a political action committee, hired top operative and that one of his aides said in a meeting that the Pence team wants to be prepared in case there was an opening in 2020. Joining us now here in Los Angeles, Gina Loudon, host of \"America Trends with Dr. Gina\" on the Youtoo America Network, and in New York, Cathy Areu, publisher of Catalina Magazine and a former editor at the Washington Post. Magazine. Gina, what do you make of Mike Pence pushing back so hard in such personal terms against this New York Times piece that includes him in the maneuvering for 2020?"

I think that's the problem that is that there has become such a chasm between conservatives in general and the media at this point, but there is just a distrust overall.

He did hire a chief of staff that is known to be a campaign guy. So his actions are showing but he may be getting ready to run for 2020 and it would be irresponsible for the \"New York Times\" to not run story like this. So it makes sense that he's upset, but maybe it's because it's the truth."

Some would say it would be irresponsible of the vice president not to be prepared to be president. He is after all the next in line. So, for any vice president in history to not be prepared some people would say that it would be irresponsible for him not to be. So then the media tries to make a story out of this, you know, other than just reporting it, but reporting it with a little jab like is there some problem there? That's what the consumers of media may have a problem with."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "In fairness to the \"Time\" Cathy, Pence wasn't even at the top of the piece. It was about Tom Cotton, Ben Sasse and John Kasick, but the Pence camp believes that such key facts were left out as, as a former governor he needed a federal PAC just to pay for his travel. And the first $1 million fund raiser for this pollical action (INAUDIBLE) he was introduced by Ivanka Trump or was it, that wasn't mentioned?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "Well, the piece wasn't about him so maybe that's why they didn't mention those things. There were saying that Republicans are coming up with a plan B for 2020 and that is the responsible thing to do given Trump's numbers right now -- they're in the 30s -- 30 percent. So yes, Trump might be the only person who thinks he can win in 2020. So the \"New York Times\" is simply saying that Republicans are looking for a plan B and Pence happens to be one of them. So, if they didn't include every detail about Pence's life, it's because as you said, the piece wasn't just about Vice President Pence. The piece I think responsible and balanced."

I think one of the Fox hosts said ditch Mitch and I think the people are feeling that way. I think society is feeling that way, so the Fox hosts are getting it right and they're speaking on behalf of the people because after all, that's what the media is. The media serves the people.

It's actually the whole conversation. There's this element of complete condescension, I think, toward the lives and views and opinions of those people who supported Donald Trump in the election. There is no real attempt to even understand why they may have done that, to look at the failures of the last -- not just the last presidency bit the last few decades that have left working people poorer, their lives tough, all that stuff that drives support.

I'm so glad we got some time to talk about it properly because I think that that is one of the reasons for the bias coverage I think, is that the people who are generating that coverage, the journalists, the editors, the people that produce that, they typically live in the wealthy parts of cities like New York and Washington and Los Angeles. And their lives are great. They have rising income, their neighborhoods are pleasant places, and they're free of crime. All those urban indicators are going in the right direction for them."

I patiently try and make the argument and say just look at what's going on in the lives of working Americans. Not those who live in this bubble either in San Francisco or New York or D.C. In D.C. for example, the wealthiest parts of the whole country. But look at the lives of people outside of that. You don't have to live there. You don't have to be part of it to see what's going on. There is data that tells you the story of what's happened to incomes. There are people who document what's going on. You don't actually have to be part of it to understand it and I think what's really happened with the media is this colossal failure of empathy for their fellow Americans, for the experience of people who are not like them."

      "utterance": "No, there's a really bad sexism problem that extends in Silicon Valley, but I think throughout corporate America. I mean this has been going on for a long time and if you talk to working women at all levels, of all organizations, they will tell you about their experiences."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It's hard to be particularly bad in the high-tech business because of sort of bro culture and fewer women that's hired for high tech jobs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "That's true. But I think the response actually goes to this point of narrow mindedness that I think is really characteristic of our liberal elite both in the media and in the business world where any view that doesn't fit with the prescribed set of opinions the elite have is just automatically dismissed. It's not even taken seriously. Even if you have that view, you don't have the right to be listened to. And I thing that's what's going on that is so troublesome, is this closing down of any alternative viewpoint."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right, well that's why we have you here. Quick break. More with Steve Hilton in just a moment. Plus, CNN cans a pro-Trump pundit and the really fascinating thing about David Letterman's comeback."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "More now with Steve Hilton, host of \"The Next Revolution\" here on Fox. So, even though you come out of Britain's conservative party, not everyone on the right is a fan. Breitbart says, fluffy liberal Steve Hilton is the original rhino. Republican in name only."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I get a lot of that actually. When I was working with David Cameron and making some changes in trying to get conservative party elected after many years in the political wilderness."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Meaning appealing to some folks in the middle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well, enough to win an election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's the point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "And that thing that was always something that was always hard to convey but I'll do my best. It's a show that actually -- it's not a betrayal of your conservative principles to try and relate them to the problems that people are facing in their lives today. So one of the big things that we try to do in the U.K. was to show that actually it was conservative solutions to those long-standing questions of poverty and inequality that has so troubled British society that would actually work after years of failing from (INAUDIBLE) party. Now, showing an interest in the lives of the poorest and of working people was seen by some as some kind of betrayal. To me, it was --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, the exact working people of this \"New York Times\" profile, again, published today says you see yourself now on American TV as kind of trying to unite or common ground between Trump supporters and Bernie Sanders supporters who obviously might agree on some issues like trade but they're kind of far out there on the left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think one of the really interesting things that's happening in politics is actually that the divide I think is increasingly not left- right but between what I would describe as the elitists and the populists. And the elitist -- you can find them in both parties. Your conversation just now about Mitch McConnell and the establishment Republicans, they are part of the problem in many ways in the sense that that agenda that is pro globalization, uncritical with what's going with automation in our economy, completely open borders on immigration, that agenda is being pursued by politicians in the left and right in the elite for the last few decades. And what you're seeing with the populist response to that is working people saying we've been screwed by these changes and we want someone to stand up for us. And that is different from the old left-right conversation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. The old left-right thing is kind of tired and this is the most fascinated I am that I think American politics are. So on your show, a Washington Times columnist says, he doesn't interrupt his guest when they're responding to well thought questions. Your program is (INAUDIBLE) and civilized. What? This is cable news, you cannot possibly keep this up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well we'll see how it goes and if I'm respective and bosses at Fox approve of it then I'm sure we'll we keep going. To me --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I interrupt people so, I'll just ask you are you trying to establish a different kinds of conversation with this show?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that -- yes, that's true. A thoughtful conversation because I think that actually some of these problems that have really hurt people for so long in their daily lives, they require a substantive thoughtful response and it's not the simplistic, you are right, you are wrong, left-right battle that I think has actually done a disservice to the real needs of people living in this country wherever they happen to live and that's what we're trying to get at with \"The Next Revolution.\""

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Appreciate the use of the studio. Still to come, CNN dumps a commentator over a Nazi salute and David Letterman planning a bit of a comeback in a way that speaks volumes about network television."

    {
      "speaker": "JEFFREY LORD, FORMER CNN COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "I want to say something here that I know will probably drive someone crazy, but I think of President Trump as the Martin Luther King of healthcare."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Jeffrey Lord was CNN fiercest Donald Trump defender at least until the other day. But after writing a column for the \"American Spectator\" in which he attacked the (INAUDIBLE) advocacy group, Media Matters as fascist, Lord tweeted Sieg Heil to the group's president. And with that, CNN fired him as a contributor. Nazi salutes are indefensible, a network spokesperson says. Lord says CNN caved over a joke and violated his free speech rights, but hey, wait a minute. There is no first amendment right to have a network contract if you say dumb stuff. Sieg heil, why even go there? David Letterman has pretty much gone underground since giving up the CBS late show. Once in a while you will see him in an interview with a picture of that big beard, but now he'll be resurfacing with a new show for Netflix. True, it's just six episodes of an interview series slated for next year but that underscores why Netflix is so successful. Letterman clearly doesn't want to do another season on network television so this lets him dip his toes in the digital waters without needing a massive audience and people can watch whenever they want. This is why outfits like Netflix and Amazon Prime videos and others are landing more big names. Well, that and the fact that they're spending big bucks.
