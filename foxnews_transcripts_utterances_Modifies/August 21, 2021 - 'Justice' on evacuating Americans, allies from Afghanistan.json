I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro, and there is breaking news tonight, as many Americans and our Afghan allies remain in danger overseas as a terrorist organization and brutal anti-American regime is once again in control of Afghanistan, which brings me to my open. Mark this day as the day the United States of America officially fell from grace as the world's superpower due to the ineptitude, the incompetence and the dereliction of duty by a so-called Commander-in-Chief, a fumbling, idiotic, confused, lying, full, incapable of extricating innocent Americans and Afghan allies from behind enemy lines in the war zone we entered 20 years ago. As American families of those trapped behind enemy lines, as Afghan- Americans whose families helped us, and indeed Americans of all walks of life are glued to this crisis on television, they are met with government officials who are not only not candid, or are confused, or are just outright lying.",

The U.K. Parliament condemned the United States, holding Joe Biden in contempt for the debacle in Afghanistan. The head of German Chancellor Merkel's party described the withdrawal as quote, \"The biggest NATO debacle since its founding,\" while the Brits and the French stunned at the unilateral withdrawal by the United States without even an e-mail, without even a phone call, even a return call to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The Brits and the French damned the torpedoes and did what everyone in this country would expect America to do, and that is get out from behind this make believe barrier and go out and rescue their citizens. And you -- you do nothing of the kind. And remember, Joe, the Brits, the French, the Germans, the Dutch, and the Aussies, they are not there because they were attacked. They're there because we were attacked on 9/11. They did this for us, you ungrateful, tone deaf, taxpayer funded career politician. And Mr. Cool, do you even give a damn?

Everything you said it's true. But judge, I'm worried tonight that we're running our people from Taliban into the ISIS hands. It's almost the Jurassic Park of terrorism. People are together in a big wad right outside the airport. How easy would it be for an ISIS suicide bomber to blow up our troops and all the people trying to get out? We need to correct that and we need to correct now. We need to push the perimeter back at the airport. We need to open up Bagram Air Base to have another way to get out, and we need to cancel the 31 August deadline because we can't get our people out. The bottom line. This is an ill-conceived, disjointed, half ass effort to get American citizens and those who fought for us out of Afghanistan and the Intel failure in this whole debacle is Joe Biden himself. It's not the quality of the Intelligence, it is the quality the man receiving the Intel. He was wrong about Iraq. He was wrong about killing bin Laden. He's been wrong about everything. He got up in front of the world and said, \"Al-Qaeda is out of Afghanistan.\" I mean, good God, is the man brain dead? He also said the Taliban are waving people through the checkpoint, does he not have a television? This is just so disturbing. And he says our allies agree with what he's doing. Well, all of that is dead wrong and I'm worried about an ISIS attack at the airport that could kill thousands of people, including Americans who are sitting ducks. If we don't change this plan quickly, we are going to get a lot of people killed by ISIS, not the Taliban.",

Tell the Taliban, we're going to fight to get our people out. If you want to fight, you'll have one, but we're going to stay until we get our people out. We're going to move the perimeter back at the Kabul Airport so we can have some organization, and we're going to cancel the 31 August deadline, and we're going to reopen Bagram Air Base. It is way out in the middle of nowhere. It's a great platform. And tell the Taliban, if you get in our way, we're going to crush you. The leverage we have is we are the United States of America, we are flat on our back, we're not back. I've never been more disappointed and disillusioned to be an American citizen as I am right now. We have a Commander-in-Chief who is completely incapable of putting the puzzle together, he's put all these people in harm's way. He has no idea of what he is doing. He was giving different options, he chose the most dangerous and dishonorable option available. He did that same damn thing in Iraq. He has been wrong about everything for 40 years, and this plan that we're trying to execute is going to get a lot of Americans killed and those who fought along our side, because ISIS is going to take advantage of the chaos at the airport.

I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan 57 times. I saw this coming a long time ago. Thank God, President Trump had a condition space withdrawal. I missed him tonight. But if you ask the military, would you risk your life to go back in Afghanistan to get our people out? They would say yes. We may lose some people to do this. But the one thing we will never lose if we do this right is our honor, and who the hell is going to fight with us in the future, if we're not willing to fight for these people now? Who's going to fight with us in the future? You can fight this war in our backyard or the enemy's backyard. I choose their backyard. You can fight it alone or with partners. And if you're going to have partners, you've got to have honorable actions toward those partners. So, we had the military capability to open up Bagram, let's open it. We have the ability to establish a perimeter around the airport that is safer, let's do it. Let's do what the French and the Germans are doing, going out and getting our people and cancel the 31 August deadline. There's no way in hell we can get everybody out by then. This just takes will, it's not a capability problem. It is a will problem.

And that's the sort of thing that really does hurt our credibility. And so over the weekend, John Ratcliffe, our former Director of National Intelligence and I got together and, and came up with a list of things that wouldn't cost much that would have had bipartisan support, and we've got to move out. We've got to first take care of the Americans to get them home, we need to salvage our credibility to the extent we can in Afghanistan, and then we've got to move out across the world to do some things to reestablish American leadership among our allies.

You could hear the anxiety, you could hear, you know, the experience that Nazira clearly has, and what is expected to happen. Although, I don't know that she described in depth in detail what will happen, what will Afghan women face and then I want to talk to you about what is going on in terms of the different tribes in Afghanistan. LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST, \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\": Well, this is a death sentence for Afghan women. Basically, for those who, you know, aren't executed or assassinated, for being policewomen or in the Army or working in the government, they will be subjected to a life of hell, without joy, without lights basically. Imagine everything that is dark. These people are forces of darkness. Their ideology is a force of true evil. And it is not supported by the vast majority of Muslims all over the world and in Afghanistan itself. Women are imprisoned in their own homes. They cannot leave without permission from a man. The burqa itself, I've worn a burqa, because I've lived in Afghanistan and it gives you an extraordinary headache. It's designed to only fit one size of head, and to be too small, because the pain is meant to be a reminder to every woman not to leave their house. They want to limit your ability to move outside. They're made of polyester anyway, and it's brutally, brutally uncomfortable in the heat and humidity over there. You have no rights. Most women are beaten in their homes. I've heard some of them describe how they've broken their wife's arm for leaving the house without permission, things like that. But no one can forget the images of women being executed in the stadium in Kabul. And you know, that clip that you have been showing, that young woman whose face is pressed up against the bars, who is screaming, \"The Taliban is coming,\" it's all she can say. And you can feel and hear the abject terror in her voice. And that's because these people rule with fear. They are absolutely brutal. And this is not some failed experiment in America. Millions of Afghans believe in having women in the workplace and having rights for women, and having freedom and a free press. And what the United States has done in turning its back on these people cannot be solved by just evacuating the Americans. You can't just abandon the Afghan people in this way on the world stage. Your moral authority is weakened and we're sort of accepting this false position that it's all done. There's nothing you can do and it's over. Just get your people out and then try and regain your credibility by putting a carrier somewhere in the in the Taiwan Straits. Give me a break. You need allies. That's how you protect yourself. You project power, walk softly, carry a big stick, and you actually stand by your allies. You don't just use them. Every American citizen everywhere in the world today is less safe because of this. Because why can't any of our allies say, you know what? We're done with you, United States. You didn't do what you promised and we've spent enough blood and treasure and by the way, we're handing you over to your enemies to slit your throats in the night, and good luck to you. We don't care. Is that the message?",

Everything you said it's true. But judge, I'm worried tonight that we're running our people from Taliban into the ISIS hands. It's almost the Jurassic Park of terrorism. People are together in a big wad right outside the airport. How easy would it be for an ISIS suicide bomber to blow up our troops and all the people trying to get out? We need to correct that and we need to correct now. We need to push the perimeter back at the airport. We need to open up Bagram Air Base to have another way to get out, and we need to cancel the 31 August deadline because we can't get our people out. The bottom line. This is an ill-conceived, disjointed, half ass effort to get American citizens and those who fought for us out of Afghanistan and the Intel failure in this whole debacle is Joe Biden himself. It's not the quality of the Intelligence, it is the quality the man receiving the Intel. He was wrong about Iraq. He was wrong about killing bin Laden. He's been wrong about everything. He got up in front of the world and said, \"Al-Qaeda is out of Afghanistan.\" I mean, good God, is the man brain dead? He also said the Taliban are waving people through the checkpoint, does he not have a television? This is just so disturbing. And he says our allies agree with what he's doing. Well, all of that is dead wrong and I'm worried about an ISIS attack at the airport that could kill thousands of people, including Americans who are sitting ducks. If we don't change this plan quickly, we are going to get a lot of people killed by ISIS, not the Taliban."

Tell the Taliban, we're going to fight to get our people out. If you want to fight, you'll have one, but we're going to stay until we get our people out. We're going to move the perimeter back at the Kabul Airport so we can have some organization, and we're going to cancel the 31 August deadline, and we're going to reopen Bagram Air Base. It is way out in the middle of nowhere. It's a great platform. And tell the Taliban, if you get in our way, we're going to crush you. The leverage we have is we are the United States of America, we are flat on our back, we're not back. I've never been more disappointed and disillusioned to be an American citizen as I am right now. We have a Commander-in-Chief who is completely incapable of putting the puzzle together, he's put all these people in harm's way. He has no idea of what he is doing. He was giving different options, he chose the most dangerous and dishonorable option available. He did that same damn thing in Iraq. He has been wrong about everything for 40 years, and this plan that we're trying to execute is going to get a lot of Americans killed and those who fought along our side, because ISIS is going to take advantage of the chaos at the airport.

I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan 57 times. I saw this coming a long time ago. Thank God, President Trump had a condition space withdrawal. I missed him tonight. But if you ask the military, would you risk your life to go back in Afghanistan to get our people out? They would say yes. We may lose some people to do this. But the one thing we will never lose if we do this right is our honor, and who the hell is going to fight with us in the future, if we're not willing to fight for these people now? Who's going to fight with us in the future? You can fight this war in our backyard or the enemy's backyard. I choose their backyard. You can fight it alone or with partners. And if you're going to have partners, you've got to have honorable actions toward those partners. So, we had the military capability to open up Bagram, let's open it. We have the ability to establish a perimeter around the airport that is safer, let's do it. Let's do what the French and the Germans are doing, going out and getting our people and cancel the 31 August deadline. There's no way in hell we can get everybody out by then. This just takes will, it's not a capability problem. It is a will problem.

They've already published an editorial, a psychological warfare aimed at the people of Taipei, in Taiwan, and they've said, this is your future, this is what's going to happen after we invade, the Americans are going to abandon you, and you're going to be surrendering to us very shortly. And that's the sort of thing that really does hurt our credibility. And so over the weekend, John Ratcliffe, our former Director of National Intelligence and I got together and, and came up with a list of things that wouldn't cost much that would have had bipartisan support, and we've got to move out. We've got to first take care of the Americans to get them home, we need to salvage our credibility to the extent we can in Afghanistan, and then we've got to move out across the world to do some things to reestablish American leadership among our allies. We are going to pay for this crisis for many, many years going forward."

And again, that's to send a message to our friends and allies in the Pacific -- the New Zealanders, the Australians, the Japanese, the Philippines, Thailand, Taiwan, that they're on the move, and that they are powerful, and that the U.S. is suffering and has suffered a massive defeat and should come over to the other side of the authoritarian. So, we need to do things like speeding up the delivery of weapons of that Taiwan has already bought from the United States. We need to get those weapons to Taiwan immediately. We need to go out and renegotiate our Compact of Free association with Palau and Micronesia, the Marshall Islands where we have access -- our military has access to vast swaths of the Pacific. We need to renegotiate that deal and get it done. We need to put a Coast Guard Cutter in American Samoa. People in the Democratic Party talked about caring about Pacific Islanders and Asian- Americans, and yet in Samoa where American Samoa, we have 50,000 Americans, they have no military presence out in the Pacific and they're being ravaged by illegal unreported and unregulated Chinese fishing. We need a Coast Guard Cutter to American Samoa.

We can't even get our people out. We're telling them but you know, go to the airport. And we've got this guy Milley -- the head of the Joint Chiefs, Milley and the Secretary of Defense Austin, and I understand that you were in a room when Trump was there and Trump as what would be the consequences of pulling out the troops.

But he also said I don't want a Saigon style retreat from Afghanistan. And he knew that and General Milley knew that and that was our policy. We wanted -- The President didn't want to leave any equipment behind in Afghanistan and we've had billions of dollars -- the taxpayers have paid billions dollars in this equipment that's been left behind. The Taliban is going to be one of the best equipped armies in the entire world, not just in the region but in the world. So yes, the President understood this. And keep in mind when President Trump left office, there were 2,500 Americans there, but more importantly, there were 5,000 NATO troops there. So we had two to one, for the first time in many, many years. President Trump, who negotiated with NATO and Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, to make sure that there were 5,000 NATO troops there as well. So Kabul was free. The situation was under control and, and we've got to get back to that situation at least long enough to evacuate the Americans and our friends and allies in in Kabul and the rest of Afghanistan.

You could hear the anxiety, you could hear, you know, the experience that Nazira clearly has, and what is expected to happen. Although, I don't know that she described in depth in detail what will happen, what will Afghan women face and then I want to talk to you about what is going on in terms of the different tribes in Afghanistan. LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST, \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\": Well, this is a death sentence for Afghan women. Basically, for those who, you know, aren't executed or assassinated, for being policewomen or in the Army or working in the government, they will be subjected to a life of hell, without joy, without lights basically. Imagine everything that is dark. These people are forces of darkness. Their ideology is a force of true evil. And it is not supported by the vast majority of Muslims all over the world and in Afghanistan itself. Women are imprisoned in their own homes. They cannot leave without permission from a man. The burqa itself, I've worn a burqa, because I've lived in Afghanistan and it gives you an extraordinary headache. It's designed to only fit one size of head, and to be too small, because the pain is meant to be a reminder to every woman not to leave their house. They want to limit your ability to move outside. They're made of polyester anyway, and it's brutally, brutally uncomfortable in the heat and humidity over there. You have no rights. Most women are beaten in their homes. I've heard some of them describe how they've broken their wife's arm for leaving the house without permission, things like that. But no one can forget the images of women being executed in the stadium in Kabul. And you know, that clip that you have been showing, that young woman whose face is pressed up against the bars, who is screaming, \"The Taliban is coming,\" it's all she can say. And you can feel and hear the abject terror in her voice. And that's because these people rule with fear. They are absolutely brutal. And this is not some failed experiment in America. Millions of Afghans believe in having women in the workplace and having rights for women, and having freedom and a free press. And what the United States has done in turning its back on these people cannot be solved by just evacuating the Americans. You can't just abandon the Afghan people in this way on the world stage. Your moral authority is weakened and we're sort of accepting this false position that it's all done. There's nothing you can do and it's over. Just get your people out and then try and regain your credibility by putting a carrier somewhere in the in the Taiwan Straits. Give me a break. You need allies. That's how you protect yourself. You project power, walk softly, carry a big stick, and you actually stand by your allies. You don't just use them. Every American citizen everywhere in the world today is less safe because of this. Because why can't any of our allies say, you know what? We're done with you, United States. You didn't do what you promised and we've spent enough blood and treasure and by the way, we're handing you over to your enemies to slit your throats in the night, and good luck to you.

Joey, thanks so much for being here tonight. You did a tour in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan and you lost both legs in Afghanistan. What has this week been like for you?"

      "utterance": "Yes, you know, my legs aren't a big deal. I recovered. I'm totally fine with that. It is the brothers I lost overseas. It's the brothers that I lost in Afghanistan that piss me off at this. We're not mad because of our sacrifice. We're mad because this man couldn't give us -- we risked life, limb, and eternal peace in this war and did so gladly. And this man in the White House couldn't give us the dignity of quitting with honor. He couldn't give us that much and that and that hurts. Listen, Google the name Danny Ridgeway, a Silver Star recipient, one of my best friends. I've got a guy upstairs right now in my home. He was a Green Beret and served honorably in Afghanistan, Africa, and South America. He's got bullet wounds he is recovering from today and he gets a text message as a veteran that they want him as a civilian to go into Afghanistan with nonprofit organizations and rescue people because our President won't let our military do it. That's the situation we're in. The idea that veterans -- a veteran sitting in my home with bullet holes in him may be the one that goes and save these people because our President won't let our military do it. This is unconscionable."

      "utterance": "Well, you know, what we heard from the N.S.A., the head of the N.S.A., O'Brien who was on earlier said that he was in the room when Mark Milley was told by all the experts that if we left early without having a plan for our people to get out that it would be a catastrophe. So Milley knew, Biden knew. They all knew. Why are they doing this to us, to American families, to us on the world stage, to our Afghan partners? Why?"

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Because it's a game of optics and politics. I'll tell you one thing, there's been four Presidents preside over this war. Joe Biden is the only one that did not inherit this war. You could argue that George Bush inherited Bill Clinton's mistakes in letting this happen to begin with. But Joe Biden was Vice President, he gave this war as Vice President to Donald Trump. So, for him to walk up there and tell the American people in a straight face that somehow this is something he inherited. That's just a lie. Listen, I don't have any love loss for any President. I don't get to be partisan when I'm pleading for the lives and dignity of my fellow brothers and sisters that are there now today. This isn't about partisanship. Listen, President Trump sat across the table with his administration with the Taliban and that was a bad look and probably a pipe dream. But the idea was give the Taliban a voice within Afghanistan, and maybe they won't terrorize it. President Biden turned that into give Afghanistan to the Taliban, and maybe I'll get this done before the midterms, so I can run for re-election without it being a current issue and that's despicable."
