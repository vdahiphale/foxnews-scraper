We will take you there as more becomes available. More questions, meanwhile, this morning about President Biden's foreign policy agenda, after his surprise announcement on Thursday that the United States will withdraw troops from Afghanistan on August 31, instead of September 11. Joining me right now is former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, also a FOX News contributor. Secretary, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here. We're waiting on this launch out of the -- Afghanistan. We're looking at the pictures of the Afghanistan base, while we await the launch of the Virgin Galactic. Your thoughts on all of this? I know that you and President Trump created the first space team, the first new military arm since 1947.",

That's all good stuff. The really important things that are happening in space are about American national security.

We worked diligently to do that. We went from 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 down to just a fraction of that. But, importantly, we had a diplomatic mission there. And that diplomatic mission was to make sure that America was never attacked from Afghanistan again. And so that was the work. I met many times with Mullah Baradar and his team of the Taliban trying to convince them the right path forward. To move this date around is an odd thing, it seems to me. Maybe it's just they moved out faster. That's all fine. But the devil is in the details. You have to get this right. You have to have the intelligence capabilities. President Trump made clear. He spoke with the Taliban a couple times as well. He made clear to them, if you kill an American, there will be an enormous cost. We will do whatever it takes. We will come back in with the forces we need to come back in with. And it was clear. From the moment we began our conversations with the Taliban in a serious way, we didn't have a single American killed. Indeed, there was only a single attack on an American. It looks like it was a rogue actor. We had the policy right. It's one thing to get out. It's how you do it, how you execute it, and how you implement our global counterterrorism mission in the aftermath of that departure that will make all the difference in whether this ends up being something that President Biden can say, yes, he did it well.",

It was ultimately his decision, as the leader, to begin this march towards having fewer and fewer troops there in Afghanistan. It's all about how you execute it. Your point about the Chinese is well-taken. Frankly, we provided security for the Chinese for 20 years. Today, there's fewer than 200 Al Qaeda there. That benefits the Chinese enormously. Their interests in Afghanistan are commercial. They're loath to commit their own troops, I expect. And so Afghanistan needs to begin to stand up on its own. I saw some clips last night of fighting-age males who are saying, it's really unsafe, I need to get out. When I see that, Maria, the Afghan people need to decide their nation is worth fighting for and making the case. They need to create a political system and political institutions. You have got Afghan leaders with beautiful homes all over the Middle East, in Europe. There's corruption everywhere. It's time for the Afghan people to do the hard work, the heavy lifting, and demand that they push back against the Taliban, not just militarily, but politically, exercise their own rights, secure their own freedom. We have provided all the resources the Afghan National Security Forces could possibly ever have dreamed of and all the training over two decades. It's time to come back. And it's time to make sure that we do this right with few American troops and making sure that we're never attacked from this place again.",

After 50 years of the idea of constructive engagement, that we could just sell some more trinkets or manage some Chinese wealth or allow them to come operate here inside America, that they would get political freedoms, it's just failed. The Trump administration turned this around. We began to protect American jobs and create American technology and military force posture in a way that would push back against the very language you saw from Xi Jinping. He is serious about this. We shouldn't take that as bluster. The Chinese Communist Party presents the single greatest threat to the United States of America from external forces, bar none. And we need to mount a sustained, serious campaign to push back against them. This is doable. We have done it with the Soviet Union. We know exactly how to build coalitions around the world. We did it with the Indians, with the Japanese, with the Australians, our good friends and allies. We were beginning to put together a coalition to protect the West. We don't want to live in a world dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. And when you hear Xi Jinping make threats like that, threats to the people on Taiwan, this requires resolve, strength, deterrence from America. And American leadership has to be there.

The freedom fighters are now in jail. Just this week, communist China seized control of Britain's largest microchip factory. And they also -- the Biden administration announced that more companies will be added to the blacklist over the Xinjiang disaster, where they have Uyghurs locked up. And yet a lot of people are questioning that blacklist, because while he's putting some companies on the blacklist, the companies that are actually doing anything and the subsidiaries of those companies are not on that list.

The moves that you described there this past week are serious, where there were -- there was actions that we saw disclosed about how they're continuing to cover up for the virus as well. We have seen the work they're doing with genetics. They're doing testing on mothers who are pregnant. They're collecting their DNA samples. This is a machine. This is a machine that is intent on dominating the world in technology and commerce and militarily. The responses have to be equally serious. I saw the blacklist that you're referring to. It's pretty technical. It's hard to tell exactly what's in it and what's not. But, in the end, if it doesn't impact a Chinese Communist Party company, if it doesn't impact their capacity to put Americans at risk, then putting their name on a piece of paper is not of any value. They need to do more. The administration needs to do more than just respond to the genocide that we declared. They need to begin to confront them in a serious way and impose real costs on a Communist Party that celebrated its 100th anniversary. And if they're able to celebrate their 200th anniversary, we will live in a very, very different world.",

We have the greatest facilities. And I reopened them, because they were -- as I told you, they were dead. They were closed, or essentially closed, for the most part. So, I said, hey, look, if Elon wants to send up a rocket, let him do it. We will get charge him some rent. Let him do it. Let these guys do it. And we're seeing advancement now that I don't believe we would have ever seen had we done it the way -- the old-fashioned way, which we're also using. We're planning on Mars, to go to Mars.

The collusion was, frankly, between the Democrats and Russia. And, frankly, it's too bad, when you look at what happens. They use -- they have weaponized this. They have weaponized so many different things. They have weaponized the IRS. They have weaponized things against Republicans, and Republicans haven't done it to them. And what it leads to is, it'll be a big attack the other way also, I guess. Look, how much can Republicans stand? What they are doing, where Hunter Biden gets a billion-and-a-half from China to manage, he gets all of this money from Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to sit on an energy board -- he never had anything to do with energy. He knows nothing. The great one is $3.5 million from Russia from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. What was that? I mentioned that in debate. Your friend -- your friend Chris Wallace would not let me ask that question. He said, that's irrelevant. Well, it's not irrelevant. But the beauty of them all is, he's going to get a half-a-million dollars a painting. And he never painted before. He's not an artist. He's never painted. This is just the payoff. And, already, they're trying to say, well, isn't it lovely? He's a painter. There is such a difference, such an incredible difference. I was president. I took no salary. It cost me a lot of money being president. And I always knew it would. But all of those things that they have done -- and the whole deal is very simple.

So you have private companies using the First Amendment as not a shield to protect the marketplace of ideas, but as a sword to close the marketplace of ideas. I anticipated this problem six months ago. And I wrote another book called \"The New Censorship, \" the case against the new censorship. What's the new censorship? The old censorship was the government suppressing free speech. That was easy to defeat. I won the Pentagon Papers case, the Chicago Seven case, the Hair case, all of the cases involving the old censorship. The new censorship is when private companies that have the benefit of Section 230 use their power, their monopoly power, their duopoly power, their triopoly power to try to close the marketplace of ideas to different ideas. So, this is an important case. It was a very important case to see how the Supreme Court will resolve the conflict between using the First Amendment to suppress speech and free speech itself. Justice Thomas has already indicated that he might well regard these giant companies in a way that permits regulation. And so we will see if there are other justices as well. But what no one can deny is, this is an important matter in America, big companies using the First Amendment to suppress free speech. And the radicals on the left who say this is not an important case simply don't know what they're talking about.",

      "utterance": "Well, Maria, you hit it on the head. Our mission was twofold. The president gave me a bite -- two pieces of the puzzle. One was to get our kids home. It's the right thing to do. We worked diligently to do that. We went from 10,000, 12,000, 14,000 down to just a fraction of that. But, importantly, we had a diplomatic mission there. And that diplomatic mission was to make sure that America was never attacked from Afghanistan again. And so that was the work. I met many times with Mullah Baradar and his team of the Taliban trying to convince them the right path forward. To move this date around is an odd thing, it seems to me. Maybe it's just they moved out faster. That's all fine. But the devil is in the details. You have to get this right. You have to have the intelligence capabilities. President Trump made clear. He spoke with the Taliban a couple times as well. He made clear to them, if you kill an American, there will be an enormous cost. We will do whatever it takes. We will come back in with the forces we need to come back in with. And it was clear. From the moment we began our conversations with the Taliban in a serious way, we didn't have a single American killed. Indeed, there was only a single attack on an American. It looks like it was a rogue actor. We had the policy right. It's one thing to get out. It's how you do it, how you execute it, and how you implement our global counterterrorism mission in the aftermath of that departure that will make all the difference in whether this ends up being something that President Biden can say, yes, he did it well."

      "speaker": "POMPEO",

It was ultimately his decision, as the leader, to begin this march towards having fewer and fewer troops there in Afghanistan. It's all about how you execute it. Your point about the Chinese is well-taken. Frankly, we provided security for the Chinese for 20 years. Today, there's fewer than 200 Al Qaeda there. That benefits the Chinese enormously. Their interests in Afghanistan are commercial. They're loath to commit their own troops, I expect. And so Afghanistan needs to begin to stand up on its own. I saw some clips last night of fighting-age males who are saying, it's really unsafe, I need to get out. When I see that, Maria, the Afghan people need to decide their nation is worth fighting for and making the case. They need to create a political system and political institutions. You have got Afghan leaders with beautiful homes all over the Middle East, in Europe. There's corruption everywhere. It's time for the Afghan people to do the hard work, the heavy lifting, and demand that they push back against the Taliban, not just militarily, but politically, exercise their own rights, secure their own freedom. We have provided all the resources the Afghan National Security Forces could possibly ever have dreamed of and all the training over two decades. It's time to come back. And it's time to make sure that we do this right with few American troops and making sure that we're never attacked from this place again."

And Xi Jinping said that China's enemies will have their heads cracked and bleeding in any future conflict. And he vowed to take Taiwan back.

After 50 years of the idea of constructive engagement, that we could just sell some more trinkets or manage some Chinese wealth or allow them to come operate here inside America, that they would get political freedoms, it's just failed. The Trump administration turned this around. We began to protect American jobs and create American technology and military force posture in a way that would push back against the very language you saw from Xi Jinping. He is serious about this. We shouldn't take that as bluster. The Chinese Communist Party presents the single greatest threat to the United States of America from external forces, bar none. And we need to mount a sustained, serious campaign to push back against them. This is doable. We have done it with the Soviet Union. We know exactly how to build coalitions around the world. We did it with the Indians, with the Japanese, with the Australians, our good friends and allies. We were beginning to put together a coalition to protect the West. We don't want to live in a world dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. And when you hear Xi Jinping make threats like that, threats to the people on Taiwan, this requires resolve, strength, deterrence from America. And American leadership has to be there. And I hope President Biden will take that up."

The freedom fighters are now in jail. Just this week, communist China seized control of Britain's largest microchip factory. And they also -- the Biden administration announced that more companies will be added to the blacklist over the Xinjiang disaster, where they have Uyghurs locked up. And yet a lot of people are questioning that blacklist, because while he's putting some companies on the blacklist, the companies that are actually doing anything and the subsidiaries of those companies are not on that list. What do you make of these moves this week from the CCP?"

The moves that you described there this past week are serious, where there were -- there was actions that we saw disclosed about how they're continuing to cover up for the virus as well. We have seen the work they're doing with genetics. They're doing testing on mothers who are pregnant. They're collecting their DNA samples. This is a machine. This is a machine that is intent on dominating the world in technology and commerce and militarily. The responses have to be equally serious. I saw the blacklist that you're referring to. It's pretty technical. It's hard to tell exactly what's in it and what's not. But, in the end, if it doesn't impact a Chinese Communist Party company, if it doesn't impact their capacity to put Americans at risk, then putting their name on a piece of paper is not of any value. They need to do more. The administration needs to do more than just respond to the genocide that we declared. They need to begin to confront them in a serious way and impose real costs on a Communist Party that celebrated its 100th anniversary. And if they're able to celebrate their 200th anniversary, we will live in a very, very different world."

We have brand-new apprehension numbers for the month of June from our source, Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council. Here are the unofficial numbers. They will probably go higher, because this is just up until today. June border encounters nationwide, 174,000 in the month of June, 39,000- plus got-aways. In other words, those people were seen on surveillance. They got away. We have no idea what their intentions are. They are now in America. according to Brandon, these people are going everywhere, Little Rock, Charlotte, Des Moines, and New York City, and Miami both major hot spots for got-aways, Tucson, Arizona, also a real hot spot for got-aways. Joining me right now is Congressman Lee Zeldin. He's a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He's also running for governor of New York right now. And good morning to you, Congressman. Your reaction to these new numbers, as we expect some of them to go to New York? What can you tell us?"

We should be funding Department of Homeland Security and ICE and Customs and Border Patrol. We should be strengthening our borders, enforcing our rule of law. And we talk about people who come across our border, but, as you look at those numbers, we also have to take account for the things that come across, the drug trafficking, the arms trafficking, the story behind these numbers. Oftentimes, we're talking about labor trafficking and sex trafficking as well. So it's important for those in government to provide all the resources to law enforcement to do their jobs safely, effectively, because this is not just something that crosses a border, but it's something that quickly spreads to cities and communities all across our country."

It's not about me. It's about everybody. And people are joining left and right. They're joining at a level that nobody -- I guess they -- I could say this on your show. It's takeonbigtech.com, takeonbigtech.com. And they're joining like -- like, I don't know, I guess probably most of these class actions have never seen before. And what it is, is, they're taking away your freedom of speech. They are taking away your right to speak. They're taking away everything. And they get powers. They have a Section 230, it's called, and that gives them immunity. That gives them protection. But once they have that, they no longer have that kind of a power where you can't go after it. This is a private company. Well, now they're not private companies. They're getting the biggest subsidy. And you can call it that. They're getting the biggest subsidy that any company has ever gotten from a government. I mean, they -- they're immune from so many different things. But they're not immune from this lawsuit, because what they have done is such a violation of the Constitution, a violation like we have never seen before. You look at -- they take me down. They take all conservative voices down, or most of them. If they find them, they take them down. It's a disgrace."

In other words, they are working as agents of the government. We do have information and evidence to show that there was a real conversation going on between Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, during the pandemic. They did censor key information. We had Dr. Kory and Senator Ron Johnson last week to discuss ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, which may very well have been very important treatments for COVID-19. And yet social media censored them. So, tell me about that, because you have got social media working hand in glove with the Democrat Party. Is that what gives you the opening to sue these companies, even though they do have that 230 immunity?"

They work with the Democrats. It's a Democrat machine. It should be a campaign contribution, the largest ever made. And even on the election, how they helped rig the election, the 2020 presidential election, they have lockboxes all over the place. They bring them in late. They bring them in whenever they want. The boxes are open. Trump has some -- in some cases, virtually no votes within the boxes, like we got no votes. We got 12 million more votes than I got the first time. And they have a lockbox. And people are looking at that left and right. By the way, the investigation going on right now from different states is massive concerning the rigged election of 2020. It was a disgrace. But a big part of that rigging was done by these companies, these very companies that we're suing, on different grounds and on other grounds."

That includes the Russia hoax, the phony dossier, impeachment with no crime, Hunter Biden's laptop, business deals, the origins and treatment of COVID-19, voting laws in 14 states are Jim Crow. And, of course, they call the armed insurrection -- they called it an armed insurrection, and yet no guns were seized, all of this misinformation to the public. And yet Twitter has restricted the account of a Chinese scholar who dared to mock Xi Jinping. Also, Twitter allows The Global Times, which is Chinese Communist Party propaganda, to come out with a story the other day and recommend that the CCP bomb Australia. How is it possible that these companies that have enriched themselves because of the liberty and freedoms of America to go on and cancel a former president, a sitting president at the time, and allow propaganda from the CCP to run wild and Iranians run wild on Twitter? I don't understand what this motivation is."

But a president of the United States that has a following like nobody's seen before, we're not allowed to do that. And so we have to use other methods, until this lawsuit is -- it's going to wind its way through the courts. I think it's going to be very successful.

Georgia was so corrupt. It was so incredibly corrupt. Frankly, nobody's seen anything like it. And you have a secretary of state, you have a governor that does nothing about it. And they have to get on the ball. But that -- 35,000 votes was -- and this is just one category. If you look at what's going on in Arizona, Arizona has been incredible. The state senators in Arizona have taken it to heart. They're doing an audit, a forensic audit, like you haven't seen really in this country. They're going to be announcing the results. That's done by them. It's not done by me. These are great patriots. They're going to be announcing the results of that audit, Maria, I hear, over the next two or three weeks. And I would imagine it would be horrendous. But we will see. Maybe it'll be wonderful. But we're going to see. It's a very big deal. And this is, again, done by the Senate, the state Senate of a state that looked and they watched, and they saw, wow, we're being scammed. Take a look at Pennsylvania. They're now starting an audit. So many areas. In New Hampshire, they found horrible things in New Hampshire with respect to voting. And we're talking about all determinative. The word is determinative, in other words, things that would overturn. I'm not saying, if you lost by 10,000 votes, and you found three votes of dead people as an example. No, I'm talking about many times the 10,000 votes necessary. We won this election in a landslide. We got 12 million more votes, Maria..."

I think that you have -- I think it's going to be 41 states are looking at it very strongly, because they saw the travesty of the 2020 election. And we can't have that, where a large percentage of our population and 78 percent of the Republican Party thinks the election was rigged and stolen. We can't have that as a country. We were known for great elections, for honest elections. These elections were so corrupt with the mail-in ballots, and by the thousands, and people getting three, four and five mail-in ballots, just like in New York. Look what happened in New York. And look what happened previously in New York with a congressional race. They never had any idea who won that race. So, this was a terrible blot on our country and our country's history and our country as a free and fair place. This -- you can't allow this to happen.

And it was a very mild-mannered speech, as I think has been -- in fact, they just came out with a report in Congress, and they didn't mention my name, literally. But what they were complaining about and the reason, in my opinion, you had over a million people there, which the press doesn't like to report at all, because it shows too much -- too much activity, too much -- too much spirit and faith and love. There was such love at that rally. You had over a million people there. They were there for one reason, the rigged election. They felt the election was rigged. That's why they were there.

And look at Minnesota. Look what they did in Seattle. They're not paying a price. In New York, they released 400 people who practically burned down Fifth Avenue and burned down our stores and killed people. And they're all released. They were released. Don't worry about it. We -- you just leave. It was just announced. And yet you have people with no guns that walked down.

We had a corrupt election. We had a rigged election. We had a stolen election. And that's why you had over a million people march to Washington."

I want to point out that, in 2019, you created the first Space Force. This was pretty extraordinary. When you first announced it, you were mocked, of course, by the mainstream media. What do you say as you watch this historic moment, with Richard Branson going into space? You said at the time space is the world's newest warfighting domain, when you created that U.S. armed services unit, a sixth branch of the U.S. armed services, and the first new military service since the Air Force was created in 1947, sir."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "So, we're very proud of that. It was close to 75 years. It was the Air Force. And now we did Space Force, which is going to be so vital. And we not only did it. I mean, it's up and running and really great. And, as you know, Biden wanted to cancel it. And he was hit so hard that he said, well, we won't cancel it, because this is what we need. Russia has it. And China has it. And they were way advanced over us. And I got it started. The other thing I did is, I opened up NASA again. That was closed. There was grass growing in the cracks of the runway. They were all broken-up runways. There was grass growing through those cracks. And now it's a vibrant, incredible place, which it has to be if we're going to go forward. So, I'm very proud of NASA. And I'm very -- because that was a closed, dead deal. And I'm very, very proud of the Space Force."

And that's Jeff Bezos. Jeff Bezos stepping down as CEO of Amazon recently to focus on these things. Your thoughts on why this is so important to some of these big billionaires, who, of course, have their hands in every other business. Amazon is everything from cloud computing to delivery, to -- of course, Bezos also owning The Washington Post."

These guys want to come in with billions of dollars. Let's lease them facilities, because, you know, you need certain facilities to send up rockets, and we have those facilities. We have the greatest facilities. And I reopened them, because they were -- as I told you, they were dead. They were closed, or essentially closed, for the most part. So, I said, hey, look, if Elon wants to send up a rocket, let him do it. We will get charge him some rent. Let him do it. Let these guys do it. And we're seeing advancement now that I don't believe we would have ever seen had we done it the way -- the old-fashioned way, which we're also using. We're planning on Mars, to go to Mars. You land on the moon, and then you have your pad going to Mars. And all of that's being worked on. And it's very exciting. And a lot of good things are happening. But we also need it for military and for military protection. So, we're doing it for that. I mean, to me, that might be number one, because, when you look at what China is doing, when you look at what Russia is doing. And now, because of what I did, we are leading the pack in space by far."

And we, of course, will be reporting on this all day. Mr. President, let me turn now to that double standard that you mentioned a moment ago. Of course, we are watching the news from the Trump Organization and your CFO indicted. Of course, we also see the elements around Hunter Biden doing this new business on selling art, and we're not allowed to know who is buying that art. We don't know if it's a Chinese company tied to the Chinese Communist Party, if it's a Ukrainian company, after he was on the board. And yet your family is under pressure. There are stories this weekend that, given the indictment of the CFO, perhaps your children are also being fingered. What can you tell us about the current state of affairs, sir?"

      "utterance": "I think it's a shame. I think it's a horrible thing that's happening in our country. I have been under investigation since the day I came down the escalator. Between Russia, Russia, and Mueller, and all of these different things I have been under heavy. And they failed totally, no collusion. There was never any collusion. There was never any conversation. The collusion was, frankly, between the Democrats and Russia. And, frankly, it's too bad, when you look at what happens. They use -- they have weaponized this. They have weaponized so many different things. They have weaponized the IRS. They have weaponized things against Republicans, and Republicans haven't done it to them. And what it leads to is, it'll be a big attack the other way also, I guess. Look, how much can Republicans stand? What they are doing, where Hunter Biden gets a billion-and-a-half from China to manage, he gets all of this money from Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to sit on an energy board -- he never had anything to do with energy. He knows nothing. The great one is $3.5 million from Russia from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. What was that? I mentioned that in debate. Your friend -- your friend Chris Wallace would not let me ask that question. He said, that's irrelevant. Well, it's not irrelevant. But the beauty of them all is, he's going to get a half-a-million dollars a painting. And he never painted before. He's not an artist. He's never painted. This is just the payoff. And, already, they're trying to say, well, isn't it lovely? He's a painter. There is such a difference, such an incredible difference. I was president. I took no salary. It cost me a lot of money being president. And I always knew it would. But all of those things that they have done -- and the whole deal is very simple. I got 75 million votes, the most of any sitting president. Polls today show me way ahead of everybody, not only Republicans, against any Democrat."

Joining me right now with reaction to what we just heard from President Trump are constitutional scholar Alan Dershowitz, the author of \"Cancel Culture: The Latest Attack on Free Speech and Due Process.\" Also here is Charlie Kirk, the president and founder of Turning Point USA. Gentlemen, it is a pleasure to see you. Alan, kicking it off with you, let me get your thoughts on the merits of President Trump's case against big tech."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's always uphill to try to sue private companies. But here you have private companies that are trying to suppress freedom of speech. So you have private companies using the First Amendment as not a shield to protect the marketplace of ideas, but as a sword to close the marketplace of ideas. I anticipated this problem six months ago. And I wrote another book called \"The New Censorship, \" the case against the new censorship. What's the new censorship? The old censorship was the government suppressing free speech. That was easy to defeat. I won the Pentagon Papers case, the Chicago Seven case, the Hair case, all of the cases involving the old censorship. The new censorship is when private companies that have the benefit of Section 230 use their power, their monopoly power, their duopoly power, their triopoly power to try to close the marketplace of ideas to different ideas. So, this is an important case. It was a very important case to see how the Supreme Court will resolve the conflict between using the First Amendment to suppress speech and free speech itself. Justice Thomas has already indicated that he might well regard these giant companies in a way that permits regulation. And so we will see if there are other justices as well. But what no one can deny is, this is an important matter in America, big companies using the First Amendment to suppress free speech. And the radicals on the left who say this is not an important case simply don't know what they're talking about."

And we have been saying for quite a while that if we do not have the ability to speak online, then many of the promises of the First Amendment and our government's promise to protect our right to speech are completely invalidated. We have a parallel government in Menlo Park, California, and it's time that we start to hold them accountable."

      "utterance": "Yes, we're still in the allegedly phase, but, according to RealClearPolitics and RealClearInvestigations, it looks that -- it looks like it's -- we're pretty certain to believe that it's a man by the name of Lieutenant Byrd, Michael Byrd. And there's more information that's going to come out around this, I think, in the coming weeks and months. But isn't it interesting, Maria, about every single one of these nationalized and politicized tragic police incidents, almost within days, we know the police officer involved, we have body camera footage, we know the history behind it. And all the activist groups call for the resignation of that person, and possibly even charges around that person. And, here, you have an unarmed veteran that went into the Capitol and got fatally shot. And a lot of people talk about January 6 as saying that it was a tragic day where people died. The only death that we know of that day where someone was murdered was the death of Ashli Babbitt. It is time that we get answers from our government. And the fact that they are remaining silent on this is very, very suspicious. And if Nancy Pelosi is actually serious about finding the truth of January 6, why doesn't she find the truth of the one murder that we know that happened of an unarmed veteran that went into the Capitol?"

The investigative work from RealClearPolitics is very convincing. And the fact that the government is not flat out denying it and they're almost avoiding the question goes to show that it's all but certain that it is this person. We're going to wait until we're 100 percent sure. But, again, we need to get an answer of who killed Ashli Babbitt, an unarmed veteran who went into our Capitol Building and was murdered by her own government."
