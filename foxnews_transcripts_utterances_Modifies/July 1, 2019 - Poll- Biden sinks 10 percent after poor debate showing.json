A new poll reveals just how badly Joe Biden bombed the first Democratic debate. So, is the 2020 primary suddenly wide open. Plus, AOC visits the border and lob some outrageous claims against the Border Patrol Agents. One of those agents Hector Garza is here to respond. And shocking video of Antifa thugs attacking and robbing a journalist. But where were the police. Dinesh D'Souza is here. Also, a growing number of women are deciding not to have children because of climate change. And we're going to have a spirited debate coming up.  But first, new numbers tonight reveal the impact of Joe Biden's dismal performance at the first Democratic debate. As Laura highlighted Friday night, the former VP seemed unprepared and even worse week. And now a new CNN poll conducted after the debate shows Biden's lead over the competition is shrinking. Uncle Joe still tops the list with 22 percent but coming in at number two is his debate sparring partner Kamala Harris with 17 percent followed by Liz Warren in third with 15, Bernie Sanders comes in fourth with Round 14 and Mayor Pete rounds out the top five with just four. Fox's David Spunt is live in Washington tonight with the story. David.",

Now with Sanders and Biden taking hits on their poll numbers, the Democratic nomination many are saying is now more wide open than ever. Both senators, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have seen a large uptick in fundraising since last week's debate. The Harris campaign says, they raked in $2 million in the first 24 hours following Thursday night's debate. Also, today, we learned that Pete Buttigieg took in just under $25 million in the second quarter. Biden has been a fund-raising machine from the moment he announced. And Harris directly singled him out Thursday criticizing his stance on school busing. Here's a portion of their interaction.",

And that does not resonate well with many black people. But there are others who don't like the way that Senator Kamala Harris is dealing with - dealt with people - locking up people in California when she was the Attorney General of the DA. So, everybody has little things going on that they have to overcome. But I still would not count Joe Biden out. However, don't underestimate Kamala Harris.

GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, NORTH KOREA TAKES ON THE WORLD\":  One of the important things of this meeting yesterday was who was not there. The Chinese were not there. China has always tried to interfere in issues involving North Korea because they think they own the place. What Trump has done, and this is different from his predecessors, he's tried to get the Chinese away from them, because they've been a malign influence. And Jesse, the other thing that Trump has done, he's gone after the Iranians. The Iranians supposedly pay the North Koreans somewhere between $2.5 billion to $3 billion a year for nuke and missile cooperation and some other stuff. That's 10 percent of North Korea's gross domestic product.  If Trump can defang the Iranians, which he's in the process of doing, he goes a long way to defanging the North Koreans.",

He was the Titanic that could not be sunk and then he ran into these icebergs called Harris, Kamala Harris and I mean Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris. These two actually did a great deal of damage to him and that I don't think he can recover from. I think it will sink him. You know I don't know what he could do at this point in time frankly to change what's going to be I think the outcome. Maybe tomorrow he says he's going to transition to a woman better yet maybe a black woman, maybe even better half black half Pacific Islander or something like that because you know there is really little of anything he can do."

So, let me just be very clear. Joe Biden did make that decision. He did say that he charmed around and was very nice with people who were segregationists. And that does not resonate well with many black people. But there are others who don't like the way that Senator Kamala Harris is dealing with - dealt with people - locking up people in California when she was the Attorney General of the DA. So, everybody has little things going on that they have to overcome. But I still would not count Joe Biden out. However, don't underestimate Kamala Harris. I think she has the gravitas to take it all the way to the top. I think she could be sitting in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue because she is really relentless, and she is more than just a debater.

This is probably why the party and most of those who are elected in Congress in these general sems are white men, old white men, old white men 70, 65, 70 and 80 years old.

But National Security Adviser John Bolton, who notably was not there for this meeting at the DMZ, says the report is flat out false.

Neither the National Security Council staff nor I have discussed or heard of any desire to settle for a nuclear freeze by North Korea.

GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, NORTH KOREA TAKES ON THE WORLD\":  One of the important things of this meeting yesterday was who was not there. The Chinese were not there. China has always tried to interfere in issues involving North Korea because they think they own the place. What Trump has done, and this is different from his predecessors, he's tried to get the Chinese away from them, because they've been a malign influence. And Jesse, the other thing that Trump has done, he's gone after the Iranians. The Iranians supposedly pay the North Koreans somewhere between $2.5 billion to $3 billion a year for nuke and missile cooperation and some other stuff. That's 10 percent of North Korea's gross domestic product.  If Trump can defang the Iranians, which he's in the process of doing, he goes a long way to defanging the North Koreans."

He is going to have to negotiate with him one-on-one. We're going to have these working level meetings and they'll hash out a lot of the details.

It's also going to need a firm timetable for disarmament. We get those, then we can start to detail things like sanctions and the rest of it that Kim wants. It's going to be a very difficult conversation.

      "utterance": "I don't think that was the reason they said they weren't going to have babies. They said they are not going to to have children, they're choosing not to, they're going to have a birth strike until this planet is not dying. And they have formed a group, and there are others who think like them. So likeminded parents, women and men, people do not want to have children until this planet gets cleaned up."

But until politicians take it seriously, all of the world leaders, I think they're announcing to President Trump, that they will not have children."

The next green Einstein that is going to save the planet. Why deny some brilliant kid the opportunity to make a solar airplane or something like that?"

We don't have to worry about more crazy being produced and entering into the world. I think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also pointed out concern over this. Fully endorse maybe her considering not having children as well. So all about this. But I think what a tragedy --"

They said we'd all be walking around with gas masks and half the fish would be gone. Manhattan would be underwater, and it was going to be all over. And did any of that happen?  No. So why should we believe them now?"

      "utterance": "Hold on, Cathy. The United States has been leading the world in reducing emissions. And the reason we've been able to do it is through natural gas. And the irony of it is the Democrats want to take us to things like the New Green Deal, which would move us completely away from fossil fuels into renewables which would eliminate the reason why we're leading the world in reducing emissions. So the Green New Deal as an idea doesn't make sense and it would take us further away from the reason why we've been leading the world on this very issue."
