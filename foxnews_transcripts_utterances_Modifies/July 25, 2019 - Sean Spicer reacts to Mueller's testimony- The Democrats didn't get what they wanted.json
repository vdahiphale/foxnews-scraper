Here's the problem, though. A lot of Republicans are the ones balking, saying, we're spending ourselves into oblivion. And a lot of them are pointing the finger at the president.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"  And it's all about the debt and getting something done, so, for the next two years, we don't have to worry about it, minus that little minor issue of driving trillions of dollars more into red ink over that same period of time. To Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill on where this thing stands right now -- Chad.",

      "sentences": "Well, in about 45 minutes, they will start this roll call vote to approve the budget caps deal and also suspend the debt ceiling until July of 2021. And you're right. There's not going to be a lot of Republicans who vote for this. Democrats are going to carry the freight. Listen to this comment from Mike Johnson. He's a Republican congressman from Louisiana. He chairs the Republican Study Committee, which is the largest bloc of conservatives in the House.  He says -- quote -- \"Our nation is more than $22 trillion in debt, and simply cannot afford reckless measures like this one.\"   We would expect the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and the whip, Steve Scalise, to vote for that bill later this afternoon. But look at the lower-tier members of the Republican leadership team. We think there's going to be a lot of people who jump off there. The reason that they have to raise the debt ceiling early is that Congress is going to go on recess here, the House, specifically tomorrow. And one of the reasons that Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, was appealing to deal with the debt ceiling now is saying they might hit this sometime in August or September. Now, I challenged Kevin McCarthy this morning about the tax bill, because that's one of the reasons why federal revenues are lower right now. He disagreed with my premise as to why they have to raise the debt ceiling on that issue so fast, because he thinks the tax bill has been -- has been pretty good.   But that's an issue. That's one of the reasons why revenues are down. Now, here's the dirty secret about this bill, Neil. This doesn't fund the government. All this does is establish a level, a spending cap level for the next two years to help them deal with appropriations bills. Those will come up in September for this fiscal year. That's where you're firing with live ammo. And Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, said this yesterday: \"This doesn't mean that everything will be hunky-dory in September.\"  You can see where there could be fights over funding the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, a wall, all of that in September -- Neil.",

So, we are looking at the best jobs market in 50 years, more than five million jobs added so far under the Trump administration, with more than a year now with the jobless rates under 4 percent, and manufacturing jobs are being brought back to the U.S., more than half-a-million being created so far in the past two-and-a-half years, and the best year for manufacturing jobs in 2018 in two decades. And that's probably why American voters are feeling the most confidence that they have felt about the U.S. economy in close to 20 years, according to our latest FOX polling.  So what are they going to do about the economy at the ballot box in 2020? Well, according to this, it's very interesting. They actually think that it's a tie between Trump or the Democrats. But in terms of who's going to handle it better afterwards, they actually give the check to Democrats, believe it or not.  And our analysis of the FOX voter poll suggests that maybe border security, health care and immigration are the net negative contributors as to why President Trump's approval rating is still below 50 percent, close to 46 percent at this point. But let's take a look at the markets, because we did hit another record high this week. We were down today because of European growth concerns. But, so far, it's been a great earnings season. We have corporations making a ton of money still.   Of the third that have reported earnings so far, three-quarters have beaten. And that's pretty good, since a lot of people were talking about an earnings recession. Now, in terms of the main stock drag today, it was Boeing once again. And it's because Southwest Airlines that says that they will not be able to fly the aircraft until January next year, and they're also losing money. And that's why they're shutting down their Newark, New York operations and consolidate at La Guardia instead -- Neil, back to you.",

Let's ask Melissa Armo with The Stock Swoosh. We have Democratic strategist Max Burns, and last, but not least, Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour.

But also I think that people don't like some personality aspects of President Trump. He's kind of, this is who he is, and you either love it or you don't love it. And that's the kind of thing.   But I think at the end of the day, I do think Trump's going to win reelection, but it's never over until the fat lady sings. And Hillary, we thought she was going to win.

These were short-range missiles, as Jennifer indicated. And what I would take away from this is that Kim is still showing a willingness to moderate his behavior, but, at the same time, he's also demonstrating that he's prepared for conflict with South Korea. But what we need to do is kind of put this in context, because he is doing a degree of signaling here. I think, as Jennifer mentioned, Mr. Bolton is wrapping up a trip to South Korea.

They include Alphabet, the Google parent, Amazon.com, of course, Facebook, potentially Apple, that they have simply gotten too big for their britches. And now state A.G.s are involved. The attorney general is involved, a number of Democrats and Republicans in agreement that something has to be done about their what they call non-competitive behaviors. It's one of those areas in which they find mutual agreements. Whether that's a good or bad thing is in the eye of the investment holder. In the meantime, this budget deal that really does seem to have bipartisan support as well. It's a way to sort of keep the government lights on, or that's the goal, for two more years, not worry about addressing the debt ceiling in a few months or another year from now, more like two years from now.

That being said, I think if you're a Democrat that's on the fence and trying to put your finger in the air and figure which way momentum was blowing, it clearly -- the wind got taken out of your sails big time yesterday. They wanted this to sort of ramp up the pressure on other Democrats to jump on board, make the case for impeachment. And so I think, if that was the test yesterday, it's making it harder for other Democrats to jump on board, because, as people hear about -- I mean, it's literally like hearing a movie review. And that's what they wanted. They wanted to create the movie version of the Mueller report. Well, if you think about it, when you talk to your friends and say, hey, how was the latest movie that came out, if they say, oh, it was horrible, it was a disaster, I got up and left, not many more people are going to go want to see the movie. And what they literally did in this case was create a situation in which other Democrats were saying, let me figure out where I can go on this politically. And with everybody panning it and panning the performance, saying it didn't bring anything new to light, it makes it much harder to create an environment in which more people are going to get on board, never mind winning the middle and bringing more of the American public on their side. It created more doubt than anything else. We're now questioning who actually wrote the report. That's not something that Democrats would have wanted.

There's not going to be a lot of Republicans who vote for this. Democrats are going to carry the freight. Listen to this comment from Mike Johnson. He's a Republican congressman from Louisiana. He chairs the Republican Study Committee, which is the largest bloc of conservatives in the House. He says -- quote -- \"Our nation is more than $22 trillion in debt, and simply cannot afford reckless measures like this one.\" We would expect the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and the whip, Steve Scalise, to vote for that bill later this afternoon. But look at the lower-tier members of the Republican leadership team. We think there's going to be a lot of people who jump off there. The reason that they have to raise the debt ceiling early is that Congress is going to go on recess here, the House, specifically tomorrow. And one of the reasons that Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, was appealing to deal with the debt ceiling now is saying they might hit this sometime in August or September. Now, I challenged Kevin McCarthy this morning about the tax bill, because that's one of the reasons why federal revenues are lower right now. He disagreed with my premise as to why they have to raise the debt ceiling on that issue so fast, because he thinks the tax bill has been -- has been pretty good. But that's an issue. That's one of the reasons why revenues are down. Now, here's the dirty secret about this bill, Neil. This doesn't fund the government. All this does is establish a level, a spending cap level for the next two years to help them deal with appropriations bills. Those will come up in September for this fiscal year.

And that's probably why American voters are feeling the most confidence that they have felt about the U.S. economy in close to 20 years, according to our latest FOX polling. So what are they going to do about the economy at the ballot box in 2020? Well, according to this, it's very interesting. They actually think that it's a tie between Trump or the Democrats. But in terms of who's going to handle it better afterwards, they actually give the check to Democrats, believe it or not. And our analysis of the FOX voter poll suggests that maybe border security, health care and immigration are the net negative contributors as to why President Trump's approval rating is still below 50 percent, close to 46 percent at this point. But let's take a look at the markets, because we did hit another record high this week. We were down today because of European growth concerns. But, so far, it's been a great earnings season. We have corporations making a ton of money still. Of the third that have reported earnings so far, three-quarters have beaten. And that's pretty good, since a lot of people were talking about an earnings recession. Now, in terms of the main stock drag today, it was Boeing once again. And it's because Southwest Airlines that says that they will not be able to fly the aircraft until January next year, and they're also losing money. And that's why they're shutting down their Newark, New York operations and consolidate at La Guardia instead -- Neil, back to you."

Let's ask Melissa Armo with The Stock Swoosh. We have Democratic strategist Max Burns, and last, but not least, Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour.

But also I think that people don't like some personality aspects of President Trump. He's kind of, this is who he is, and you either love it or you don't love it. And that's the kind of thing.

The first missile flew 270 miles early Thursday morning, local time. But the second missile fired just 30 minutes later is the one officials are most concerned about.

The missile launches come two days after Kim Jong-un was photographed at a North Korean shipyard where a new type of submarine is being constructed. The launch took place as President Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton wrapped up a visit to Seoul, South Korea.

These were short-range missiles, as Jennifer indicated. And what I would take away from this is that Kim is still showing a willingness to moderate his behavior, but, at the same time, he's also demonstrating that he's prepared for conflict with South Korea. But what we need to do is kind of put this in context, because he is doing a degree of signaling here. I think, as Jennifer mentioned, Mr. Bolton is wrapping up a trip to South Korea. What your audience might not be aware of is, just five days ago, the U.S. and South Korea agreed to return to some military exercises."

And it's just a bit of posturing internally for Kim to demonstrate that he's doing something to flex his muscles. Now, I would also add, Neil, that every time Kim does a launch like this, it provides the United States intelligence an opportunity to learn more about just what his capabilities are."

By the way, as I have been saying here, we're in the middle of earnings season here. We don't want to get too bogged down in names you don't know or those that aren't trendsetters. I think it's safe to say Amazon certainly falls in the latter category, one of those sort of gigantic retail concerns online and elsewhere, beating in its latest earnings period the revenue estimates of the company. But it's not making as much money as they thought it would. Now, don't cry for Jeff Bezos or Amazon in general. But that stock, which has been a high-flyer, clipped a little bit today, falling just a tad. We're going, meanwhile, right back to the House of Representatives, the House floor, this vote going on to increase spending. Again, it is expected to pass without much difficulty. But what -- something that we are following is this revolt within the Republican Party, particularly some of the conservative members, who are saying, we, the party of fiscal discipline -- discipline, are botching it. We're signing off on something that is going to add a lot of red ink. It's expedient. It's helpful. The fact that everyone wants this done, so that they don't have to go back and visit this for two years, is propelling all of this, but that's the problem, with these conservatives saying, we're punting again. And we're hoping that we don't have to worry about this for two years, by which time we will have added another $2 trillion in debt."

But this seems to be building up bipartisan steam on the part of Democrats and Republicans. We're now getting word that eight state attorneys general were meeting with the U.S. attorney general, Bill Barr, today, about concerns about the big tech companies stifling competition on the Internet. By the way, that is the same approach that Bill Barr has raised about them. Some of the names seem familiar to you. They include Alphabet, the Google parent, Amazon.com, of course, Facebook, potentially Apple, that they have simply gotten too big for their britches. And now state A.G.s are involved. The attorney general is involved, a number of Democrats and Republicans in agreement that something has to be done about their what they call non-competitive behaviors. It's one of those areas in which they find mutual agreements. Whether that's a good or bad thing is in the eye of the investment holder. In the meantime, this budget deal that really does seem to have bipartisan support as well. It's a way to sort of keep the government lights on, or that's the goal, for two more years, not worry about addressing the debt ceiling in a few months or another year from now, more like two years from now. But some conservative Republicans are saying, this is getting ridiculous. This isn't any sign of fiscal discipline. This is something expedient. And it's killing the party's credibility on just the one issue that was near and dear to them, spending, and getting too involved in that. Republican Texas Congressman Chip Roy with us right now.

I represent the Army Futures Command in Austin, Texas. Not one of them, not one, have asked that we mortgage the future of this country on the backs of their hard work defending this country.

      "utterance": "I think, if yesterday's hearings were the Democrats' attempt to make the movie out of the Mueller report, then the best they're going to get is a Razzie Award. This was an utter optical failure. I think whoever prepped Joe Biden for his first debate prepped Bob Mueller for this hearing. The Democrats didn't get what they wanted. Mueller looked flustered at times, didn't give them much of what they wanted at all. And so I think, at best, that number may shrink, not grow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, sometimes, we can argue over optics and substance and all that. But the bottom line is, if you really had a gangbusters performance or the substance of his remarks had registered beyond what people had known was in the report, you would have seen a lot more Democrats rushing to the impeachment line today. And no one did. And I'm wondering what that means. Is this a dead issue? There are going to be those who will keep arguing it. Virtually all the presidential candidates are. So what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Well, again, go back to what they wanted. I mean, these guys were doing mock hearings and having people play Jim Jordan and Bob Mueller. The goal that they wanted was literally the visual adaptation of the Mueller report. So, by the standard in which they set, it was an utter failure. That being said, I think if you're a Democrat that's on the fence and trying to put your finger in the air and figure which way momentum was blowing, it clearly -- the wind got taken out of your sails big time yesterday. They wanted this to sort of ramp up the pressure on other Democrats to jump on board, make the case for impeachment. And so I think, if that was the test yesterday, it's making it harder for other Democrats to jump on board, because, as people hear about -- I mean, it's literally like hearing a movie review. And that's what they wanted. They wanted to create the movie version of the Mueller report. Well, if you think about it, when you talk to your friends and say, hey, how was the latest movie that came out, if they say, oh, it was horrible, it was a disaster, I got up and left, not many more people are going to go want to see the movie. And what they literally did in this case was create a situation in which other Democrats were saying, let me figure out where I can go on this politically. And with everybody panning it and panning the performance, saying it didn't bring anything new to light, it makes it much harder to create an environment in which more people are going to get on board, never mind winning the middle and bringing more of the American public on their side. It created more doubt than anything else. We're now questioning who actually wrote the report. That's not something that Democrats would have wanted. There was a lot of legitimate questions put forward by the Republican members last night that I think took the Democrats for a big curve in what they expected the outcome and headlines to be this morning."

Hook or crook, we're going to get this done. Professor Jeffrey Engel on the importance of winning over people and, more importantly, winning them over with a positive message, and relentlessly telling them it will be all right. I'm not going to scare you. I'm not going to beat this over your head. I'm telling it will be all right. Just go with me. Jeffrey Engel is the director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University. Way too soon, I'm sure, Professor, to put Boris Johnson in that camp of illustrious leaders on the right and left. But the one quality I see is this. This will happen. This will get done.

      "speaker": "ENGEL",
      "utterance": "... knew the direction that -- yes, knew the direction that he wants to go, and, frankly, was less concerned with the dynamics of how they got there than the end result. For Churchill, for Kennedy, for Reagan, each of them had a vision of how to inspire nation and, more importantly, each of them knew that the inspiration itself had value. That is to say, if people felt better about the future, if people felt more confidence, if people felt the confidence radiating from the -- from the leader, they themselves would make the country move faster and better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, one thing that might help -- but we showed some of the examples, Winston Churchill, who had famously a great sense of humor, JFK did, Ronald Reagan did. I don't know Maggie Thatcher quite as well in that historical respect, but Boris Johnson pounding on that as well, even making fun of the fact that his fellow Conservatives might have chosen the wrong guy, but laughing at himself in the process and sort of reminding people that, with a laugh, you can push them all the more, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ENGEL",
      "utterance": "Well, not only can you push them all the more. You can get them to look the other way. President Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, was a master of this, that, whenever he didn't want to answer a question, he would offer a quip. And it didn't necessarily have to be funny. It just had to be awkward, so that people forgot the question that they were asking in the first place. It's really a wonderful way of diverting attention and also have -- showing that you have the confidence to laugh at yourself. One of my favorite examples, actually, comes from President Dwight Eisenhower, who, of course, had one of the greatest resumes in history. When you have on your resume \"saved Western civilization,\" it looks pretty good in terms of competence. And he was able to from time to time to, I kid you not, speak gibberish into the microphone during press conferences, because he knew that was going to both frustrate the Soviets,, and also give nothing of value of information out to the American public that he thought was too sensitive to reveal. So he was more than willing to have the confidence to look silly in many ways in order to get his agenda across."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "There is an advantage too, in Boris Johnson's case, and, by extension, I would say for President Trump, to being unpredictable, to being someone who might want to challenge you to wonder, gee, what will he do in response? Now, Boris Johnson has already told the Europeans that, look, we're out of here. We can either make a new deal, or we will leave without a deal. And I know he's kind of left the Europeans scratching their heads, thinking, he won't really do that. But he's making them think about that, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ENGEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's a little bit of a crazed factor that is useful in this regard, that when we used to talk about nuclear weapons strategy, relying upon the fact that we had rational actors on all sides. If you're able, like Johnson, and to a certain extent like Trump, to convince your adversary that you are unpredictable, well, then they might actually choose a more conservative line. They might choose a more predictable line. It really gives a sense that Johnson is trying to essentially seize the -- and catalyze the high ground from a very weak position at present in Britain. If nothing else, he can exude the confidence that he appears to know what he's doing, even if he doesn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I always find, like, a positive attitude is contagious. And if you're around someone who says, yes, we can get this done, or, like JFK, yes, we can land on the moon, just as rockets at the time he was making that speech were crashing at the launch pad, you can believe in anything. Ronald Reagan with that and taking office in the middle of an economic horror show and just saying, we're going to be fine. We got -- I see the best days of America ahead. Sometimes, you're just -- you're so beaten up, you just say, wow, sign me up for whatever he's taking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ENGEL",
      "utterance": "Yes. And it really does also help to be a good speaker. When we think about President Reagan, we think about Franklin Roosevelt, we think about Barack Obama, there's a sense in which you can exude confidence simply by the fact that the words sound good coming out of your mouth. I mean, the record for Ronald Reagan in his first term in particular was full of ups and downs and the economy not necessarily doing what he wanted, even up to 1984, by his reelection, yet he managed to convince Americans that he had the plan to give them confidence where they were going, after the recession, after the dismal '70s, after Vietnam, that he had a new vision. And that, as you said, was exactly contagious. I think that's actually Reagan's greatest accomplishment, is being able to reinvigorate the American psyche."

And they seem to show some bipartisanship on more transparency and drug prices and all. So they can work together. But does it give you any different vantage point from an investment point of view? Like, if this were not happening, if they were not cooperating on anything, if it was all impeaching all the time, would you say now is not the time to be in the markets?"
    },

The bubble-blowing bull market dynamic that we have had for the last eight, nine, 10 years, since 2008-2009, when we came out of the crisis, those dynamics are still very much in place.
