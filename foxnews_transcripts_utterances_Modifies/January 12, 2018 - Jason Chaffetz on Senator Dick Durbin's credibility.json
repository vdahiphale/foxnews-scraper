And by the way, Dick and Lindsey's immigration act is about as viable these days as Siegfried and Royce. We have seen this before. They pranced up to the White House with a grand unveiling and they were flummoxed when immigration stalwarts, Congressman Bob Goodlatte from Virginia and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas were already in the room as was White House policy advisor, immigration expert, Stephen Miller.   Remember, just a few days earlier when the cameras were rolling, the president said he would not sign any DACA deal without the funding of his wall and an end to chain migration and that stupid visa lottery system. Yet somehow the dynamic duo thought that they could through charm and flattery alone con Trump into agreeing to their solution that didn't meet the president's baseline and actually, if you can believe it, their idea increased chain migration. The president, to their faces said it was dead on arrival. Good for him. Durbin and Graham were so enraged after being spurned, somebody went to the press. They pedaled the story that Trump had referred to Haiti and unspecified African countries as s-holes and we should try to get Norwegian immigrants here instead.",

Now, setting aside the alleged remark for a moment, would you describe any of these countries as Shangri-La? I mean, if people there were living in club med they wouldn't be trying to crash our borders.  It's important after all the verbiage to take a look at some of the real facts about a few of the countries that can't keep their own people from leaving. Now, let's begin with El Salvador, a country I have been to many times and I have known very well for the last 30 years.  Its capital has the highest murder rate in the world. Somalia, well, guess what, it's one of the largest state sponsors of terrorism, is a safe haven for terrorists across the globe, and then, of course, Sudan, it's one of the four countries on the U.S. state sponsors of terror list in addition to a lot of other bad facts. Now, I would not have called these countries what the president did, but they are rank with corruption, repression and, of course, it's obvious, isn't it, that they offer their citizens little hope of a better life.  In other words, they are hell holes. But, for the Democrats and their media allies who are forever feigning in affinity for the third world, facts don't matter. After all, race baiting the president is so much more fun.",

All those things demonstrate that Democrat Durbin and all the rest had no intention of working with the president on a DACA deal. I really don't think they did. Because if they were truly concerned for these DACA kids, DREAMers upwards of 30 years of age, call them kids, well, they would give a little and get a little. They knew the president couldn't accept what they were offering. But, we know now what the real story is.  They had zero intention of negotiating in good faith because somehow they thought they could guilt the president into siding with them. But I guess they don't really know him very well, do they? They are out of ideas and they have no solutions.  The race card is the only one they have left to play. But, look, despite the racial smears, the unfairness of it all, look at what Trump has already done for black America. Black unemployment is at its lowest level since the bureau of labor statistics started reporting the data back in 1972. It's at 6.8 percent. Do you know what it was in the middle of Obama's first term, 16.8 percent? Black family income fell by more than $900 per family during the Obama years, fell. Just in the first 8 months of the Trump administration, black family income has risen by more than $1,000. I will take that direction any day of the week.  With Chrysler now announcing plants moving from Mexico to the United States, the stock market booming and wages rising across the country due to Trump's tax cut backs, America will thrive. Listen to Gary from Texas, a caller on my radio show this morning who expressed, I bet how a lot of minorities really feel about this manufactured controversy.",

And that's the Angle.   Joining us now for reaction, here in studio is Horace Cooper, he is a co- chair of Project 21, and in studio is also Garland Nixon, of course, a liberal radio talk show host, love everybody's perspective, and in Phoenix is Kevin Jackson a radio talk show host and Fox News contributor. Great to see all of you.  All right. Horace, let me start with you. Your reaction to what's happened over the last 24 hours, the president has in good faith said all right, we'll give protection to 800,000 people here. They were brought illegally, most of them, of course children, but he said these are the things we need. These are things that I campaigned on and we got to do and then you saw what happened. HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: FDR famously said that all we have to fear is fear itself. The new Democrats all they have to offer is race itself. Every single opportunity to turn the conversation from the facts, the logic, and the merits go to race. It means they're lazy. It means they are not serious.

First, the alleged ringleader, Fermin Flores Rosales, from Mexico has been previously deported numerous times and now is illegally present back in the United States. And then there is Mario Acosta-Ruiz from Mexico also illegally in the United States. Another lovely, Cristobal Flores-Rosales of Mexico was already deported previously, but somehow, he's back here selling heroin. And yet, another, Yoel Soto-Campos, another sweetheart from Mexico, has been previously deported multiple times.  And finally, Joel Torrez-Espinoza from Mexico has again been previously deported on a number of occasions and get this was actually convicted in 2012 in Utah for felony possession with intent to distribute cocaine these are total travesties in your communities, not just in Denver but all across the United States. We will continue to highlight them, dig and get the facts for you when nobody else will. By the way, ICE told us that we are the only news organization and the prosecutor in the case, only news organization that had asked about the immigration status.

Gentlemen, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you on this. We're going to be highlighting these cases throughout the next several months on this show because, for some reason, most mainstream media outlets leave those little facts out. They are inconvenient facts for people who believe we should be much more generous with our immigration policies and so forth. The African-American community has been especially hard hit by the heroin trafficking in the United States and by the drug pushers.

Fiat Chrysler has announced it's moving production of heavy duty trucks from Mexico to Michigan, and, get this, creating 2,500 new jobs. Hey, President Obama, I can explain all of it, you're confused. It's called tax reform, deregulation, and soon better trade policies. The CEO of Fiat Chrysler explicitly cited the savings from Trump's tax reform and, quote, \"The resulting improvement in the U.S. business environment\" for his decision.

And by the way, Dick and Lindsey's immigration act is about as viable these days as Siegfried and Royce. We have seen this before. They pranced up to the White House with a grand unveiling and they were flummoxed when immigration stalwarts, Congressman Bob Goodlatte from Virginia and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas were already in the room as was White House policy advisor, immigration expert, Stephen Miller. Remember, just a few days earlier when the cameras were rolling, the president said he would not sign any DACA deal without the funding of his wall and an end to chain migration and that stupid visa lottery system. Yet somehow the dynamic duo thought that they could through charm and flattery alone con Trump into agreeing to their solution that didn't meet the president's baseline and actually, if you can believe it, their idea increased chain migration. The president, to their faces said it was dead on arrival. Good for him. Durbin and Graham were so enraged after being spurned, somebody went to the press. They pedaled the story that Trump had referred to Haiti and unspecified African countries as s-holes and we should try to get Norwegian immigrants here instead."

Now, setting aside the alleged remark for a moment, would you describe any of these countries as Shangri-La? I mean, if people there were living in club med they wouldn't be trying to crash our borders. It's important after all the verbiage to take a look at some of the real facts about a few of the countries that can't keep their own people from leaving. Now, let's begin with El Salvador, a country I have been to many times and I have known very well for the last 30 years. Its capital has the highest murder rate in the world. Somalia, well, guess what, it's one of the largest state sponsors of terrorism, is a safe haven for terrorists across the globe, and then, of course, Sudan, it's one of the four countries on the U.S. state sponsors of terror list in addition to a lot of other bad facts. Now, I would not have called these countries what the president did, but they are rank with corruption, repression and, of course, it's obvious, isn't it, that they offer their citizens little hope of a better life. In other words, they are hell holes. But, for the Democrats and their media allies who are forever feigning in affinity for the third world, facts don't matter. After all, race baiting the president is so much more fun."

All those things demonstrate that Democrat Durbin and all the rest had no intention of working with the president on a DACA deal. I really don't think they did. Because if they were truly concerned for these DACA kids, DREAMers upwards of 30 years of age, call them kids, well, they would give a little and get a little. They knew the president couldn't accept what they were offering. But, we know now what the real story is. They had zero intention of negotiating in good faith because somehow they thought they could guilt the president into siding with them. But I guess they don't really know him very well, do they? They are out of ideas and they have no solutions. The race card is the only one they have left to play. But, look, despite the racial smears, the unfairness of it all, look at what Trump has already done for black America. Black unemployment is at its lowest level since the bureau of labor statistics started reporting the data back in 1972. It's at 6.8 percent. Do you know what it was in the middle of Obama's first term, 16.8 percent? Black family income fell by more than $900 per family during the Obama years, fell. Just in the first 8 months of the Trump administration, black family income has risen by more than $1,000. I will take that direction any day of the week. With Chrysler now announcing plants moving from Mexico to the United States, the stock market booming and wages rising across the country due to Trump's tax cut backs, America will thrive. Listen to Gary from Texas, a caller on my radio show this morning who expressed, I bet how a lot of minorities really feel about this manufactured controversy."

Those who work hard but somehow maybe along the way got addicted to opioids, they need help, and no matter what Durbin or CNN says, that is a fact. The silent majority feels that the system is unfair, and you bet they want it fixed. And when Trump demands a better deal on immigration, one that's going to secure the border and keep illegals from competing with our citizens like that caller, for jobs that they need, and he is fighting on behalf of all citizens, the president is fighting for blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians, you are here legally, you are an American citizen, he is fighting for you. And that's the Angle. Joining us now for reaction, here in studio is Horace Cooper, he is a co- chair of Project 21, and in studio is also Garland Nixon, of course, a liberal radio talk show host, love everybody's perspective, and in Phoenix is Kevin Jackson a radio talk show host and Fox News contributor. Great to see all of you. All right. Horace, let me start with you. Your reaction to what's happened over the last 24 hours, the president has in good faith said all right, we'll give protection to 800,000 people here. They were brought illegally, most of them, of course children, but he said these are the things we need. These are things that I campaigned on and we got to do and then you saw what happened. HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: FDR famously said that all we have to fear is fear itself. The new Democrats all they have to offer is race itself. Every single opportunity to turn the conversation from the facts, the logic, and the merits go to race. It means they're lazy. It means they are not serious.

We need solutions so problems that exist for the DACA kids you want a solution we will get there, for economic growth, we got to get there, for families of all colors who are having struggles, we got to get there. But to constantly keep people in a state of resistance for what reason? Whose lives are getting -- how many jobs are being created by doing that? How many lives are being improved? I don't think many. That's all I have to say about that. Guys, don't go anywhere, though, we have a knocking update on the legal status of the men running a Denver heroin ring.

      "utterance": "Well, it turns out the president was right. We do have an important update to a story we brought you last night, a lot of hombres, about a busted heroin ring in Denver, Colorado. We were the only show to bring you this last night and tonight, we are the only show bringing you the exclusive update from Immigration and Customs Enforcement about these creeps. First, the alleged ringleader, Fermin Flores Rosales, from Mexico has been previously deported numerous times and now is illegally present back in the United States. And then there is Mario Acosta-Ruiz from Mexico also illegally in the United States. Another lovely, Cristobal Flores-Rosales of Mexico was already deported previously, but somehow, he's back here selling heroin. And yet, another, Yoel Soto-Campos, another sweetheart from Mexico, has been previously deported multiple times. And finally, Joel Torrez-Espinoza from Mexico has again been previously deported on a number of occasions and get this was actually convicted in 2012 in Utah for felony possession with intent to distribute cocaine these are total travesties in your communities, not just in Denver but all across the United States. We will continue to highlight them, dig and get the facts for you when nobody else will. By the way, ICE told us that we are the only news organization and the prosecutor in the case, only news organization that had asked about the immigration status. For reaction, let us bring in Civil Rights Attorney Leo Terrell from Los Angeles and here in Washington, Niger Innis, the national spokesperson for the Congress of Racial Equality. Gentlemen, it's great to see you. Leo, let's start with you on this. We're going to be highlighting these cases throughout the next several months on this show because, for some reason, most mainstream media outlets leave those little facts out. They are inconvenient facts for people who believe we should be much more generous with our immigration policies and so forth. The African-American community has been especially hard hit by the heroin trafficking in the United States and by the drug pushers. They take advantage of them and they devastate communities but especially the African-American community. What's your take on this particular scourge and what we should do with these individuals?"

You want me to broad stroke these six guys as being the responsibility for drugs in the African-American community? I won't go there. But I will sit here and give you that we got six bad guys. They shouldn't be in the country. But let's not go any further than that argument because there is a lot of good immigrants, illegal aliens who are in this country. For example, Laura, you like facts, a lot of illegal aliens right now through the Dream Act, serving our military, teachers, doctors, lawyers, nurses, so, I don't want you to jump from theist six bad guys and make a broad stroke on all illegal immigrants because that's what you are trying to do."

That's a problem. That's six people in Denver. We have people all across the country pushing drugs from other countries."

Niger, I want to go to you on this. That's the line you always hear any time you bring up scourge of drugs, murders, abuse of children they say yeah other people do that too. Of course, there are good people who are illegal immigrants. Absolutely. But if one American of any background is brutalized at the hands of an illegal immigrant who shouldn't be here, whose fault is that? The victim's?"

If that, no, it is not just these six individuals that are craven criminals that not only prey on black communities and brown communities but immigrant communities. Some of those nice illegal aliens and immigrants that are in our country good folk are trapped by a lot of these folk and by the industries. But, even worse than these particular criminals are politicians who play games with immigrant communities the same way that progressive politicians have played with the black community for decades. I'm talking about people like Jerry Brown. I'm talking people like Rahm Emanuel with their sanctuary states, their sanctuary cities and now new class of individuals sanctuary felons that they give pardons too because they are pursuing a progressive agenda. Well, who -- where do these people prey? Where do they practice their illicit trades? It's not in the bay area at the chardonnay cocktail parties, OK. It is in these black and brown and immigrant communities that are the victims of these horrendous crimes."

Laura, you are a lawyer, isn't that a big leap in logic because you want to ignore -- you want to ignore the good immigrants in this country, you want to ignore all of the ones that -- Laura, I want to give you some facts -- from lawyer to lawyer, Laura. You know, why don't you mention the country Nigeria. Oh my gosh, that's the country that has higher percentage of individuals with graduate's degrees than Americans.

Minority communities have been disproportionately affected by the drain that the illegal population puts on our public schools. They don't go to the fancy schools. They go to public schools. Multiple language spoken, multiple ESL programs necessary, extra money that is not going to the kids who come from difficult circumstances. That is money that is limited in budgets that are already overtaxed. It's hurting black communities more than the rich, white communities that are the do- gooders who want to say everybody can come in. Let everybody come in. Let's have the big bienvenidos mat at the border. But do you not care about those minority communities including Hispanic communities?"

If the laws don't matter, then let's have them not matter across the board. We will see how that chaos works for us. Guys, we are out of time.

Obama's press secretary at the time, Jay Carney, responding I looked into this and spoke with somebody who was in that meeting and it did not happen.

Robin, let's start with you on this. I remember back in 2005 that Dick Durbin comment about our troops because my producer at the time Lee Habeeb was watching. I think it was C-Span, I think it was at night, and he calls me and he said did you just hear what Dick Durbin said? He's describing our guys like Pol Pot, Nazis, and he ultimately had to come out and apologize. But that statement, I can't imagine ever making a statement about the U.S. military such as that. That one statement told me one about Dick Durbin than anything else that you can point to about something that Trump said about certain countries that send a disproportionate number of lottery visa numbers us.

There's only one Democrat, and only the Democrat is saying that this has happened. And I think it's highly suspect when Dick Durbin, who has a history of doing this, he used this card on Republicans before, was absolutely wrong. And I think it was a German philosopher Nietzsche who said I'm not upset that you lied to me. I'm upset that I can never trust you again.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, we have come across another glaring example of Hollywood hypocrisy in the upcoming film \"Fifty Shades Freed,\" the third installment of that nightmare \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" franchise. Naturally it's just another blatant use of sex and objectification of women to sell tickets to something the industry, this is something it has done since its inception. It's nothing new. But check out the catch phrase for the marketing campaign for the new flick, \"Don't miss the climax.\" That's on posters at New York subway stops used by who knows how many children with their parents every day. And the way the ad in Times Square is even bigger. And that's a problem for a Hollywood that now claims to be woke to the sexual predation that's out there and is now trying to position itself for the moral authority with its Me Too and Time's Up campaign. Now, we were just lectured on the evils of sexual improprieties and objectification by a parade of actresses and of course Oprah Winfrey at the Golden Globes. And yet they are telling the world, including our young girls, young children, big billboards, go see this movie so you don't miss the climax? The double talk from Tinseltown is striking. Respect women and value women, great. But, what, while we bind, gag and beat them for our sexual pleasure on some guy on the big screen. Actions speak louder than their platitudes. Oh, by the way, and \"Fifty Shades Freed\" opens on Valentine's Day, very romantic, which also happens to be Ash Wednesday. And now the latest installment of our recurring segment, \"The Experts.\" Remember all the so-called experts who scoffed at the notion that President Trump could bring jobs back to America? PBS headlined a story in March, 2016, \"Trump says he'll bring jobs back to America. Economists are skeptical.\" Two months later then President Obama said this about then candidate Trump's promise to bring back jobs."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It's called policy, sir, the magic wand. Shortly after Trump was elected, economists and \"New York Times\" columnist Paul Krugman declared that manufacturing jobs were not coming back to the U.S. no matter what Trump might do. And then just last June CBS headlined a story \"Manufacturing jobs in America, they're not coming back.\" Well, maybe all those experts then can explain this. Fiat Chrysler has announced it's moving production of heavy duty trucks from Mexico to Michigan, and, get this, creating 2,500 new jobs. Hey, President Obama, I can explain all of it, you're confused. It's called tax reform, deregulation, and soon better trade policies. The CEO of Fiat Chrysler explicitly cited the savings from Trump's tax reform and, quote, \"The resulting improvement in the U.S. business environment\" for his decision. Oh, and by the way, Fiat Chrysler is also handing out $2,000 bonuses to 60,000 workers, bonuses, you know, just like those recently announced by Walmart, AT&T, American Airlines, waste management company, Bank of America, Comcast, and nine other major corporations since Trump's tax reform became law. And by the way, let's not forget these are bonuses that Nancy Pelosi derides as, they are just crumbs. Confounding the experts, jobs are coming back and the Trump economy is really beginning to roar. Trump is the first Republican president since Ronald Reagan to oversee so much tremendous economic news, and he did it without a magic wand. Stay with us because when we come right back we're going to tell you how one former CNN host was fired for a tweet disparaging President Trump. So will the same fate befall a host who did the same thing last night? That's next."

And you really put it well in your previous segment. This is a meltdown of epic proportions. It's fabulous to watch. It's hysterical. This is a reaction to the extraordinary economic news.
