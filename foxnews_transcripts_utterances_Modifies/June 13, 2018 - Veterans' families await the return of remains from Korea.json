Bret, thank you so much.  So, a live look once again at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. where the ballgame is bringing people together right now which is definitely what we need. The Congressional Game about to get underway, and as Bret was just saying Congressman Steve Scalise, who one year ago was shot and nearly bled to death on a baseball field. Will be standing at second base and here he is as he comes out. We're taking you live as it happens, let's watch this for a moment. Look at -- look at Steve Scalise, here. Walking with one cane on one arm, walking down the line and hugging everybody. I mean, this is a man who went through so much, and as you, you know you have to take yourself back to that moment. We were all literally day by day wondering if he was going to survive what happened.  This gunman opening fire on a baseball field on a beautiful morning in Washington, D.C. It was freakish, bizarre, and brutal, and so devastating for Steve Scalise and his family, who I guarantee are in tears right now watching him out here on this baseball field as he walks around and gets ready to take second base. So, our best to him, it is wonderful to see this tradition continuing tonight. And we will keep an eye on this really special moment at Nationals Park tonight as we watch the game.  But first, there is another game to discuss tonight and that is the future of the FBI.",

Let's put up this chart that is part of the report that shows the pattern of leaks coming out of the FBI.   So, just you know, obviously, at home you can't really grasp this completely. But the little red circles in the middle are reporters. And then, there are numbers that extend out showing the number of exchanges between the reporter and people like. For example, the Deputy Assistant Director, the staff operations specialist, the senior special agent, the general attorney. All going to this reporter person in the middle.

The Trump Foundation, by contrast, raised $18.8 million over 30 years and gave away 19.2 million. Meaning, they gave way more money than they actually ever raised they had zero overhead. You know, if you look at what the Trump Foundation has been giving, they gave $1,100,000 to the Marine Corps and Law Enforcement Association. That is the Association has tasked with. If you died in the line of duty as the United States Marine or is a law enforcement officer, this is the foundation that funds your kid's education. The Trump Foundation gave them a $1.1 million. The Green Beret Foundation, the Navy SEALs Foundation, these are the premier foundation, the 22Kill Foundation which is designed to prevent the 22 individuals who kill themselves every day after they come back from suicide. This is where the Trump family gave their money.

Paul Nehlen is one of the names that is in there and he has been harshly criticized for anti-Semitism. You once called him a hero and said you were inspired by him.

But of course that's not enough for CNN and all the left-wing media, they are trying to connect us to all that. And the reason they are as they are trying to distract from the main message which is this. That is that President Trump is strong, he is getting stronger, and those of us who have tied ourselves to President Trump and who vowed to support his policies are winning. We're winning in the primaries. And we're going to increasingly win as we get closer to November.

We were all literally day by day wondering if he was going to survive what happened. This gunman opening fire on a baseball field on a beautiful morning in Washington, D.C. It was freakish, bizarre, and brutal, and so devastating for Steve Scalise and his family, who I guarantee are in tears right now watching him out here on this baseball field as he walks around and gets ready to take second base.

When I -- when I actually started reading it, I couldn't understand where that takeaway really came from? But one other thing because Christopher Wray, spoke about this today. Let's put up this chart that is part of the report that shows the pattern of leaks coming out of the FBI. So, just you know, obviously, at home you can't really grasp this completely. But the little red circles in the middle are reporters. And then, there are numbers that extend out showing the number of exchanges between the reporter and people like. For example, the Deputy Assistant Director, the staff operations specialist, the senior special agent, the general attorney. All going to this reporter person in the middle.

So, he has no credibility on this as report found that there were no crimes by Clinton, no bias at the FBI and something that we all know that James Comey is an imperfect man just like we are all imperfect people. And that he could have done his job better. This is good for Democracy."

So, you know, we, looking back of that, this is now sort of doubles down on James Comey's actions and why it would make say -- I mean, I would imagine if he was still in place now. There would be a lot of questions about whether or not he needed to be fired."

But there was a finding that it did not affect any investigation actions that they took nor should it. And you know, look, I have brothers who are police officers, boy do they have strong political opinions. And I just hope and I see in their work that it never affects what they do on the streets, and there's no evidence that any haze was affected by what Strzok and Page were doing."

Just going back to what I mentioned before from the report that James Comey usurped the authority of the Attorney General, and did not accurately describe the legal position of the department prosecutors. And when you go through that the language that was changed, and it's believed that it was likely changed by Peter Strzok. You know, when you look at the things that were altered, changing reasonably likely that hostile actors gained access to the e-mail server that was changed to possible. They also changed that she used private e-mail to communicate with President Obama in hostile territory to that, that was a senior official. You know, so when you look at all the softening of that language as it goes through, and then, you look at that at the Strzok-Page text message that says, you know, we will find a way to stop it when it comes to a Trump presidency.

This is from Peter Strzok -- a statement from Peter Strzok through his attorney. And it asked the question about the Hillary Clinton investigation which -- you know, I know Democrats criticized the fact that hers was so public, and that the Trump investigation was under wrap. So he said, \"There is simply no equivalence between an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified information, and credible evidence suggesting that the presidential campaign of a major party candidate was actively colluding with a hostile foreign power in a way that could undermine the integrity of an American presidential election.\" I mean, he's citing that as if it's fact, at this point we still haven't -- we have no evidence that would support that but that's why he claims -- Peters Strzok claims that he had to move his attention so firmly over to this other campaign that he clearly did not want to succeed."

Evidence has to be weighed and tested and that will bear out through -- you know, any future charges that are in addition to the 20 people who already charged, and the guilty pleas we've seen in the investigation.

In fact, the report today on page 144 says that \"They successfully determined classified information was improperly stored and transmitted on Clinton's e-mail server and classified information was compromised by unauthorized individuals to include foreign governments and intelligence services via cyber intrusion and other means.\" That is a huge, huge breaking news.

It's nonsense. It just flies in the face of any kind of logic. Second, what's interesting about this is that everyone -- this is like Groundhog Day. Every month we're on we're talking about the Nunez memo, we're talking about this.

You know, I really believe that I read through this today with -- as clear an eye as I possibly could and I kept looking up at the T.V. and all across the television sets in my in my office, it was saying you know, no bias, no bias. And then I'm reading these things about everything they change in the report just soften the language I'm thinking, OK for what reason that would they have done that?

The suit which specifically names the President's children along with the President, Don Jr., Eric, and Ivanka, accuses the Foundation of illegal conduct and alleges unlawful coordination with the Trump Presidential Campaign. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood who took over that position after Eric Schneiderman resigned in disgrace amid reports that he had abused women, she says this. \"The Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook where payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits regardless of their purpose or legality.\" Underwood seeking 2.8 million in restitution plus penalties and wants the Foundation dissolved which by the way the President wanted to do a long time ago when he ran for office but they said they had to keep it open so that they could keep the investigation open. The President now says he will not settle this case. Corey Lewandowski is President Trump's former Campaign Manager and his Co- Author of let Trump be Trump. Good to see you this evening, Cory.

What we've seen is Eric Schneiderman thought he was going to make his political career going after Donald Trump and his family and the Foundation. At the same time, he was asking them for donations when he was running for office so that's the hypocrisy of New York politics. And now you look at what the Attorney General has said recently about this administration. Let me read a to you, it's very important. Battling the White House is the most important work I have ever done. That's what the Attorney General of New York has said. So if you don't think that her attacks on the Trump Foundation are political vendetta, then nothing is. She is abusing her power as the Attorney General to go after a Foundation which has donated tens of millions of dollars to charitable causes and specifically those to help veterans."

But in terms of the campaign and what they are accusing the campaign of, Corey, it does point to you directly with regard to the Iowa caucuses and the e-mail that you wrote to Allan Weisselberg, and the subject is veterans charities, and it says is there any way we can make some disbursements this week while in Iowa specifically on Saturday. Now they're claiming that they -- that the Foundation was used to funnel cash to certain organizations in order to I guess, curry favor ahead of the caucuses. What do you say about that, Corey?"

      "utterance": "Look, let me be very clear. I've never spoken to anyone from the New York Attorney General's Office. They've never contacted me. I've always made myself available. So you know, again, this was politically motivated and if people were really concerned about a foundation, Hillary Clinton's Foundation raised $500 million dollars from countries like Qatar, and Algeria, and Kuwait, and gave 15 percent of their money for programmatic requests. 15 percent of the $500 million dollars they gave away. The Trump Foundation, by contrast, raised $18.8 million over 30 years and gave away 19.2 million. Meaning, they gave way more money than they actually ever raised they had zero overhead. You know, if you look at what the Trump Foundation has been giving, they gave $1,100,000 to the Marine Corps and Law Enforcement Association. That is the Association has tasked with. If you died in the line of duty as the United States Marine or is a law enforcement officer, this is the foundation that funds your kid's education. The Trump Foundation gave them a $1.1 million. The Green Beret Foundation, the Navy SEALs Foundation, these are the premier foundation, the 22Kill Foundation which is designed to prevent the 22 individuals who kill themselves every day after they come back from suicide. This is where the Trump family gave their money. So I don't understand why there's any question that Mr. Trump and his companies that he controlled personally donated over $8 million to this foundation over the last 30 years because that's the charitable individual that he is and he should be praised for the work that he's done."

The reports filled with statements of bias. The inspector general was saying is that, he can't say conclusively that though, that whatever bias they found influence the outcome of these actions. So, and that's a very difficult thing because there are many people involved and the people involved said look, I wasn't influenced by political considerations.

It is a very difficult thing to determine but I guess the most important thing is as you step back from it is, what happens now? And you know, you heard Christopher Wray talking this afternoon about what they need to do to make sure that this never happens again.

He also said some things that were truly newsworthy like the fact that Hillary Clinton was effectively hacked by foreign powers and there was classified evidence of compromise. Comey is now on the record once again for violating core Department of Justice rules and policies.

You know, when I supported Nehlen is when Philip Schaff did and Anne Coulter did and President Trump did as well, he said very nice things about him. It was only afterwards that the guy kind of lost his marbles and said all these terrible things. And we all at that point distance ourselves from him and disavowed him. But of course that's not enough for CNN and all the left-wing media, they are trying to connect us to all that. And the reason they are as they are trying to distract from the main message which is this. That is that President Trump is strong, he is getting stronger, and those of us who have tied ourselves to President Trump and who vowed to support his policies are winning. We're winning in the primaries. And we're going to increasingly win as we get closer to November. I think, I think that by that point, we will have a red tide because of the popularity of President Trump."

One more question because I move up of this topic, because Paul Nehlen, you are right, did not start to, it wasn't revealed that he had made this anti-Semitic comments when you said such going things about him. However, he had already said that he believe that all Muslim should be deported from the United States. Do you agree with that?"

You don't do a background check on everybody and I certainly would not agree with that. I have a very good relationship in fact with the Muslim community and the community that I served right now."

He wrote a very nice tweet about you congratulating you on the campaign the other night and you have made it very clear that you want very much to be closely aligned with him as you move forward in this campaign, correct?"

You can actually see the resurgence in manufacturing in particular, in Virginia, in southwest Virginia and around the state. And now with this latest success in the Korean peninsula for the first time, we got peace breaking out since 1950 in the Korean peninsula, and you can't argue with that success."

Not a single, even Democrats admit, not a single accomplishment in the past six years. The only thing he has done is run for vice president and he didn't even do a good job at that."

The House majority whip was shot and seriously wounded and almost lost his life. But tonight he is playing baseball in Washington, D.C. And also tonight, the Louisiana congressman as we mentioned -- yes, he's out there playing. That's what we're saying. He's out there playing. Steve Doocy is out there too and he joins us live from Nationals Park. So stick around for that, it's going to be awesome. There he is, hi, Steve. We will be right back."

It was a very moving night. Steve Scalise was in the hospital fighting for his life at that point, he had been gunned down with others at a baseball field outside of Washington, D.C., in a just horrific and enormously obviously unexpected horrible attack that happened there. So tonight, they are back on the field. Here's what happened on the first play, OK. The leadoff batter hits a sharp grounder on the first pitch at the congressional baseball game, right at Scalise who feels that cleanly and throws out Democrat-- Democrat California Republican Ruiz at first. That courtesy of Chad) program to play by play. He's goes to play by play all the time. Steve is here. Steve Doocy is at the game this evening, there is a look at it. I mean, you can't make that up."

And you know, I know he's been practicing, I know he's had a dozen surgeries since one year ago today when just a couple of miles from where we're standing right now here at Nationals Park. That crazed gunman came out with a long gun, the semiautomatic and tried to kill as many Republicans as he could. Steve Scalise was down, pinned it down. His teammates wanted to come and rescue him, couldn't, it wasn't until the brave action of the police officers, the capitol police, as personal security detail that actually was able to bring -- neutralize the gunman, killed the gunman. And then everybody was taken to hospitals. Steve Scalise faced so much rehab, a dozen surgery. He wanted to come back tonight, it has been his mission to be here and waved to the crowd, and he was able to do it. And so, Martha, for him to be able to on the first play of the game, throw a Democrat out? I'm telling you, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. It was like a movie in the way, it was just too perfect."

And in addition to Mr. Scalise, the two capitol police officers who were injured that day, they threw the balls out, the first two ceremonial pitches, and they threw them to two of the other guys who were actually struck by the gunmen as well. And then Steve Scalise came in and, you know, we've been wondering what it was going to be like. It was great. He plays the -- he was there for about two innings. He had other official congressional duties to attend to. But I will tell you what, there is just such a a different feeling today. In fact, I was talking to the speaker of the house with Steve Scalise about how different it was, and this is what he had to say."

Doctors who are also Republican members of Congress, they got up and put a tourniquet on him and other people and I saved their lives. And that is why there are thousands of people here tonight trying to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for area charities. And tonight, they saw a great show.

He posted this picture of him standing next to a large gnome and it says Comey, Comey's Gnomey. So try to decide for that what that means. So we were at the baseball game and we want to bring you this special moment that we all remember from September when Steve Scalise finally made it back to the work to the people's house on his return to Congress last year.
