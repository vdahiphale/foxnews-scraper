      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, big breaking news in what is pivotal, crucial to our Constitution and that is a quest for equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws.  It involves numerous issues. Julian Assange versus Hillary Clinton, and the great injustice in the Roger Stone case. There in the Stone case, a travesty of justice. We have all of the details tonight, and an insane judge in that particular case.  Plus, we will have reaction and analysis to the very latest news from the Democrats' latest nasty, bare-knuckle brawl political my fight. It was another Schiff show. Oh, and yes, farmer Bloomberg admitting, oh, yes, I try -- I bought the House of Representatives for Pelosi. Great move.  But, first, breaking only moments ago, big news for Republicans -- eight elected officials in Mississippi have announced they are switching from Democrats and independents to the Republican Party. Now, the Mississippi GOP expects that more announcements will follow soon. Also breaking tonight, more good news, look at this, in the state of Kentucky, special election, Republican just won a statehouse district that has been in Democratic control since the 1980s. This is a preview of coming attractions, major news, potential barometer for things to come. Full election analysis is only moments away tonight.  But we do start with Bolshevik Bernie Sanders, who just can't seem to help himself. Now, the Democratic front-runner is doubling down on his effusive praise of communism. Sure, Castro murdered tens of thousands of his own citizens. He locked up political dissidents, confiscated private property, outlawed all freedoms and induced widespread starvation and poverty.  But according to Bolshevik Bernie, Fidel Castro's literacy program made it all worth it, which is why literally hundreds of thousands of Cubans, let's see, risked their lives in broken down, rickety, dilapidated boats and shark infested waters in inner tubes in the hopes of getting here, and thankfully, many did.   Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Now, this is now the second straight day Bolshevik Bernie has gone out of his way praising Castro's communist dictatorship.  Well, hang on, my ties off. There we go. Perfect.   Anyway, and for what? A propaganda field reeducation program masquerading as a literacy platform? Now, either Bolshevik Bernie is incredibly stupid or he thinks we, the people, are incredibly stupid. His radical brand of Soviet-style socialism is about one thing and one thing only: that is government control and takeover of every aspect of our lives.  Now, and every socialist hellhole, from Venezuela to Cuba to the USSR, his honeymoon place, the process is always the same. It all starts with the nationalism of major industry and promises -- oh, the government is going to give everyone everything for free. We're going to take care of everything for you. Well, that's what the New Green Deal is all about. That's what Medicare- for-All is all about. And Bolshevik Bernie is literally plotting a government takeover of two of America's largest industries. And make no mistake, this could easily cost over $100 trillion in the next ten years.  But don't worry, Bernie has a plan to cover the cost and you are all going to pay for it.  Today, he actually rolled out nine, that's right, nine, brand-new tax hikes for all of you to enjoy. And by the way, here's what the fake news media will ignore -- to start, anybody that makes $29,000 a year is going to get slapped with a 4 percent tax increase. Up next, employers will get hit with an additional 7.5 percent payroll tax. By the way, they will pass that on to we, the consumers. High income earners, they're going now to get taxed a top federal rate of 52 percent. That's a 15 percent hike there. Capital gains, that will go through the roof.  By the way, the death tax, if you paid taxes, after they steal more money with his wealth tax, and when you die, he's going to take 77 percent, that's the top rate. Wow, they tax you again. You have to pay to die in America.   The corporate income tax rate will go up to 35 percent, a 14-point increase. A new cap on itemized tax deductions will be imposed. The oil and gas industry will be hit with $3 trillion tax increase. Wonder what they're going to do with the price of oil and gas? I guess we're going to pay that, too. And last but not least, large corporations of Bernie's choosing will get hit with a brand-new $2 trillion tax. Now, that will be a recipe for economic disaster, because corporations are not stupid. They are going to leave this country and take their business elsewhere, as will billionaires and millionaires. They are not going to give their wealth over to Bernie Sanders and his Bolshevik revolution.  By the way, it still doesn't quite account for the trillions in new spending. And laughably, now, Bolshevik Bernie's campaign is claiming that his insane programs will magically create 20 million new jobs. He was saying the other night that we're going to lose jobs under his plan.  And, by the way, he is also claiming it will magically save the government trillions of dollars and that will make the funding gap. I know he's old, so he may not have a calculator yet. Maybe somebody can update his abacus and give poor Bernie a new calculator. Maybe buy him an iPhone or something, because his math won't ever add up.   But tonight, I do have to hand it to Bernie, from his unyielding praise of communism, bragging about oppressive new taxes, well, he is at least slightly more honest than his opponents -- Medicare for All, Green New Deal, late-term abortions, elimination of the Second Amendment, open borders, free health care for illegal immigrants. Oh, we not only have sanctuary cities but a sanctuary country. They all pretty much want the same thing. All of these Democrats, they are all radical, extreme socialists. But Bolshevik Bernie's raw candor about the radical Democratic Party's platform is making them a little nervous. Just don't tell everybody this is what we think.  They know the American people won't buy it, so now, figuratively -- well, they are speaking out against Bernie.  Take a look.",

This piece, 1969, Sanders writing, quote: Now, if children go around naked -- well, they are liable to see each other's sexual organs and maybe even touch them. A terrible thing. If we raise children up like this, it will probably ruin the whole pornography business. His words, not mine.   By the way, he's a grown adult man, and he wrote that? Something wrong with this guy.

I will tell you, it is an amazing story, I have a very good friend of mine that passed away, his land -- his family land was stolen. His neighbor's land was stolen when Castro came to power. Many of his friends and neighbors were murdered by Castro and his thugs. He barely made it out alive.

Second, Marxism is based on the belief that an employer and an employee, a worker and an owner, can't both help each other and both be better off. The worker gets good pay. The employer makes a profit on the capital they've invested.  But his ideas are Marxist ideas, and Marxism always leads to authoritarianism and dictatorship, eventually. It does everywhere in the world it's been tried. And as you point out, in my home state of Florida, we have hundreds of thousands of people who have come to this country fleeing some of the very same policies that we're now seeing advocated on a debate stage in one of our two major political parties.

The average corporate tax rate in Nordic countries is around 21 percent. They don't have a minimum wage. In Sweden, they have universal school choice for everybody. So, they have a big welfare state, but they do -- and they have high taxes -- but they are not socialist countries. Now, what they're talking what is nationalizing health care.

If you do care about constitutional governments, if you care about the rule of law, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws, you've got to pay attention. Now, we have a case, extradition case, going on in London as we speak. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is facing extradition to the U.S., indicted on 18 violations of the Espionage Act for publishing classified material. Let's see, has anyone ever read the Pentagon Papers, by the way? Might want to read that. By the way, you know that is the case with the Supreme Court ruled journalists have the right to publish leaked, classified material from the Vietnam War? That's a landmark case. Put aside whatever the legal issues are here for a second, and discuss the irony of these charges. Julian Assange, what they are now saying they want to bring him to this country for would be facing the Espionage Act publishing otherwise, quote, secret materials, from they say, Russia. He denied it when I interviewed him.  But Hillary Clinton's secret server, let's see, had top secret, classified information on it, a clear violation of the Espionage Act. Where are those charges? Now, also, what else are they talking about? Clinton faced a zero charges for, let's see, funneling money, through a law firm, to hire an op research firm to hire a foreign spy and paying for Russian dirt on Donald Trump. She paid for Russian disinformation, or as \"The New York Times\" now recognizes, a little late, it was Russian disinformation right from the start. And Hillary Clinton literally colluded with a foreign government. OK. Why isn't she being held accountable? She paid for Russian lies. By the way, in my interview with Assange in January, put it up on my Twitter account if you want to watch the whole interview. January 2017, I asked him six separate times, and he denied ever getting anything from Russia. OK, maybe you agree or disagree, which, even if he did, at least, he didn't have to pay for it like Hillary Clinton. That would be on equal justice under the law. If you are going to say, oh, with to bring this guy here, why isn't she arrested for the Espionage Act? Why isn't she arrested for paying for Russian lies? Now, it's undisputed, it is clear, there is a paper trail. We know the dossier author Christopher Steele on record testifying about that dirty dossier, even saying he has no idea any of it is true. Clear evidence that two far left hacks pretending to be journalist, David Corn, Michael Isikoff, conspiracy theorists, leaked the dossier information. Why? To help the Democrats rigged the election with her Russian bought and paid-for lies. When I interviewed Julian Assange, I asked him over and over again about his sources. He consistently denied working with Russia or any other state actor. But we know Hillary paid for it.  Take a look.",

How come she's not having charges brought up on her? This is a lack of equal justice under the law. The question remains, OK, Julian Assange is aggressively targeting for publishing material, where are the charges for Hillary Clinton, who paid for Russian lies and colluded with Russia and paid for the Russian lies and used it in the 2016 campaign? This is just one part of our dual system of justice in this country. You want to talk about more unequal justice? All right, let's look at the Sixth Amendment. That was the one that guarantees, quote, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an impartial jury. Now, does that mean anything to you? Because it apparently means nothing to federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who presided over the case against Roger Stone in the Manafort case. In a recent decision, the judge went on an anti-Trump rant. The Obama pointed judge even pushed an unrelated conspiracy theory, Roger Stone was covering up for President Trump. He wasn't part of the Trump campaign.  And that's not all. She also claimed that Stone's jurors served with integrity. OK. We got a big problem with that lie because the jury foreperson outed herself on social media as a compromised anti-Trump and anti-Roger Stone activist, referring to President Trump as a member of the Ku Klux Klan, calling all Trump supporter's, that will be Roger Stone, racist, and she even tweeted about Stone directly. In January 2019, applauding the late night raid of Stone's Florida home. So, let me get this straight. You got, let's see, Mueller prosecutors wanted to rock up Roger Stone for nine years because he allegedly lied to Congress. Then a jury led by a Trump-hating foreperson, a Stone-hating foreperson, will convict him on all counts, that is a Schiff sham show. And Trump-hating media, Obama appointee, you know, gives them 40 months in prison? We're supposed to be OK with this? Now, keep in mind, most of Stone's charges, process charges. Lying to Congress allegations. We'll scroll all of the other lies, but first, we got to introduce our guest. We'll scroll them on the side of our screen. David Schoen was in the courtroom today, criminal defense attorney. Geraldo Rivera is with us, and Dan Bongino. Let's go on to the courtroom first with David Schoen.  David, what did you see today? Because what I saw it as a travesty of justice. This was a tainted jury. That woman should not -- should have first told the judge, she had been thrown off the jury panel from the get- go.

The Article 3 courts, the courts I work in every day of my life, she denigrated them with her speech at sentencing. She accused Stone of covering up for President Trump, had nothing to do with it, and she said because of Stone, Nunes' House committee got things wrong. Devin Nunes spokesman said he had a 200-page report, there was maybe one line about Roger Stone.

Shannon, this is now very unprecedented, and in many ways, they're identifying a political point of view, which then might put them in a position where people would rightly justify calling for recusal. SHANNON BREAM, HOST, \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\": Yes, and that's the question the president has tonight. You mentioned Senator Cruz pulling no punches, saying about that Sotomayor dissent, quote, I read it a little bit like an arsonist complaining about the noise from the fire trucks. Now, he adds to President Trump, continuing to point to statements from both Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg from asking how it is possible they don't have to recuse themselves from cases involving the president. Well, the Supreme Court is the one federal court in which judges, in this case, justices, can't be forced to recuse themselves. So, to remind our viewers what the president is referring to, here's a review of what Justice Ginsburg said back during the 2016 presidential campaign. She told the AP When asked about a possible Trump presidency, I don't want to think about that possibility. To \"The New York Times\", quote: I can't imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president. Adding, for the courts, it could be, I don't even want to contemplate that. To CNN, she asked, how has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? Now, to a lot of people, that seems particularly significant in retrospect since these justices will consider a trio of cases aimed at getting access to the president's tax and financial records in March. Well, the lawyers committee for civil rights under law says the president's call for the justices to recuse themselves is deeply disturbing. They call it unprecedented, saying the president is actively trying to undermine the independence of the judiciary.

We don't know how many other FISA warrants have either been altered or changed or if there was anything added to them. So this is the reason why the FISA court itself, under Rosemary Collier, was demanding that they review all of the FISAs, and it's the reason why Michael Horowitz is actually asking to review all of those come as well. The big fight here in the next two weeks, that's on -- right around March 14th, there's the sunset clause, is whether or not Congress will stick to their guns and not allow FISA to renew, or will they allow a renewal based on what Mitch McConnell wants, and based on what Attorney General Bill Barr will do to change the system from within.",

In this country, the CDC and National Institutes of Health expect coronavirus to spread, but because it is a brand-new virus, they don't know how much, how fast, or how severe the disease will be. But they also warn Americans that preventing the spread could lead to big time life disruptions, like closing schools, canceling flights, and other big crowd events. Worldwide, there are more than 80,000 cases and 37 countries, and more than 2,700 people have died. The CDC says the disease is primarily spread through person-to-person contact from people who are within about six feet of each other. And it is most contagious when people are the sickest. It is interesting that in Wuhan province in China, the disease spread very fast, but in this country, so far, not so fast. In fact, all 53 of those infected in the U.S. either came off of cruise ship quarantined in Japan, or came back from China. Finally, the fear is certainly battering markets.

It involves numerous issues. Julian Assange versus Hillary Clinton, and the great injustice in the Roger Stone case. There in the Stone case, a travesty of justice. We have all of the details tonight, and an insane judge in that particular case. Plus, we will have reaction and analysis to the very latest news from the Democrats' latest nasty, bare-knuckle brawl political my fight. It was another Schiff show. Oh, and yes, farmer Bloomberg admitting, oh, yes, I try -- I bought the House of Representatives for Pelosi. Great move. But, first, breaking only moments ago, big news for Republicans -- eight elected officials in Mississippi have announced they are switching from Democrats and independents to the Republican Party. Now, the Mississippi GOP expects that more announcements will follow soon. Also breaking tonight, more good news, look at this, in the state of Kentucky, special election, Republican just won a statehouse district that has been in Democratic control since the 1980s. This is a preview of coming attractions, major news, potential barometer for things to come. Full election analysis is only moments away tonight. But we do start with Bolshevik Bernie Sanders, who just can't seem to help himself. Now, the Democratic front-runner is doubling down on his effusive praise of communism. Sure, Castro murdered tens of thousands of his own citizens. He locked up political dissidents, confiscated private property, outlawed all freedoms and induced widespread starvation and poverty. But according to Bolshevik Bernie, Fidel Castro's literacy program made it all worth it, which is why literally hundreds of thousands of Cubans, let's see, risked their lives in broken down, rickety, dilapidated boats and shark infested waters in inner tubes in the hopes of getting here, and thankfully, many did. Take a look."

      "speaker": "Now, either Bolshevik Bernie is incredibly stupid or he thinks we, the people, are incredibly stupid. His radical brand of Soviet-style socialism is about one thing and one thing only",
      "utterance": "that is government control and takeover of every aspect of our lives. Now, and every socialist hellhole, from Venezuela to Cuba to the USSR, his honeymoon place, the process is always the same. It all starts with the nationalism of major industry and promises -- oh, the government is going to give everyone everything for free. We're going to take care of everything for you. Well, that's what the New Green Deal is all about. That's what Medicare- for-All is all about. And Bolshevik Bernie is literally plotting a government takeover of two of America's largest industries. And make no mistake, this could easily cost over $100 trillion in the next ten years. But don't worry, Bernie has a plan to cover the cost and you are all going to pay for it. Today, he actually rolled out nine, that's right, nine, brand-new tax hikes for all of you to enjoy. And by the way, here's what the fake news media will ignore -- to start, anybody that makes $29,000 a year is going to get slapped with a 4 percent tax increase. Up next, employers will get hit with an additional 7.5 percent payroll tax. By the way, they will pass that on to we, the consumers. High income earners, they're going now to get taxed a top federal rate of 52 percent. That's a 15 percent hike there. Capital gains, that will go through the roof. By the way, the death tax, if you paid taxes, after they steal more money with his wealth tax, and when you die, he's going to take 77 percent, that's the top rate. Wow, they tax you again. You have to pay to die in America. The corporate income tax rate will go up to 35 percent, a 14-point increase. A new cap on itemized tax deductions will be imposed. The oil and gas industry will be hit with $3 trillion tax increase. Wonder what they're going to do with the price of oil and gas? I guess we're going to pay that, too. And last but not least, large corporations of Bernie's choosing will get hit with a brand-new $2 trillion tax. Now, that will be a recipe for economic disaster, because corporations are not stupid. They are going to leave this country and take their business elsewhere, as will billionaires and millionaires. They are not going to give their wealth over to Bernie Sanders and his Bolshevik revolution. By the way, it still doesn't quite account for the trillions in new spending. And laughably, now, Bolshevik Bernie's campaign is claiming that his insane programs will magically create 20 million new jobs. He was saying the other night that we're going to lose jobs under his plan. And, by the way, he is also claiming it will magically save the government trillions of dollars and that will make the funding gap. I know he's old, so he may not have a calculator yet. Maybe somebody can update his abacus and give poor Bernie a new calculator. Maybe buy him an iPhone or something, because his math won't ever add up. But tonight, I do have to hand it to Bernie, from his unyielding praise of communism, bragging about oppressive new taxes, well, he is at least slightly more honest than his opponents -- Medicare for All, Green New Deal, late-term abortions, elimination of the Second Amendment, open borders, free health care for illegal immigrants. Oh, we not only have sanctuary cities but a sanctuary country. They all pretty much want the same thing. All of these Democrats, they are all radical, extreme socialists. But Bolshevik Bernie's raw candor about the radical Democratic Party's platform is making them a little nervous. Just don't tell everybody this is what we think. They know the American people won't buy it, so now, figuratively -- well, they are speaking out against Bernie. Take a look."

Tonight, we have uncovered another article to show you. By the way, viewer warning, it is just as sick and creepy is what we told you about last night. This piece, 1969, Sanders writing, quote: Now, if children go around naked -- well, they are liable to see each other's sexual organs and maybe even touch them. A terrible thing. If we raise children up like this, it will probably ruin the whole pornography business. His words, not mine. By the way, he's a grown adult man, and he wrote that? Something wrong with this guy.

Second, Marxism is based on the belief that an employer and an employee, a worker and an owner, can't both help each other and both be better off. The worker gets good pay. The employer makes a profit on the capital they've invested. But his ideas are Marxist ideas, and Marxism always leads to authoritarianism and dictatorship, eventually. It does everywhere in the world it's been tried. And as you point out, in my home state of Florida, we have hundreds of thousands of people who have come to this country fleeing some of the very same policies that we're now seeing advocated on a debate stage in one of our two major political parties.

Number one, Nordic countries are actually not socialist. You know, I used to actually buy into that. And you look at it carefully, it's not true. They have free enterprise. The average corporate tax rate in Nordic countries is around 21 percent. They don't have a minimum wage. In Sweden, they have universal school choice for everybody. So, they have a big welfare state, but they do -- and they have high taxes -- but they are not socialist countries. Now, what they're talking what is nationalizing health care.

If you do care about constitutional governments, if you care about the rule of law, equal justice under the law, equal application of our laws, you've got to pay attention. Now, we have a case, extradition case, going on in London as we speak. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is facing extradition to the U.S., indicted on 18 violations of the Espionage Act for publishing classified material. Let's see, has anyone ever read the Pentagon Papers, by the way? Might want to read that. By the way, you know that is the case with the Supreme Court ruled journalists have the right to publish leaked, classified material from the Vietnam War? That's a landmark case. Put aside whatever the legal issues are here for a second, and discuss the irony of these charges. Julian Assange, what they are now saying they want to bring him to this country for would be facing the Espionage Act publishing otherwise, quote, secret materials, from they say, Russia. He denied it when I interviewed him. But Hillary Clinton's secret server, let's see, had top secret, classified information on it, a clear violation of the Espionage Act. Where are those charges? Now, also, what else are they talking about? Clinton faced a zero charges for, let's see, funneling money, through a law firm, to hire an op research firm to hire a foreign spy and paying for Russian dirt on Donald Trump. She paid for Russian disinformation, or as \"The New York Times\" now recognizes, a little late, it was Russian disinformation right from the start. And Hillary Clinton literally colluded with a foreign government. OK. Why isn't she being held accountable? She paid for Russian lies. By the way, in my interview with Assange in January, put it up on my Twitter account if you want to watch the whole interview. January 2017, I asked him six separate times, and he denied ever getting anything from Russia. OK, maybe you agree or disagree, which, even if he did, at least, he didn't have to pay for it like Hillary Clinton. That would be on equal justice under the law. If you are going to say, oh, with to bring this guy here, why isn't she arrested for the Espionage Act? Why isn't she arrested for paying for Russian lies? Now, it's undisputed, it is clear, there is a paper trail. We know the dossier author Christopher Steele on record testifying about that dirty dossier, even saying he has no idea any of it is true. Clear evidence that two far left hacks pretending to be journalist, David Corn, Michael Isikoff, conspiracy theorists, leaked the dossier information. Why? To help the Democrats rigged the election with her Russian bought and paid-for lies. When I interviewed Julian Assange, I asked him over and over again about his sources. He consistently denied working with Russia or any other state actor. But we know Hillary paid for it. Take a look."

That's separate and apart, by the way, from the fact that Hillary Clinton paid for Russian lies to influence the election. How come she's not being arrested? How come she's not having charges brought up on her? This is a lack of equal justice under the law. The question remains, OK, Julian Assange is aggressively targeting for publishing material, where are the charges for Hillary Clinton, who paid for Russian lies and colluded with Russia and paid for the Russian lies and used it in the 2016 campaign? This is just one part of our dual system of justice in this country. You want to talk about more unequal justice? All right, let's look at the Sixth Amendment. That was the one that guarantees, quote, in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an impartial jury. Now, does that mean anything to you? Because it apparently means nothing to federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who presided over the case against Roger Stone in the Manafort case. In a recent decision, the judge went on an anti-Trump rant. The Obama pointed judge even pushed an unrelated conspiracy theory, Roger Stone was covering up for President Trump. He wasn't part of the Trump campaign. And that's not all. She also claimed that Stone's jurors served with integrity. OK. We got a big problem with that lie because the jury foreperson outed herself on social media as a compromised anti-Trump and anti-Roger Stone activist, referring to President Trump as a member of the Ku Klux Klan, calling all Trump supporter's, that will be Roger Stone, racist, and she even tweeted about Stone directly. In January 2019, applauding the late night raid of Stone's Florida home. So, let me get this straight. You got, let's see, Mueller prosecutors wanted to rock up Roger Stone for nine years because he allegedly lied to Congress. Then a jury led by a Trump-hating foreperson, a Stone-hating foreperson, will convict him on all counts, that is a Schiff sham show. And Trump-hating media, Obama appointee, you know, gives them 40 months in prison? We're supposed to be OK with this? Now, keep in mind, most of Stone's charges, process charges. Lying to Congress allegations. We'll scroll all of the other lies, but first, we got to introduce our guest. We'll scroll them on the side of our screen. David Schoen was in the courtroom today, criminal defense attorney. Geraldo Rivera is with us, and Dan Bongino. Let's go on to the courtroom first with David Schoen. David, what did you see today? Because what I saw it as a travesty of justice. This was a tainted jury. That woman should not -- should have first told the judge, she had been thrown off the jury panel from the get- go. Never should have been on that jury. She never n disclosed that. New trial, end of sentence. And as it relates to Assange, Hillary bought and paid for Russian lies."

      "speaker": "DAVID SCHOEN, DEFENSE ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "First of all, let me clear up one thing. The courtroom was closed to spectators by the judge. She had a compromise. She allowed people to listen to it. But, listen, the juror and judge appeared to be kindred spirits. You talk about a lack of fairness, the judge professed to care about the integrity of the system. The Article 3 courts, the courts I work in every day of my life, she denigrated them with her speech at sentencing. She accused Stone of covering up for President Trump, had nothing to do with it, and she said because of Stone, Nunes' House committee got things wrong. Devin Nunes spokesman said he had a 200-page report, there was maybe one line about Roger Stone. The Mueller-Weissmann team had the information they claimed Stone denied, they didn't find Russia collusion. This wasn't about covering up for Trump. The judge talking could have been Mr. Schiff or Mr. Nadler. It denigrates our process and the integrity of our courts."

And, you know, these types of lapse (ph) are usually are laugh off, they're harmless, they don't usually impact the bottom line for a candidate, unless they reinforce a negative preconceived notion of that candidate. And with Joe Biden, as you've alluded to, Joe -- Sean, you have this idea that his candidacy is missing something, is missing a step, is missing some sort of passion. And they became four years too late, eight years too late, whatever the number may be, because he's not clearly as engaged as you would imagine a proverbial front-runner should be.

Senator Ted Cruz had very sharp words for Justice Sotomayor. \"FOX News @ Night\" host, our own Shannon Bream, now joins us to explain. Shannon, this is now very unprecedented, and in many ways, they're identifying a political point of view, which then might put them in a position where people would rightly justify calling for recusal. SHANNON BREAM, HOST, \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\": Yes, and that's the question the president has tonight. You mentioned Senator Cruz pulling no punches, saying about that Sotomayor dissent, quote, I read it a little bit like an arsonist complaining about the noise from the fire trucks. Now, he adds to President Trump, continuing to point to statements from both Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg from asking how it is possible they don't have to recuse themselves from cases involving the president. Well, the Supreme Court is the one federal court in which judges, in this case, justices, can't be forced to recuse themselves. So, to remind our viewers what the president is referring to, here's a review of what Justice Ginsburg said back during the 2016 presidential campaign. She told the AP When asked about a possible Trump presidency, I don't want to think about that possibility. To \"The New York Times\", quote: I can't imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president. Adding, for the courts, it could be, I don't even want to contemplate that. To CNN, she asked, how has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? Now, to a lot of people, that seems particularly significant in retrospect since these justices will consider a trio of cases aimed at getting access to the president's tax and financial records in March. Well, the lawyers committee for civil rights under law says the president's call for the justices to recuse themselves is deeply disturbing. They call it unprecedented, saying the president is actively trying to undermine the independence of the judiciary. I reached out tonight, both justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor are declining comment, as is the chief justice, for now, John Roberts -- Sean."

That's all of our phone records, text messages, who we talk to, not the contents of those messages. But I want you to think about this. What happened to Carter Page is only what we know of. We don't know how many other FISA warrants have either been altered or changed or if there was anything added to them. So this is the reason why the FISA court itself, under Rosemary Collier, was demanding that they review all of the FISAs, and it's the reason why Michael Horowitz is actually asking to review all of those come as well. The big fight here in the next two weeks, that's on -- right around March 14th, there's the sunset clause, is whether or not Congress will stick to their guns and not allow FISA to renew, or will they allow a renewal based on what Mitch McConnell wants, and based on what Attorney General Bill Barr will do to change the system from within."

When we come back, all right, the Center for Disease Control issued a dire warning about the coronavirus and how it could impact the U.S. Trace Gallagher has that full report. Karl Rove has his whiteboard, and well, guess what? South Carolina is on Saturday. Super Tuesday one week from tonight, straight ahead."

      "utterance": "Sean, the World Health Organization now says coronavirus fits the criteria Disease X, meaning it has the potential to reach international epidemic levels like Ebola, SARS or the Zika virus. The designation is not meant to frighten the world but rather to get the world to think about how to prepare. In this country, the CDC and National Institutes of Health expect coronavirus to spread, but because it is a brand-new virus, they don't know how much, how fast, or how severe the disease will be. But they also warn Americans that preventing the spread could lead to big time life disruptions, like closing schools, canceling flights, and other big crowd events. Worldwide, there are more than 80,000 cases and 37 countries, and more than 2,700 people have died. The CDC says the disease is primarily spread through person-to-person contact from people who are within about six feet of each other. And it is most contagious when people are the sickest. It is interesting that in Wuhan province in China, the disease spread very fast, but in this country, so far, not so fast. In fact, all 53 of those infected in the U.S. either came off of cruise ship quarantined in Japan, or came back from China. Finally, the fear is certainly battering markets. The Dow is down 1,911 points in two days. One of the worries for the U.S. is the rapid outbreak in Italy might soon affect European economic hubs like Germany, Switzerland, and Austria -- Sean."

He now has an initial offer with the DHS of $2.5 billion for -- to fight the coronavirus. Democrats are saying it's not enough. Well, let's spent the $2.5 billion first and get moving, and not politicize illness the way they're doing it. Thank you, Trace. Sadly, the left is already, yes, fully politicizing tragedy. The Trump administration is seeking $2.5 billion in funds to fight this deadly disease. Here to react to that and, of course, well, a crazy group of Democratic radical socialists that want to be president, the architect Karl Rove with a whiteboard. $2.5 billion seems like a lot of money, Karl, and we're not going to support this it is not a enough. How about we start with $2.5 billion?"

Francis Collins, the director, an extraordinary human being. Tony Fauci, one of the heroes --"

And these are people who are helping the Acting Homeland Secretary Chad Wolf and the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, two terrific individuals. These five people are helping plan this. Three of them are completely apolitical. Schumer is trying to politicize something that should be left alone. If these top professionals, Redfield, Collins, Fauci thought the $2.5 billion was insufficient, they would be saying so. The president is paying close attention to them, this ought to be done outside of politics. Stop it, Schumer. This is not good for our country."

It's going to take 1,991 of them to win, 101 of them have been elected, 2.5 percent of the total number of delegates have been elected, 2.5 percent. And it's all over. We know how it is going to play out. The New York Times, 45 delegates for Sanders, 25 for Buttigieg. He only has to get 43 times that amount in order to get the number he needs in order to win. He only got to get 45 times that. This is fit (ph) right at the beginning."
