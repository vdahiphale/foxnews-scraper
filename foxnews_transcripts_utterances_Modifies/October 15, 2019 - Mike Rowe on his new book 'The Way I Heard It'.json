      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Thirty years goes pretty fast. Thirty years ago, it was the fall of 1989, believe it or not -- it seems like yesterday. And at the time, if you can remember that far back, America seemed unbeatable. Our chief rival, the Soviet Union had just collapsed. Our economy and military strength dwarfed those of every nation on the planet. America in 1989 was the uncontested leader of the world free and otherwise.  But just three decades later, that advantage has evaporated completely. Instead of expanding and solidifying our power, we've wasted it. And as a result, we're now in the race of our lives against a country that in 1989 was so poor that many of its people could not afford meat or electricity -- China. And at this rate, China will beat us.  So the question is, how did America fall so far so fast? And the answer is simple, bad leadership. The people who benefited the most from this country cared about it the least. They were also the quickest to sell it out to foreign powers for profit.  That's obvious now, thanks to people like LeBron James. James, of course, is one of the most famous athletes in history, but he started off at the very bottom. He was born to an impoverished 16-year-old mother in Akron, Ohio. He never went to college. And yet, thanks to hard work and remarkable skill, James's endorsement income alone now exceeds $15 million a year.  If there's anyone whose life is a tribute to America, to its decency, to its endless opportunity, it's LeBron James. In return, he showers America with contempt. Just yesterday, James was asked to comment on the NBA executive who issued a one-line statement in supportive democracy in Hong Kong. Here's how LeBron James responded.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's the American President he is talking to. Well, if you read James's Twitter feed, you won't be surprised to learn any of this quote, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,\" he tweeted once. \"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\"  Okay, well, obviously, things that matter does not include throwing Muslims in concentration camps in China or the oppression of more than a billion people in China.  So what does matter to LeBron James and his friends in our ruling class? Well, the first thing they care about is popularity and that's what they're delighted to weigh in politically, when it's fashionable in West Los Angeles bashing the administration or protesting the National Anthem or re- tweeting and supportive transgender rights or whatever.   Their friends call them brave when they do this, which is one of the indications it's not bravery, it's conformity, which is the opposite usually. The other thing that James and the rest care about, of course, is money. When you criticize Beijing, it might cost you money. Here's a perfect example.  LeBron James is both starring in and producing an upcoming film called \"Space Jam 2.\" The movie is expected to do big business in China, if it's released there. And James can't risk that.  The rest of Hollywood made the same decision many years ago. We used to see occasionally movies that criticize the dictatorship of China or took the side of Tibet. Remember Richard Gere, whatever happened to him? But not anymore. In fact, that's unimaginable. You can't imagine a major Hollywood picture taking the side of Tibet or Hong Kong, or the Dalai Lama or human rights in China, the world's largest country. No. Instead, studios now grovel for Chinese funding. And if China appears in films at all, it's always in a positive portrayal. Meanwhile, Russia, which is a completely an irrelevant country, most of the time is subverting our democracy. That's what they tell us. This is what corruption looks like.   Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports will be weighing in on all of this in just a minute, but first tonight, Clay Travis of Fox Sports Radio is the author of the book \"Republicans Buy Sneakers, Too,\" apparently sort of Chinese communists. Clay Travis joins us today.  Clay, thanks so much for coming on tonight. So, I mean, I don't think anyone would have a problem if sports figures want to stay out of politics more generally. But James, he is not wildly political or anything, but he does regularly weigh in on American politics. So do many of them. But the idea of criticizing the fascist government of China is over the line. How does this work?",

      "sentences": "I think you've nailed it. It's all about money, Tucker, and first, thanks for having me on.  Second, LeBron James is one of the biggest hypocrites in all of sports. You hit on it. Look, if he had decided to stay out of politics, if the NBA had decided to stay out of politics, they could have dominated by just selling their overall brand of basketball to a market that loves basketball. But the NBA decided it wasn't good enough to be a basketball league, they had to be a woke basketball league.  And as part of that, they pulled their All-Star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina over a transgender bathroom bill. They took away the word owner and replaced it with the word governor because they decided it was racially insensitive. And that was a conversation that came out of LeBron James's barbershop show. And so this to me is a major shot across the bow of the NBA and I think you hit on something that's really important here in the larger scale.   Back in 1997, twenty years ago, when we started taking our movies to China, they were saying, okay, you can play the movie here, but we've got to take out two minutes. We don't want to offend people inside China. We're going to allow our censorship to play here.  Note what's going on with this Daryl Morey tweet. China is not saying to the NBA, hey, play by our rules in inside the country. They are saying we expect our rules which govern our country to also go outside the border of the country, and that's massive. And I think why to the credit of the NBA, they managed to do something that's almost impossible. They got AOC and Ted Cruz to sign a joint letter, saying the NBA was intolerable the way they had responded, which at least is an element of bipartisanship. That's how bad the NBA position was here.",

What LeBron James has been willing to do is speak out when there's no cost whatsoever for him. He can call Donald Trump a bum. He can refuse to meet with him, but yet he will go to Communist China and he will bow, he will genuflect at the altar of the Chinese Communist government, and that is such an inherent hypocrisy.  If he wanted to be Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali said, I ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong. He went to battle. He risked his title. He risked his life, his liberty in the United States to fight for something he believed in. LeBron James had an opportunity here, Tucker and this is what's so disappointing to me.

Yes, he would raise money for her. But they were -- he was very involved in a number of different dynamics and he was seen with her. They were considered, you know, kind of buddies in a certain way. At one point when the #MeToo movement started, one actress had noted that she had tried to tell Hillary to stop having fundraisers with Harvey Weinstein, because he was a bad, bad man, and that was ignored. So now you've got Ronan Farrow and we talked about respecting Chris Hayes. Ronan Farrow has a great book with a lot of different details. Of course, these are assertions and allegations and many people are denying what he is asserting.

To get a job at Harvard Law, of course, you know, she claimed to be a person of color, an American Indian. She said she was fired from a teaching job for getting pregnant when the evidence shows that's completely untrue. And now, a \"Washington Post\" story this morning describes how Warren once eulogized a dead colleague by telling his grieving children that the man had sexually harassed her by literally chasing her around in circles in this office. One problem with that story, the man she accused of chasing her was a polio victim. He couldn't chase anybody. Howie Carr is a radio host, author of the book \"What Really Happened.\" He joins us tonight. Probably not surprised, Howie by this latest story, I would think.",

He was a Law Professor when she became at the University of Houston, when she first became a Law Professor, a baby Law Professor, as she liked to put it, you know, in her folksy down home manner. And so when he died in 1997, she went to the wake or the memorial service and eulogized him and talked about this funny incident once when he chased around -- chased her around the desk. He liked her, he found her attractive. So 20 years pass. She is a senator and the #MeToo Movement starts. Harvey Weinstein, \"Meet the Press\" says to these female senators, Democrats, do you have a #MeToo story? If you have a #MeToo story, you can come on \"Meet the Press.\" So suddenly the tall tale evolves from this avuncular Professor Eugene Smith, Mr. Chips. He becomes a Harvey Weinstein predator at \"Meet the Press\" and she says he was chasing around. And he lunged for her and she balled up her fist and was getting ready to punch him. She finally escaped after several times around the desk. She ran out of the office, came back to her office. She was shaking, and she wore brown afterwards.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Thirty years goes pretty fast. Thirty years ago, it was the fall of 1989, believe it or not -- it seems like yesterday. And at the time, if you can remember that far back, America seemed unbeatable. Our chief rival, the Soviet Union had just collapsed. Our economy and military strength dwarfed those of every nation on the planet. America in 1989 was the uncontested leader of the world free and otherwise. But just three decades later, that advantage has evaporated completely. Instead of expanding and solidifying our power, we've wasted it. And as a result, we're now in the race of our lives against a country that in 1989 was so poor that many of its people could not afford meat or electricity -- China. And at this rate, China will beat us. So the question is, how did America fall so far so fast? And the answer is simple, bad leadership. The people who benefited the most from this country cared about it the least. They were also the quickest to sell it out to foreign powers for profit. That's obvious now, thanks to people like LeBron James. James, of course, is one of the most famous athletes in history, but he started off at the very bottom. He was born to an impoverished 16-year-old mother in Akron, Ohio. He never went to college. And yet, thanks to hard work and remarkable skill, James's endorsement income alone now exceeds $15 million a year. If there's anyone whose life is a tribute to America, to its decency, to its endless opportunity, it's LeBron James. In return, he showers America with contempt. Just yesterday, James was asked to comment on the NBA executive who issued a one-line statement in supportive democracy in Hong Kong. Here's how LeBron James responded."

And he spoke, and so many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do, even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So freedom of speech is just fine says LeBron James, as long as you don't do anything crazy with it, like I don't know, obliquely bleakly criticize the Chinese Communist Party. No, that's out of bounds. It might harm people spiritually. It also might potentially make LeBron James slightly less rich. And of course, that's the real problem with it. Think we're being unfair? Think that's an unfair interpretation of what you just saw? Well, according to ESPN, LeBron James has been adamant in his defense of Chinese fascism. Even off camera, watch this."

You know, damn well, if a player made the same similar statements and cause such war ramifications for the league, there'd be some sort of league recourse, there would be repercussions that the player has to pay. You know, potentially, this tweet could cost the NBA hundreds of millions of dollars, which could come out of the players' pockets. And so that's the double standard that was being addressed in that meeting."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's the American President he is talking to. Well, if you read James's Twitter feed, you won't be surprised to learn any of this quote, \"Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,\" he tweeted once. \"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\" Okay, well, obviously, things that matter does not include throwing Muslims in concentration camps in China or the oppression of more than a billion people in China. So what does matter to LeBron James and his friends in our ruling class? Well, the first thing they care about is popularity and that's what they're delighted to weigh in politically, when it's fashionable in West Los Angeles bashing the administration or protesting the National Anthem or re- tweeting and supportive transgender rights or whatever. Their friends call them brave when they do this, which is one of the indications it's not bravery, it's conformity, which is the opposite usually. The other thing that James and the rest care about, of course, is money. When you criticize Beijing, it might cost you money. Here's a perfect example. LeBron James is both starring in and producing an upcoming film called \"Space Jam 2.\" The movie is expected to do big business in China, if it's released there. And James can't risk that. The rest of Hollywood made the same decision many years ago. We used to see occasionally movies that criticize the dictatorship of China or took the side of Tibet. Remember Richard Gere, whatever happened to him? But not anymore. In fact, that's unimaginable. You can't imagine a major Hollywood picture taking the side of Tibet or Hong Kong, or the Dalai Lama or human rights in China, the world's largest country. No. Instead, studios now grovel for Chinese funding. And if China appears in films at all, it's always in a positive portrayal. Meanwhile, Russia, which is a completely an irrelevant country, most of the time is subverting our democracy. That's what they tell us. This is what corruption looks like. Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports will be weighing in on all of this in just a minute, but first tonight, Clay Travis of Fox Sports Radio is the author of the book \"Republicans Buy Sneakers, Too,\" apparently sort of Chinese communists. Clay Travis joins us today. Clay, thanks so much for coming on tonight. So, I mean, I don't think anyone would have a problem if sports figures want to stay out of politics more generally. But James, he is not wildly political or anything, but he does regularly weigh in on American politics. So do many of them. But the idea of criticizing the fascist government of China is over the line. How does this work?"

      "speaker": "CLAY TRAVIS, FOX SPORTS RADIO",
      "utterance": "I think you've nailed it. It's all about money, Tucker, and first, thanks for having me on. Second, LeBron James is one of the biggest hypocrites in all of sports. You hit on it. Look, if he had decided to stay out of politics, if the NBA had decided to stay out of politics, they could have dominated by just selling their overall brand of basketball to a market that loves basketball. But the NBA decided it wasn't good enough to be a basketball league, they had to be a woke basketball league. And as part of that, they pulled their All-Star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina over a transgender bathroom bill. They took away the word owner and replaced it with the word governor because they decided it was racially insensitive. And that was a conversation that came out of LeBron James's barbershop show. And so this to me is a major shot across the bow of the NBA and I think you hit on something that's really important here in the larger scale. Back in 1997, twenty years ago, when we started taking our movies to China, they were saying, okay, you can play the movie here, but we've got to take out two minutes. We don't want to offend people inside China. We're going to allow our censorship to play here. Note what's going on with this Daryl Morey tweet. China is not saying to the NBA, hey, play by our rules in inside the country. They are saying we expect our rules which govern our country to also go outside the border of the country, and that's massive. And I think why to the credit of the NBA, they managed to do something that's almost impossible. They got AOC and Ted Cruz to sign a joint letter, saying the NBA was intolerable the way they had responded, which at least is an element of bipartisanship. That's how bad the NBA position was here."

He tried to brand himself as the modern day Muhammad Ali. Well, you talked about the necessity for bravery. It means risking something -- money, life, liberty -- something. What LeBron James has been willing to do is speak out when there's no cost whatsoever for him. He can call Donald Trump a bum. He can refuse to meet with him, but yet he will go to Communist China and he will bow, he will genuflect at the altar of the Chinese Communist government, and that is such an inherent hypocrisy. If he wanted to be Muhammad Ali. Muhammad Ali said, I ain't got no quarrel with the Viet Cong. He went to battle. He risked his title. He risked his life, his liberty in the United States to fight for something he believed in. LeBron James had an opportunity here, Tucker and this is what's so disappointing to me. If you want to be political, LeBron James last night you had an opportunity to say, you know what, I'm an American. I went from nothing. I've risen to the point where one day I might be a billionaire."

For one of their early protests, this is a city of seven and a half million people, two million people in the streets.

Like this moment has -- well, I saw through him the whole time. He's a hypocrite. He'll say, you know, people go to LA, they don't care about basketball. That's why they look -- He is a hypocrite. His kid -- he'll say stuff about his kid. He doesn't too much pressure, yet he named him LeBron James, Jr. I mean, everything he says is hypocritical. This may be the issue where people finally wake up. Because like what you've said, it doesn't matter what side of the aisle he is on, it doesn't matter. Everybody agrees. This is about basic human decency. And you care more about your money and becoming a billionaire. That's it."

They were allowed to call witnesses, take testimony. But none of that is happening here. This is all being done behind closed doors. It is being done with the Republicans permitted to attend and ask questions, but not to call witnesses. And what happens, of course, is that the witnesses come, they appear and then select portions of their testimony, which is not being made public, they are leaked, and creating the impression you would expect leak from that side of the aisle to create and it's working like crazy. I mean, look at what's happened, Tucker. Impeaching as a minority -- we had minority support in this country for the longest time since Ukraine has come along.

Most people at NBC at least will pretend to believe up Oppenheim's denials, but one won't.

One thing though, is indisputable. Ronan Farrow walked out of NBC News after working on the Weinstein story and within two months, published an incredible article at \"The New Yorker\" that not only won a Pulitzer, but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day. It is the kind of journalism that you want to do as a journalist that everyone works in this business shouldn't want to facilitate. The path of least resistance is always there, beckoning seductively with an entirely plausible cover story, you've got bigger fish to fry. This is the hill to die on. The story isn't ready.

Chris Hayes deserves credit. It takes bravery to defy someone who can fire you, and by the way, it's an ominous sign for Noah Oppenheim and Andy Lack. If Chris Hayes is going after you on live TV, you're in trouble. Well, NBC executives aren't the only ones who protected Harvey Weinstein. Farrow's book also describes how Hillary Clinton intervened on Harvey Weinstein's behalf and not only expressed concerns about Farrow's reporting, trying to push Farrow off the story. Tammy Bruce hosts \"Get Tammy Bruce\" on Fox Nation and she joins us tonight.

Ronan Farrow said that he was referred to or at least considered part of Hillary's brain trust. So it's not like they were just acquaintances who would meet at parties. Yes, he would raise money for her. But they were -- he was very involved in a number of different dynamics and he was seen with her. They were considered, you know, kind of buddies in a certain way. At one point when the #MeToo movement started, one actress had noted that she had tried to tell Hillary to stop having fundraisers with Harvey Weinstein, because he was a bad, bad man, and that was ignored. So now you've got Ronan Farrow and we talked about respecting Chris Hayes. Ronan Farrow has a great book with a lot of different details. Of course, these are assertions and allegations and many people are denying what he is asserting. But the fact is, he didn't need to bring up the fact that Hillary tried to intervene and quash this investigation if you will, but he did so anyway, because it was the right thing to do. But he also said it was a punch in the gut when this happened, and we've heard that quite often, haven't we, Tucker. Marianne Williamson shocked at how the left turned on her, right?"

You don't want to be surprised in the end when it really matters. So none of this is surprising, but it does tell you, he said it is the power protecting power. I would disagree. I would say that it is like defending like; that it is the nature of those in a certain position and it is having each having a button that they can threaten the other one with. And then whether it's like in Ronan's assertion is that it was Matt Lauer that NBC was threatened by Weinstein. He asserts that he had the goods on Matt Lauer, so you better stop this Ronan Farrow report. That's the kind of thing when everybody is doing something wrong, and something may be kind of awful, that they can, you know, use that as a bargaining chip.

I'm looking at Chris Hayes and the way he heard it, his employer might have swung and missed. And the way the Canadians just heard, well, it was just not being inclusive enough. And I guess maybe when I started writing this podcast called \"The Way I Heard It\" three years ago, in my mind, I was thinking, look, the last thing I want to do is make any more trouble or break any more eggs. I am a guy. I've got some opinions, and for whatever reason, people have invited me to share them. So I just started prefacing everything I said, with look, I am no expert, but the way I heard it, LeBron James kind of screwed the pooch on that one. Okay."

That's what my podcast has been. So somebody said you should take some of your favorite stories from that podcast and put them in a book, which I did. And then my mother read it and said, Michael, this is a very lazy way to write a book. You should intersperse these true stories of famous people that you've never met with true stories about your own misspent youth that in some way, rhyme with the aforementioned telling. So I said, mom, you've never steered me wrong. You know, she's got a bestselling book on \"New York Times\" list, so I said, okay."

So I never -- I never really did anything except write letters and mail them to friends. And you know, my mother has been writing me letters her whole life, and suddenly all her letters got published. And then I'm thinking, well, maybe, maybe I should do something, too. But honestly, I've never thought of myself as a writer's writer. I write because it's one of the few things left in my life that truly compresses time, if that makes sense."

And then you look up and you're landing and where did the time go? You know, so I always wrote because it did that to the space time continuum. The crazy thing with this podcast, we've done 150 episodes and a year ago, my producer called me and said, Mike, you've got 110 million downloads. Don't stop doing it. And then of course my hobby turned into a job and now here I sit promoting a book of the same title. But I'm not complaining because the way I heard it, I'm pretty lucky."

To get a job at Harvard Law, of course, you know, she claimed to be a person of color, an American Indian. She said she was fired from a teaching job for getting pregnant when the evidence shows that's completely untrue. And now, a \"Washington Post\" story this morning describes how Warren once eulogized a dead colleague by telling his grieving children that the man had sexually harassed her by literally chasing her around in circles in this office. One problem with that story, the man she accused of chasing her was a polio victim. He couldn't chase anybody. Howie Carr is a radio host, author of the book \"What Really Happened.\" He joins us tonight. Probably not surprised, Howie by this latest story, I would think."

He never fully regained the use of his limbs. He hobbled around on a walker. He smoked Lucky Strikes. He was wheezing. He was a Law Professor when she became at the University of Houston, when she first became a Law Professor, a baby Law Professor, as she liked to put it, you know, in her folksy down home manner. And so when he died in 1997, she went to the wake or the memorial service and eulogized him and talked about this funny incident once when he chased around -- chased her around the desk. He liked her, he found her attractive. So 20 years pass. She is a senator and the #MeToo Movement starts. Harvey Weinstein, \"Meet the Press\" says to these female senators, Democrats, do you have a #MeToo story? If you have a #MeToo story, you can come on \"Meet the Press.\" So suddenly the tall tale evolves from this avuncular Professor Eugene Smith, Mr. Chips. He becomes a Harvey Weinstein predator at \"Meet the Press\" and she says he was chasing around. And he lunged for her and she balled up her fist and was getting ready to punch him. She finally escaped after several times around the desk. She ran out of the office, came back to her office. She was shaking, and she wore brown afterwards."

Maybe I wasn't fired for being pregnant, but you tell your story to those terrible people who say I'm lying or you know --"
