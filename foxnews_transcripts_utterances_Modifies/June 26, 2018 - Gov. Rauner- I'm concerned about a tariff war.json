And the odd timing of remembering a World War II hero, Garlin Murl Conner, gone decades now, but his wife still here to accept an honor, a unique honor bestowed upon very few Americans, a Congressional Medal of Honor.  And if you think about it, we have had a week of squabbling and throwing out powers that be from restaurants and chasing others with harsh words, harsh comments, hearkening back to a time where we didn't do that sort of thing on the right or left. He was the genuine article, a reminder that it's still in us and is in our DNA.  The greatest generation, as it's been called, and properly so, but a reminder that we are the children and the grandchildren of that great generation. So it is in our DNA, not necessarily to be heroes, but to be human beings.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And you're watching \"Your World.\" And what a fitting way to begin the show where we take a look at the drama back and forth and put it in perspective, beginning first and foremost with some big news out of the U.S. Supreme Court essentially saying that the president's travel ban was, as implemented, OK, that it didn't violate the Constitution.  But it was within the narrowest of votes, a 5-4 vote. Shannon Bream at the Supreme Court on all of this.  Hey, Shannon.",

They call it the proclamation, the White House does. The president saying today he feels vindicated after all of these fights, after months of what he calls hysterical commentary from both the media and Democrats, who he says are unwilling to do what it takes, he believes, to secure the border.   Writing for the majority, the chief justice backed him up in today's 5-4 decision -- quote -- \"The proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes, preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted, and inducing other nations to improve their practices.\" And while the conservatives found the president was lawfully within his executive powers based on both the text of federal immigration law and the text itself of this travel ban, there were two separate strong dissents, including one by Justice Sotomayor, who said the majority was wrong to ignore the statements that President Trump had made on the campaign trail and when he was a candidate and also after being sworn in. She said this -- quote -- \"The president's statements, which the majority fails to address in its legal analysis, strongly support the conclusion that the proclamation was issued to express hostility towards Muslims and exclude them from the country.\"  A lot of demonstrators here at the court and critics are speaking out.",

It's a relatively narrow opinion. And, as Shannon pointed out, this is an opinion on a preliminary injunction, meaning, tell us what the law is while we try the case. So now it goes back to the trial court for people to say, OK, it's constitutional. Here's why it doesn't apply to me. So whoever wants to come in the country from one of the -- into the U.S. from one of these countries, whether they enter here in Brooklyn or whether they enter in Honolulu, gets a chance to get a trial now. They can't challenge its constitutionality.   But they have an opportunity to demonstrate to a trial court judge, a federal district court judge, why this ban doesn't apply to them.

And the odd timing of remembering a World War II hero, Garlin Murl Conner, gone decades now, but his wife still here to accept an honor, a unique honor bestowed upon very few Americans, a Congressional Medal of Honor. And if you think about it, we have had a week of squabbling and throwing out powers that be from restaurants and chasing others with harsh words, harsh comments, hearkening back to a time where we didn't do that sort of thing on the right or left. He was the genuine article, a reminder that it's still in us and is in our DNA. The greatest generation, as it's been called, and properly so, but a reminder that we are the children and the grandchildren of that great generation. So it is in our DNA, not necessarily to be heroes, but to be human beings. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And you're watching \"Your World.\" And what a fitting way to begin the show where we take a look at the drama back and forth and put it in perspective, beginning first and foremost with some big news out of the U.S. Supreme Court essentially saying that the president's travel ban was, as implemented, OK, that it didn't violate the Constitution. But it was within the narrowest of votes, a 5-4 vote. Shannon Bream at the Supreme Court on all of this. Hey, Shannon."

      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. Well, the president is celebrating today after months of legal wrangling, losses in the lower courts, and now three versions of this executive travel ban. They call it the proclamation, the White House does. The president saying today he feels vindicated after all of these fights, after months of what he calls hysterical commentary from both the media and Democrats, who he says are unwilling to do what it takes, he believes, to secure the border. Writing for the majority, the chief justice backed him up in today's 5-4 decision -- quote -- \"The proclamation is expressly premised on legitimate purposes, preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted, and inducing other nations to improve their practices.\" And while the conservatives found the president was lawfully within his executive powers based on both the text of federal immigration law and the text itself of this travel ban, there were two separate strong dissents, including one by Justice Sotomayor, who said the majority was wrong to ignore the statements that President Trump had made on the campaign trail and when he was a candidate and also after being sworn in. She said this -- quote -- \"The president's statements, which the majority fails to address in its legal analysis, strongly support the conclusion that the proclamation was issued to express hostility towards Muslims and exclude them from the country.\" A lot of demonstrators here at the court and critics are speaking out."

So now that they have outlined the contours of their reasoning, they're sending it back to the lower courts, so it will actually now be heard and decided on the merits. And, Neil, I won't be surprised if it ends up back here at the Supreme Court once that is done."

And the dissent said, you cannot fail to take that into account because that's what his motivation is. So if his motivation is to keep people out because they are Muslim, that changes the court's analysis and it requires the government to jump through a much higher bar in order to pass constitutional muster. But if the purpose of the proclamation is to, as the chief justice said, secure the nation's borders, further the president's ability to use congressional tools to keep people out, to force the countries from which they engage to engage in better vetting for people leaving there, all of which are all legitimate government roles..."

The majority says, if we keep looking at everything politicians say before they came into office in order to address the constitutionality of what they do when they're in office, there will be no end to our research into their words.

She is saying it was a bigoted decision, because this will rank with Korematsu, which is really one of what we call the dirty dozen, one of the 12 worst opinions in the history of the country, where the Supreme Court upheld the right of President Roosevelt to detain Japanese Americans without proving fault, just on the basis of their ancestry. The chief justice -- this rarely happens -- for the majority to address the dissent, the chief justice says, look, you used nice ruffles and flourishes. We all know horrible the Korematsu decision was, but this case has nothing to do with Korematsu. This isn't about locking people up. This is just saying go home until your country vets you better."

      "utterance": "I think he was aware -- the chief justice is very concerned about legacy and image. How will this opinion be viewed after he's no longer chief justice? I don't know if Justice Sotomayor's prediction will come to pass. But the chief justice was obviously concerned enough about it that he chose to address it in the majority opinion. It's a relatively narrow opinion. And, as Shannon pointed out, this is an opinion on a preliminary injunction, meaning, tell us what the law is while we try the case. So now it goes back to the trial court for people to say, OK, it's constitutional. Here's why it doesn't apply to me. So whoever wants to come in the country from one of the -- into the U.S. from one of these countries, whether they enter here in Brooklyn or whether they enter in Honolulu, gets a chance to get a trial now. They can't challenge its constitutionality. But they have an opportunity to demonstrate to a trial court judge, a federal district court judge, why this ban doesn't apply to them. And, as Shannon predicted, this is going to go on and on and on and eventually will come back to the Supreme Court. But the president's executive order remains in play, and is fully enforceable during the pendency of these trials."

Let's get the read on all this and the fallout from conservative commentator Jenna Ellis, The Wall Street Journal's Shelby Holliday, Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins. Michael, I will begin with you, because you have the view that this is one of those few decisions the Supreme Court, you know, makes that it will regret, that it will have to come back and address, right?"

      "speaker": "MICHAEL STARR HOPKINS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I do. I think this is going to end up going down in the realm of the Dred Scott decision, like the judge said, in the realm of Korematsu. I think the court here failed to look at intent. I think, now, in this third iteration of the executive order, I think there are some legitimate arguments about the constitutionality of it. But I think here the court failed to look at, what was the intent of the Trump administration? And when you look at that bake -- the cake baker's case, there, they did look at intent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "JENNA ELLIS, ATTORNEY",

If we're playing a chess game here, it doesn't matter what your intent is. It matters, can you move the knight to a specific position or not, according to the rules? So, the political fallout here is going to be a freefall up for the Trump administration, because this was a win for the rule of law, for the Constitution and for every American family. And because it was such a narrow vote, 5-4, and both in the travel ban decision and in the NIFLA case today, this is telling every American family who voted for President Trump that they made the right decision, because Justice Gorsuch is now on the bench. And at the James Dobson Family Institute, we hear from millions of families daily from our constituency and our network that talk about why families are important, why the rule of law is important, why their vote matters. And the Supreme Court today played by the rule of law, not by the politics."

      "utterance": "All right. Shelby, looking at this -- and we have this great immigration debate back and forth on the controversy over the separation of these kids from their parents at the border and then reuniting them, does this move the needle there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHELBY HOLLIDAY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, politically, this is an extremely important decision for -- basically for what you mentioned. Yes, this is a huge wind in the president's sails. He sees this as a huge victory for the White House. It certainly reaffirms the president's power when it comes to issues of national security and immigration. It also just underscores the importance of elections. Elections have consequences. And this was an extremely close decision that was decided by a justice that the president himself picked. So, it is likely to rile up the president's base. We also have seven states going to the polls today in primaries. So, it's unclear how it will play out on the ground and how it could play out in midterms, but it's certainly seen as a victory. And the president can turn, and he's already turning around and saying, hey, look, Democrats, I do have this power. I do have the authority to implement the rule of law and to crack down on illegal immigrants to secure our borders. And he sees this as related to his policy on the certain border. So, politically, yes, it will have consequences and it is important for the president."

      "speaker": "HOPKINS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, actually, I think that this is -- and I think Shelby is correct that the president believes that this is going to help him. But I think this is also going to get Democrats out to the polls in 2018 for the congressional elections, because now we're already hearing about Democratic groups coming together for protests over the weekend, not just now regarding immigration, but also regarding this Muslim ban. And so I think what we're going to see is Trump is going to feed his base. But this is going to be used by Democrats to also excite our base."

      "speaker": "ELLIS",
      "utterance": "I think it's going to move the political needle in terms of all of the people who voted for Trump in 2016 as kind of the lesser of two evils. This is going to reinforce that that was a right vote. And they are going to be actively support him. And even though Democrats -- the only thing they can complain about is that the politics actually don't matter to the Supreme Court. And so if we're looking at the people who do care, this is going to help President Trump."

Now Harley-Davidson in the middle of all this, says, we're leaving, taking a lot of jobs with us overseas. We don't want to be slapped with these tariffs.

Certainly, you look at what the administration and Congress have done together to reform our tax code, it's helped the American economy boom and it's certainly helped Illinois. Look at what the administration and Congress have done to reduce regulatory burden on American businesses. The American economy is very strong. And Illinois is doing much better as a result. So, you have got to applaud that. And clearly we have had unfair trade deals with many countries. And trying to change that is important and we should support it.

I think Mr. Strzok will be asked initially about the August 8, 2016, text message, where he said, \"No, no, he won't, we will stop him\" regarding the Trump presidency. You will recall that it was just nine days before that that he opened up on Papadopoulos and just six days after that statement that he said there was an insurance policy against the Trump presidency. One thing that we would like to really get to the bottom of is whether or not July 31 was truly the moment when the Trump investigation with Russia began or whether or not there was intelligence collected on the Trump campaign previously. Those are questions that Mr. Strzok is uniquely qualified to answer. And I hope we learn more tomorrow."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "One of the questions a lot of folks want to get clear from Mr. Strzok is what he knew and when he knew it. For example, in the context of his very disparaging remarks about then candidate Trump, was he privy, was Lisa Page privy to any information beyond their whatever personal contempt for then presidential candidate Trump was, that were they saying what they were saying in the context of some Russian rumors or collusion such that would prompt this type of comment? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, you're right. The question goes beyond just personal bias. The question is whether or not the bias of Peter Strzok manifested itself in the form of investigative decisions. Remember, Strzok was the lead investigator on the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. He was on the FBI's investigation into President Trump and Russia. And then he was drafted on to the Mueller probe. So, that is going three for three. And we ought to know whether or not there was bias in terms of the prioritization of the Trump-Russia investigation over the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation. You will recall that the inspector general said that he wasn't sure that it wasn't bias that resulted in a tamping down of the investigation of Hillary Clinton and acceleration of the Trump investigation. That would be very improper. And only questioning will fully illuminate that fact pattern."

I know a lot of comments and texts and individuals, obviously from Strzok to Lisa Page -- now we know about Andy McCabe and all -- who didn't think very much of Donald Trump and all these other unidentified agents who similarly didn't think much of Donald Trump, so had a clear bias against the guy. I have as yet to run into in all the study -- and I haven't read nearly the volumes on this as you have -- but in anything that I have read, not one agent that seemed to have a bias toward Donald Trump, liked Donald Trump."

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",

You will recall one attorney who also was on all three investigations was saying viva la resistance, literally associating himself with the resistance movement to the Trump presidency while he was serving at the Department of Justice and -- at the FBI, I should say. And so I think that we need to expose who these people are. We need to find out what evidence they handled, developed, what interviews they conducted, because you may see a lot of the evidence regarding the president as the fruit of the poisonous tree if it was collected improperly or in the absence of compliance with the law."

Well, if you're looking for someone blinking on this trade war stuff, it's not the president of the United States so far, indicating that the world needs us a lot more than we need them, particularly when it comes to China. So he's holding tight to his plan here to stick tariffs on any country that doesn't bend on this issue. Former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers Austan Goolsbee on that. Austan, always good to have you. He says this will work out, we will be better off for it. What do you think?"

And I perfectly understand he's not the first person to have an objection about the Chinese taking the intellectual property of American companies. President Bush, President Obama, President Clinton each tried different strategies to address that. I know that if you take all your allies and alienate them by threatening trade war against your allies, that doesn't help you negotiate with China to get them to do what you want on the China front. And it's actually more likely at this point that China is going to go to our own U.S. allies and get them to unite against us at the WTO than it is that we can get them to join our side. And I never thought I would have to say that, because it seems crazy. But I think there's a real danger that if we get in a hot trade war, that we're going to be talking about recession, not just in the United States, but for the -- for the whole globe."

But they have seen their market tank. I think it's technical -- the Shanghai has moved into the bear territory, in other words, fallen more than 20 percent off its highs, multiyear lows. Their currency is getting smacked around. Now they're doing everything they can to stimulate an economy that is hiccupping. So, they need us, to the point of the president, more than we need them. And they need to do a deal. They just don't want to lose their face here on this. What do you make of that?"

He's saying the U.S. is a bank that they're robbing. That's not how trade works. And when you look at China, how does putting tariffs on Germany and Canada help us to negotiate with China? It is backward. It's completely confused."

But his argument has already prompted the German automakers to say, well, we will drastically cut tariffs here. Hopefully, the German government will approve it, the European Central Bank will go through with it, the European Union. But they want to avoid this. So, where do you see this all going?"

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "Yes, look, I'm not sure, but let's say it was a setup. The president says it was an excuse. Then I guess my question is, why, when we pass the tax cut for corporations, did we include the provisions that are going to -- depending what country Harley-Davidson decides to move these jobs to, the Trump tax bill is going to give them a tax cut for doing this. So what were they thinking when they designed those provisions when they passed the tax bill? So, either way, it doesn't seem like it's good news."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I'm sure you have heard the administration flip it's around to say, whatever we lose on these Harley-Davidson jobs, if it's a few thousand, we have gained millions over the course of this 17, 18 months of the Trump administration that dwarfs whatever impact we're seeing here. You say?"

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "Correct. And let us hope it never happens. Let us hope it never happens. But if we get the 50, 100 or now the president is talking about $200 bill of tariffs on China, and China is saying they're going to embrace $200 billion of tariffs on the U.S., we get that, hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their jobs. So, let's hope that doesn't happen."

Why jeopardize that? I don't understand it. It violates the gunfighter's credo, which is, don't pick seven fights while carrying a six-shooter. And that's exactly where we are on this.

But I'm actually less concerned with Maxine Waters and more concerned with the bigger picture here. And that is that this is becoming the rule, instead of the exemption for political discourse on both the right and the left. And this kind of incivility is fine for liberals who think that the government has to regulate every part of social, cultural and civic life. But it's not OK for conservatives who believe in self-governance. Self- governance, in the absence of civility, is anarchy. It does not work. So it's OK for the left. I'm fine with them taking that road. I actually think it's better for us in 2018. But I don't want to see conservatives and Republicans going down the same path."

Chuck Schumer, he is really looking through the lens of, he needs to get some Democrats elected in some red states. So he's trying to broaden this, trying to pull back a little bit, so this is not used in campaign fodder against Democrats.

And we have got a barn burner of a battle going on in Staten Island, New York, for a congressional seat that might be swapped out by the incumbent who won it back from the guy who had to go to jail.

And really what we're looking for here is to see to what degree the Republican Party is becoming the party of Donald Trump. And I think most people will say that has already happened. But what is really interesting is that, when you go into places that favored Donald Trump in 2016, like this borough up by you guys, or in South Carolina, his approval rating remains really high, is actually extremely high in some of these places among Republican voters. And so what you see then is sort of a race to out-Trump each other. And I think we have had this happen in South Carolina. I think we have had this happen in New York.

And he's fairly -- some would consider him never-Trump, but even he and even that Romney have had to tread a pretty fine line. They are able to come and say, listen, I can be reasonable about Trump.
