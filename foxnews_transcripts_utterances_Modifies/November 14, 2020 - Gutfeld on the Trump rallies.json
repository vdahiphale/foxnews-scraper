But it was the media that started the, what if he stays in the White House BS which Trump into a joke, chanting 12 more years. And all this crap is coming from the same dopes who started it all with the Russian collusion hoax. First they called Trump's win a foreign concoction. Schiff had proof they claimed. They also claimed Trump wasn't there president so they held massive protests. Maxine demanded that you get into people's faces, ignoring Trump's work for minorities from prison reform to black colleges to jobs, they embraced mind-reading. His deeds may not be evil, but we know his thoughts are. And what did that bring? Well, they chased Trump staffers at restaurants. They showed up at homes. They docked supporters, celebs called for assassination and bombing the White House. And the capper, hey, let's defund the cops. Then when the violence worsens, we can blame it on Trump again. Leftist leaders blamed their cities mayhem on Trump and not their own cowardice. Then came the arson, the looting. Media on Twitter shouting burn it all down until it reached their homes. Democrat mayors hid behind the cops they wanted to defund. And soon, media hacks defined looting as acceptable. The pathetic phrase mostly peaceful became the mockable defense. Joe Biden called Antifa an idea. As Plato understood, when you live in a cave, everything is just an idea. So now, we have these huge rallies and caravans of thousands. And the press, they ask in fear who are all these people? Well, to quote your idol, sorry, you built that. So Dana, last night at the club, you said this to me.

And you know, President Trump is closing, like, maybe he's at the right place at the right time. I was been thinking about how another narrative that you heard over the year was that President Trump doesn't really want to win. This is all for publicity and for a possible thing that he wants to do in the future, and to build hotels around the world. And there he is at 1:00 a.m., the fifth of five rallies with a crowd like that. So I think obviously he wants to win. Stirewalt reminded me of something earlier today, and that is in the last two re-elections both for Bush and Obama, remember as I said. Incumbents are hard to beat. They'll usually win again. It's only happened twice since World War II that a president didn't win a second term. And for Bush and Obama, they got a push of about 2.1 percent at this late stage, and it made the difference.

And everything we've seen about the Trump base, it's never wavered in four years, it's never cracked. Enthusiasm is at record high. And you could argue that it's even growing. When you think about all the rallies he's done, all the new registrations that they've added, if he can maintain strong numbers with white working class, cracked 30 percent with Hispanics. Maybe 10 percent with blacks, you punch your ticket back to the White House. And other indicators are really strong for the president, too. Just look at his approval on the economy, the number one issue in this election. Very strong, Rasmussen has him at 52 percent approval. Also very strong there, I was looking at the polls today, Juan.

I know the president said somebody here doesn't like him. Tim Murtaugh was on Fox and said the Fox polling was terrible. I think our polling is pretty good. And I think our Fox polling has a great record, in fact, of accuracy. And what the Fox polls says is that Biden is up eight nationally, right? And I think if you look at the fact that their data has been so consistent, I think there's a reason to think, oh, yeah, people might show up at 1:00 to have some fun and be entertained. But it doesn't necessarily transition then in your mind into, oh, that equals votes. The big question for me is who would you rather be looking at those polls on election eve tonight? Which side is better positioned to win the Electoral College? That's what it all comes down to. And I don't think there's any doubt. I don't think if you are in the club or you are in the rafters doing the Macarena, you'd say, oh, I'd rather be Trump -- no. You'd rather be Joe Biden tonight. And you know when you see that incredible turnout, and by the way, Greg, people who turned out and stood in line, they did in defiance of voter suppression. They are in fact overcoming something. And there's a tremendous history in our country, especially with black Americans, of having to fight for their right to vote. So I think it's triggered something. In any case, when you see those lines with an incumbent running, an incumbent, it means people want change. That's not good news for the incumbent.",

You know, even today, you saw in Texas, you saw a Republican judge say to the challenge coming from the Trump campaign about people who had cast votes at a drive-through situation, more than 100,000, no. Those people had the right to vote and that was set up long ago. You could have challenged earlier. You didn't. And so leave them alone. Many of these challenges are coming from the Trump campaign, so it's ironic to see the president out there saying don't you wish the Supreme Court would rule that we could -- no, listen. People historically in Florida and Pennsylvania and here in New York, these votes have taken days. It's just that they haven't made any huge difference, except of course in Florida in 2,000. But the point is that this is the way America runs. It's not any conspiracy. It's just the way things are done.

Voters could also legalize so-called magic mushrooms in that state, which I've just learned the technical term for that. Now, I thought a 60 minutes piece about magic mushrooms and there's -- their help for people that have PTSD. Is that correct, Greg?",

But if you take it under supervision, and it's a controlled substance, it could be the most amazing time of your life. And that's why decriminalization I think is important because once you take substances and regulate them by -- not by law, but by packaging and dosing so that there's an enterprise that is actually doing the right measures and making sure it's pure and clean, you have a substance that is effectively safe, almost, I would have -- I haven't done the research in like two years, but almost all of the opiate overdoses were due to fentanyl-laced drugs purchased on the streets from China. It wasn't prescription Percocet or Oxycontin that were killing people. So, just one analogy, imagine if -- imagine if nicotine was illegal and you couldn't buy 20 cigarettes, but you could go on the street and buy one cigarette that had the strength of a carton.

And all this crap is coming from the same dopes who started it all with the Russian collusion hoax. First they called Trump's win a foreign concoction. Schiff had proof they claimed. They also claimed Trump wasn't there president so they held massive protests. Maxine demanded that you get into people's faces, ignoring Trump's work for minorities from prison reform to black colleges to jobs, they embraced mind-reading. His deeds may not be evil, but we know his thoughts are. And what did that bring? Well, they chased Trump staffers at restaurants. They showed up at homes. They docked supporters, celebs called for assassination and bombing the White House. And the capper, hey, let's defund the cops. Then when the violence worsens, we can blame it on Trump again. Leftist leaders blamed their cities mayhem on Trump and not their own cowardice. Then came the arson, the looting. Media on Twitter shouting burn it all down until it reached their homes. Democrat mayors hid behind the cops they wanted to defund. And soon, media hacks defined looting as acceptable. The pathetic phrase mostly peaceful became the mockable defense. Joe Biden called Antifa an idea. As Plato understood, when you live in a cave, everything is just an idea. So now, we have these huge rallies and caravans of thousands.

I was been thinking about how another narrative that you heard over the year was that President Trump doesn't really want to win. This is all for publicity and for a possible thing that he wants to do in the future, and to build hotels around the world. And there he is at 1:00 a.m., the fifth of five rallies with a crowd like that. So I think obviously he wants to win.

It's only happened twice since World War II that a president didn't win a second term. And for Bush and Obama, they got a push of about 2.1 percent at this late stage, and it made the difference. So it possibly could be happening."

And the votes that the Democrats have put in the bank so far with early voting and mail-in voting are just not enough they believe to withstand a strong Trump turn out. And everything we've seen about the Trump base, it's never wavered in four years, it's never cracked. Enthusiasm is at record high. And you could argue that it's even growing. When you think about all the rallies he's done, all the new registrations that they've added, if he can maintain strong numbers with white working class, cracked 30 percent with Hispanics. Maybe 10 percent with blacks, you punch your ticket back to the White House. And other indicators are really strong for the president, too. Just look at his approval on the economy, the number one issue in this election. Very strong, Rasmussen has him at 52 percent approval. Also very strong there, I was looking at the polls today, Juan. I know you like looking at the polls, Real Clear Politics average."

He had a seven-point lead two weeks ago in Pennsylvania. The the lead is now 2.9. That's kind of scary. So if you just look at how the campaigns are finishing, Trump looks optimistic. Well energized, focused, hitting a lot of those populists, very, very sharp contrast with Joe Biden. Joe Biden looks like he's making a lot of mistakes, not a lot of enthusiasm on that side. I think the Trump campaign feels good."

I know the president said somebody here doesn't like him. Tim Murtaugh was on Fox and said the Fox polling was terrible. I think our polling is pretty good. And I think our Fox polling has a great record, in fact, of accuracy. And what the Fox polls says is that Biden is up eight nationally, right? And I think if you look at the fact that their data has been so consistent, I think there's a reason to think, oh, yeah, people might show up at 1:00 to have some fun and be entertained. But it doesn't necessarily transition then in your mind into, oh, that equals votes. The big question for me is who would you rather be looking at those polls on election eve tonight? Which side is better positioned to win the Electoral College? That's what it all comes down to. And I don't think there's any doubt. I don't think if you are in the club or you are in the rafters doing the Macarena, you'd say, oh, I'd rather be Trump -- no. You'd rather be Joe Biden tonight. And you know when you see that incredible turnout, and by the way, Greg, people who turned out and stood in line, they did in defiance of voter suppression. They are in fact overcoming something. And there's a tremendous history in our country, especially with black Americans, of having to fight for their right to vote. So I think it's triggered something. In any case, when you see those lines with an incumbent running, an incumbent, it means people want change. That's not good news for the incumbent."

The other thing is, though, some of these mail-in ballots, people get Florida in that count. Mail-in ballots have been coming in strong from Republicans.

And they will be suing in some of these battlegrounds to change the rules and the deadlines. Because right now, the deadlines and the rules have been set, they've been set through courts and legislatures. So if you fly in lawyers and then change the rules and delay and say ballots that have been sent out that haven't even been returned need to be counted, because every vote needs to be counted.

It's not left or right. It's just history. That's the way it's done. It's like a Tenth Amendment argument about states' rights. And states are in charge of the election in their jurisdiction. You know, even today, you saw in Texas, you saw a Republican judge say to the challenge coming from the Trump campaign about people who had cast votes at a drive-through situation, more than 100,000, no. Those people had the right to vote and that was set up long ago. You could have challenged earlier. You didn't. And so leave them alone. Many of these challenges are coming from the Trump campaign, so it's ironic to see the president out there saying don't you wish the Supreme Court would rule that we could -- no, listen. People historically in Florida and Pennsylvania and here in New York, these votes have taken days. It's just that they haven't made any huge difference, except of course in Florida in 2,000. But the point is that this is the way America runs. It's not any conspiracy. It's just the way things are done. But right now, in this heightened polarized political atmosphere, you see people pointing it out and say, oh, there goes the other side. Well, that's just not realistic."

Every place in Georgetown and every place in New York is being boarded up, why, because they are preparing for the worst. But somehow, the politicians couldn't get together to prepare for the worst if something is close. I mean, if you see something coming, can't you do anything about it? And I mean, let's face it. Trump was ridiculed for talking about, like, the problems with the mail- ins. And now, you have the Democrats talking about it. It's like, you know what? Maybe we should have listened to the guy.

Stop having your friends call us because we are not going to have any senators. Just a moratorium on that, another thing for Elizabeth Warren is she would be up for re-election in 2022. There is a Republican governor in Massachusetts. If the Senate is going to be held by Republicans, barely even, but if the Republicans are going to hold on, then why would they risk having the governor of Massachusetts replace Elizabeth Warren with a Republican so that she could be the secretary of the treasury when that will give them no end of headaches?

And one of the things we see politically is that seniors who were strong for Trump in 2016 are not this year, and a lot of them disapprove of his handling of the virus."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, like, when we finally get to pick through all the election results, the Coronavirus is going to weigh very heavily one way or the other. But, you know, I mentioned in the A-block about the Bush reelection and Obama reelection getting that push of about two percent at the end. One of the things that Bret just mentioned is like, in the suburbs, for parents of children who are still not in schools -- and this issue of parents versus the teachers' unions, they might not they might not like President Trump at all. But the thought of locking down again for another year when they watch their children spiral downward, both from mental health, their physical health, their inability to compete on a global level because they're not in school when the private schools are open, that -- you know, that could be one of the factors."

But I just want to point out, when we do a show, we get these files, and we get these things, and they have all of our -- all the stuff that we're supposed to read. Every day that we do this about COVID, there's a very important detail in there nobody brings up, the infection fatality rate keeps dropping."

And if you report that, then you help Trump, that the infection fatality rate is going down and will continue to go down. A lot of that is because as this -- OK, so you go well, there are all these new cases. Well, there's new cases because we're testing. Testing is finding the new cases. The infection fatality rate drops. That has to be told again, and again. It drives me crazy that we really don't. But I want to give THE FIVE a slap on the back because we talked about -- that's good, right, a slap on the back?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "A pat on the back. That comes later. We predicted that -- we predicted this debate would come down to the lockdown versus no lockdown probably five months ago when the lockdown started. We said sooner or later, we're going to have to calculate how many lives are saved by a lockdown versus lost. And it was such a cold calculation that nobody likes to do it. But we actually argued about it. We said like, OK, here's an adult argument, drug overdoses, right, suicides, depression, what does unemployment lead to? What about rising crime which we saw? Oddly enough, ironically, car accidents have gone up in some cities, because people are speeding more. Pedestrian deaths are at a high in New York City because pedestrians are getting hit by the speeding cars. So, we have actually had this discussion many times. And Trump has always been kind of one step ahead because as an optimist, he thinks that we're going to get back to work, we're going to get back to work, because we will. It is time for us to have this discussion. But Joe can't have it because he's stuck on one variable. He's the generic candidate that can't come up with a plan. And we need to have somebody who says we're Americans, we're going to get back to work. There are costs and there are benefits. We have to embrace that. That's the -- that's what adults do."

New Jersey, Arizona, Montana, and South Dakota -- South Dakota will vote on whether to legalize recreational marijuana. And Oregon could become the first state to decriminalize hard drugs instead of jail time. Possession of small amounts of heroin, cocaine, and LSD would result in fines or attending addiction recovery centers. Voters could also legalize so-called magic mushrooms in that state, which I've just learned the technical term for that. Now, I thought a 60 minutes piece about magic mushrooms and there's -- their help for people that have PTSD. Is that correct, Greg?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, no, it's got -- OK, here's the thing, and I'll walk -- I'll give you my argument using psilocybin as an example. Psilocybin is an incredibly powerful hallucinogenic. And if you take it with your friends and have a good day, it could be the worst possible night of your life. But if you take it under supervision, and it's a controlled substance, it could be the most amazing time of your life. And that's why decriminalization I think is important because once you take substances and regulate them by -- not by law, but by packaging and dosing so that there's an enterprise that is actually doing the right measures and making sure it's pure and clean, you have a substance that is effectively safe, almost, I would have -- I haven't done the research in like two years, but almost all of the opiate overdoses were due to fentanyl-laced drugs purchased on the streets from China. It wasn't prescription Percocet or Oxycontin that were killing people. So, just one analogy, imagine if -- imagine if nicotine was illegal and you couldn't buy 20 cigarettes, but you could go on the street and buy one cigarette that had the strength of a carton. That's how we buy drugs on the street. And we, I mean, Dana and her husband Pete."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "So, I was -- I have long been conflicted about legalization of any drug. I've never done drugs. And I wonder, Juan, like, I guess, how do you feel about it that you have grandchildren? Have your views evolved on this issue at all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So, as you know, I voted early. And in the District of Columbia, I voted against proposal, a referendum that would say, you know what, we're going to not police this, not deal with it, because I just I worry about that very issue, Dana, about kids. I must say that I'm a little bit of a hypocrite on this because as a kid, I was involved with some of this. So, I will say this, though. What strikes me is Michael Moore's thesis, which is that none of those states that you listed in the open are swing states, none of them. And what you see is whenever you put legalizing marijuana, not so much the psychedelics, but marijuana on the ballot, wow, you get a boom of young people turning out to vote. So, it could have made a difference. I mean, certain people in certain races in the past have put it there for just that reason. They want the younger people to vote. And the younger people are behind this 100 percent. Greg is on target."

But as you watch this, keep in mind that not every bird can do this. Magpies are the most intelligent. Their brain to body mass ratio is bigger than any creature except a human.
