And Gore can't just pull ahead of President Bush in that area and they think, well, that could be a real problem for us because Pennsylvania was one of the possible states that President Bush didn't end up winning.  But when they do the focus group a week before the election they ask the basic question, who would you rather go to prom with, George W. Bush or Al Gore? And to a person there like, George W. Bush because I would have a lot more fun and it would be great and she said that that's when she thought that there would probably lose. And it was that likability factor. So, it does really get back to that. And Mark Steyn on Tucker Carlson's show just had I thought, it was a really good point, that the media did cover the email story, partly because they were forced into it. But \"The New York Times\" did break the story. And also, she is so predictable and President Trump was not. And that human nature is to go and look for something that is new and interesting and so President Trump benefited from that. The other thing she doesn't do in this book at all is admit that just a small bit of effort in Wisconsin and Michigan and, what's the other one?",

Juan, what they actually discussed, an official tells me they talked about tax reform, DACA and trying to find a law to quantify all of that. And border security, that's an important point for the President because he wants Republicans on the hill and nobody is pushing still for the wall and more border security in addition to DACA and in trade and infrastructure, other priorities of the President. Second point to make is that also attending in addition to the President and these Democratic leaders, Gary Cohen and General John Kelly, of course chief economic advisor and the White House chief-of-staff. That suggests the President was bringing some top officials to try and get some business done. Earlier today, the President had some rank-and-file Democratic and Republican lawmakers in, one of them, Josh Gottheimer is the co-chair of the problem solvers caucus. He says that the President privately and you see the meeting there, told these lawmakers that he had tried it one way early in his administration working only with Republicans for the most part. And now it's going to try something new, reaching across the aisle. And the President said, you know, when reporters pressed him about Republicans being skeptical about these meetings with Democrats, that they shouldn't worry. Watch.",

So, it's neck and neck, Gore and Bush. And Gore can't just pull ahead of President Bush in that area and they think, well, that could be a real problem for us because Pennsylvania was one of the possible states that President Bush didn't end up winning. But when they do the focus group a week before the election they ask the basic question, who would you rather go to prom with, George W. Bush or Al Gore? And to a person there like, George W. Bush because I would have a lot more fun and it would be great and she said that that's when she thought that there would probably lose. And it was that likability factor. So, it does really get back to that. And Mark Steyn on Tucker Carlson's show just had I thought, it was a really good point, that the media did cover the email story, partly because they were forced into it. But \"The New York Times\" did break the story. And also, she is so predictable and President Trump was not. And that human nature is to go and look for something that is new and interesting and so President Trump benefited from that. The other thing she doesn't do in this book at all is admit that just a small bit of effort in Wisconsin and Michigan and, what's the other one?"

I mean, we were all there for that. You know, we were there for his inaugural address and, you know, I didn't hear it like that.

The President having dinner with the Democratic leaders, an official here tells me it ended a couple moments ago, they are calling it a constructive working dinner, you would expect them to say that after a dinner like this, two interesting points though worth highlighting. Juan, what they actually discussed, an official tells me they talked about tax reform, DACA and trying to find a law to quantify all of that. And border security, that's an important point for the President because he wants Republicans on the hill and nobody is pushing still for the wall and more border security in addition to DACA and in trade and infrastructure, other priorities of the President. Second point to make is that also attending in addition to the President and these Democratic leaders, Gary Cohen and General John Kelly, of course chief economic advisor and the White House chief-of-staff. That suggests the President was bringing some top officials to try and get some business done. Earlier today, the President had some rank-and-file Democratic and Republican lawmakers in, one of them, Josh Gottheimer is the co-chair of the problem solvers caucus. He says that the President privately and you see the meeting there, told these lawmakers that he had tried it one way early in his administration working only with Republicans for the most part. And now it's going to try something new, reaching across the aisle. And the President said, you know, when reporters pressed him about Republicans being skeptical about these meetings with Democrats, that they shouldn't worry. Watch."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Now, the President went on to say that he's hoping to get a bipartisan tax reform deal. He said that could include major tax cuts for the middle class and for corporations but said, he would be willing to increase taxes on the rich, something that may have been a bit of a surprise, although tonight White House officials are scrambling to sort of clarify that the President doesn't want to increase taxes for the rich, he may want to close some loopholes that will effectively raise taxes on the rich but he doesn't want to raise rates on the rich. So, there is a lot of detail still to be worked out -- Dana."

President Obama didn't have to do it because he had such big majorities although he pushed through ObamaCare and then we all know how that turned out. And late in his presidency, President Obama tried to do some dinners with some of the Republicans and it was just really frankly too late. So, I think this is actually pretty constructive as President Trump said, Kimberly. Might not work out, but at least you have to try.

I say, okay, this is somebody who's used to doing business and when you want to sit down and get a deal done. You know, okay, let's go get together, see what we can find some common, you know, points of interest, and agreement, and go through exactly what our plan is and see what we can concur. And then if there are things we disagree about, and then we can go over that and try to negotiate it. I think this is a smart approach. He hasn't been able to get his own party to do what he's asked them to do. He's kind of got no choice at this point to try to reach across the table to get a few of the votes that he needs. And it's also boxing the Democrats and from a strategy perspective because, they can't say that he wasn't trying to be bipartisan, he wasn't trying to be reasonable or listen to their interests or their concerns. From their constituents, because if you want to make America great and not just Republican Americans, you reach across the aisle."

I mean, Trump likes Nancy, she's glamorous, she's funny. He has a lot in common with Chuck, they're from New York. You know, I think maybe that's one the reasons. I think most Americans can see why he's doing this but in all seriousness, he is doing this because he couldn't govern with partisan majorities in the House. Republicans in the House and Senate, they shouldn't be upset by this. They gave birth to this. If they had passed repeal and replace, he would have been governing with partisan majorities, they would have been already on by late July to tax reform. And that would have been fine but he pivoted out of it and he's now going to be like the prime minister where you try to forge these kinds of bipartisan governing coalitions and see if that works. Now, the media is not used to this because it hasn't been done for quite some time. Bush 41 reached across the aisle, Bill Clinton triangulated, Reagan always hang out --"

And yes, calling viewers dumb is pretty arrogant. I guess stars know that being in a telethon creates a shield that allows you to lecture safely from the perch of sanctimony. But still, if they want to wag a finger, it's still 44 million bucks, that's a mountain of dough. So, I can think one night of chiding by people whose toughest choices in life or whether they fly farther or just take a yacht. So, regardless of politics, everyone should do their part, we've all 21 given and we have asked others to do so and many have pitched in, including Sister Margaret chainsaw.

      "utterance": "Everyone is mad about Comey. I think the White House actually has a real benefit by saying earlier today Sarah Huckabee Sanders said this is not the President's role. This is the Justice Department's role. I think you could stop there. They have surrogates or they have ways, outside counsel to be able to comment on those types of things. I think if all those points have been made contemporaneously with the firing, it would hold more water. Right now I think it looks thin because it's in reaction to the Bannon interview and she is being asked about it in the White House Press briefing room. They have somewhat of good stuff going on at the White House right now that I think there's ways to not talk about it. He doesn't always work in your favor. For example, just last week the Justice Department after years of investigation has come the conclusion under the Trump administration that Lois Lerner was not culpable. There wasn't evidence to bring any case against her. So I think keep it out of the White House and let outside counsel handle it."

When Comey's letter came out, I said on this show, it was far more destructive than saying he would prosecute her over the emails, because he basically said she was irresponsible, incompetent and possibly dangerous because -- and then he says but we are not going to do anything about it. I kind of have to defend her at this point, even after she drives me crazy. What Sanders said is we should certainly look, there are two outs in there. \"Look\" doesn't mean \"act.\" it's like a movie on Cinemax. I could look at that. Check the ratings. Who's in it?"

Look at the swing state like Iowa, she lost by 150,000 votes. This wasn't close. This wasn't enough for this Comey thing at the end with Anthony Weiner didn't tip the scales. This wasn't Bush versus Gore, not a razor-thin election. This was an electoral landslide. Not in the popular vote but electorally. He could say if it wasn't for NBC leaking the access Hollywood tape or if it wasn't for Comey not indicting Hillary. You can play the blame game on both sides."

I think people are reacting to the idea that Robert Mueller is asking for White House staff to come in. He is going after Spicer and Reince Priebus and getting them. I think the pressure is building inside the White House and they want to divert attention and they want to focus on Jim Comey. As Dana pointed out, if the Justice Department thought he had somehow violated the law, Jim Comey would've been dragged in, indicted by now."

I think this is a very predictable thing we're seeing on the part leading Democrats. A lot of people want it. They're also adopting this idea and they're this post office list of people who are supporting because I think they feel in order to garner that support to be the next Presidential candidate, they're going to have to be for single payer to carve out that Bernie support."

Even if you raise taxes to 50 percent on the wealthiest people, you still can't come close. So I love to the Democrats are running so far left on this issue. I think that is fantastic.

But the things is Republican always end up being the one that had to figure out how to pay for it. They never had to figure out how to pay for it, they show all the goodies and back out on the badies and we end up in sour and it is like how are you going to pay for it. Same as the climate change."

You need three things. You need capitalism which is based on choice and competition. We sue it for everything and it works, but when we get to this part of the world, healthcare we stop. We can't do capitalism competition and choice, but if we actually try, that is what we need to do, in your minds we can't fund trillion dollar a year program on rich people because they won't exist.
