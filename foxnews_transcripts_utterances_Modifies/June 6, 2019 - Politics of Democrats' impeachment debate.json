But to go back to this earlier conversation, this is all a political exercise, this is all a political discussion. They don't have any proof. They don't even know what the crime is. The whole point of this is that Nancy Pelosi understands that they could very well lose an election to Donald Trump, and in fact the only thing that's keeping Donald Trump, in her mind, in office is if they go through the impeachment trial and he gets reelected as a result of that.

      "utterance": "This isn't like standing up at a national party convention chanting \"lock her up\" right? It's not that. Nancy Pelosi has been trying to make the case, and I think what I heard in that comment was a differentiation between impeachment and prosecution. The House doesn’t have the ability to prosecute. The House has the ability to impeach. That's a political argument. That's a political action. And she knows that the votes aren't there in the Senate. She knows that it is, at least as of now, still politically perilous, which is why she's out there saying, let's continue the investigations, let's continue to put a spotlight on the things that we think he's done wrong and see where that goes. The public isn't there yet, although there is some evidence in recent polling that the public is ever so slightly moving in that direction. We've seen some polls in recent weeks where public support for impeachment has crept up. It's still not a majority."

      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "But this is the point, right, that this is where the pro- impeachment crowd is going, and she's saying we don't have the votes for that. There's lots of investigations that may still turn up -- there are still criminal investigations that have to do with his other activities, with the Trump Foundation, with campaign finance violations. He hasn't been convicted of anything yet, which is why I think she saying let's keep the focus on the investigations. And there seems to be at least a majority of people out there who buy into the notion that he has done something wrong. Does it rise to criminality? We haven't seen it yet."

      "utterance": "I think we know by now when you ask the president, you're going to get an answer. He's not going to have restraint on any set, whether it's Normandy or right here in D.C. But I think the right move here is to not talk about impeachment while you are over celebrating the 75th anniversary of D-Day. But to go back to this earlier conversation, this is all a political exercise, this is all a political discussion. They don't have any proof. They don't even know what the crime is. The whole point of this is that Nancy Pelosi understands that they could very well lose an election to Donald Trump, and in fact the only thing that's keeping Donald Trump, in her mind, in office is if they go through the impeachment trial and he gets reelected as a result of that. So she sees this in totally political terms and is turning up that volume just to try to keep the base at bay and buy time to get to the Iowa caucus."

And it's just a reminder about the impact of the war on those veterans and on the braves behind them, the families who never got to see their loved ones come home, the generations impact by that war. And I just hope that we continue having this celebration and don’t just drop it once we lose all those veterans, which eventually will happen."

Both of them are seen as very unpopular leaders right now in their own countries. And they went up there, and I think the president gave a good speech, I think President Macron gave a good speech. The most disappointing thing for me was he came off of the stage and then came on this network and started to attack Nancy Pelosi by name. You were there, you hit the right tone in that speech. You can put politics aside, we all can put politics aside on this day."

There's something special that brings out, I think amongst all of us when we're talking about D-Day and the sacrifices, it clearly brought out the best in President Trump. I thought it was very moving."

Over at Arlington National Cemetery 96-year-old D-Day veteran Carl Mann was buried today. He was among the troops storming the beaches at Omaha Beach. He died March 30th. He was in his military career awarded seven Bronze Stars and three Purple Hearts. And along the National Mall today, about 40 World War II veterans laid wreathes at the National World War II memorial, joined by representatives from each of the allied nations that took part in the Normandy campaign. Just some of the celebrations here in the nation's capital. Thanks for inviting us into your homes tonight.
