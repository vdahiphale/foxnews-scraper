      "sentences": "All right. Tucker, as always, thank you. Great show tonight. We have an amazing show, a ton of ground to cover. The president's attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is right here in studio for an exclusive interview. Now, the deep state is an overdrive. They all working as we've been pointing out to malign and destroy the presidency of Donald Trump, the person duly elected by you the American people.  Now, tonight, we're going to break down exactly why our two-tier justice system is targeting this administration. We'll show you the extreme measures that Robert Mueller is taking and others are taking to delegitimize this president and everyone who supports him.  And breaking tonight, President Trump is now beefing up his legal team in order to navigate the special counsel's well off the rails investigation. In my opinion, make no mistakes. These are very scary political times in America. There are real consequences for everyday Americans. And coming up, we'll explain why one for Trump political aide was forced to sell his home to pay his legal bills associated with this witch hunt.  So, it's time to dismantle the deep state, hold people accountable for acts they've committed and hold the corrupt media accountable as they are happily cheering for President Trump's political demise and completely ignoring an amazing list of accomplishments. We'll have all the latest media madness coming up and developments on the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's efforts to obstruct Republican members of Congress from doing their job and getting to the bottom of the FISA abuse scandal. The FBI's mishandling of the Clinton investigation and so much more.  It's time for tonight's very important breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "So, this deep state that we have been warning you about now for a long time is going all out. This week, two separate major leaks from Robert Mueller's off the rails political witch-hunt are now revealing the special counsel's obsessive determination to set a perjury trap for President Trump.  \"The New York Times\" released a list of questions that Robert Mueller allegedly wants Donald from to answer. These questions are all open-ended. They're patently frankly ridiculous and they are designed to trap the president into committing perjury. Some of the questions even targeted the president's own thoughts. What does the president think about James Comey? What does the president think about the Sessions recusal? What does the president think about the special counsel?   So, let me get this straight: is Robert Mueller now the thought police? Is it now illegal in the United States of America for a sitting president of the United States to have private thoughts? According to \"The Washington Post\", Robert Mueller has now even threatened the president with a subpoena if he refuses to sit down for an interview now forget that Robert Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and forget it after weeks when they have found zero evidence of any wrongdoing by the president. This is now a political takedown of the person that you chose to lead this country now should we be surprised well this investigation is being conducted by some of the same people who were totally complicit in using Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies, you know, the unverified steel dossier as actual evidence to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on an American, a Trump campaign associate in the lead-up to an election. In other words, the FBI used Democratic campaign material during an election, lied and passed it off as legitimate evidence in order to get a FISA warrant from a FISA judge to spy on the Trump campaign. That dossier was never verified, never corroborated, has now been debunked and they now -- literally, they never told the judge that Hillary Clinton and the DNC whose finances she was controlling paid for it. It is outrageous and this is the United States of America.   Remember, here's the who's who, if you will, of Robert Mueller who he hired to lead the special counsel investigation. What do we see? A bunch of big-time Democratic donors including who \"The New York Times\" referred to as his pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. He's given thousands of dollars to Democrats and remember, we've disclosed Weissmann's very aggressive tactics. They have caused multiple overturns and wrongful convictions, ruining countless lives at Andersen accounting, Merrill Lynch, elsewhere, and let's not forget, that Trump aiding FBI lovebird Peter Strzok, he helped author Hillary Clinton's exoneration before overseeing the interview months later and, of course struck was so blatantly biased he was removed from the investigation of Robert Mueller. But then you have Robert Mueller's other top deep state Democrats they remain today. In just a few minutes, Trump attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani will be here to give us an exclusive interview to discuss whether or not the president should ever agree to an interview with this band of many Trump-hating sycophants of Hillary Clinton.  Giuliani will also help break down the brand-new charges and changes on Trump's legal team, including tonight's breaking news. Now, just hours ago, the White House announced that Ty Cobb will be retiring at the end of May and powerful longtime Washington attorney Emmet Flood will join his legal team. We'll have more on that in a minute.   But, first, we have a shocking story to bring you revealing the toll that this ongoing witch-hunt is taking on real people who have realized and frankly anyone who has ever worked with President Trump or on his campaign. Former Trump campaign communication adviser Michael Caputo, he recently told the Senate Intel Committee, their investigation has had a devastating financial impact on him and his family, forced him to sell his home because he had incurred over $100,000 in legal bills. And during the closed-door session, Caputo told the Senate committee, quote, 'what America needs is an investigation of the investigators. I want to know who's paying for the spies work and coordinating this attack on President Donald Trump. I want to know who cost us so much money, who crushed our children, who forced us out of our home, all because you lost an election? I want to know because GD you to hell.'  Despite real-life consequences from Caputo and others associated with the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency, with literally no evidence of collusion, after months and months and months of multiple investigations, you still have your mainstream media there pushing forward almost in unison their effort to aid and abet the deep state with this non-stop 24/7 obsessive, negative Russia, Russia, Russia, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy coverage, and in the meantime, ignoring every major Trump accomplishment. Take a look at some of this week's coverage that is an example.",

Forget about all these developments, look at what the prime minister of Israel did yesterday, there is a nuclear program in Iran or the booming economy, record low unemployment in states in the United States now, record low unemployment for women in the workplace, Hispanics and African Americans record lows. And the media wants you to believe the White House is in shambles? Not so. But you know better and that's why according to a brand new Rasmussen poll, President Trump has a higher approval rating in his second year than former President Obama.  And by the way, you're not going to hear that in the mainstream media, instead chances are, you'll probably see this guy, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Stormy Daniels. According to NewsBusters, Avenatti was on fake news CNN a whopping 59 times in less than two months.  And finally tonight we turn to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. As we speak, he continues to stonewall congressional efforts to do their job and get to the bottom of multiple serious issues, including FISA abuse, spying on American citizens, not telling the truth to a FISA court, presenting political information not telling the court, presenting unverified, uncorroborated information paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, by a foreign national, lies from Russia. Oh I thought Russian collusion and foreign nationals influencing our elections were bad. Earlier today, President Trump tweeted, quote: 'A rigged system. They don't want to turn over documents to Congress, what are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal justice? At some point, I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the presidency and get involved.'   And breaking today, Fox News has learned that some lawmakers still have not been given adequate access to the documents they have subpoenaed and they're requesting to the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committees.  Rod Rosenstein, if you have nothing to hide regarding the department's FISA practices, why not release them? Why not release all the documents, let the American people see it? If you have nothing to hide on the handling of the Clinton investigation, hand over the documents. Nothing to hide on Russia collusion investigation, Hillary paying Christopher Steele funneling money through a law firm, Russian lies to manipulate the American people, to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate, hand it over.  Tonight, every single American needs to be asking just what is Rod Rosenstein hiding? All right. Joining us now for the exclusive interview, he's the former mayor in New York City. He is the current president of -- attorney for the president, President Trump, Rudy Giuliani is with us.  All right.",

He fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn't a target of the investigation. He's entitled to that. Hillary Clinton got that. Actually, he couldn't get that. So, he fired him and he said, I'm free of the guy, and he went on Lester Holt. Lester Holt's interview was as good as anybody could do, better than I think any of the people around Mueller could have done, and Lester Holt asked them, why did you do it? He said, I did it because I felt that I had to explain to the American people the president was not the target of the investigation.  And even Jake Tapper pushed him really hard, talking about Comey. Comey had no answer for why he didn't say this, even though he had done the same thing for Hillary. So, you can't blame the president for feeling, I am not being treated the same way they were.

They all working as we've been pointing out to malign and destroy the presidency of Donald Trump, the person duly elected by you the American people. Now, tonight, we're going to break down exactly why our two-tier justice system is targeting this administration. We'll show you the extreme measures that Robert Mueller is taking and others are taking to delegitimize this president and everyone who supports him. And breaking tonight, President Trump is now beefing up his legal team in order to navigate the special counsel's well off the rails investigation. In my opinion, make no mistakes. These are very scary political times in America. There are real consequences for everyday Americans. And coming up, we'll explain why one for Trump political aide was forced to sell his home to pay his legal bills associated with this witch hunt. So, it's time to dismantle the deep state, hold people accountable for acts they've committed and hold the corrupt media accountable as they are happily cheering for President Trump's political demise and completely ignoring an amazing list of accomplishments. We'll have all the latest media madness coming up and developments on the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's efforts to obstruct Republican members of Congress from doing their job and getting to the bottom of the FISA abuse scandal. The FBI's mishandling of the Clinton investigation and so much more. It's time for tonight's very important breaking news opening monologue."

      "utterance": "So, this deep state that we have been warning you about now for a long time is going all out. This week, two separate major leaks from Robert Mueller's off the rails political witch-hunt are now revealing the special counsel's obsessive determination to set a perjury trap for President Trump. \"The New York Times\" released a list of questions that Robert Mueller allegedly wants Donald from to answer. These questions are all open-ended. They're patently frankly ridiculous and they are designed to trap the president into committing perjury. Some of the questions even targeted the president's own thoughts. What does the president think about James Comey? What does the president think about the Sessions recusal? What does the president think about the special counsel?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "So, let me get this straight",
      "utterance": "is Robert Mueller now the thought police? Is it now illegal in the United States of America for a sitting president of the United States to have private thoughts? According to \"The Washington Post\", Robert Mueller has now even threatened the president with a subpoena if he refuses to sit down for an interview now forget that Robert Mueller was tasked with investigating Russian collusion and forget it after weeks when they have found zero evidence of any wrongdoing by the president. This is now a political takedown of the person that you chose to lead this country now should we be surprised well this investigation is being conducted by some of the same people who were totally complicit in using Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for Russian lies, you know, the unverified steel dossier as actual evidence to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on an American, a Trump campaign associate in the lead-up to an election. In other words, the FBI used Democratic campaign material during an election, lied and passed it off as legitimate evidence in order to get a FISA warrant from a FISA judge to spy on the Trump campaign. That dossier was never verified, never corroborated, has now been debunked and they now -- literally, they never told the judge that Hillary Clinton and the DNC whose finances she was controlling paid for it. It is outrageous and this is the United States of America. Remember, here's the who's who, if you will, of Robert Mueller who he hired to lead the special counsel investigation. What do we see? A bunch of big-time Democratic donors including who \"The New York Times\" referred to as his pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. He's given thousands of dollars to Democrats and remember, we've disclosed Weissmann's very aggressive tactics. They have caused multiple overturns and wrongful convictions, ruining countless lives at Andersen accounting, Merrill Lynch, elsewhere, and let's not forget, that Trump aiding FBI lovebird Peter Strzok, he helped author Hillary Clinton's exoneration before overseeing the interview months later and, of course struck was so blatantly biased he was removed from the investigation of Robert Mueller. But then you have Robert Mueller's other top deep state Democrats they remain today. In just a few minutes, Trump attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani will be here to give us an exclusive interview to discuss whether or not the president should ever agree to an interview with this band of many Trump-hating sycophants of Hillary Clinton. Giuliani will also help break down the brand-new charges and changes on Trump's legal team, including tonight's breaking news. Now, just hours ago, the White House announced that Ty Cobb will be retiring at the end of May and powerful longtime Washington attorney Emmet Flood will join his legal team. We'll have more on that in a minute. But, first, we have a shocking story to bring you revealing the toll that this ongoing witch-hunt is taking on real people who have realized and frankly anyone who has ever worked with President Trump or on his campaign. Former Trump campaign communication adviser Michael Caputo, he recently told the Senate Intel Committee, their investigation has had a devastating financial impact on him and his family, forced him to sell his home because he had incurred over $100,000 in legal bills. And during the closed-door session, Caputo told the Senate committee, quote, 'what America needs is an investigation of the investigators. I want to know who's paying for the spies work and coordinating this attack on President Donald Trump. I want to know who cost us so much money, who crushed our children, who forced us out of our home, all because you lost an election? I want to know because GD you to hell.' Despite real-life consequences from Caputo and others associated with the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency, with literally no evidence of collusion, after months and months and months of multiple investigations, you still have your mainstream media there pushing forward almost in unison their effort to aid and abet the deep state with this non-stop 24/7 obsessive, negative Russia, Russia, Russia, Stormy, Stormy, Stormy coverage, and in the meantime, ignoring every major Trump accomplishment. Take a look at some of this week's coverage that is an example."

And the media wants you to believe the White House is in shambles? Not so. But you know better and that's why according to a brand new Rasmussen poll, President Trump has a higher approval rating in his second year than former President Obama. And by the way, you're not going to hear that in the mainstream media, instead chances are, you'll probably see this guy, Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for Stormy Daniels. According to NewsBusters, Avenatti was on fake news CNN a whopping 59 times in less than two months. And finally tonight we turn to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. As we speak, he continues to stonewall congressional efforts to do their job and get to the bottom of multiple serious issues, including FISA abuse, spying on American citizens, not telling the truth to a FISA court, presenting political information not telling the court, presenting unverified, uncorroborated information paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, by a foreign national, lies from Russia.

Rod Rosenstein, if you have nothing to hide regarding the department's FISA practices, why not release them? Why not release all the documents, let the American people see it? If you have nothing to hide on the handling of the Clinton investigation, hand over the documents. Nothing to hide on Russia collusion investigation, Hillary paying Christopher Steele funneling money through a law firm, Russian lies to manipulate the American people, to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate, hand it over.

He fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn't a target of the investigation. He's entitled to that. Hillary Clinton got that. Actually, he couldn't get that. So, he fired him and he said, I'm free of the guy, and he went on Lester Holt. Lester Holt's interview was as good as anybody could do, better than I think any of the people around Mueller could have done, and Lester Holt asked them, why did you do it? He said, I did it because I felt that I had to explain to the American people the president was not the target of the investigation. And even Jake Tapper pushed him really hard, talking about Comey. Comey had no answer for why he didn't say this, even though he had done the same thing for Hillary. So, you can't blame the president for feeling, I am not being treated the same way they were.

And I have been very open in this and saying this, that this is a setup, that this is a subpoena, this is a perjury trap. And let's walk through what if they issue a subpoena? What if they tell -- if he's decided not to talk, they sent him before a grand jury because it becomes tricky, as Alan Dershowitz has described on this show. If the president pleads the Fifth, which he doesn't want to do, he said he doesn't want to do, then they give him immunity, then what?"

If they issue a subpoena, that will be -- that will be unprecedented in the sense that it's pretty clear that a president can't be subpoenaed to a criminal proceeding about him. Now, why is that? And fortunately -- or maybe unfortunately -- we have the real life circumstance going on that the Founding Fathers thought about, which is a president cannot be distracted by a criminal investigation. You can always prosecute him after. They can get him when he leaves the White House. You can always prosecute him after. But we -- I could not -- if Mueller said to me tomorrow, bring him in, two hours, like you want, no questions that you don't want, we are pretty much ready to clear him. I could not go to the president and say, take two days off to get ready for that and screw the whole thing with North Korea. I -- how can any American do that? He's our president.

The question there was, the only possible violation there would be wasn't a campaign finance violation, which usually results in a fine by the way, not this big storm troopers coming in and breaking down his apartment and breaking down his office. That was money that was paid by his lawyer, the way I would do out of his law firm funds or whatever funds, it doesn't matter. The president reimbursed that over a period of several months."
