All right, so one of the things, guys that hasn't been getting a lot of attention recently and I've seen it covered on, I think \"Hannity.\" That's the only place I've seen it covered on was that Christopher Steele was being paid by the FBI for many, many months and double dipping getting paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, and he was back-dooring through the FBI with a man named Bruce Ohr and Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS, and what does that tell you, Dan about the operation that the FBI and the Clinton campaign were undertaking way, way, way early on in 2016?",

The one you're dressing here is what I call the information superhighway or the information laundering operation, and it is best summed up this way.   When the FBI source for most of the information used to spy on the Trump team, a guy by the name of Christopher Steele, paid by the Hillary team to generate this fake spurious nonsense information against Trump. When he was discredited and deemed by the FBI and I'm quoting Jesse, the FBI here, when he was deemed not suitable for use as a source anymore because he was lying about his media contacts, they had to launder his information back into the FBI to use him again. So what did they do? They hired the wife of a DOJ official, Bruce Ohr, his wife Nelly at Fusion GPS, reconnected Steele right back into the DOJ and basically instead of laundering money, they laundered information.

I mean, Steele is on the payroll of Hillary Clinton and the FBI and when they fire him for being a liar, they continue to use him in violation of FBI regulations. They were devious about it.

There is no way that's a crime, but as you just said, Hillary Clinton who actually paid, Jesse -- paid Kremlin connected sources for actual information that was changed, that did change it. There is no way -- that is not a crime. I mean this is basic logic.  The Democrats are going down the road here, I will tell you, Jesse.

So, the other day the President goes down to Florida and announces a massive increase in jobs as a result of his policies down there. We also saw the remains of the Korean War soldiers returned. And look at this here, Pence comes out to receive the remains in a very somber and important and historical ceremony. And look at the networks. ABC News did not even give it 30 seconds. CBS did not cover it. NBC Nightly News did not cover it. MSNBC did not take it live. I mean, it is just completely ridiculous the way that they are burying these types of stories. And then you had another really poignant moment where the President stops his motorcade after one of these events and gets out and starts greeting firefighters and shaking their hands. It was just one of those really touching, Presidential moments that the media, if it had been Barack Obama, would have picked up and led with on the nightly news, but if it's this President, they don't even cover it at all.",

They fully deserve to go, and demonstrate the absolute bigoted nonsense of Trump. Donald is an enormous blank. Trump is a disaster.\" Joining me now, former secret service agent and host of \"Renegade Republican,\" Dan Bongino and the author of \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump,\" Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett. All right, so one of the things, guys that hasn't been getting a lot of attention recently and I've seen it covered on, I think \"Hannity.\" That's the only place I've seen it covered on was that Christopher Steele was being paid by the FBI for many, many months and double dipping getting paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC, and he was back-dooring through the FBI with a man named Bruce Ohr and Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS, and what does that tell you, Dan about the operation that the FBI and the Clinton campaign were undertaking way, way, way early on in 2016?"

      "utterance": "Yes, Jesse, this is a complicated case, but I'd break it down into three let's say, sub scandals. You have the spy gate, the mega scandal -- there's three kind of sub scandals. The one you're dressing here is what I call the information superhighway or the information laundering operation, and it is best summed up this way. When the FBI source for most of the information used to spy on the Trump team, a guy by the name of Christopher Steele, paid by the Hillary team to generate this fake spurious nonsense information against Trump. When he was discredited and deemed by the FBI and I'm quoting Jesse, the FBI here, when he was deemed not suitable for use as a source anymore because he was lying about his media contacts, they had to launder his information back into the FBI to use him again. So what did they do? They hired the wife of a DOJ official, Bruce Ohr, his wife Nelly at Fusion GPS, reconnected Steele right back into the DOJ and basically instead of laundering money, they laundered information. It is an absolute disgrace what happened to this president."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

When the FBI got wind of it, they did not send a bunch of FBI agents and spies to go look into Dianne Feinstein and tried to entrap her. Instead, they gave her a defensive briefing and warned her about this guy. It is just so much different than the way the Trump situation was handled."

      "utterance": "There is no fairness, there is no equivalency here. If you're a Democrat or a friend of Hillary, you get immunity or you get off scot-free. Here, it remotely connected to Donald Trump, you get people like Robert Mueller and Andrew Wiseman and his team of partisans coming after you with a vengeance, and really abusing their positions of power, and that is part of the story of the Russia hoax. And you are right about Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele. I mean, Steele is on the payroll of Hillary Clinton and the FBI and when they fire him for being a liar, they continue to use him in violation of FBI regulations. They were devious about it. They had Bruce Ohr as a conduit. And the other amazing thing is even after the President is elected, after he takes office, and for several months afterwards, they are still using Christopher Steele as a spy on Donald Trump, trying to verify the unverifiable dossier."

They do not use were collusion, I guess the legal terminology would be conspiracy because information is the same thing as money, but I am looking at it and no information was ever given to the Trump team by Russia, yet, the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for information from Kremlin sources. They just washed it through an intermediary, Christopher Steele. Isn't there a big difference between the Trump Tower meeting and the way that the dossier was obtained, Dan?"

Jonathan Turley does a lot of work on this network who is a very skilled lawyer and not partisan by any stretch, wrote a terrific piece saying just that. There is no possible way that the Trump Tower meeting between Don Trump, Jr., Manafort and a couple of Russians who by the way, have very deep connections to both the Clintons and Fusion GPS -- that's another story -- where no significant information on the Clintons is exchanged whatsoever. Granted, the meeting is a bad idea. Everybody acknowledges that, okay? There is no way that's a crime, but as you just said, Hillary Clinton who actually paid, Jesse -- paid Kremlin connected sources for actual information that was changed, that did change it. There is no way -- that is not a crime. I mean this is basic logic. The Democrats are going down the road here, I will tell you, Jesse. They are walking right off a cliff and I don't even think they know it. They are blinded by their hatred for Trump."

What is a thing of value, and by the way, information not a thing of value, money is Hillary Clinton paid money to Christopher Steele making that a thing of value. So she clearly violated the law and egregious cases, like hers, it's a crime. But the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump, Jr., that's not even remotely a crime."

Most people are only conscious because they are disenfranchised in some way, right? So they are aware of how the dominant power works and how their own lives function, and people who have dominant power don't have to ask those questions. So the questions that men have to ask themselves are the same questions that all kind of people that are struggling for consciousness and liberation and justice need to ask so that the world can be better for everyone."

He can walk into a bar and behave a certain way because he is a man, that he might not be able to walk into his job and behave that way.

Even just on the level of you might not be seen as someone desperate if you're a single man that walks into a bar, whereas if a woman walks into a bar and she is single, that is perceived as a very different kind of social gesture."

A lot of other news stories this past week and the last couple of weeks the media has just completely buried. So, the other day the President goes down to Florida and announces a massive increase in jobs as a result of his policies down there. We also saw the remains of the Korean War soldiers returned. And look at this here, Pence comes out to receive the remains in a very somber and important and historical ceremony. And look at the networks. ABC News did not even give it 30 seconds. CBS did not cover it. NBC Nightly News did not cover it. MSNBC did not take it live. I mean, it is just completely ridiculous the way that they are burying these types of stories. And then you had another really poignant moment where the President stops his motorcade after one of these events and gets out and starts greeting firefighters and shaking their hands. It was just one of those really touching, Presidential moments that the media, if it had been Barack Obama, would have picked up and led with on the nightly news, but if it's this President, they don't even cover it at all."

That's the kind of narrative that they like to run on this president. Instead of giving him praise for the good things that he's doing, he's doing things that we've never seen done in our country before, but they don't want to give him the credit for that.
