We heard from Secretary Buttigieg, the transportation secretary on the supply chain issues, the secretary of energy on the gas prices, the secretary of Department of Homeland Security on the border disaster and the crisis there, and the secretary of education dealing with Critical Race Theory and other questions. It's a lot.   Let's bring in our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" also author of the new book \"Rigged, How the Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized our Elections,\" Juan Williams is a FOX News analyst, and Morgan Ortagus, former State Department spokesperson. When you put it in that frame Morgan, and you were in administration, and sometimes you had bad weeks or a couple of bad weeks, but each one of those is a significant issue that this administration is dealing with.",

And it really, I think, is endemic of a crisis of leadership, right? Really if you ask the American people who's in charge, right, they don't see Joe Biden as being a leader if you look at all of the polling. And they don't see the vice president either standing up and leading on the positions that she said she was going to.   And if you look at poll after poll, like Quinnipiac, for example, just 25 percent of Americans are approving of how the president is handling the border. And then you check out at the grocery store and your groceries are a lot more expensive than they were a year ago or six months ago. So I don't think it's one thing. It's everything that you laid out at the beginning. And the White House and this administration needs to get themselves out of the bubble and realize it's not the commentators on other news channels that determine whether they get reelected or whether they're doing a good job. They answer to the American people. The American people are hurting. They're having a hard time filling up their gas tank. They're worried about inflation. They're worried about the price of groceries. And they know that there is a border situation that this administration really has no honest intention of solving anytime soon.",

I just wanted to add quickly, though, that I think a lot of this kind of carping at the Biden administration ignores -- this week we had such good news, the lowest number of unemployment claims since the pandemic began. GDP at six percent. I think that's the highest in like 40 years. The stock market right now, it's at near record high, it's hit records 50 times already this year. I think the American people are aware of supply chain backups, but they're also aware of the pandemic, and a lot of that's global.

Gallup, Mollie, the question was, government, is it doing too much? Preferences for government activity, doing too much or should do more, and you look at these numbers. Doing too much is now leading exponentially from year over year. And at the same time, Democrats are pushing these trillion dollars bills up on the Hill.   MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  I think one of the big disconnects is people know that the federal government is wanting to do a lot of things, and what they're doing is failing at a lot of things. You look at all of these issues that you brought up at the beginning, whether it's the debacle of the incompetence of how we existed Afghanistan, a completely open border as a result of the policies of the Biden administration. And then when you want to have a frank and open talk about what everybody in the country realizes is a suffering economy, you have a transportation secretary who sits there and tries to say that, actually, the economy is doing quite well, whereas normal Americans know that that's not the case and that the federal government, ostensibly in charge of some of these things, is doing a bad job of managing supply chains or other issues that are leading to empty shelves, skyrocketing prices. And they don't seem to be taking it seriously. And the less they take it seriously, and it's not just Biden but all of these cabinet officials, the less they take it seriously, the more anxiety it gives average Americans because they realize they're not taking it seriously.",
