Now, what he did have that I didn't see a ton of last night is the charisma, the hope, the lift, right? You saw Dan Bowles of the Washington Post writes today that the Democrats put their worse face forward the last two nights. President Obama when he was running, he was -- remember he was the happy guy. Hope and change. And you didn't really feel any of that on the stage. I also think that instead of going after President Trump, like, I know -- I understand they kind of -- they did go -- they always go after President Trump, but the focus was on that the last eight years was not progressive enough and that they didn't go far enough, and there has to be some drastic change. Look at what Elizabeth Warren is saying, and Bernie Sanders. You might expect it from them.  But I would imagine that Joe Biden didn't expect that from Kamala Harris.  To Cory Booker's point about Biden clinging to Obama when it's useful for him and distancing when it's not, it's pretty effective and I think that's why he got the applause that he did.",

Number two, I happened to read that Joe Manchin, John Tester, Mark Warner, as well as Jeanne Shaheen, all Democrats who said these people on the stage are not reflecting what I think what Democrats stand for. We're not for Medicare for all, we're not for opening up the border and letting people waltz in, or decriminalizing. You know, we're not for a lot what -- most of the people are getting applause for.

It was a big favorite among white educated people, especially liberals who felt by watching The Wire and talking about it, it solved Baltimore's problems. Sort of the way \"Game of Thrones\" solved the nation's dragon problem. So art could eliminate a problem, but it could also pretend to be a solution. Everyone watches a show and feels better about themselves, it's virtue signaling with popcorn and a remote, you never have to leave your couch, but at least you've done something, which is more than Trump can say, he probably never watched \"The Wire.\" So \"The Wire\" won tons of awards and is considered a classic. And for two decades the city it depicts declines even more. I applaud Cummings for his frankness, but wonder how despite all the money shoveled into that district, none of the problems depicted so starkly in \"The Wire,\" the drugs, the debt, the corruption, were fixed.

Now, what he did have that I didn't see a ton of last night is the charisma, the hope, the lift, right? You saw Dan Bowles of the Washington Post writes today that the Democrats put their worse face forward the last two nights. President Obama when he was running, he was -- remember he was the happy guy. Hope and change. And you didn't really feel any of that on the stage. I also think that instead of going after President Trump, like, I know -- I understand they kind of -- they did go -- they always go after President Trump, but the focus was on that the last eight years was not progressive enough and that they didn't go far enough, and there has to be some drastic change. Look at what Elizabeth Warren is saying, and Bernie Sanders. You might expect it from them. But I would imagine that Joe Biden didn't expect that from Kamala Harris.  To Cory Booker's point about Biden clinging to Obama when it's useful for him and distancing when it's not, it's pretty effective and I think that's why he got the applause that he did."

So when somebody zings somebody you get this -- like the Kool Aid line that Cory used. Wasn't that creative or interesting? But it felt like it needed applause. To your point, in 2009, President Obama was seen as a progressive hero, ten years later he's now considered a Republican. And Obamacare is a right- wing plot.

But especially in California, and especially -- you know, given her record there, she flip-flopped over the line between backing the blue and really, you know, being that kind of fan of that liberal community for a lot of years.

Number two is -- tell me what kind of mayor you were, Cory Booker? What were you doing on crime? What did you do for the area? What did you do for gangs? What kind of report card do you have? So Joe Biden said, yeah, I kind of want this fight. Cory Booker had a great line. People applauded, we move on. But this is legitimate farter for anybody he sits down and talks to him. Number two, I happened to read that Joe Manchin, John Tester, Mark Warner, as well as Jeanne Shaheen, all Democrats who said these people on the stage are not reflecting what I think what Democrats stand for. We're not for Medicare for all, we're not for opening up the border and letting people waltz in, or decriminalizing. You know, we're not for a lot what -- most of the people are getting applause for. So there's a problem.  The Democrats got to have a therapist, find out what they stand for. I don't know why Elizabeth Warren would stand out?

Now, she takes it as a compliment that she was getting all of this heat because she's considered one of the front runners, but I think that that was a bit of a mistake. And you want to know how you can tell. Today, she came out after the debate, she held a press conference for about 45 minutes, took as many questions as she could, and I think that was to reassure her supporters and the people sending checks to her campaign that she's got this.

Well, I know what I did, I watched The Wire, just like a bunch of other white people did. This fantastic show depicted the horrors of Baltimore's drug problem, back before drugs became a lifestyle choice, -- like Al Sharpton. It was a big favorite among white educated people, especially liberals who felt by watching The Wire and talking about it, it solved Baltimore's problems. Sort of the way \"Game of Thrones\" solved the nation's dragon problem. So art could eliminate a problem, but it could also pretend to be a solution. Everyone watches a show and feels better about themselves, it's virtue signaling with popcorn and a remote, you never have to leave your couch, but at least you've done something, which is more than Trump can say, he probably never watched \"The Wire.\" So \"The Wire\" won tons of awards and is considered a classic. And for two decades the city it depicts declines even more. I applaud Cummings for his frankness, but wonder how despite all the money shoveled into that district, none of the problems depicted so starkly in \"The Wire,\" the drugs, the debt, the corruption, were fixed. Meanwhile, Cummings is a millionaire, another in a long line of liberal Democrats who have work hard and become rich people. Maybe HBO can do a TV series about that, too.

Now, President Trump by contrast is going to Ohio, no Republicans ever won an election without Ohio. He won by nine points. He's leaving nothing to chance. He's going to go to Ohio.

So, 100 percent, he's going to lean into Biden and everyone else's comments about phasing out coal and fracking et cetera and his reelect team ran with that hard-last night. Right. We saw that on Twitter. They immediately pounced on that. And I also think that we talked a little bit about this yesterday, but the Democratic Party is 100 percent alienating a lot of those voters who have been powering our country for decades and they are making them seem like they are part of the problem. And so, Trump will likely pounce on that too.  KILMEADE: The thing is, he's got to play a perfect game, Dana, because one chant dominated a 90-minute speech. So, he's got to do things maybe that are out of his control. Question. If he hears send them back or some type of chant, if you're Trump, do you not step back? Do you step forward?

And then August 10th in Birmingham. This is Birmingham Alabama. I go right there. I think I'm going to choose to fly rather than drive and then hit San Antonio on the 16th of November.

And the point of this charity is to restore these classic cars left behind that those were killed in action. Take a look."
