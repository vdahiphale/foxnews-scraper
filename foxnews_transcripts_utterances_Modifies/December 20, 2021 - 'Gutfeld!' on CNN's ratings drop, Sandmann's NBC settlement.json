For once, I guess even perverts take holiday breaks. Yes, it was announced that CNN has closed its offices to \"non-essential employees.\" It's either for COVID or so law enforcement could have a break. Meaning the only people at CNN are people that are necessary to create their product. We visited their offices to see who's left.",

Here's a delightful picture of what appears to be a mentally deranged, unstable freak, celebrating an act of arson. Yes, it's Jim Acosta standing with a group of CNN employees who thankfully aren't sex traffickers. They're all unmasked, of course, which is weird. You think after the month CNN had, they'd all be wearing masks to hide their embarrassed faces. But what's he holding? Yes, a picture of the Fox Christmas tree surrounded by faces of Fox T.V. personalities. That's kind of creepy, you know. I mean, even for Acosta, that guy makes Dracula seem less dead inside. Let's take a closer look at it, shall we? Now obviously, it's hard to parse what a nutcase does. But what could it mean? Anything. He could be mocking the fact that the Fox tree was torched in a disgusting act of arson, that would make the most sense, given that CNN has a penchant for not only making light of crime, but making crime itself.",

And even the remaining anchors still have whiplash from looking the other way from people's misery. It's a pattern, what doesn't harm them, but harms you, they laugh that because laughing at horrible realities is a way of coping. For CNN and Kamala Harris, it's their version of a smoke bomb. So now that that network is the face of crime, instead of covering it, they now cover for it. The upside at least we know where all these people are at any given time. The only reason why I'm glad Don Lemon is on the air is to know when it's safe to go drinking outside. That guy is more hansy than Big Ben. Who knew once the most trusted name in news is now a sanctuary city for sad sacks. Check out this screen grab. How cute is this? Got to read that lower third. At CNN implodes under the weight of sex crimes and firings. They desperately try the look over at Fox News ploy as witness here with the general of gelato Brian Stelter. He can't even fool Democrats anymore. But I get it when you're now the hood ornament of media deceit and self humiliation. This is the only ploy but look at Fox. Their entire network is but look at Fox. And it's working out for us. Like Brian himself. Our ratings are massive. On any given night, this show has four, yes, four times the viewing audiences Don Lemon. Yes. I will take it. Why not? Now I know that's like saying I'm four times better looking than the Elephant Man. Or four times a better shot than Alec Baldwin. But you think they'd learn at this point? I mean, it's like their audience got CNN COVID killing their ratings dead.",

But like me wandering into a Cinnabon store stoned, it's too late for them to turn back. Like George Custer they lead the charge and so many awful things. They spent a year letting one anchor deceptively defend his brother, as he sexually harassed and sent thousands of elderly people to their death. His brother killed more old people than air horns. Joking about his brother's big nose with a giant Q-tip should have tipped off CNN's brass that this wasn't journalism. Then after much outside pressure, they fired him pretending they were disgusted by the behavior all alone. Yes. I guess that's why they let him do it for a really, really long time. They lied about January 6th and why not? They lie about the other 364 days a year. They lied about border agents whipping Haitians. They lied about so many things they claimed was worse than Watergate and worse than the Civil War. Yes, worse than the Civil War, which ended slavery. Yet CNN thought it was bad. Go figure. They must have hated how World War II ended to. They claim to funding the cops didn't exist when it did. They claim no one could prove critical race theory existed and when people easily proved it did they called you racist. They called you a terrorist but they already use that for January 6th. In the old days, media would defend their peer's rights to say something they disagreed with. But now CNN claims that freedom of the press no longer applies to anyone outside their building. They also felt the desire to punish anyone tangentially related to their perceived enemies or critics because their -- for ideological, ideological separatism, punishment included. And that allows them to be blind to how outlandish stupid and biased their content is. Yet it wasn't enough to target Fox News. You got to go after Trump voters, parents, the police, anyone who dare question mask mandates. They became the mouthpiece for enforced conformity. As a mock real crime they happily tried to cancel you for a meme. They ignored mobs destroying cities while trumpeting phony hate crimes. They'd be happy if we were all on terror watch lists. But there is bright side. And CNN is too busy focusing all their energies on Fox. At least maybe the kids are safe. Frankly, I'd rather have their hands on a picture of a tree that instead of -- instead of hiding in one with a pair of binoculars next to a middle school. So that's the silver lining to CNN's really (BLEEP) year. Just don't stand next to the anchors on New Year's Eve when they start looking for someone to kiss. You don't know where that mouth has been.",

Sandman gets a pile of money. And NBC still has custody of Joy Reid. So win lose. But just like his previous settlements with the Washington Post and CNN, this one's also confidential. Just like that police report when Kat got kicked out of Bret Baier's dressing room. Yes. Of course, you'd recall the lawsuits were the fallout over a confrontation at the 2019 march for life in D.C. Media reports said the incident was racially charged and blamed Sandman. And racially charged it was with slurs shatter by the racist black Israelites groups who hate white people like AOC hates coherent sentences. Now the filing against him NBC Universal and MSNBC reportedly asked for $275 million. Nearly twice my yearly salary. But really we all want to know how much did he get? But he's not buying any stuff that would give us a hint, which is smart because if Goodfellas taught us anything, don't buy flat (BLEEP) after a windfall because then you get whacked. Throw the strangle, yes. So how can we get him to tell us how much the settlement was without telling us what the settlement was? Nick, if you're watching, here's some things you can buy. So we know what you got. If the settlement is just like a few 100 bucks then you buy Jesse Watters' toupee. Made of alpaca hair. Now, but something in the six figure range, you could buy Brian Kilmeade's favorite mode of transport? Yes, this is exactly how he gets around. I just like why it's very calming, just to watch her go down those steps. And if the settlement is anything over seven figures, you should really buy this.

The poll also found that 47 percent would feel comfortable working alongside their convicted counterparts as long as their past arrest was not for violent crime which makes sense and that their teardrop tattoo means that they cried at weddings. Finally, the survey found that bosses who give second chances tend to be very forgiving, with 90 percent of managers saying employees with criminal records work just as hard as they're law- abiding colleagues.

Yes, it's Jim Acosta standing with a group of CNN employees who thankfully aren't sex traffickers. They're all unmasked, of course, which is weird.

Yes, a picture of the Fox Christmas tree surrounded by faces of Fox T.V. personalities. That's kind of creepy, you know. I mean, even for Acosta, that guy makes Dracula seem less dead inside. Let's take a closer look at it, shall we? Now obviously, it's hard to parse what a nutcase does. But what could it mean? Anything.

So now that that network is the face of crime, instead of covering it, they now cover for it. The upside at least we know where all these people are at any given time. The only reason why I'm glad Don Lemon is on the air is to know when it's safe to go drinking outside. That guy is more hansy than Big Ben. Who knew once the most trusted name in news is now a sanctuary city for sad sacks. Check out this screen grab. How cute is this? Got to read that lower third. At CNN implodes under the weight of sex crimes and firings. They desperately try the look over at Fox News ploy as witness here with the general of gelato Brian Stelter. He can't even fool Democrats anymore. But I get it when you're now the hood ornament of media deceit and self humiliation. This is the only ploy but look at Fox. Their entire network is but look at Fox. And it's working out for us. Like Brian himself. Our ratings are massive. On any given night, this show has four, yes, four times the viewing audiences Don Lemon. Yes. I will take it. Why not? Now I know that's like saying I'm four times better looking than the Elephant Man. Or four times a better shot than Alec Baldwin. But you think they'd learn at this point?

But like me wandering into a Cinnabon store stoned, it's too late for them to turn back. Like George Custer they lead the charge and so many awful things. They spent a year letting one anchor deceptively defend his brother, as he sexually harassed and sent thousands of elderly people to their death. His brother killed more old people than air horns. Joking about his brother's big nose with a giant Q-tip should have tipped off CNN's brass that this wasn't journalism. Then after much outside pressure, they fired him pretending they were disgusted by the behavior all alone. Yes. I guess that's why they let him do it for a really, really long time. They lied about January 6th and why not? They lie about the other 364 days a year. They lied about border agents whipping Haitians. They lied about so many things they claimed was worse than Watergate and worse than the Civil War. Yes, worse than the Civil War, which ended slavery. Yet CNN thought it was bad. Go figure. They must have hated how World War II ended to. They claim to funding the cops didn't exist when it did. They claim no one could prove critical race theory existed and when people easily proved it did they called you racist. They called you a terrorist but they already use that for January 6th. In the old days, media would defend their peer's rights to say something they disagreed with. But now CNN claims that freedom of the press no longer applies to anyone outside their building. They also felt the desire to punish anyone tangentially related to their perceived enemies or critics because their -- for ideological, ideological separatism, punishment included. And that allows them to be blind to how outlandish stupid and biased their content is. Yet it wasn't enough to target Fox News. You got to go after Trump voters, parents, the police, anyone who dare question mask mandates. They became the mouthpiece for enforced conformity. As a mock real crime they happily tried to cancel you for a meme. They ignored mobs destroying cities while trumpeting phony hate crimes. They'd be happy if we were all on terror watch lists. But there is bright side. And CNN is too busy focusing all their energies on Fox. At least maybe the kids are safe. Frankly, I'd rather have their hands on a picture of a tree that instead of -- instead of hiding in one with a pair of binoculars next to a middle school. So that's the silver lining to CNN's really (BLEEP) year. Just don't stand next to the anchors on New Year's Eve when they start looking for someone to kiss.

Sandman gets a pile of money. And NBC still has custody of Joy Reid. So win lose. But just like his previous settlements with the Washington Post and CNN, this one's also confidential.

Media reports said the incident was racially charged and blamed Sandman.

Throw the strangle, yes. So how can we get him to tell us how much the settlement was without telling us what the settlement was? Nick, if you're watching, here's some things you can buy. So we know what you got. If the settlement is just like a few 100 bucks then you buy Jesse Watters' toupee. Made of alpaca hair. Now, but something in the six figure range, you could buy Brian Kilmeade's favorite mode of transport? Yes, this is exactly how he gets around.

Finally, the survey found that bosses who give second chances tend to be very forgiving, with 90 percent of managers saying employees with criminal records work just as hard as they're law- abiding colleagues.

Yes, it's Jim Acosta standing with a group of CNN employees who thankfully aren't sex traffickers. They're all unmasked, of course, which is weird. You think after the month CNN had, they'd all be wearing masks to hide their embarrassed faces. But what's he holding? Yes, a picture of the Fox Christmas tree surrounded by faces of Fox T.V. personalities. That's kind of creepy, you know. I mean, even for Acosta, that guy makes Dracula seem less dead inside. Let's take a closer look at it, shall we? Now obviously, it's hard to parse what a nutcase does. But what could it mean? Anything. He could be mocking the fact that the Fox tree was torched in a disgusting act of arson, that would make the most sense, given that CNN has a penchant for not only making light of crime, but making crime itself."

And even the remaining anchors still have whiplash from looking the other way from people's misery. It's a pattern, what doesn't harm them, but harms you, they laugh that because laughing at horrible realities is a way of coping. For CNN and Kamala Harris, it's their version of a smoke bomb. So now that that network is the face of crime, instead of covering it, they now cover for it. The upside at least we know where all these people are at any given time. The only reason why I'm glad Don Lemon is on the air is to know when it's safe to go drinking outside. That guy is more hansy than Big Ben. Who knew once the most trusted name in news is now a sanctuary city for sad sacks. Check out this screen grab. How cute is this? Got to read that lower third. At CNN implodes under the weight of sex crimes and firings. They desperately try the look over at Fox News ploy as witness here with the general of gelato Brian Stelter. He can't even fool Democrats anymore. But I get it when you're now the hood ornament of media deceit and self humiliation. This is the only ploy but look at Fox. Their entire network is but look at Fox. And it's working out for us. Like Brian himself. Our ratings are massive. On any given night, this show has four, yes, four times the viewing audiences Don Lemon. Yes. I will take it. Why not? Now I know that's like saying I'm four times better looking than the Elephant Man. Or four times a better shot than Alec Baldwin. But you think they'd learn at this point?

      "utterance": "So, as they become the spokes network for mayhem, they send the remaining sensible viewers to us. But like me wandering into a Cinnabon store stoned, it's too late for them to turn back. Like George Custer they lead the charge and so many awful things. They spent a year letting one anchor deceptively defend his brother, as he sexually harassed and sent thousands of elderly people to their death. His brother killed more old people than air horns. Joking about his brother's big nose with a giant Q-tip should have tipped off CNN's brass that this wasn't journalism. Then after much outside pressure, they fired him pretending they were disgusted by the behavior all alone. Yes. I guess that's why they let him do it for a really, really long time. They lied about January 6th and why not? They lie about the other 364 days a year. They lied about border agents whipping Haitians. They lied about so many things they claimed was worse than Watergate and worse than the Civil War. Yes, worse than the Civil War, which ended slavery. Yet CNN thought it was bad. Go figure. They must have hated how World War II ended to. They claim to funding the cops didn't exist when it did. They claim no one could prove critical race theory existed and when people easily proved it did they called you racist. They called you a terrorist but they already use that for January 6th. In the old days, media would defend their peer's rights to say something they disagreed with. But now CNN claims that freedom of the press no longer applies to anyone outside their building. They also felt the desire to punish anyone tangentially related to their perceived enemies or critics because their -- for ideological, ideological separatism, punishment included. And that allows them to be blind to how outlandish stupid and biased their content is. Yet it wasn't enough to target Fox News. You got to go after Trump voters, parents, the police, anyone who dare question mask mandates. They became the mouthpiece for enforced conformity. As a mock real crime they happily tried to cancel you for a meme. They ignored mobs destroying cities while trumpeting phony hate crimes. They'd be happy if we were all on terror watch lists. But there is bright side. And CNN is too busy focusing all their energies on Fox. At least maybe the kids are safe. Frankly, I'd rather have their hands on a picture of a tree that instead of -- instead of hiding in one with a pair of binoculars next to a middle school. So that's the silver lining to CNN's really (BLEEP) year. Just don't stand next to the anchors on New Year's Eve when they start looking for someone to kiss. You don't know where that mouth has been."

Sandman gets a pile of money. And NBC still has custody of Joy Reid. So win lose. But just like his previous settlements with the Washington Post and CNN, this one's also confidential. Just like that police report when Kat got kicked out of Bret Baier's dressing room. Yes. Of course, you'd recall the lawsuits were the fallout over a confrontation at the 2019 march for life in D.C. Media reports said the incident was racially charged and blamed Sandman. And racially charged it was with slurs shatter by the racist black Israelites groups who hate white people like AOC hates coherent sentences. Now the filing against him NBC Universal and MSNBC reportedly asked for $275 million. Nearly twice my yearly salary. But really we all want to know how much did he get? But he's not buying any stuff that would give us a hint, which is smart because if Goodfellas taught us anything, don't buy flat (BLEEP) after a windfall because then you get whacked. Throw the strangle, yes. So how can we get him to tell us how much the settlement was without telling us what the settlement was? Nick, if you're watching, here's some things you can buy. So we know what you got. If the settlement is just like a few 100 bucks then you buy Jesse Watters' toupee. Made of alpaca hair. Now, but something in the six figure range, you could buy Brian Kilmeade's favorite mode of transport? Yes, this is exactly how he gets around. I just like why it's very calming, just to watch her go down those steps. And if the settlement is anything over seven figures, you should really buy this.

A new survey by the Human Resources company, Checker, I guess they had to get out of the taxi cab business, says four in five American workers would actually support their job hiring people with criminal, criminal records -- former inmates. What the survey left out was that the four out of five workers were CNN employees, and the fifth one stocking up on pepper spray. The poll also found that 47 percent would feel comfortable working alongside their convicted counterparts as long as their past arrest was not for violent crime which makes sense and that their teardrop tattoo means that they cried at weddings. Finally, the survey found that bosses who give second chances tend to be very forgiving, with 90 percent of managers saying employees with criminal records work just as hard as they're law- abiding colleagues. And you never know when you might need to shank a troublemaker in the accounting department. I, for one, have always pitied the down and out jailbird and I've never turned my back on hiring a criminal."

For once, I guess even perverts take holiday breaks. Yes, it was announced that CNN has closed its offices to \"non-essential employees.\" It's either for COVID or so law enforcement could have a break. Meaning the only people at CNN are people that are necessary to create their product. We visited their offices to see who's left."

Here's a delightful picture of what appears to be a mentally deranged, unstable freak, celebrating an act of arson. Yes, it's Jim Acosta standing with a group of CNN employees who thankfully aren't sex traffickers. They're all unmasked, of course, which is weird. You think after the month CNN had, they'd all be wearing masks to hide their embarrassed faces. But what's he holding? Yes, a picture of the Fox Christmas tree surrounded by faces of Fox T.V. personalities. That's kind of creepy, you know. I mean, even for Acosta, that guy makes Dracula seem less dead inside. Let's take a closer look at it, shall we? Now obviously, it's hard to parse what a nutcase does. But what could it mean? Anything. He could be mocking the fact that the Fox tree was torched in a disgusting act of arson, that would make the most sense, given that CNN has a penchant for not only making light of crime, but making crime itself."

It's like -- if you watch a certain state TV and you listen to conservative media, you would think that, you know, entire cities are just, you know, in brawled in fights and fires and whatever. We went out had a great dinner in New York City tonight, people actually walked up to us and said thank you for -- I watch you every night."

And even the remaining anchors still have whiplash from looking the other way from people's misery. It's a pattern, what doesn't harm them, but harms you, they laugh that because laughing at horrible realities is a way of coping. For CNN and Kamala Harris, it's their version of a smoke bomb. So now that that network is the face of crime, instead of covering it, they now cover for it. The upside at least we know where all these people are at any given time. The only reason why I'm glad Don Lemon is on the air is to know when it's safe to go drinking outside. That guy is more hansy than Big Ben. Who knew once the most trusted name in news is now a sanctuary city for sad sacks. Check out this screen grab. How cute is this? Got to read that lower third. At CNN implodes under the weight of sex crimes and firings. They desperately try the look over at Fox News ploy as witness here with the general of gelato Brian Stelter. He can't even fool Democrats anymore. But I get it when you're now the hood ornament of media deceit and self humiliation. This is the only ploy but look at Fox. Their entire network is but look at Fox. And it's working out for us. Like Brian himself. Our ratings are massive. On any given night, this show has four, yes, four times the viewing audiences Don Lemon. Yes. I will take it. Why not? Now I know that's like saying I'm four times better looking than the Elephant Man. Or four times a better shot than Alec Baldwin. But you think they'd learn at this point? I mean, it's like their audience got CNN COVID killing their ratings dead."

We'd like to congratulate CNN on successfully vaccinating yourself against high ratings. I've never seen viewer number this slow. Now will you need a booster eventually, perhaps by giving a show to some previously unknown even less talented Cuomo variant? Only time will tell. But until then, anyone know what this thing does?"

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "So, as they become the spokes network for mayhem, they send the remaining sensible viewers to us. But like me wandering into a Cinnabon store stoned, it's too late for them to turn back. Like George Custer they lead the charge and so many awful things. They spent a year letting one anchor deceptively defend his brother, as he sexually harassed and sent thousands of elderly people to their death. His brother killed more old people than air horns. Joking about his brother's big nose with a giant Q-tip should have tipped off CNN's brass that this wasn't journalism. Then after much outside pressure, they fired him pretending they were disgusted by the behavior all alone. Yes. I guess that's why they let him do it for a really, really long time. They lied about January 6th and why not? They lie about the other 364 days a year. They lied about border agents whipping Haitians. They lied about so many things they claimed was worse than Watergate and worse than the Civil War. Yes, worse than the Civil War, which ended slavery. Yet CNN thought it was bad. Go figure. They must have hated how World War II ended to. They claim to funding the cops didn't exist when it did. They claim no one could prove critical race theory existed and when people easily proved it did they called you racist. They called you a terrorist but they already use that for January 6th. In the old days, media would defend their peer's rights to say something they disagreed with. But now CNN claims that freedom of the press no longer applies to anyone outside their building. They also felt the desire to punish anyone tangentially related to their perceived enemies or critics because their -- for ideological, ideological separatism, punishment included. And that allows them to be blind to how outlandish stupid and biased their content is. Yet it wasn't enough to target Fox News. You got to go after Trump voters, parents, the police, anyone who dare question mask mandates. They became the mouthpiece for enforced conformity. As a mock real crime they happily tried to cancel you for a meme. They ignored mobs destroying cities while trumpeting phony hate crimes. They'd be happy if we were all on terror watch lists. But there is bright side. And CNN is too busy focusing all their energies on Fox. At least maybe the kids are safe. Frankly, I'd rather have their hands on a picture of a tree that instead of -- instead of hiding in one with a pair of binoculars next to a middle school. So that's the silver lining to CNN's really (BLEEP) year. Just don't stand next to the anchors on New Year's Eve when they start looking for someone to kiss. You don't know where that mouth has been."

Sandman gets a pile of money. And NBC still has custody of Joy Reid. So win lose. But just like his previous settlements with the Washington Post and CNN, this one's also confidential. Just like that police report when Kat got kicked out of Bret Baier's dressing room. Yes. Of course, you'd recall the lawsuits were the fallout over a confrontation at the 2019 march for life in D.C. Media reports said the incident was racially charged and blamed Sandman. And racially charged it was with slurs shatter by the racist black Israelites groups who hate white people like AOC hates coherent sentences. Now the filing against him NBC Universal and MSNBC reportedly asked for $275 million. Nearly twice my yearly salary. But really we all want to know how much did he get? But he's not buying any stuff that would give us a hint, which is smart because if Goodfellas taught us anything, don't buy flat (BLEEP) after a windfall because then you get whacked. Throw the strangle, yes. So how can we get him to tell us how much the settlement was without telling us what the settlement was? Nick, if you're watching, here's some things you can buy. So we know what you got. If the settlement is just like a few 100 bucks then you buy Jesse Watters' toupee. Made of alpaca hair. Now, but something in the six figure range, you could buy Brian Kilmeade's favorite mode of transport? Yes, this is exactly how he gets around. I just like why it's very calming, just to watch her go down those steps. And if the settlement is anything over seven figures, you should really buy this.

What the survey left out was that the four out of five workers were CNN employees, and the fifth one stocking up on pepper spray. The poll also found that 47 percent would feel comfortable working alongside their convicted counterparts as long as their past arrest was not for violent crime which makes sense and that their teardrop tattoo means that they cried at weddings. Finally, the survey found that bosses who give second chances tend to be very forgiving, with 90 percent of managers saying employees with criminal records work just as hard as they're law- abiding colleagues.

In Texas, a Joe, it's not just the toads who are horny, a single gentlemen put up a billboard last month alongside the highway to help them land a date. The billboard quickly leapfrogged Nicole Wallace in viewership. The 66-year-old father of five's message reads: \"Wanted a good woman, 50 to 55- ish for talks and walks in mutual acts of kindness.\" Yes, the old mutual acts of kindness.

This goes to show that even a man desperate enough to rent a billboard will still expect a woman to be 15 years younger.
