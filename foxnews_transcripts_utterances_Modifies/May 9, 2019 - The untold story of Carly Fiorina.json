If Attorney General Barr were to turn over the report, he would be breaking the law since the grand jury testimony cannot be, by law, shared with Congress.

China, on the other hand, they have the slowest growth in three decades, their wages are declining, their manufacturing sector is shedding jobs, their population is aging and producibility is going down. So, Trump calculates that one, the United States can better withstand a trade confrontation with China than China can, and two, Xi needs this deal more than he does. Because our economy is strong. We can -- we can withstand, when you are well armed, economically, you can withstand a trade war. China cannot withstand a trade war with the United States, so we're in a position of strength to negotiate.",

The Fed say Hale then gave the documents to an unnamed reporter, but court records say that reporter made a documentary about the U.S. military's use of drones which points to Jeremy Scahill, a founding editor of The Intercept, a news outlet that has also done extensive reporting on U.S. drone operations. Daniel Hale's attorney calls him a whistleblower. And The Intercept released a statement that reads in part, quoting here. \"These documents detailed the secret, unaccountable process for targeting and killing people around the world, including U.S. citizens, through drone strikes.\" Other supporters call Hale's arrest an effort to criminalize journalism. The U.S. government maintains that Daniel Hale released critical information about military operations against terrorist targets, including terrorist identities and the identities of people who were screened because they were suspected of being involved in terrorism.

The conservative magazine declared an editorial, \"The proximate cause is a couple of redacted lines, including one footnote, in a 400-page report. Let's be glad for the sake of the republic that an entire page wasn't withheld.\" Guess what, new polling suggests the American people might agreeing that it's time to turn the page on the Mueller report. We'll have those new numbers later in the show. In moments, Mollie Hemingway from the Federalist, and a former speechwriter for Eric Holder, Jake Maccoby. They'll be here. But first, joining me live, Florida congressman, Matt Gaetz, a Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee. Good evening, Congressman."

But we have a real crisis on the border where 3,000 people a day are turning themselves in into a system that we cannot accommodate additional influx for. And now we've got a tortured interpretation of a constitutional crisis. I can assure you that is not the case. The game you're watching isn't the game that's being played. The very reason Jerry Nadler is going after a Bill Barr has nothing to do with the eight percent of the Mueller report that hasn't been seen, and it has everything to do with the fact that Bill Barr is now turning the tables on the people in the Obama White House. The people in the deep state and the intelligence community who politicized, a FISA court, and the investigators, I think, who departed from normalized practice."

Trying to articulate his message, because he knows that Barr is probably coming after Comey and his band of merry men who largely paved the way for Hillary Clinton to not face consequence, and then turned around.

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "I think what this latest subpoena shows is, there's never getting this behind us as far as the Democrats are concerned. Donald Trump Jr. has given dozens of hours of testimony to the intelligence committees in the Congress, and that doesn't seem to be enough. This is obviously an effort just to try to continue the fiction that there was some sort of improper action. But, I think we all can recognize if Donald Trump Jr. had committed a crime, Robert Mueller would have charged one. The reason Democrats say that Donald Trump wasn't charged is because he was the president. Well, Donald Trump Jr. is not the president. So, if he had done something wrong, he would have been charged with a crime. This is simply an effort to try to maintain the fiction that there was improper conduct that has now been proven false."

As you say, Robert Mueller had two years all of these subpoenas and witnesses and decided not to indict for whatever reason, Donald Trump Jr. and a whole bunch of other people. In addition to that, you believe that the Mueller report exonerated the president. If all of that is true, why doesn't the president want Bob Mueller to testify before Congress, then, and just say, hey, he's free and clear?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that'll ultimately be a decision that's not left to the president. I have no problem with Robert Mueller testifying. In fact, when Democrats had the Bill Barr subpoena, I offered an amendment to substitute Robert Mueller from -- for Bill Barr. I think we've heard a lot from Bill Barr, I'd love to hear from Mueller. Democrats on procedural basis blocked my amendment, blocked our access to Mueller. So, I'd love to see Mueller come in."

But in this case, you actually have an attorney general who has used every opportunity to undermine this report to spin it and to spin it for his boss.

But what we've got now is a situation in which the attorney general of the United States who is supposed to be acting on behalf of the American people is acting as a hatchet man for the president, and that's not how this should work. All of the Congress wants, and I think this is reasonable is to get an unredacted, uncensored version of this report that hasn't passed through the hands of a man who has shown that he will do anything to stand up for his boss."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Right. And first of, congressional oversight is very important. Congress creates agencies and they have an obligation to make sure that those agencies are doing what they should do and not doing what they shouldn't do. These are agencies that they fund. When they were trying to find out about the fast and furious issue, in which a federal agent was killed as part of a -- as part of a gun-running scheme that our government was running, that was clearly a legitimate oversight function. Having the Russia hoax blow up in your face is not necessarily a constitutional crisis. I do want Congress to get what it wants, but there are certain things that prohibit it. If Attorney General Barr were to turn over the report, he would be breaking the law since the grand jury testimony cannot be, by law, shared with Congress. There are also privileged communications there. So, you want to make sure that people do get what they need, but Attorney General Barr sort of bent over backwards in terms of trying to accommodate it. Again, it's very embarrassing that the -- that the report ended with not a single indictment for anyone colluding with Russia, despite what we were told. That doesn't mean it's a constitutional crisis."

      "speaker": "MACCOBY",
      "utterance": "But that's not true at all. What we want is this report, and what we want is to conduct oversight of the executive branch.

Even the president of the United States personally directing administration officials not to respond to subpoenas, not to testify before Congress, and it's not just Democrats, by the way, we just heard today that Don Jr. has been subpoenaed to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and that's not a Democrat who's doing that."

And the larger point is that there have been exposed by the Mueller report some serious and inappropriate actions by both the President and some of his most senior aides that I think the average American ought to familiarize themselves with, be aware of, be concerned about. But in my conversations with colleagues, as you mentioned, what I'm trying to do is keep us focused on legislating in ways that actually addresses the daily concerns the needs the issues that confront millions of working families who I think are losing patience with Congress and the federal government over the last decade because they don't see us doing enough to address their --"

You've mentioned concerns. But on the issue of obstruction, for example, there were concerns as you say raised by Robert Mueller but he didn't move forward. He didn't suggest there should be charges. And the same now we hear about the subpoena from the Senate Intel Committee today for Donald Trump Jr. to come back. Robert Mueller talked to him. He's talked to the Senate Judiciary Committee that you serve on, and in the end -- at the end of the day Robert Mueller did not indict Donald Trump Jr. So why is the Senate still wanting to hear from him?"

    {
      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "That's right, and that's an excellent question. I don't know the answer to that. It was the Intelligence Committee, a committee on which I don't serve, that issued a subpoena form. My best hunch is that the Mueller report revealed some ways in which Donald Trump Jr. was well aware of either the ongoing Trump Tower Moscow project or some aspects of the meeting and Trump Tower with folks offering dirt on Hillary Clinton who were Russian that wasn't testified about to the Intelligence Committee and they want to bring him back in to see if they can get a straight answer out of him. You know, there's a number of folks who have been held accountable for having lied to Congress. One of the Michael Cohen just reported for a jail term, others you know, Michael Flynn and others have faced accountability. I don't think it's inappropriate for the Intelligence Committee on a bipartisan basis to put someone back in and question --"

But if -- and I stress if Donald Trump Jr. lied to Congress, why didn't Robert Mueller with more than a dozen prosecutors at its disposal, the hundreds of witnesses in subpoenas we were all heard about, why didn't he recommend charges then if he lied?"

    {
      "speaker": "COONS",

One of the things that led a number of us on the Judiciary Committee to recommend that we bring Robert Mueller in for one session, one hearing of questioning was there's a lot of unanswered questions from the second volume of the Mueller report. There's a fair amount of evidence that dozens of former federal prosecutors have said would make out a claim for obstruction that I think would be worth are having a conversation with Mueller about. And there was that conversation between Mueller and the Attorney General where Lindsey Graham our Chairman has that if there was a misrepresentation of that call, that would be grounds for bringing Mueller in."

I don't know. I wasn't there for that interview, but my hunch is that Senator Blumenthal is a former Attorney General is speaking forcefully about subpoenas and the importance of respecting due process. But to your broader point, I think the average American is looking for us to legislate on things that matter. One of the things I regret is that there isn't enough coverage of when we do make bipartisan progress today, actually today in the Judiciary Committee, there were three different bills that moved out, several of them Senator Blumenthal was a co-sponsor with Republicans --"

And it's pretty clear, and you know, the Democrats that had a seven-point advantage you know, in the Midterms, that advantage in the latest poll has shrunk to a difference in favorability of only two percent of the parties. And if I ask do you want investigations or infrastructure, 80 percent say that. So I think the public says look, we wanted to get the Mueller report. In the end, there was no Russia collusion. Let's get back to business. Congress itself has only a 23 percent approval rating."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",

Do you think Democrats in Congress are doing too much, too little, or about the right amount to investigate Donald Trump? And it shows a plurality of people. 41 percent say Democrats are simply investigating the president too much. How does that play as we head into 2020?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, because I think the voters are saying what are they getting from the Democrats. In many ways, they voted the Democrats in the House because they were dissatisfied with the Republicans for being log-jammed, and they are not going to tolerate another two years of log jamming, and this now is tipping over. Look, I think the two bases of each party are happy to argue about the Mueller report and obstruction and collusion forever, but the middle of the country wants issues and is fed up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So The Wall Street Journal had an editorial about all of this a couple days ago, and they basically said that the Democrats want to keep their base happy, the resistors if you will, by saying we're investigating, we're going after them, we're not giving up but they want to stop short of actual impeachment. They called it a pseudo impeachment. You agree with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, that's I think exactly what's happening. You've got some chairmen in the committees who are in safe districts who are pandering to a base, a majority of Democrats would go ahead and impeach President Trump. And at the same time though, they're hurting the election chances over all of the Democrats as a party because 63, 65 percent what wouldn't do impeachment. And so they're trying to walk that fine line. You heard it in that interview with Senator Coons. He's investigating, he's trying to do legislating. Look, you got to choose. And I think the public after the Mueller report is pretty clear what they want the Congress to choose."

You stop and think about what happened in Venezuela with the Maduro regime, you know, we thought that we had one garner on the way in, that exploded, now the president has some bad feelings.

And look, the reality is Trump has figured out that we are not going to get China to change its trade practices by filing a strongly worded letter. We talked about letters with the WTO. The reality is that the U.S. economy is booming right now. We have a comparative advantage because 3.2 percent economic growth, lowest unemployment in five decades. China, on the other hand, they have the slowest growth in three decades, their wages are declining, their manufacturing sector is shedding jobs, their population is aging and producibility is going down. So, Trump calculates that one, the United States can better withstand a trade confrontation with China than China can, and two, Xi needs this deal more than he does. Because our economy is strong. We can -- we can withstand, when you are well armed, economically, you can withstand a trade war. China cannot withstand a trade war with the United States, so we're in a position of strength to negotiate."

And after leaving the military, he worked as a contractor for the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, or NGA, where he had top-secret security clearance, and allegedly used his top-secret computer to print out dozens of documents related to U.S. counterterrorism operations, specifically drone strikes. The Fed say Hale then gave the documents to an unnamed reporter, but court records say that reporter made a documentary about the U.S. military's use of drones which points to Jeremy Scahill, a founding editor of The Intercept, a news outlet that has also done extensive reporting on U.S. drone operations. Daniel Hale's attorney calls him a whistleblower. And The Intercept released a statement that reads in part, quoting here. \"These documents detailed the secret, unaccountable process for targeting and killing people around the world, including U.S. citizens, through drone strikes.\" Other supporters call Hale's arrest an effort to criminalize journalism. The U.S. government maintains that Daniel Hale released critical information about military operations against terrorist targets, including terrorist identities and the identities of people who were screened because they were suspected of being involved in terrorism.

So, the Associated Press had a look at this auto generated, we have some video of it, Facebook celebration video with various images. Look at this. Basically, it's an animated video that begins with a photo of the black flags of Jihad. Seconds later, it flashes highlights of a year of social media posts, that basically some of the stuff was being posted, and they thought it was, you know, some sort of celebration. So, they said great, let's put this together like it's somebody's birthday video like we get on our normal pages. Instead, it's Jihad propaganda and it's just sort of auto generated, and then who knows, kids, others, are seeing this trash."

That's where he is inspired to do these things, and Facebook all they're thinking about right now is their quarterly profit. And it's not just Facebook who has this responsibility. It's YouTube, it's Twitter, and it is the less popular sites like 8chan."

What I will say, though, is that we can break up Facebook and still face the same problem, which is incendiary language, terrorist content on our social media platforms. And if we don't have a strong public-private partnership that is completely focused on dealing with this crisis, we are going to continue to deal with this whether we break up these large social media companies or not, and that's what I'm concerned with. Keeping the American people safe."

George Washington said to us in 1789, the trouble with political parties is they will come to care only about winning. The genius of this country was in understanding that the citizen is sovereign and that people closest to the problem know best how to solve it. That was the idea I ran my campaign on, but that's the idea behind this book, as well. That each of us have. I know this from my own life and from the people I've met along the way, each of us have enormous potential. More than we realize.

When you answered the door, you basically said it for him. You said, \"To step away from the presidential race was simply the next right decision to make. It wasn't a failure, it wasn't cause for devastation, grief, or regret. To think that way would be handing my power over to emotions that would never pay me back.\" What do you mean by that?"

But what I have learned in my life is we have so much more power, we make so much more of a contribution when we are on a path towards fulfilling our potential and helping others fulfill theirs. So, I was prepared to win the presidency and do the job. I was also always prepared to lose, and do something else. And it was clear that I couldn't win, so it was time to get out."

What it turned out I'm afraid of, I'm afraid that people will think what's wrong with Carly? Couldn't you stop this? You are a bad mother, you're a bad person. And once I said that out loud, and I thought, all right, what's the worst that can happen? People think that what's the best that can happen? Maybe I can help someone else. And the first time that I actually talked about Lori, of course it was very difficult. But this woman came up to me afterwards and she said, thank you so much for sharing your story, because I'm dealing with this. That was a blessing, for me."

      "utterance": "Well, women are more than half the nation, so women should be more than half of everything, really, because if they are not, we are wasting talent. So, I think it's wonderful that more women are running. I also think it's a shame that women have allowed themselves to be politicized and used, in a way. When I was running for president, my candidacy was called offensive to women by a lot of women's groups who didn't agree with me. Well, my goodness, men don't agree, why should women agree? We need to be able to resist assassinating someone's character because we disagree with them. And we also need to be able to resist excusing someone's character because we do agree with them. And so, I hope we'll take a more holistic view of women and say, yes, whatever their beliefs are, we need more of them in the workplace, in political life, we need more of them fulfilling their potential and changing the order of things for the better."
