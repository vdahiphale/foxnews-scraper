      "sentences": "All right. Thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We have major breaking news about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's witch-hunt against President Trump. This is an information overload our right here on this program. We're going to lay out the case tonight about how the American justice system, your system is literally hanging by a thread. Our constitution hangs in the balance tonight, and we will explain all of this to you, but it's going to take the entire hour. Please stay with us.  Also tonight, an inside look at how Donald Trump shocked the political world and won the White House in historic fashion. The co-authors, they were there of the new book, \"Let Trump Be Trump.\" Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie, they will give you that insider story right here.  Also Newt Gingrich, Judge Jeanine Pirro, Sarah Carter, Gregg Jarrett, Victoria Toensing, Dan Bongino, just to name a few. But first, the politics, the corruption, the malfeasance at play to unseat a duly elected president by you is far worse than anybody could have thought or could have ever even imagined. This is rotten to the core, it is creating now a clear and present danger to this country.  Tonight, explosive new information about Peter Strzok. He's the former top FBI counterintelligence official that was removed from the Russia investigation, why? For sending anti-Trump, pro-Hillary Clinton text messages. Fox News tonight has learned that Strzok's role in the Clinton email investigation is now under review. I will address that. And Strzok is directly tied to everything. The Clinton email probe, the Trump so-called Russia investigation. We have an investigative reporter Sarah Carter is reporting that Strzok even interviewed Lieutenant General Michael Flynn and Hillary Clinton in both cases and Fox News has confirmed that the former FBI official changed the language, he did it, in James Comey's draft letter about Hillary Clinton from grossly negligent to \"extreme carelessness.\"  Plus, the deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He has been identified tonight as the key witness that Congress wants to interview in regards to the anti-Trump fake news dossier and propaganda. And media insanity. ABC News suspends reporter Brian Ross after he is caught red-handed spreading more fake news and outright lies about General Flynn and the president. We also have very serious questions tonight about the rule of law. Equal justice under the law that you the American people deserve answers to. Is America, now, as my friend Mark Levin says becoming a post-constitutional Republic? Will cover all of this and much more. And tonight's breaking news opening monologue.  All right. This is one of those nights you got to stay tuned for the hour. There is so much new information to cover. It gets complicated, but it does all fit together, and I promise. Guess what, you won't get this anywhere else on TV.   We start with new explosive information in the developing scandal involving former top FBI official, his name is Peter Strzok. And according to reports from over the weekend, Strzok was removed from Mueller's investigation this summer after it was discovered that he was sending anti-Trump text messages to his girlfriend, a woman named Lisa Paige. She worked as a top FBI lawyer under Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Now since then, Fox News has learned that the office of Inspector General is now reviewing Peter Strzok's role in the Clinton email server investigation and from what we know, Strzok, who was an anti-Trump, Hillary Clinton- loving FBI official, was intimately involved in investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Now, just stop for a second. Now, think about James Comey. He was writing an exoneration before an investigation. And our own Catherine Herridge is reporting that Strzok was on the ground floor of that Clinton email server investigation. This is crucial. Now, that includes participating in the July 2, 2016 interview of the former secretary of state -- also remember, she was not under oath -- and Strzok was involved in recommending whether or not Hillary Clinton should be prosecuted. Remember, they hadn't fully investigated.   And Fox News has confirmed that the FBI official actually was the one that changed the language in James Comey's draft letter before the investigation was concluded about Hillary Clinton. The legal term \"grossly negligent.\" He changed it to \"extremely careless.\" And the FBI agent also helped draft James Comey, his now infamous exoneration statement that let Clinton off the hook. They never did the investigation. And Strzok lead the probe into classified Huma Abedin emails -- this guy is everywhere -- that were found on Anthony Weiner's computer. Now, House investigators are also telling Fox News tonight, they believe that it was Strzok that is tied to the FBI's handling of the anti-Trump fake news, phony Russian dossier and the FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate. Now, what this all means is that the fix was in on the Clinton investigation. What we have now is just more evidence, incontrovertible evidence. And speaking of the fake news dossier, Catherine Herridge is also reporting tonight that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is the key witness that Congress now wants to interview about that dossier. But McCabe, he's not going to show up to testify on Thursday. He is thought to have been the FBI's key point person, or the handler of former British M6 agent Christopher Steele, the guy that created the phony dossier and paid Russians to lie to influence you in that election. Now remember, according to reports, a political action committee tied to the Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, best friends with the Clintons -- remember, he gave a half a million dollars to Andrew McCabe's wife Jill, she was running for a Virginia State Senate seat. Now, Virginia's Democratic Party also gave Jill McCabe over $200,000, an obscene amount for any state Senate candidate.  Now, President Trump is reacting to this new information. He's tweeting out. \"After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation and more running the FBI, it's reputation is in tatters. Worst in history. But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.\"   The president is 100 percent right about James Comey and about Hillary Clinton, and about there being a double standard for Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. The president commented further on all of this. Let's take a look.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "Now, I know, this is a ton of information to unpack here, so, let me break this down even further for you. Here's what all of this means. We have an anti-Trump pro-Hillary Clinton top FBI official that is directly involved in letting Hillary Clinton walk free before interviewing the key people in the investigation, including Hillary Clinton. They exonerated Clinton before ever concluding the investigation. Then the same FBI official helped oversee Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into possible election interference and according to Sarah Carter's reporting, interviewed Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. This guy is abusively biased.  We have been saying for months that this is a political witch-hunt. This new information about Peter Strzok is a smoking gun. These types of tactics, they are only used in Banana Republics.   Now, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunez, he is now threatening to hold the FBI and the DOJ in contempt of Congress for stonewalling about why this guy Strzok was fired back in August. And what all of you need to know, the American people tonight, you need to know this. How deeply was this one guy, Peter Strzok involved in Mueller's investigation? Because other than Michael Flynn, who else did he interview? Why didn't he put Hillary under oath? And where else could Strzok have influenced and compromised this investigation with what we now know was a politically biased agenda? Remember Lieutenant General Flynn, he was surveilled, he was unmasked. His name was leaked to the press. That is illegal, that is a crime. Nobody has been investigated or arrested. So, what they did to Flynn is illegal and we can -- we can't discount the other massive conflicts of interest, the other red flags coming from Special Counsel Mueller's team. For example, key members of Mueller's team, look at the money on your screen, donated tens of thousands of dollars not to any Republicans, Democrats like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. How can anybody honestly say that those people are going to be fair and impartial after supporting liberal politicians with huge amounts of money, including President Trump's 2016 opponent. This stinks to high heaven.  And as the investigator Andrew Weissmann -- another questionable member and choice by Mueller's team. Our friend and colleague Gregg Jarrett did some digging into Weissmann's past. Here's what he found. Back during the Enron accounting scandal, Weissmann was a hard-charging prosecutor on the task force that brought a controversial obstruction of justice case against the accounting firm Arthur Andersen that eventually put that company out of business. It cost tens of thousands of people their jobs. And it was for nothing, because in 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the obstruction of justice conviction in a unanimous nine-zero ruling. Next to impossible.  And it's not the only example of Weissmann's aggressive tactics resulting in a case being overturned. The convictions of a business transaction between Enron and Merrill Lynch, it sent people to jail. It was also reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Critics have also accused Weissmann of intimidating witnesses, creating crimes that do not even exist, and in one case in particular, withholding exculpatory evidence would have helped the defendant. And just like Mueller, Weissmann is also tied to the corrupt Uranium One deal and the ensuing cover-up. Now, Weissmann ran the DOJ's fraud section during the Russian bribery scheme and Gregg Jarrett actually noticed it was his name and his signature on the bottom of the plea agreement signed by the Russian businessman involved in that case. And we can't forget that Mueller is also, what, best friends, BFF, with James Comey. A huge massive conflict of interest and potentially even a violation of law. All of this is inexcusable in any country that cares about the rule of law. You should not be allowed to tolerate this in any way shape, matter or form. And we should be asking ourselves a simple question: Why in God's name would Robert Mueller put this abusively biased team together of unethical political crusaders who have an agenda that we can now prove? Why are they involved in this investigation? It's been one giant pattern of bias and abuse of power.   And we have a tremendous amount of respect on this program for those of you that watch for law enforcement. We have a tremendous respect for the intelligence community who put their lives on the line for us every day. But because of politics, what, our Justice Department has people in it like Peter Strzok that are abusively, politically biased? What is the result? We now have a two-tiered justice system that I have been warning about. It is now creating a clear and present danger to this Republic. If we weaponized the tools of surveillance, the powerful tools, and if we have two sets of standards for justice, and people in power think they know what's in the best interest of you, the American people, and will undermine a duly elected president and try and get him thrown out of office since the day he is elected, we will have then lost this country.  And tonight, there's another major angle to the story that we cannot ignore discount. As the Washington Examiner's Byron York points out in a new article, the investigation into Michael Flynn was not about Russian collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign in Russia, Russia, Russia. Rather, it hinges on what is known as the Logan act.  Let me explain what this is. According to York and law, The Logan Act is a 218-year-old law in this country. A law that prohibits private citizens from acting on behalf of the United States in disputes with foreign governments. Guess what? In 218 years, nobody has ever been prosecuted under this law, and many legal experts call it archaic and simply irrelevant. And some even go as far as to say that it's unconstitutional. But this is what played, that law played the central role in the Obama administration's investigation into Flynn. Never mind the surveillance, unmasking and illegal leaks of intelligence. It's reportedly why the FBI agents went to the White House to interview Flynn back in January 24th about discussions that he had during the transition period with his counterpart, the Russian ambassador, about sanctions the Obama administration had placed on Russia. And the U.N. resolution on Israel. Big deal, that would have been his job. This is the interview where Flynn called \"lied\" to the FBI which led to his guilty plea. Again, nothing to do with Russia. But let's take a step back for a minute. Now, during this transition period, Obama State Department said they didn't have any problems with the Trump transition team reaching out to foreign officials. They said it. Watch this.",

Unfortunately for ABC, this isn't the first time Brian Ross has been accused of peddling fake news. I have a whole history of it. Like for example in 2012 when Ross falsely suggested the Colorado mass shooter James Holmes, he could be tied to the Tea Party. That turned out to be wrong, too.

If Hillary Clinton had won, none of this would have surfaced. They would have just kept covering up all the corruption. And they would have just kept taking care of themselves. So the very fact that you had this disrupting figured in the White House, all of us are learning some pretty horrifying things about how sick system is. How sick the entire processes in ways I would have thought were impossible.  And I have the greatest respect for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and it is astonishing to me that you could have people at the top who are this corrupt, this profoundly dishonest. The second thing that struck me, listening actually to your opening monologue. If you take what General Flynn is accused of and then you take virtually anything Hillary has done. I mean, 33,000 deletions of email without any kind of approval. You know, having a totally inappropriate server that was totally outside the State Department rules. I mean, it just goes on the list.

      "utterance": "All right. Thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We have major breaking news about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's witch-hunt against President Trump. This is an information overload our right here on this program. We're going to lay out the case tonight about how the American justice system, your system is literally hanging by a thread. Our constitution hangs in the balance tonight, and we will explain all of this to you, but it's going to take the entire hour. Please stay with us. Also tonight, an inside look at how Donald Trump shocked the political world and won the White House in historic fashion. The co-authors, they were there of the new book, \"Let Trump Be Trump.\" Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie, they will give you that insider story right here. Also Newt Gingrich, Judge Jeanine Pirro, Sarah Carter, Gregg Jarrett, Victoria Toensing, Dan Bongino, just to name a few. But first, the politics, the corruption, the malfeasance at play to unseat a duly elected president by you is far worse than anybody could have thought or could have ever even imagined. This is rotten to the core, it is creating now a clear and present danger to this country. Tonight, explosive new information about Peter Strzok. He's the former top FBI counterintelligence official that was removed from the Russia investigation, why? For sending anti-Trump, pro-Hillary Clinton text messages. Fox News tonight has learned that Strzok's role in the Clinton email investigation is now under review. I will address that. And Strzok is directly tied to everything. The Clinton email probe, the Trump so-called Russia investigation. We have an investigative reporter Sarah Carter is reporting that Strzok even interviewed Lieutenant General Michael Flynn and Hillary Clinton in both cases and Fox News has confirmed that the former FBI official changed the language, he did it, in James Comey's draft letter about Hillary Clinton from grossly negligent to \"extreme carelessness.\" Plus, the deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He has been identified tonight as the key witness that Congress wants to interview in regards to the anti-Trump fake news dossier and propaganda. And media insanity. ABC News suspends reporter Brian Ross after he is caught red-handed spreading more fake news and outright lies about General Flynn and the president. We also have very serious questions tonight about the rule of law. Equal justice under the law that you the American people deserve answers to. Is America, now, as my friend Mark Levin says becoming a post-constitutional Republic? Will cover all of this and much more. And tonight's breaking news opening monologue. All right. This is one of those nights you got to stay tuned for the hour. There is so much new information to cover. It gets complicated, but it does all fit together, and I promise. Guess what, you won't get this anywhere else on TV. We start with new explosive information in the developing scandal involving former top FBI official, his name is Peter Strzok. And according to reports from over the weekend, Strzok was removed from Mueller's investigation this summer after it was discovered that he was sending anti-Trump text messages to his girlfriend, a woman named Lisa Paige. She worked as a top FBI lawyer under Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Now since then, Fox News has learned that the office of Inspector General is now reviewing Peter Strzok's role in the Clinton email server investigation and from what we know, Strzok, who was an anti-Trump, Hillary Clinton- loving FBI official, was intimately involved in investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Now, just stop for a second. Now, think about James Comey. He was writing an exoneration before an investigation. And our own Catherine Herridge is reporting that Strzok was on the ground floor of that Clinton email server investigation. This is crucial. Now, that includes participating in the July 2, 2016 interview of the former secretary of state -- also remember, she was not under oath -- and Strzok was involved in recommending whether or not Hillary Clinton should be prosecuted. Remember, they hadn't fully investigated. And Fox News has confirmed that the FBI official actually was the one that changed the language in James Comey's draft letter before the investigation was concluded about Hillary Clinton. The legal term \"grossly negligent.\" He changed it to \"extremely careless.\" And the FBI agent also helped draft James Comey, his now infamous exoneration statement that let Clinton off the hook. They never did the investigation. And Strzok lead the probe into classified Huma Abedin emails -- this guy is everywhere -- that were found on Anthony Weiner's computer. Now, House investigators are also telling Fox News tonight, they believe that it was Strzok that is tied to the FBI's handling of the anti-Trump fake news, phony Russian dossier and the FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate. Now, what this all means is that the fix was in on the Clinton investigation. What we have now is just more evidence, incontrovertible evidence. And speaking of the fake news dossier, Catherine Herridge is also reporting tonight that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is the key witness that Congress now wants to interview about that dossier. But McCabe, he's not going to show up to testify on Thursday. He is thought to have been the FBI's key point person, or the handler of former British M6 agent Christopher Steele, the guy that created the phony dossier and paid Russians to lie to influence you in that election. Now remember, according to reports, a political action committee tied to the Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, best friends with the Clintons -- remember, he gave a half a million dollars to Andrew McCabe's wife Jill, she was running for a Virginia State Senate seat. Now, Virginia's Democratic Party also gave Jill McCabe over $200,000, an obscene amount for any state Senate candidate. Now, President Trump is reacting to this new information. He's tweeting out. \"After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation and more running the FBI, it's reputation is in tatters. Worst in history. But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.\" The president is 100 percent right about James Comey and about Hillary Clinton, and about there being a double standard for Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. The president commented further on all of this. Let's take a look."

Nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and they destroyed his life. I think it's a shame. Hillary Clinton on the Fourth of July weekend went to the FBI, not under oath, it was the most incredible thing anyone has ever seen. She lied many times, nothing happened to her. Flynn lied and it's like they ruined his life. It's very unfair."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, I know, this is a ton of information to unpack here, so, let me break this down even further for you. Here's what all of this means. We have an anti-Trump pro-Hillary Clinton top FBI official that is directly involved in letting Hillary Clinton walk free before interviewing the key people in the investigation, including Hillary Clinton. They exonerated Clinton before ever concluding the investigation. Then the same FBI official helped oversee Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into possible election interference and according to Sarah Carter's reporting, interviewed Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. This guy is abusively biased. We have been saying for months that this is a political witch-hunt. This new information about Peter Strzok is a smoking gun. These types of tactics, they are only used in Banana Republics. Now, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunez, he is now threatening to hold the FBI and the DOJ in contempt of Congress for stonewalling about why this guy Strzok was fired back in August. And what all of you need to know, the American people tonight, you need to know this. How deeply was this one guy, Peter Strzok involved in Mueller's investigation? Because other than Michael Flynn, who else did he interview? Why didn't he put Hillary under oath? And where else could Strzok have influenced and compromised this investigation with what we now know was a politically biased agenda? Remember Lieutenant General Flynn, he was surveilled, he was unmasked. His name was leaked to the press. That is illegal, that is a crime. Nobody has been investigated or arrested. So, what they did to Flynn is illegal and we can -- we can't discount the other massive conflicts of interest, the other red flags coming from Special Counsel Mueller's team. For example, key members of Mueller's team, look at the money on your screen, donated tens of thousands of dollars not to any Republicans, Democrats like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. How can anybody honestly say that those people are going to be fair and impartial after supporting liberal politicians with huge amounts of money, including President Trump's 2016 opponent. This stinks to high heaven. And as the investigator Andrew Weissmann -- another questionable member and choice by Mueller's team. Our friend and colleague Gregg Jarrett did some digging into Weissmann's past. Here's what he found. Back during the Enron accounting scandal, Weissmann was a hard-charging prosecutor on the task force that brought a controversial obstruction of justice case against the accounting firm Arthur Andersen that eventually put that company out of business. It cost tens of thousands of people their jobs. And it was for nothing, because in 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the obstruction of justice conviction in a unanimous nine-zero ruling. Next to impossible. And it's not the only example of Weissmann's aggressive tactics resulting in a case being overturned. The convictions of a business transaction between Enron and Merrill Lynch, it sent people to jail. It was also reversed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Critics have also accused Weissmann of intimidating witnesses, creating crimes that do not even exist, and in one case in particular, withholding exculpatory evidence would have helped the defendant. And just like Mueller, Weissmann is also tied to the corrupt Uranium One deal and the ensuing cover-up. Now, Weissmann ran the DOJ's fraud section during the Russian bribery scheme and Gregg Jarrett actually noticed it was his name and his signature on the bottom of the plea agreement signed by the Russian businessman involved in that case. And we can't forget that Mueller is also, what, best friends, BFF, with James Comey. A huge massive conflict of interest and potentially even a violation of law."

      "speaker": "All of this is inexcusable in any country that cares about the rule of law. You should not be allowed to tolerate this in any way shape, matter or form. And we should be asking ourselves a simple question",
      "utterance": "Why in God's name would Robert Mueller put this abusively biased team together of unethical political crusaders who have an agenda that we can now prove? Why are they involved in this investigation? It's been one giant pattern of bias and abuse of power. And we have a tremendous amount of respect on this program for those of you that watch for law enforcement. We have a tremendous respect for the intelligence community who put their lives on the line for us every day. But because of politics, what, our Justice Department has people in it like Peter Strzok that are abusively, politically biased? What is the result? We now have a two-tiered justice system that I have been warning about. It is now creating a clear and present danger to this Republic. If we weaponized the tools of surveillance, the powerful tools, and if we have two sets of standards for justice, and people in power think they know what's in the best interest of you, the American people, and will undermine a duly elected president and try and get him thrown out of office since the day he is elected, we will have then lost this country. And tonight, there's another major angle to the story that we cannot ignore discount. As the Washington Examiner's Byron York points out in a new article, the investigation into Michael Flynn was not about Russian collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign in Russia, Russia, Russia. Rather, it hinges on what is known as the Logan act. Let me explain what this is. According to York and law, The Logan Act is a 218-year-old law in this country. A law that prohibits private citizens from acting on behalf of the United States in disputes with foreign governments. Guess what? In 218 years, nobody has ever been prosecuted under this law, and many legal experts call it archaic and simply irrelevant. And some even go as far as to say that it's unconstitutional. But this is what played, that law played the central role in the Obama administration's investigation into Flynn. Never mind the surveillance, unmasking and illegal leaks of intelligence. It's reportedly why the FBI agents went to the White House to interview Flynn back in January 24th about discussions that he had during the transition period with his counterpart, the Russian ambassador, about sanctions the Obama administration had placed on Russia. And the U.N. resolution on Israel. Big deal, that would have been his job. This is the interview where Flynn called \"lied\" to the FBI which led to his guilty plea. Again, nothing to do with Russia. But let's take a step back for a minute. Now, during this transition period, Obama State Department said they didn't have any problems with the Trump transition team reaching out to foreign officials. They said it. Watch this."

And that's not all. Former federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy is also saying this is now an obstruction of justice investigation and the ultimate goal is to impeach President Trump. Where did you hear that before? And finally tonight, as we often say on the show, we are not the destroyed Trump media. And if you are watching at home, have no doubts about fake news not being a clear, present danger to the Trump administration. They are the willing accomplices in all of this. And we have an example that should make you a believer. It's scary, it's real, and it proves what we have been saying on this program since '08. Journalism in America is dead. And on Friday morning, as news was breaking about General Flynn pleading guilty about lying to the FBI, ABC News chief investigative correspondent Brian Ross reported that Flynn was prepared to testify that it was candidate Trump that directed him to make contact with the Russians. Here's a report."

He said the President has asked Flynn to contact Russia during the campaign. He's now clarifying that saying, according to Flynn, candidate Trump asked him during the campaign to find ways to repair relations with Russia and other hot spots. And then after the election the president-elect told them to contact Russia on issues including working together to fight ISIS."
    },

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Hello, big difference between candidate Trump and President-elect Trump asking Flynn to contact his soon-to-be counterparts. And according to The Washington Post on Twitter, Brian Ross initially issued a tweet promoting his fake news report about, quote, well candidate Trump, which was re-tweeted 25,000 times before it was ultimately deleted. Now, this erroneous reporting, or let's call it what it is, lie, was being spread over and over again by numerous news outlets all day on Friday before Brian Ross had to walk back the story. And on Saturday, ABC News announced it is suspending Ross for four weeks without pay. By the way, a little too little, a little too late. Unfortunately for ABC, this isn't the first time Brian Ross has been accused of peddling fake news. I have a whole history of it. Like for example in 2012 when Ross falsely suggested the Colorado mass shooter James Holmes, he could be tied to the Tea Party. That turned out to be wrong, too. Here with reaction, investigative reporter Sara Carter, former DOJ official Victoria Toensing, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Sara, this is your blockbuster, the FBI supervisor, he is the same one that interviewed Hillary. Tell everybody everything this guy was involved in, and he's anti-Trump and he's pro-Clinton."

And remember, this is a complaint I reported on your show months ago. April, June. You know, July, where I was talking about how FBI officials, the guys working on the ground, working on these cases were stunned that some of their higher ups seemed very partisan to Hillary Clinton and they were going after Trump and Trump campaign officials. And Michael Flynn was one of them. And you brought something up that is very important when you talked about the unmasking. Remember there were reports all through December and then after Susan Rice denied that she unmarked and later admitted that she unmasked. And people started to tell stories like, well, we were concerned about the way other nations were going to feel so we needed to hear what they were saying about the election of President Trump. They came up with all kinds of stories. What we see now based on this evidence, based on the fact that we know now Peter Strzok interviewed Flynn, that he was involved in the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, one of the central, key players."

Rod Rosenstein, the Intel Committee, as well as the Inspector General, need to look into the email messages of every other member of Mueller staff. And begin with Andrew Weissmann, why? Because Weissmann has very close ties with a lawyer he hired at the Department of Justice who sent out anti- Trump tweets and re-tweets and who was there at an anti-Trump protest.

If Hillary Clinton had won, none of this would have surfaced. They would have just kept covering up all the corruption. And they would have just kept taking care of themselves. So the very fact that you had this disrupting figured in the White House, all of us are learning some pretty horrifying things about how sick system is. How sick the entire processes in ways I would have thought were impossible. And I have the greatest respect for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and it is astonishing to me that you could have people at the top who are this corrupt, this profoundly dishonest. The second thing that struck me, listening actually to your opening monologue. If you take what General Flynn is accused of and then you take virtually anything Hillary has done. I mean, 33,000 deletions of email without any kind of approval. You know, having a totally inappropriate server that was totally outside the State Department rules. I mean, it just goes on the list.

Edgar Hoover use to begin building a modern FBI in the sense of an honest integrity-filled serious investigative agency. It's a fascinating book. But what struck me was, we now have the corruption that that book describes at the very center of our national capital. Take a look Comey. Comey decides to interview Hillary Clinton not under oath.

And we have to understand that this is a real fight for whether or not America is going to remain in republic that is ruled by law, or whether it's going to degenerate into being purely corrupt system of power where if you were on the right team, you can rip everybody off and be protected and if you were on the wrong team you can be innocent and still go to jail.

      "utterance": "In 2012, Latinos voted in record numbers. The next day, even Sean Hannity changed his mind and decided immigration reform was a good idea. What are you doing, he said, Putin is what you call a leader. Mike Huckabee and Sean Hannity keep talking about his bare chest. Which is kind of weird. With respect to Sean Hannity, I didn't know he had invited me for a beer. His opinion of me does not seem to be very high. But I'm always good for a beer. I'll bet -- I'll put him up against Sean Hannity. He'll tear him up!"

      "utterance": "Was he threatening violence? Oh, my gosh. Apparently, Obama, I'm kidding even though he can't get over his obsession with Fox News. This is what he had to say at a political summit overseas in India. Really? He is obsessed."

    {
      "speaker": "OBAMA",
      "utterance": "Those who watch Fox News and those who read The New York Times occupy completely different realities. I mean, if I watch Fox News, I wouldn't vote for me. Because there's this unrecognizable character. I remember when I was 9resident, every once and a while I would watch that and say who is that guy? Oh, this character named Barack Obama, he is portrayed in the weird ways and selective clips that come out, where the sentence isn't finished and then it's all edited and shaped to promote a certain story."

      "utterance": "Not true. Pretty unbelievable. Listen, you're now citizen Barack Obama. Here's my advice to you. Get over it. Go give a speech. Go write a book that leftists will buy. Or write about Acorn, Linskey, and Reverend Wright (inaudible), go do that. As always thank you for being with us. We'll always be fair and balanced and not the destroy Trump media.
