They frantically try to reanimate the Kavanaugh story, right? \"The New York Times\" ran an excerpt from a book in which an alleged incident of sexual abuse was documented. And then it was on every show and every network until, whoops, it was revealed at \"The Times,\" you know, they left out a key fact. The alleged victim had no recollection of any incident -- at all. Weird how that detail got past the editors? You'd think a detail like that would matter. But they knew the book and the story itself was a dud. So they obliterated that detail. And that was how they maintained their business model, which is to sell urban legends to people who feel the same way they do.   So they ran a story about a Supreme Court Justice committing a crime, leaving out the part about there not being a victim. Imagine that. That's a pretty big omission.

They frantically try to reanimate the Kavanaugh story, right? \"The New York Times\" ran an excerpt from a book in which an alleged incident of sexual abuse was documented. And then it was on every show and every network until, whoops, it was revealed at \"The Times,\" you know, they left out a key fact. The alleged victim had no recollection of any incident -- at all. Weird how that detail got past the editors? You'd think a detail like that would matter. But they knew the book and the story itself was a dud. So they obliterated that detail. And that was how they maintained their business model, which is to sell urban legends to people who feel the same way they do. So they ran a story about a Supreme Court Justice committing a crime, leaving out the part about there not being a victim. Imagine that. That's a pretty big omission.
