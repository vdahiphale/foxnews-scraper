      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she wants tripped on a molecule, Dana Perino. “The Five.” Nick Sandmann, the smiling target of the infamous Covington smear is suing the Washington Post for 250 million bucks for leading the media mob. Can't say I blame him because the story isn't about Covington but those who covered it, not to mention all the money they made off that smear.  This case, along with Kavanaugh and Smollett and a hundred others, need to be a journalism course, one that reveals how echo chamber media gins up outrage, protects narrative and steers social media into a frenzy. We blame twitter, but twitter is just a wall the media throw stuff at to see what sticks.  If it sticks you make a lot of money or use it to build the reputations of some left-wing hacks. Nick's lawsuit means that in the future some dope can't brag to the Pulitzer committee that he broke the Covington story.  Remember the Clarence Thomas hearings and how that turned many liberals like Andrew Breitbart into fire-breathing conservatives? Sometimes a show trial reveals more than you think. Feinstein traded her reputation for a shot at Kavanaugh. Since 2016, those epiphany moments like Covington have piled up. In mere months, we've seen three major media fails. There are others. But there's only one persistent culprit at the crime scene, the mainstream media. Journalists who are writing for other journalists, hoping to get a better job, a book deal, a prize, a minute on TV.  And the motivating factor behind the machine, conflict. Conflict leads to eyeballs, which leads to clicks, which leads to money. Yeah, the media made tons off Covington, so why shouldn't the kid get a piece of the action? After all, without poor Nick, some of us would have to work for a living. So, Jesse, I have the brain room to do some research. Did you know --",

This while we have just learned from people who have been staking out the grand jury room on the fourth floor that the Osundairo brothers have gone back inside for round two inside the grand jury room, seemed to be kind of a false start with the grand jury yesterday. And again, the people who have been staking out the grand jury room say the brothers are inside at this moment as the case moves forward. On a day when we now have surveillance video coming to us from WBBM channel two here in Chicago, and this is security video from what we're told by employees at the Crafty Beaver is inside of their store, and it shows these individuals buying things like ski masks, what looks to be a red hat. We know of the inventory that was taken from the apartment where the Osundairo brothers were staying here in Chicago. One of the items on that inventory is a red hat, and that could have very well played a role in what is now shaping up more and more to have been a hoax attack in this case. So we now have Jussie Smollett, he's been listed as a suspect in this case officially according to the chief communications officer. This long- standing request for police to have a conversation with Smollett, that has not been realized. He never showed up for this follow-up interview.

We know from people who have been staking out the grand jury room that the Osundairo brothers are inside there. So, their testimony is part of the evidence that is being presented to the grand jury. And we're waiting to see what will come out of that grand jury. After this long waiting game that started really Friday night with police saying, they wanted to bring Smollett in for some follow-up questioning. He lawyered up. He got his crisis intervention team. It became clear that they were never going to say no to police that they're coming in for this follow-up questioning. But they weren't coming in. They were just dragging their feet. That was never going to happen. Police eventually ran out of time with that and they're now presenting evidence to the grand jury.

Can't say I blame him because the story isn't about Covington but those who covered it, not to mention all the money they made off that smear. This case, along with Kavanaugh and Smollett and a hundred others, need to be a journalism course, one that reveals how echo chamber media gins up outrage, protects narrative and steers social media into a frenzy. We blame twitter, but twitter is just a wall the media throw stuff at to see what sticks. If it sticks you make a lot of money or use it to build the reputations of some left-wing hacks. Nick's lawsuit means that in the future some dope can't brag to the Pulitzer committee that he broke the Covington story. Remember the Clarence Thomas hearings and how that turned many liberals like Andrew Breitbart into fire-breathing conservatives? Sometimes a show trial reveals more than you think. Feinstein traded her reputation for a shot at Kavanaugh. Since 2016, those epiphany moments like Covington have piled up. In mere months, we've seen three major media fails. There are others. But there's only one persistent culprit at the crime scene, the mainstream media. Journalists who are writing for other journalists, hoping to get a better job, a book deal, a prize, a minute on TV. And the motivating factor behind the machine, conflict. Conflict leads to eyeballs, which leads to clicks, which leads to money. Yeah, the media made tons off Covington, so why shouldn't the kid get a piece of the action? After all, without poor Nick, some of us would have to work for a living. So, Jesse, I have the brain room to do some research. Did you know --"

But here's the more important thing, it's all grassroots small dollar money, so he has a network that he can go back to over and over again that these others don't, and that includes Joe Biden."

But if you say, hey, you undecided or will you volunteer name, guess what? Biden is very close, like 9 percent for Biden, 8 percent for Harris. So what does this tell you?"

      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "That's interesting. I think what it tells me is that Harris -- there was a bit of skepticism that I saw coming more from the east coast and those of us from the west coast really had high name recognition for her. She's a significant following and impact and awareness there in the west coast that I think the other half of the nation didn't see. And just to your point about the network, I think what's so interesting about Bernie Sanders is that, you know, he will always be that leader and the first guy of the socialist movement and whatever, and people will just gather behind him. And even if, intellectually, we're not sure how much runway is ahead, his followers think that it's limitless. And with that super delegate that rule now in the DNC, I think that he will be a formidable opponent to Biden regardless if he takes his time and has that name recognition. Bernie Sanders might really make some changes."

He said, crazy Bernie, he missed his time, indicating he should have run -- should have had the opportunity to run against him in 2016. But then Bernie fired back, maybe this is different. Maybe this why people like Bernie, he said the only crazy is the president who's racist, sexist, xenophobic, and a fraud."

And Bernie comes out and raises more money in four hours than Kamala Harris raise in 24, and people start looking around and saying, oh, my God, this guy has got the small donor network, almost as good as Trump, raised 200 million last cycle, and he could be a serious threat. Remember, Bernie is fluent in socialism. It's like his native tongue. He doesn't have to speak in codes. He literally wired the socialism code. He's not a pretender. He's the real deal. He was cool before socialism was cool. So I could see Bernie getting the most applause at the debates, raising the most amount of money and winning Iowa. And all of a sudden, the kingmakers of the Democratic Party are thinking of themselves, oh, my God, we have a serious problem again on our hands, and they're going to have to kneecap this guy again."

When the government pays for things, I.E., making them free, it leads to a horrific death. It artificially inflates prices. So when I'm talking about these -- who's being hurt most it's students with student loan debt. The student loan bubble is due to artificially inflated prices because you can get these loans. So that's what's got to be tied. You've got to teach kids that socialism ruins your life. It bankrupted you by artificially inflating the price of college. They can raise the tuition because of there are loans that could cover it. And then you're stuck with it and these greedy administrators are laughing all the way to the bank while you basically mortgage your life. That's socialism."

      "speaker": "MIKE TOBIN, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "this is all happening very fast and furious. You've just mentioned moments ago, the chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi for the Chicago PD says that Jussie Smollett is now a suspect for a class four felony, falsifying a police report. We know that's a punishable by a maximum of three years. This while we have just learned from people who have been staking out the grand jury room on the fourth floor that the Osundairo brothers have gone back inside for round two inside the grand jury room, seemed to be kind of a false start with the grand jury yesterday. And again, the people who have been staking out the grand jury room say the brothers are inside at this moment as the case moves forward. On a day when we now have surveillance video coming to us from WBBM channel two here in Chicago, and this is security video from what we're told by employees at the Crafty Beaver is inside of their store, and it shows these individuals buying things like ski masks, what looks to be a red hat. We know of the inventory that was taken from the apartment where the Osundairo brothers were staying here in Chicago. One of the items on that inventory is a red hat, and that could have very well played a role in what is now shaping up more and more to have been a hoax attack in this case. So we now have Jussie Smollett, he's been listed as a suspect in this case officially according to the chief communications officer. This long- standing request for police to have a conversation with Smollett, that has not been realized. He never showed up for this follow-up interview. We have some information that lawyers for Smollett and police met today. The Sun Times has indicated that that meeting is going on right now. The clarification we have through the official police channels is that meeting happened this morning but never the conversation that they want to have with Smollett. Jesse?"

But today, apparently, his lawyers spoke to the Cook County attorneys and they said OK, he doesn't have to come in. I wonder, is he sick? What was the mitigating factor or the sculpting factor that would lead Cook County officials to say he didn't have to appear before the grand jury?"

And all indications are that something is amiss in this case. So I don't know if it's necessary exculpatory evidence that gets involved in that, but when you have this sudden halt to the process yesterday, and the Cook County state attorney Kim Fox, recusing yourself, you may have some kind of evidence that was introduced yesterday. And it should be noted that The Tribune is running a report right now saying the reason she has suddenly recuse herself is because she got pretty close with the family during the initial stages, when everyone thought that Jussie Smollett was the victim of a hate crime."

Remember, us, the people that aren't liberals are vindicated because any kind of tangential link to Trump, you, if you don't believe this story then you are part of the problem. This - everybody should be pleased that a hate crime didn't happen, because it means we're less racist than the media wants us to be. And I don't care about Smollett anymore. He's dirt.

He's no longer in limbo. He is officially a suspect for a class four felony filing a false police report. Maximum penalty we know for that is three years in prison and $25,000 fine. Also, as you mentioned, evidence is being presented to a grand jury on the fourth floor in this building behind me. We know from people who have been staking out the grand jury room that the Osundairo brothers are inside there. So, their testimony is part of the evidence that is being presented to the grand jury. And we're waiting to see what will come out of that grand jury. After this long waiting game that started really Friday night with police saying, they wanted to bring Smollett in for some follow-up questioning. He lawyered up. He got his crisis intervention team. It became clear that they were never going to say no to police that they're coming in for this follow-up questioning. But they weren't coming in. They were just dragging their feet. That was never going to happen. Police eventually ran out of time with that and they're now presenting evidence to the grand jury. We'll see what comes out of the grand jury and if it ultimately results in an arrest warrant. Things are moving pretty fast here in Chicago. Guys."

One of the speculative reports out there that says that he first set this threatening letter to himself, didn't get the response that he wanted. So, he upped the ante with this big staged attack. There were some other reporting to the effect that he was being written out or minimized in the drama, Empire. So, he staged this attack to get some attention, but keep in mind, the 20th Century Fox issued pretty strongly worded statement saying that no not at all. They're still standing behind their actor."

And it was all going to work out. But cops are smarter than that. PD did a very, very good job of breaking this down. The story was almost too big to fail, and the media wasn't asking questions because they didn't want to ask questions, because if it was a hoax, which I think deep down even they knew, it wasn't right.

Now to your thought like where does this argument go. 17 percent increase in hate crimes due to Donald Trump. So, you've got to go look at that. This is what I do. I go and I check it out, OK. That 17 percent increase from 2016 to 2017 was due to 1000 additional reporting agencies. So, it wasn't a rate increase. It was an increase due to more reporting."
