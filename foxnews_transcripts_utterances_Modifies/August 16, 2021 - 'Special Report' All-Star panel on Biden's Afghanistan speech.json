But for much of the speech, I couldn't figure out what war he was -- what so-called war he was talking about. We have been getting out of Afghanistan gradually, slowly for years and years. We were down now in that country to about 2,500 American soldiers on the ground. No American soldier had been killed there in a year-and-a-half. But that little modest force with the air power, the intelligence and the logistical support and the advice that came with it, was enough to maintain a kind of an uneasy stalemate in that country. The president comes along and blows the whole thing up because he wants to get out. We were getting out. And it mattered how we got out. It always matters how you get out in a situation like this. Withdrawals and evacuations are very militarily tricky and dangerous. And this one has been utterly and completely botched. And apart from saying they didn't expect it would go downhill this fast, the president really did nothing to explain how that happened or why it has gone so badly.",

Look, I think, Brit and Trey are about right in this sense -- President Biden declared to the country, three out of four Americans agree with him that America should not be in Afghanistan any longer. There is no doubt. We accomplished a lot of what we intended to accomplish. I was in Congress on 9/11. We believed that jihadists and Al-Qaeda were operating from Afghanistan. We sent forces there to degrade them, to kill bin Laden, and we did. Any time you project military -- American military into engagement with a clear objective or a desired outcome, they generally do very, very well. But you invite trouble and you invite disappointment, you invite undesired outcomes when the defined purpose is not so defined. And over the last several years, it was not. He had that right. But without question -- he, being President Biden. But, without question, they have botched this exit. This national security team of his, the pressure is mounting in many, many ways for them to fix this exit plan for all of our Afghan allies. But I would hope those of us who wish to be critical of the president -- I don't wish to be critical of him, but those who wish to be critical of him, please do not conflate the two. The exit from Afghanistan is the right thing to do. We have other priorities we need to focus on. And if by some chance Afghanistan becomes a Woodstock for jihadists, guess what, we will be able to marshal a coalition of the willing, a bigger, stronger, and perhaps more resolute one than we did under President Bush if that is indeed the case. But they have to fix this exit plan. This will be President Biden's Achilles heel if he does not.",

We didn't hear how long the air bridge really is going to run in the president's speech. And just in the past few minutes, Ben, Associated Press, U.S. defense official confirms Taliban's sudden accumulation of U.S. supplied Afghan equipment is, quote, enormous. BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": This is a travesty in so many ways. And I do think that we have to separate the policy here from the execution. The policy is broadly popular. And I heard the president come out and defend the policy of leaving Afghanistan. But it's a speech that he could have given six months ago. And it really didn't wrestle with any of the actual questions that people have over what they have seen over the past several days, particularly as it relates to any kind of confidence that we can have in our military leadership and our intelligence community that promised that something like this was going to take months if it happened. And, frankly, we look back at that press conference that the president had, where he was doing all this happy talk about the idea that the Afghan military was prepared, that Taliban leadership was not a forgone conclusion, that he expected them to fight, et cetera. And the question really becomes is that what he really believed? Is that what he was being told? And why, if he was saying that then, does his attitude now seem to be, well, the people who need to get out, they should have been getting out much earlier. They chose to stay there. Maybe they chose to stay there because of the things they were hearing from the commander-in-chief of the free world. And that's something that I think is only on him. He cannot put that on Donald Trump. He cannot put that on previous administrations. It is on him that he chose to say that, and it's on him that it turned out not to be true.",

There is not. This is a calamity, a disaster, a completely botched operation. And I don't think you can blame the guys, the suits at the Pentagon or the suits at the State Department. They are just doing the best they can to defend it. This is on Biden. He overruled his general's wishes and proceeded with this. He didn't have to do it this way. He did it -- this is the way he wanted to do it. And the political consequences of this, I think, will be long lasting. His base will back him and people who wanted out will support him and so on.

Look, I think, Brit and Trey are about right in this sense -- President Biden declared to the country, three out of four Americans agree with him that America should not be in Afghanistan any longer. There is no doubt. We accomplished a lot of what we intended to accomplish. I was in Congress on 9/11. We believed that jihadists and Al-Qaeda were operating from Afghanistan. We sent forces there to degrade them, to kill bin Laden, and we did. Any time you project military -- American military into engagement with a clear objective or a desired outcome, they generally do very, very well. But you invite trouble and you invite disappointment, you invite undesired outcomes when the defined purpose is not so defined. And over the last several years, it was not. He had that right. But without question -- he, being President Biden. But, without question, they have botched this exit. This national security team of his, the pressure is mounting in many, many ways for them to fix this exit plan for all of our Afghan allies. But I would hope those of us who wish to be critical of the president -- I don't wish to be critical of him, but those who wish to be critical of him, please do not conflate the two. The exit from Afghanistan is the right thing to do. We have other priorities we need to focus on. And if by some chance Afghanistan becomes a Woodstock for jihadists, guess what, we will be able to marshal a coalition of the willing, a bigger, stronger, and perhaps more resolute one than we did under President Bush if that is indeed the case. But they have to fix this exit plan. This will be President Biden's Achilles heel if he does not."

      "utterance": "We didn't hear about the rules of engagement for those troops trying to get all those people out. We didn't hear how long the air bridge really is going to run in the president's speech. And just in the past few minutes, Ben, Associated Press, U.S. defense official confirms Taliban's sudden accumulation of U.S. supplied Afghan equipment is, quote, enormous. BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": This is a travesty in so many ways. And I do think that we have to separate the policy here from the execution. The policy is broadly popular. And I heard the president come out and defend the policy of leaving Afghanistan. But it's a speech that he could have given six months ago. And it really didn't wrestle with any of the actual questions that people have over what they have seen over the past several days, particularly as it relates to any kind of confidence that we can have in our military leadership and our intelligence community that promised that something like this was going to take months if it happened. And, frankly, we look back at that press conference that the president had, where he was doing all this happy talk about the idea that the Afghan military was prepared, that Taliban leadership was not a forgone conclusion, that he expected them to fight, et cetera. And the question really becomes is that what he really believed? Is that what he was being told? And why, if he was saying that then, does his attitude now seem to be, well, the people who need to get out, they should have been getting out much earlier. They chose to stay there. Maybe they chose to stay there because of the things they were hearing from the commander-in-chief of the free world. And that's something that I think is only on him. He cannot put that on Donald Trump. He cannot put that on previous administrations. It is on him that he chose to say that, and it's on him that it turned out not to be true."

      "speaker": "CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "I think if you cannot trust the advisers whom Americans are working with and who are the ones who will be taking over when we leave, then the entire strategy of the transfer of authority in power is in jeopardy. And I think it means they have to recalculate as to whether, how, and when the Americans and the Europeans can actually leave. The Taliban understand exactly what's going to happen. If the allies, the west, is going to leave, the war will resume, and they assume they will ultimately defeat the government already in Kabul. So they have no incentive to concede anything."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Our late colleague Dr. Charles Krauthammer. We talked a lot about Afghanistan on this panel over the years, as can you imagine. And he always said that Taliban operated in years, not weeks and days. We're back with the panel. Brit, today, the State Department spokesperson said that the Taliban, we hope that it for an inclusive and representative government. That's pretty hopeful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Yes, I will say it is, Bret. You have got to feel for these people at this time. For John Kerry at the Pentagon and that poor sap at the State Department has got to come out and try to make sense of all this and try to make it sound like there is some rational policy involved here. There is not. This is a calamity, a disaster, a completely botched operation. And I don't think you can blame the guys, the suits at the Pentagon or the suits at the State Department. They are just doing the best they can to defend it. This is on Biden. He overruled his general's wishes and proceeded with this. He didn't have to do it this way. He did it -- this is the way he wanted to do it. And the political consequences of this, I think, will be long lasting. His base will back him and people who wanted out will support him and so on. But there are a lot of people in the middle here who watch something as tragic as this and as hideous as this who will not come back to him."

And when I think of the Afghan translators, I think of the Afghan women, I think of all the lives lost in Afghanistan, and we're -- the best we could do, the images that we are seeing, people holding on to airplanes, trying to escape that country where we spent $2 trillion. Look, I know Biden said the buck stopped with him today, Bret, but only after he blamed everyone else. He blamed all the presidents before him and the Afghan soldiers. That ain't the buck stopping with you when you blame everybody else."

And I'm not going to be lectured to by the Chinese foreign minister about our military force leaving Afghanistan. But one thing my mentor and late friend Richard Holbrooke always said is that the military, our military's mission should never be nation-building. We are not nation-building in South Korea or Germany or Japan. We are not propping up a government in any of those nations. We are supporting policy and supporting a government that support our policy. So, I think we should be clear about that. I have seen some of that and heard some of that criticism today. But I'd be careful. The Chinese foreign minister shouldn't be lecturing us about our military engagement."
