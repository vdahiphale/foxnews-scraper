Russian artillery attacks intensifying as its military continues to close in on the capital city of Kyiv, and a worrying development to the West as Russian forces have expanded their attack, firing missiles at a former training barracks in western Ukraine just 12 miles from the border of NATO member Poland. In moments, we're going to bring you a live report from Ukraine where Greg Palkot is standing by with the latest. But first, no leverage Joe. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, everybody knows the Russians like the Chinese, they're masters of propaganda. They use it to control their people by controlling the information flow. Yet sadly, in the United States, our current leadership releases its own share of propaganda on a regular basis. Consider their framing of the much anticipated talks between Chinese and U.S. officials in Rome that just wrapped. Now, the focus was China's role in backstopping Russia and Ukraine. What could be done next? The word the Biden team wants you to remember is intense. As in Biden's National Security Adviser had an intense meeting with a top Chinese diplomat.",

He was direct - about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions. The official added. Translation, Sullivan got nothing and China yawned. Here's how China saw the meeting. Chinese President Xi Jinping has proposed mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as the three principles in developing China-U.S. relations in the new era. U.S. President Joe Biden responded positively with such important commitments, as that the U.S. does not seek a new Cold War or to change China's system, nor will it oppose China through strengthening alliances, support Taiwan independence, or seek confrontation with China. China then referenced Ukraine at the end of this as an afterthought. Now, in Washington, when a high level meeting fizzles and yields no deliverables as they call them, you send a spokesman out to spin the atmospherics. And over at the State Department, it was more word signifying nothing. Now listen for the passive verbs connoting America as an observer.",

Second, why are we acting as if there's any question about whether China is even helping Russia. Even if they're not selling weapons directly to Russia, China is giving them crucial help by buying their agricultural products and, of course, their oil. So this is a total end run around Western sanctions. We've been saying this now for, what, two-plus weeks. And third, as I've said for years, China does not care about the rules of the international community, neither does Russia. So invoking them very piously doesn't get you anywhere. It doesn't get you any respect. Now, this was as far as the State Department got when it came to accountability for Putin's bankers in Beijing.",

Now, the CCP also knows that it has a friend in Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who has said that Trump's old China tariffs are contributing to inflation now.

      "sentences": "Now, what are the actual chances that the feeble-minded Biden is going to stand up to John Kerry, Janet Yellen, the myriad of business and financial interests doing China's bidding? Now, what about the odds he'll take on the media establishment that loves and protects China 24/7? The answer, zero, no chance. And understanding how Xi views the United States at this point is also critical in any interaction or crisis dealing with China. Now, right now, Xi sees us as a power in decline. He sees us as weak and self loathing, a country that is culturally depraved and politically divided. But he sees his communist system as superior in every way. He's a nationalist, and he's aiming for nothing short of global domination. And to get there, his priorities range from the substantive, the Belt and Road Initiative type stuff to the frivolous, like his banning effeminate male characters on TV. Remember that? Oh, and by the way, when he did that thing with the effeminate male characters, he knew that the American film industry would never protest or complain that that was discriminatory or anti LGBTQ. They wouldn't complain one bit. Heck, when was the last time you saw a Chinese villain on the big screen? And Xi knows, by the way, the key GOP establishment figures, they don't lose sleep about China's monopolization of key industries. Of course, not. The only thing that motivates them is money. And a lot of money buys China a lot of political cover and Congress. Xi knows all of this, because he's watched it unfold over the past 25 years, which brings us back to the current nightmare in Ukraine. Now, Biden could demand that John Kerry go out and say that the administration is putting its climate change goals on hold, at least as long as China remains a destabilizing force on the world. He could also say that as long as the CCP is trying to - by proxy, overthrow Zelenskyy in Ukraine, we're not going to abandon our oil and gas industries. But of course, the Biden people would never do something so sensible. And as a result, we might as well just have an adult beverage because we have zero leverage. Countries formerly helpful to the U.S. are looking eastward. Think about Saudi Arabia, which just invited Xi for a visit amidst another blunder by the United States. And the U.S. is either, at this point, looking at all the things that have happened, they're either going to get stronger by getting its own economic house in order and begin decoupling from these despotic regimes like China, or the world is going to get more dangerous and more chaotic. In the meantime, the only Ukraine negotiations that are going to happen in this scenario are the types of negotiations that, let's say, go on between a cat and a mouse. The cat's got to toy around with a mouse, then pounce when the time is right. Because it knows it can. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute, author of 'Bully of Asia'. Steven, their readouts from this meeting today were quite something to behold. The U.S. sends Jake Sullivan who's thought to be one of the hawks in the Biden administration to deal with this top Chinese diplomat. From your sense, what came out of that meeting? STEVEN MOSHER, \"BULLY OF ASIA\" AUTHOR: Well, I think the Biden administration was a day late and a dollar short in approaching China for help. I mean, Russia went to China four months ago and signed a new shipping agreement to help them avoid any future sanctions or embargo. So anyone who says that China doesn't have Russia's back just has to look at the new shipping agreement which says that anything shipped from Russian ports to China belongs to China as soon as it's put on the ship. So we can't seize the ship. We can't seize the cargo. That happened four months ago. And of course, as you mentioned, Putin went to Beijing right before the Olympic, have signed a 5000-word agreement pledging eternal friendship. 5000-word agreements don't get negotiated overnight. So this collusion - this is the real Russian collusion, Laura, between Russia and China. And to claim now as Jake Sullivan did, that, well, we're going to enlist China in the effort to help contain Russia and stop the carnage in Ukraine is just nonsense, because that ship has sailed.",

It's brutal. \"Judging from the posture, it is the U.S. that needs to ask China for help in the context of Russia-Ukraine conflict.\" And it went on to say various other things about how this whole thing unfolded and saying the United States - essentially, how dare you think that you can swing around your influence in the world? Like what gives you, the United States, this idea that you're the strong power now? It was super humiliating to have that kind of commentary come out of this meeting. So what's the point of this meeting if it ended up just being another moment for China to humiliate us?",

Who could forget the Alaska meeting, at which our Secretary of State was harangued for minutes on end, about all of the problems of America and how America shouldn't try to dictate to the rest of the world, how it behaves? Make no mistake. Xi Jinping has a China dream. And his China dream is to dominate the world by 2049 and to do it in stages. And he's already taken Hong Kong. He's looking at Taiwan, but he won't stop there. He will move on other countries near China as well. And what he would like to do, and I think how he sees this whole Ukrainian thing unfolding, is to get Russia into China's orbit permanently, to make Russia with all of its vast mineral and natural resources, oil and gas, a kind of vassal state of China. Thus, uniting Eurasia in pursuit of his China dream. So I think we need to step back and I pray that the carnage in Ukraine ends right now. But we need to step back and think about what the world is going to look like after that happens. And if we have created a Eurasian empire dominated by China, then we're going to face a formidable opponent in the decades to come.",

But they say the U.S. is the instigator of the Ukraine crisis, yet it wants to exploit the whole world to expand its own strategic interests. Well, you could flip that on China. You're the instigator. You're funding Russia with the oil and the agricultural exports, the agreement that you just said. But this is what China always does. But just back to my point about diplomacy and why we need real diplomats to deal with these savvy negotiators and sat there. These people are - cut you with a knife in China. You cannot set up a meeting where the up - the upshot of it is that our national security adviser gets mocked for asking China for help. That's what they're doing here in this communique. It's mocking the United States on the world stage. It is an embarrassment for us.",

And make no mistake, the wheat is already being shipped from Russia to China. The oil and gas are flowing as well. And this will only continue. So through the extent that we see a titanic shift in the world today, we're looking at another Sino-Russian Empire, kind of like the Sino Soviet collusion that we had during the 1950s.",

But where's Biden on this? Does his administration support peace or do they want this war to drag on? Some people are wondering that tonight. Now, right now what's best for Ukraine is a ceasefire with Russia. As a piece from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argues, \"The U.S. and its allies should support Zelenskyy in any diplomatic course he pursues. And they must be prepared to lift sanctions if Russia and Ukraine negotiate and implement a settlement agreement.\" Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, Editor-In-Chief at The Federalist, Fox News contributor. Mollie, my breath is still taken away by what happened at this meeting today in Rome. It was - this ends up being a nightmare for us in so many ways.

And there are not very many good options for Ukraine and having to accede a portion of the Donbas is not good. It's an awful situation, but far better than having their entire country destroyed. So it's important that sober voices be encouraging them as they work to end this. You do wonder if people decide that they would like a prolonged action. You've had prominent people on both sides of the aisle talk about extending the situation, escalating the situation, using this as a means to engage in regime change in Russia. A policy that has failed many of the times we've tried it recently, but that some people seem to want to extend here. But that is not in Ukraine's best interest and that's not in our best interest.",

And two years after locking down due to COVID, the U.S. Capitol building is still close to the public, despite DC not reporting a single COVID case in days. So will it ever reopen? Well, we got our answer today. Fox is told the Capitol will be reopened to the public on March 28. Wow. Oh, wait, hold your applause. This is just phase one. Only groups of 15 or fewer people will be allowed to visit members' offices, or go on staff-led tours. There will be public tours, but only for school groups of 50 or fewer students. Joining me now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise; Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee. And this is not the most important issue of the day. But it is kind of emblematic of how this COVID crisis is still being moved to keep the people out of their own house, which is the capitol. Congressman Scalise, I said that they would close the Capitol forever if they could. And this is just kind of more nonsense.",

A lot of things he learned two plus years ago turned out not be true. It's a question a lot of media people want to ignore about the real origins, the timing of it. And the question is why. Two new studies put out in February of 2021 and November of 2020 now shed light on all of these questions, this matter about when it started circulating. These studies show that COVID was actually circulating among the general population as early as November of 2019 in France and as early as September 2019 in Italy. Joining me now is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, professor at the Stanford School of Medicine. Dr. Bhattacharya, I know you tweeted about this over the weekend. I read your tweets religiously, as you know. These studies have both been out for a year, so why were they ignored?",

Russian artillery attacks intensifying as its military continues to close in on the capital city of Kyiv, and a worrying development to the West as Russian forces have expanded their attack, firing missiles at a former training barracks in western Ukraine just 12 miles from the border of NATO member Poland. In moments, we're going to bring you a live report from Ukraine where Greg Palkot is standing by with the latest. But first, no leverage Joe. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, everybody knows the Russians like the Chinese, they're masters of propaganda. They use it to control their people by controlling the information flow. Yet sadly, in the United States, our current leadership releases its own share of propaganda on a regular basis. Consider their framing of the much anticipated talks between Chinese and U.S. officials in Rome that just wrapped. Now, the focus was China's role in backstopping Russia and Ukraine. What could be done next? The word the Biden team wants you to remember is intense. As in Biden's National Security Adviser had an intense meeting with a top Chinese diplomat."

He was direct - about those concerns and the potential implications and consequences of certain actions. The official added. Translation, Sullivan got nothing and China yawned. Here's how China saw the meeting. Chinese President Xi Jinping has proposed mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation as the three principles in developing China-U.S. relations in the new era. U.S. President Joe Biden responded positively with such important commitments, as that the U.S. does not seek a new Cold War or to change China's system, nor will it oppose China through strengthening alliances, support Taiwan independence, or seek confrontation with China. China then referenced Ukraine at the end of this as an afterthought. Now, in Washington, when a high level meeting fizzles and yields no deliverables as they call them, you send a spokesman out to spin the atmospherics. And over at the State Department, it was more word signifying nothing. Now listen for the passive verbs connoting America as an observer."

And right now, we're doing nothing but making China richer by the day of nearly, what, $50 billion worth of goods we buy from them each month? Russia's watching that too. Second, why are we acting as if there's any question about whether China is even helping Russia. Even if they're not selling weapons directly to Russia, China is giving them crucial help by buying their agricultural products and, of course, their oil. So this is a total end run around Western sanctions. We've been saying this now for, what, two-plus weeks. And third, as I've said for years, China does not care about the rules of the international community, neither does Russia. So invoking them very piously doesn't get you anywhere.

And they know that Kerry is desperate for China's help on the issue, as stupid as that is. Now, the CCP also knows that it has a friend in Biden Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who has said that Trump's old China tariffs are contributing to inflation now. Well, this is great news for China, which of course, wants them drop, the tariffs. And of course, China also knows that Joe Biden himself, whose son got wealthy for dubious work in China, has said that China's growth is not a threat to the United States."

      "utterance": "Now, what are the actual chances that the feeble-minded Biden is going to stand up to John Kerry, Janet Yellen, the myriad of business and financial interests doing China's bidding? Now, what about the odds he'll take on the media establishment that loves and protects China 24/7? The answer, zero, no chance. And understanding how Xi views the United States at this point is also critical in any interaction or crisis dealing with China. Now, right now, Xi sees us as a power in decline. He sees us as weak and self loathing, a country that is culturally depraved and politically divided. But he sees his communist system as superior in every way. He's a nationalist, and he's aiming for nothing short of global domination. And to get there, his priorities range from the substantive, the Belt and Road Initiative type stuff to the frivolous, like his banning effeminate male characters on TV. Remember that? Oh, and by the way, when he did that thing with the effeminate male characters, he knew that the American film industry would never protest or complain that that was discriminatory or anti LGBTQ. They wouldn't complain one bit. Heck, when was the last time you saw a Chinese villain on the big screen? And Xi knows, by the way, the key GOP establishment figures, they don't lose sleep about China's monopolization of key industries. Of course, not. The only thing that motivates them is money. And a lot of money buys China a lot of political cover and Congress. Xi knows all of this, because he's watched it unfold over the past 25 years, which brings us back to the current nightmare in Ukraine. Now, Biden could demand that John Kerry go out and say that the administration is putting its climate change goals on hold, at least as long as China remains a destabilizing force on the world. He could also say that as long as the CCP is trying to - by proxy, overthrow Zelenskyy in Ukraine, we're not going to abandon our oil and gas industries. But of course, the Biden people would never do something so sensible. And as a result, we might as well just have an adult beverage because we have zero leverage. Countries formerly helpful to the U.S. are looking eastward. Think about Saudi Arabia, which just invited Xi for a visit amidst another blunder by the United States. And the U.S. is either, at this point, looking at all the things that have happened, they're either going to get stronger by getting its own economic house in order and begin decoupling from these despotic regimes like China, or the world is going to get more dangerous and more chaotic. In the meantime, the only Ukraine negotiations that are going to happen in this scenario are the types of negotiations that, let's say, go on between a cat and a mouse. The cat's got to toy around with a mouse, then pounce when the time is right. Because it knows it can. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Steven Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute, author of 'Bully of Asia'. Steven, their readouts from this meeting today were quite something to behold. The U.S. sends Jake Sullivan who's thought to be one of the hawks in the Biden administration to deal with this top Chinese diplomat. From your sense, what came out of that meeting? STEVEN MOSHER, \"BULLY OF ASIA\" AUTHOR: Well, I think the Biden administration was a day late and a dollar short in approaching China for help. I mean, Russia went to China four months ago and signed a new shipping agreement to help them avoid any future sanctions or embargo. So anyone who says that China doesn't have Russia's back just has to look at the new shipping agreement which says that anything shipped from Russian ports to China belongs to China as soon as it's put on the ship. So we can't seize the ship. We can't seize the cargo. That happened four months ago. And of course, as you mentioned, Putin went to Beijing right before the Olympic, have signed a 5000-word agreement pledging eternal friendship. 5000-word agreements don't get negotiated overnight. So this collusion - this is the real Russian collusion, Laura, between Russia and China. And to claim now as Jake Sullivan did, that, well, we're going to enlist China in the effort to help contain Russia and stop the carnage in Ukraine is just nonsense, because that ship has sailed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, the CCP keeps twisting the knife on Biden, Steven. This is the editorial from the Chinese - basically, media (ph) organ Global Times. It's brutal. \"Judging from the posture, it is the U.S. that needs to ask China for help in the context of Russia-Ukraine conflict.\" And it went on to say various other things about how this whole thing unfolded and saying the United States - essentially, how dare you think that you can swing around your influence in the world? Like what gives you, the United States, this idea that you're the strong power now? It was super humiliating to have that kind of commentary come out of this meeting. So what's the point of this meeting if it ended up just being another moment for China to humiliate us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOSHER",
      "utterance": "Well, that's been - there's been a whole series of meetings like that between China and the United States since the Biden administration took office. Who could forget the Alaska meeting, at which our Secretary of State was harangued for minutes on end, about all of the problems of America and how America shouldn't try to dictate to the rest of the world, how it behaves? Make no mistake. Xi Jinping has a China dream. And his China dream is to dominate the world by 2049 and to do it in stages. And he's already taken Hong Kong. He's looking at Taiwan, but he won't stop there. He will move on other countries near China as well. And what he would like to do, and I think how he sees this whole Ukrainian thing unfolding, is to get Russia into China's orbit permanently, to make Russia with all of its vast mineral and natural resources, oil and gas, a kind of vassal state of China. Thus, uniting Eurasia in pursuit of his China dream. So I think we need to step back and I pray that the carnage in Ukraine ends right now. But we need to step back and think about what the world is going to look like after that happens. And if we have created a Eurasian empire dominated by China, then we're going to face a formidable opponent in the decades to come."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, again, going back to this - again, this is the state media organ of China. This is their - it's their spin on this. But they say the U.S. is the instigator of the Ukraine crisis, yet it wants to exploit the whole world to expand its own strategic interests. Well, you could flip that on China. You're the instigator. You're funding Russia with the oil and the agricultural exports, the agreement that you just said. But this is what China always does. But just back to my point about diplomacy and why we need real diplomats to deal with these savvy negotiators and sat there. These people are - cut you with a knife in China. You cannot set up a meeting where the up - the upshot of it is that our national security adviser gets mocked for asking China for help. That's what they're doing here in this communique. It's mocking the United States on the world stage. It is an embarrassment for us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOSHER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. These things should have been hammered out ahead of time. And when it was clear as it should have been clear, that China wasn't going to play ball because it wants to draw Russia into its orbit. It's happy to let Vladimir Putin chew off a little bloody piece of Ukraine, if that will bring Russia into China's orbit permanently. And make no mistake, the wheat is already being shipped from Russia to China. The oil and gas are flowing as well. And this will only continue. So through the extent that we see a titanic shift in the world today, we're looking at another Sino-Russian Empire, kind of like the Sino Soviet collusion that we had during the 1950s."

We are not negotiating from a position of strength. Trump understood that. Steven, great to see you tonight. And peace talks between Russia-Ukraine are set to resume tomorrow. But where's Biden on this? Does his administration support peace or do they want this war to drag on? Some people are wondering that tonight. Now, right now what's best for Ukraine is a ceasefire with Russia. As a piece from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argues, \"The U.S. and its allies should support Zelenskyy in any diplomatic course he pursues. And they must be prepared to lift sanctions if Russia and Ukraine negotiate and implement a settlement agreement.\" Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, Editor-In-Chief at The Federalist, Fox News contributor. Mollie, my breath is still taken away by what happened at this meeting today in Rome. It was - this ends up being a nightmare for us in so many ways. But why does it seem like people aren't talking about getting to yes on a deal, getting to yes in Ukraine to stop the horrors that we're seeing unfolding?"

      "utterance": "It's absolutely shocking, given the reality of the situation in Ukraine that we haven't had more people talking about how to end this war. It is up to Ukraine to decide how much they want to fight and whether they want to negotiate here. But we should absolutely support them, specifically, including, if they decide on neutrality as they discuss with Russia. War is a terrible tragedy. And there are not very many good options for Ukraine and having to accede a portion of the Donbas is not good. It's an awful situation, but far better than having their entire country destroyed. So it's important that sober voices be encouraging them as they work to end this. You do wonder if people decide that they would like a prolonged action. You've had prominent people on both sides of the aisle talk about extending the situation, escalating the situation, using this as a means to engage in regime change in Russia. A policy that has failed many of the times we've tried it recently, but that some people seem to want to extend here. But that is not in Ukraine's best interest and that's not in our best interest."

And I think they looked to this situation with Ukraine as a way to avoid having to take responsibility for some of what they've done. But even the situation in Ukraine is a product, as you know, from your - what was in earlier in the show of the weakness of the Biden administration and how it's handling its foreign policy portfolio as well. But there are a lot of people who look for short-term gains, and don't think about the long-term consequences, of getting embroiled in literally World War III.

He oversaw some of the worst moments of those committees. They did not prepare him well. And if someone's calm at this time, while everything is going to hell in a hand basket domestically and globally, that's a signal of some major problem.

And two years after locking down due to COVID, the U.S. Capitol building is still close to the public, despite DC not reporting a single COVID case in days. So will it ever reopen? Well, we got our answer today. Fox is told the Capitol will be reopened to the public on March 28. Wow. Oh, wait, hold your applause. This is just phase one. Only groups of 15 or fewer people will be allowed to visit members' offices, or go on staff-led tours. There will be public tours, but only for school groups of 50 or fewer students. Joining me now is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise; Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee. And this is not the most important issue of the day. But it is kind of emblematic of how this COVID crisis is still being moved to keep the people out of their own house, which is the capitol. Congressman Scalise, I said that they would close the Capitol forever if they could. And this is just kind of more nonsense."

The United States Senate unanimously passed a resolution, to say, open up the Capitol. Imagine, that's every Republican, every Democrat in the Senate saying, let's open up the Capitol. Pelosi doesn't want to let go of the power and so she is still held it shut down. Even in a few weeks, they're only going to have a staggered opening when everybody is reopening. Look at all the football games leading up to the Superbowl. You get over 70,000 people that arenas. By the way, Republican state, Democrat state without masks and yet they still want to keep things closed in DC. It's time to open up the people's house. Let the public back in."

They defunded the police, they've opened the border, they've closed schools, they've canceled pipelines, and now that they've made gas $5 a gallon, what do they do? They tell us all to go buy a Tesla. I mean, this is how out of touch they are with normal Americans. Out here where I'm from in the Midwest, I mean, people who work in the plant crops in the field, who work third shift to build homes, they drive pickup trucks. They don't drive Teslas. I mean, this is how out of touch they are. And Steve's exactly right. It's all political. It was interesting. They took away the mask mandate for the House of Representatives the day before Joe Biden gave the State of the Union and they're supposed to fully open up the Capitol on Labor Day right at the kickoff of the traditional campaign season shows it's all political."

Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, Congressman Al Lawson, didn't vote in person even one time last year. And according to the LA Times, California Congressman Ro Khanna used proxy voting while sitting in a car in the Capitol parking lot doing an online interview about his new book.

Democrats have closed the Capitol, allowed proxy voting, kicked Republicans off committee, won't let Republicans serve on a Select Committee for the first time in history, trying to end the Electoral College, trying to end the filibuster, trying to pack the court. And they have the nerve to say that it's Republicans and Donald Trump who are a threat to democracy? Give me a stinking break. People are so sick of their baloney. That's why I think a big change is coming this fall."

What message does this send to the country about Congress' priorities? They never seem to be at home?"

I mean, they asked for surface to air missiles months ago before Russia even invaded. That would have saved a lot of lives if they had those missiles back a few weeks ago before Putin invaded. They're trying to get the MIGs right now, and Biden won't work with Poland and other NATO countries in Eastern Europe to help get MIGs in for goodness sake. So Zelenskyy is going to be on a call with us in two days. Look, this guy's been a hero. The people of Ukraine are heroes. But there's a brutal genocide going on. And they're trying to figure out whether or not they're going to offend Putin still. And yet, Biden's out there - like he could open up the spigots tomorrow for American energy and undermine Putin's leverage on oil and gas. He won't do it. He's begging other dictators. He loves getting oil from dictators, whether it's Putin, Iran, Venezuela. Stop dealing with dictators, and just look what's beneath our feet. Open up American energy. We could lower gas prices tomorrow and take money out of Putin's pocket. So you don't - he won't have the ability to fund this war."

And none of those, you think Larry Hogan is going to beat President Trump in the primary? You think Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, you think anyone is going to beat him in a primary? I don't see him beating him in the Republican primary. More importantly, I don't see anybody beating him in the general election in 2024. I want him to run, I hope he runs, because he has proven he can go to the swamp, do what he said he'd do, get things done for we the people, not for the swamp, but for the American people.

He said we should not be involved in this monochromatic thinking where partisanship locks us into one thought. You have to be original. And you do that all the time. You draw sometimes outside the lines that people expect. And I think that makes not only for good leadership, but good TV. And too many of these shows, you flip around the dial, some of these panels that are supposed to be diverse thinkers, ends up looking like a visit to the enchanted tiki room. Everybody's mouths are moving at the same time, saying the same thing. I think you're seeing these guys are comedians at heart. You need to police an audience, and you can't lie to the audience for too long, and that's what's happening here, I think."

They need to send someone with real credibility in if the United States is going to play any role here. James Baker, call your office. I would say that what looks like it's going to happen is Macron is going to cut a deal with Xi and talk to Putin Zelenskyy, and that's going to be presented to Europe, and Biden's just going to go, OK, sounds good to me.

Talk about something you know you've experienced, you've researched. When you wander into the voting rights, it's not voting rights. The voting rights act he's talking about, which is the newest one, would get rid of IDs, ensure mail-in ballots across the country. It would actually, as he said, suppress the vote in many communities by diluting it. So stick to the script and talk about the things you know best. The audience would respond far better, I think."

Two new studies put out in February of 2021 and November of 2020 now shed light on all of these questions, this matter about when it started circulating. These studies show that COVID was actually circulating among the general population as early as November of 2019 in France and as early as September 2019 in Italy. Joining me now is Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, professor at the Stanford School of Medicine. Dr. Bhattacharya, I know you tweeted about this over the weekend. I read your tweets religiously, as you know.

And I think for the fourth dose, it's irresponsible to start talking about that at this point, especially when we've looked at Israel, they had fourth doses, and they still have a massive wave of cases. A lot of people have already had COVID, especially with this Omicron wave. They actually are very well protected. It's not at all clear at this point that we really need further shots.
