But the President has done it against the will of the Senate.  Look, he just nominated some more people for the 9th Circuit that were with the advice and consent of the two senators from California because he says, it's time change the judiciary because they have legislators from the bench.  We've seen this too many times. To Ann's point, the immigration issue had to go all the way to the Supreme Court for a nine nothing decision to say the president of the United States has the authority to prevent people from coming into this country that he believes are a detriment to our country.  The same power that every president has used since World War II.  But we have seen judges all too often legislating from the bench.

He went on to say, \"Hey, we found this guy, he did a pretty good job. Ulysses S. Grant.  Not only did he actually win the war, he actually went on to be a, become a pretty good president of the United States, too, and so maybe we should recognize him,\" and he happened to be in Ohio at the time and that was the point of the whole discussion, but NBC didn't want to talk about that.",

McCain couldn't win - I mean, the way the country has been changed by immigration.  McCain couldn't win, Romney couldn't win.  Trump won, so why don't Republicans in Congress think, \"Oh, this guy knows how to do it.

But the President has done it against the will of the Senate.  Look, he just nominated some more people for the 9th Circuit that were with the advice and consent of the two senators from California because he says, it's time change the judiciary because they have legislators from the bench.  We've seen this too many times. To Ann's point, the immigration issue had to go all the way to the Supreme Court for a nine nothing decision to say the president of the United States has the authority to prevent people from coming into this country that he believes are a detriment to our country.  The same power that every president has used since World War II.  But we have seen judges all too often legislating from the bench. To Mitch's credit, because of what the President has done, they fundamentally changed the court system that's going to have long-term ramifications in the positive."

If you remember, he went to Joint Base Andrews one night at midnight to see people come back off that plane who were overseas.  This President has done this time and time and time again, without bucket loads of money, without pallet full of cash going overseas.  He is not negotiating with these nations.  He is saying, you send our people or we're going to have a problem and he is drawing a line in the sand that those other nations have continuously walked across in previous administrations and this time, they understand if you cross this person, he is not a man to be trifled with and there will be a recourse. And so, we saw that today and I think that family and the nation is very happy that he's back on US soil."

Back now with Corey and Ann, all right, so NBC News and MSNBC have been running this sound bite from President Trump all yesterday and all today, and it's totally taken out of context.  This is what NBC News has played about Donald Trump talking about the Civil War and then i'll explain what they cut out afterwards.  Roll it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",

Lee.\"  And he had all of these generals, they looked great, they were top of their class at West Point.  They were the greatest people. There was only one problem.  They didn't know how the hell to win."

So what they want to do once again is be selective of their coverage with Trump.  They don't want to give the full story.  But I always say this, the American people are very smart.  They are tired of the mainstream media lying to them.  They turn to other outlets and the best thing that we have is Donald Trump directly to the American people giving his message because exactly what happened is what you said happened. He went on to say, \"Hey, we found this guy, he did a pretty good job. Ulysses S. Grant.  Not only did he actually win the war, he actually went on to be a, become a pretty good president of the United States, too, and so maybe we should recognize him,\" and he happened to be in Ohio at the time and that was the point of the whole discussion, but NBC didn't want to talk about that."

Lee militarily was good at killing people.  And he didn't dwell on that, he wasn't praising the guy for what he stood for.  Do they have editors at NBC, Ann, that can say, \"You've deceptively edited the president's sound bite?\"  And then have totally smeared him into making him look like he is doing something he didn't do."

Lee. And by the way, he was a great general.  He has studied the way Napoleon has studied, but the point was, as Corey said, he was in Ohio.  He was leading to the point that we, with this unbelievably great general, crushing the Union forces with about a quarter the size of the force.  Half of his soldiers were barefoot, and he is still beating the Union Army.  So, yes, of course, he was keeping Lincoln up at night.  He sends in a guy from Ohio."

They can't allow that to be said, so they have to crush him.  He's crazy. By the way, if they think he's crazy, why are they attacking him?  If you attacked a crazy homeless guy in the bus with schizophrenia, you would be a bad person, but it's okay to attack Kanye West because he's crazy?

Where is Dr. Ford?  Where is Stormy Daniels? Where is Omarosa and her case? Because the media - these were the people in the media that they were - these three people, they were going to - these were icons.  These were icons and the media just gave them the big hug and was protecting them and showcasing them, and they have been dropped."

The media used - what happened to Mark Judge who last week we were accusing of rape because we thought it was helpful.  He is a real person.  He used to work for me.  I know him.  Whatever happened - they destroyed his life and now, nobody cares because it's not about helping individuals, it's about obtaining power.  That's all it's about."

Michael then tore through the Mid-Atlantic Region leaving behind massive amounts of destruction.  So far as least 17 people in four states have been killed and officials fear the number will rise.
