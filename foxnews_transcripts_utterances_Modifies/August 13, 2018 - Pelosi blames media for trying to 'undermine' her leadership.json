And I wrote a piece on foxnews.com today in which I said, even if she didn't think that the President of the United States of America deserved better than this, certainly the American people do. And it puts our entire national security at risk. Like, I don't know how, you know, Russians get in here, into this phone, but they do, and it's just -- that's why you have lockers outside of the situation room. And there must have been enough concern. Remember the stories about the White House, being told you know longer can bring personal devices into the White House. You had to leave them in your car or leave them at home. And there must have been more concerned about her.   The White House is being, I think, quite restrained in talking about the reasons for her departure. I was shocked that she had a recording in the situation room. I also think that it was wrong to air it. I don't think that we should encourage any of this. The strange thing for me too is just about how quickly this book will go away. And it will be forgotten in three weeks. I learned that about when a book came out during the Bush administration. It was upsetting to me. The book was horrible to me. It was very disloyal, but it went out -- it was gone within three weeks. And you know who told me that it was President Bush. He said don't worry about it. Just let it go. It's irrelevant. And that is true. So for the people who are working in the White House who feel betrayed, just know that it will go away, and she looks terrible for doing this, and I'm sorry that it happened to all of us.

He said, man, she was saying great things, so I hired her. As long as she said great things about me, she was cool. Then she stopped saying great things now, she's wacky and her intelligence, like other black people, is to be questioned.   The big issue here for me, Jesse, I didn't know about this nondisclosure agreement, $15,000 a month. And apparently this is true that when you leave the Trump White House, they give you a job in the upcoming campaign, the 2020 campaign, but you have to sign a deal that says you can't talk about what happened in the White House. You know what struck me was -- you go back to people like Tillerson, McMahon, and others, and you say, you know, this White House is pretty chaotic. The Michael Wolff book, very chaotic. And she's saying this White House is very chaotic, backstabbing, and that's why she was taping people. I disagree with Dana. If you go into the situation room and there's actual national security being discussed, yeah, you would be in violation.

They will call every single Democrat in congress and put them on the spot in an official capacity and say, listen, are you going to vote for her as speaker? Then they will call every Dem nominee, will you vote for her as speaker? They will call the staff of all the Democrats in congress, will you vote? Then they'll run a poll, and then they'll do a few deep dives and some think pieces, and then they'll maybe book the opponent, and then they'll have a debate on CNN. So they foster this crazy scrum that then forces the hand of politicians. They could have done this with Dianne Feinstein. You know, she had a mole from China working for her for 20 years. They could have asked every senator on the Republican and Democratic side, do you condemn this? Do you feel comfortable with her? They could have asked her opponents out in California.

And it puts our entire national security at risk. Like, I don't know how, you know, Russians get in here, into this phone, but they do, and it's just -- that's why you have lockers outside of the situation room. And there must have been enough concern. Remember the stories about the White House, being told you know longer can bring personal devices into the White House. You had to leave them in your car or leave them at home. And there must have been more concerned about her. The White House is being, I think, quite restrained in talking about the reasons for her departure. I was shocked that she had a recording in the situation room. I also think that it was wrong to air it. I don't think that we should encourage any of this. The strange thing for me too is just about how quickly this book will go away. And it will be forgotten in three weeks. I learned that about when a book came out during the Bush administration. It was upsetting to me. The book was horrible to me. It was very disloyal, but it went out -- it was gone within three weeks. And you know who told me that it was President Bush. He said don't worry about it. Just let it go. It's irrelevant. And that is true. So for the people who are working in the White House who feel betrayed, just know that it will go away, and she looks terrible for doing this, and I'm sorry that it happened to all of us.

He said, man, she was saying great things, so I hired her. As long as she said great things about me, she was cool. Then she stopped saying great things now, she's wacky and her intelligence, like other black people, is to be questioned. The big issue here for me, Jesse, I didn't know about this nondisclosure agreement, $15,000 a month. And apparently this is true that when you leave the Trump White House, they give you a job in the upcoming campaign, the 2020 campaign, but you have to sign a deal that says you can't talk about what happened in the White House. You know what struck me was -- you go back to people like Tillerson, McMahon, and others, and you say, you know, this White House is pretty chaotic. The Michael Wolff book, very chaotic. And she's saying this White House is very chaotic, backstabbing, and that's why she was taping people. I disagree with Dana. If you go into the situation room and there's actual national security being discussed, yeah, you would be in violation.

That is not good for us as Americans. It's not good for whoever is in charge at the White House, be Republican or Democrat. So there are reasons that we have all these safeguards.

For instance, I don't think people at NBC necessary like Pelosi, so they're trying to create a little bit of an anti- Pelosi wave. And this is how they do this. They will call every single Democrat in congress and put them on the spot in an official capacity and say, listen, are you going to vote for her as speaker? Then they will call every Dem nominee, will you vote for her as speaker? They will call the staff of all the Democrats in congress, will you vote? Then they'll run a poll, and then they'll do a few deep dives and some think pieces, and then they'll maybe book the opponent, and then they'll have a debate on CNN. So they foster this crazy scrum that then forces the hand of politicians. They could have done this with Dianne Feinstein. You know, she had a mole from China working for her for 20 years. They could have asked every senator on the Republican and Democratic side, do you condemn this? Do you feel comfortable with her? They could have asked her opponents out in California. So they can foster these types of -- the momentum to have people apologize or step down. And when they choose a target, they're relentless. And they can really."

That would have been rich. No, she blamed the New York Times. So, it's one of those things where instead of taking personal responsibility and doing some thorough examination of your political life and the way people perceive you, it's much easier to blame someone else.

He did tell air traffic control that he was not a danger to other people, just himself. So, the jets that they scrambled from the military didn't try to take him out because he wasn't going into a civilian area.

But those guys in 9/11, they actually had some pilot training. This guy had no pilot's license and then he gained access to the aircraft and you have to know how to move in sequence the levers to get the plane started and you have to talk to people. And apparently, everybody just went along with it and those incredible maneuvers you were just watching, they're real. That's what he was doing. This is a guy who -- from all we know from his family, from anybody else -- never flew an airplane. And then, he crashes into the deserted side of a small island. It has about 12 people living on it. So, I don't think he was out to do any damage. The concern I would have sitting here in New York is, wow, post-9/11 this is going on after all the steps we've taken? Wow."

I think this is a very unique situation where an individual decided this is the way he wanted to go and this was -- he wasn't trying to involve anybody else. I think he just did -- \"I'm going out in a blaze of glory\" and he made sure he didn't hurt anybody else. Maybe hit the water, probably be a more comfortable ending, but he hit the wall. So, I don't look at this like I'm not worried about airport security as much as I'm worried..."

So, again, it's unfortunate, but if we have to calm down for a minute and let's not get teens together in panels -- well, I guess we already did that, but to find out what was the thing. Here was a guy who said he was at the end of it. He was done. He was tired and he chose to go out on a plane and he didn't go after anybody else. So, thank you for that, but..."
