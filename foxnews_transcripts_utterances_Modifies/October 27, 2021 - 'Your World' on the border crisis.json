But retailers are paying these fees, desperate to get products on the shelves ahead of the holidays. American Airlines reported that revenue from their cargo line generated 3.7 percent of the airline's total revenue in the third quarter of this year. That's the best quarter for cargo ever and nearly double the amount it generated during the same time in 2019. Other airlines like United and Delta, well, they're seeing growth in cargo revenue, too. Now, we have heard about how the lack of truck drivers is adding to the backlog of shipping containers in our seaports, but American Airlines says they're not seeing that same issue at the airports.",

Currently, only 34 percent of independents approve of the job Biden is doing. And that is the lowest of his term to date, a fall of 21 points since June. Overall, the polls showed his approvals holding at 42 percent after dropping sharply in September. And that is becoming toxic for Democrats running for office, including in the New Jersey governor's race, where the president went today to promote his agenda. The White House insisted the point of that trip was not to campaign for the incumbent governor, Phil Murphy, but -- despite Biden's endorsement of him. He did appear there. Biden also is heading to Virginia tomorrow. That trip is specifically to campaign for the Democrat Terry McAuliffe in this dead heat race that we're watching for governor. The election there is considered to be a bellwether for how Democrats are going to fare in the midterms. Still, progressives are saying that there was no mistake in staving off a vote on the first half of the president's agenda. It could have happened back in September.

Then that robber and another suspect rush into the store, snatch up as many designer purses as possible, and rush out. Amid the rising crime, major retailers like Macy's, Gap and Disney have closed stores on Michigan Avenue. Critics place part of the blame for the increase in shoplifting on Democratic state's attorney Kim Foxx. Her office stopped prosecuting shoplifting as a felony if the stolen items are worth less than $1,000. In response, Foxx's office tells us: \"we recognize community concerns around crime and the impact it can have on one's sense of safety, as well as the economic stability of a business. We continue to prosecute retail theft cases as misdemeanors and felonies when appropriate to do so based on the facts and evidence.\" The rise in shoplifting is not just a Chicago problem. It's happening in other major cities across the country. In San Francisco, it's becoming such a problem, Walgreens announced its closing five more stores in the Bay Area as a result.

According to the director of the movie \"Rust\" and other crew members, at least two people likely handled the gun that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins before that gun was handed to Alec Baldwin. As a series of vigils were held over the weekend for Hutchins, new information released by the sheriff revealed that Baldwin was rehearsing a scene at the time, drawing his gun from his holster and pointing it directly at the camera, where Hutchins was standing. The affidavits released by the sheriff reveal that, according to Joel Souza, the director, who was injured in the shooting, someone had shouted \"cold gun\" when the weapon was handed to Baldwin, meaning it should have been safe to use. Others have identified the person who said that as Dave Halls, the assistant director, one of those with responsibility for checking the weapon, and other crew members within the industry have come forward to reveal that they had previously raised concerns on different productions about Halls' approach to safety issues. Concerns have also been raised about the armorer on set, the person directly responsible for weapons. On the set of \"Rust,\" that was 24-year- old Hannah Gutierrez. Neither Gutierrez nor the assistant director, Halls, have publicly commented. Baldwin's wife, meantime, Hilaria, posted on Instagram today, saying -- quote -- \"My heart is with Halyna, her husband, her son, their family and loved ones, and my Alec. It's said there are no words because it's impossible to express the shock and heartache of such a tragic accident, heartbreak, loss, support.\" The questions that remain unanswered, Charles, how on earth did a live round get into a gun that was about to be used on a movie set? Who put that live round in the gun, and why, Charles?",

Now, over the summer, the Dixie Fire burned up nearly a million acres in this neck of the woods. But, recently, with this bomb cyclone, with this latest storm system moving through, the focus has turned to burn scar flooding. Now, burn scar flooding occurs when all the vegetation is burned off on the hillsides, because these fires, they destroy the trees, the vegetation, the duff on the forest floor that can help soak up the rain. And this can all lead to flash flooding when you have heavy rainfall like we have been experiencing here in Northern California. Vegetation also holds the soil in place. So mudslides and other erosion issues can be a problem on burn scars. And we have seen a big mudslide along Highway 70 about eight miles north of the town of Pulga. Caltrans has now shut down a large stretch of Highway 70 that runs along the Feather River Canyon and through the Dixie Fire burn scar. No word at this point when this stretch of Highway 70 will reopen or how long it will take to clear the debris from that mudslide. And all this rain can be destructive. It's also very needed. California is in the midst of a severe drought. Many of the lakes and reservoirs here are running low. That includes Lake Oroville, which is fed by the Feather River and is the state's second largest reservoir. Over the summer, lake levels hit only a quarter of the capacity of that lake. But now, with this rain, water levels in the lake are on the rise. Meanwhile, back here in Northern California, things are drying out. So we are getting some relief. There are going to be some scattered showers throughout the afternoon, but the risk of flash flooding should now be over -- Charles, back to you.",

American Airlines reported that revenue from their cargo line generated 3.7 percent of the airline's total revenue in the third quarter of this year. That's the best quarter for cargo ever and nearly double the amount it generated during the same time in 2019. Other airlines like United and Delta, well, they're seeing growth in cargo revenue, too.

That's the same thing as saying, they're going to front-load the spending.

The president went to New Jersey to promote his spending plan, working with what's really a three-day window to try to get this done, if he wants to bring it across the finish line, go to the Hill, do the dog and pony show and call this an achievement, before he gets on a plane and heads to Italy and Scotland for the G20 and COP 26 conferences. He wanted to have and wants to have a legislative achievement in his back pocket when he appears shoulder to shoulder with these foreign leaders. So because there's been no time to waste, he met this past weekend with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Joe Manchin at his home in Wilmington, which I don't believe we have ever seen him do before. And this morning, ahead of his trip to New Jersey to promote this plan, Biden said he was hopeful, hopeful about a timeline."

A new Gallup poll shows that the president's lost more ground on job approval from day one than any president since World War II. His approval among independents is also driving a lot of that loss. Currently, only 34 percent of independents approve of the job Biden is doing. And that is the lowest of his term to date, a fall of 21 points since June. Overall, the polls showed his approvals holding at 42 percent after dropping sharply in September. And that is becoming toxic for Democrats running for office, including in the New Jersey governor's race, where the president went today to promote his agenda. The White House insisted the point of that trip was not to campaign for the incumbent governor, Phil Murphy, but -- despite Biden's endorsement of him. He did appear there. Biden also is heading to Virginia tomorrow. That trip is specifically to campaign for the Democrat Terry McAuliffe in this dead heat race that we're watching for governor. The election there is considered to be a bellwether for how Democrats are going to fare in the midterms. Still, progressives are saying that there was no mistake in staving off a vote on the first half of the president's agenda. It could have happened back in September. They decided to block that vote and are now being asked whether this has put complicating factors potentially for these governor's races, especially in Virginia coming right up. They're saying that these are blue states, they should be easy wins. But we will see how that pans out -- Charles."

      "speaker": "LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER",

And you can't just point to one thing. It's everything. In general, independents and even Republicans and Democrats are feeling the country's going in the wrong direction. A lot of people voted for Biden because they gave him the benefit of the doubt, saying this is at least got to be better than it was. And, in fact, people are feeling worse about it than it was. So I think this is really bad news for Governor Murphy in New Jersey, who really thought that he had a sure path to reelection. I don't think it's quite as sure as it used to be. His gap is narrowing and narrowing and narrowing. And with more than a third of voters in New Jersey as registered independents, I think his race is going to be tighter than he'd expect. And so I think, even though these races might likely not go completely -- it's not for sure that they're going to go into Republican. The fact that Biden is even out there in Virginia, New Jersey, in states that are squarely Democratic states -- I mean, think about New Jersey. It has gone Democrat every year since 1992, every presidential election. And Virginia, where Biden carried it by 10 points, they're now at play. This is really bad news for the Democrats and the Biden administration."

We saw CNN poll where 25 percent of folks said, yes, they want to see both of those bills passed, but 34 percent or so said it would hurt their family.

And they know -- many of them have said that they appreciated the stimulus when it came time for COVID, but now is not the time just to be pumping more money out without knowing where it's coming from. The messaging that the Biden administration is doing, where he keeps saying it's not going to cost Americans anything, we have got this paid for, it's not working, because, if you look at the polling, a lot of people say I'm concerned about the spending, I'm concerned about putting ourselves further in debt."

And that only went down because 180,000 people left the work force. Every time something goes wrong, President Biden tells America that's -- that it's actually great.

Is it going to be -- because that's very much -- if you look at the playbook in 2010, there were so many people running for -- it wasn't just saying we're running against this. We're running for something. And so I think the Republicans have to put together a picture, whether it's a signature policy, whether it's something that's going to say that things are going to get better.

Amid the rising crime, major retailers like Macy's, Gap and Disney have closed stores on Michigan Avenue.

The issue is that the federal government has sent out this message that right now is the time to come to the U.S., because you will be let into the country. And that's why you see these large groups of caravans that are surging the border. We saw that in Del Rio a few weeks ago. We're continuing to see that day in and day out along the Southern border. We still have thousands that are coming across the border every single day. So the problem is the messaging. The messaging is right now, come to the U.S., because you will be let free into the country, because there is no consequences. There is no rule of law that's being enforced by the federal government. That's why Texas is stepping in. We are stepping in. And we are going to do what we can as far as with the resources that we have to contain this surge. And also not only that, Charles, but we also are arresting illegal immigrants that are coming across that are violating state law for criminal trespass. So we are making arrests. We have made over 1, 400 arrests since July. So the message that we are sending is that don't come to Texas. If you do, you will be arrested, you will be apprehended, and you will be placed behind bars."

They got to put more pressure on them to stop these caravans from making it further north. And right now, what we saw in some of those videos, that's not taking place. They have really got to take a stance and enforce and have some action to prevent these caravans. But, right now, there's so much money being involved with human smuggling. Just to give you an insight, right now, human smugglers are making well over $100 million a week just on human smuggling. That's not even narcotics. So there's so much money involved with these cartels and these smuggling organizations. They have so much power right now, that it's going to be very difficult and challenging to shut these groups down, because as long as the message is being sent to come to the U.S., we're going to continue seeing these caravans making their way to the Southern border."

      "utterance": "Hey, Charles. According to the director of the movie \"Rust\" and other crew members, at least two people likely handled the gun that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins before that gun was handed to Alec Baldwin. As a series of vigils were held over the weekend for Hutchins, new information released by the sheriff revealed that Baldwin was rehearsing a scene at the time, drawing his gun from his holster and pointing it directly at the camera, where Hutchins was standing. The affidavits released by the sheriff reveal that, according to Joel Souza, the director, who was injured in the shooting, someone had shouted \"cold gun\" when the weapon was handed to Baldwin, meaning it should have been safe to use. Others have identified the person who said that as Dave Halls, the assistant director, one of those with responsibility for checking the weapon, and other crew members within the industry have come forward to reveal that they had previously raised concerns on different productions about Halls' approach to safety issues. Concerns have also been raised about the armorer on set, the person directly responsible for weapons. On the set of \"Rust,\" that was 24-year- old Hannah Gutierrez. Neither Gutierrez nor the assistant director, Halls, have publicly commented. Baldwin's wife, meantime, Hilaria, posted on Instagram today, saying -- quote -- \"My heart is with Halyna, her husband, her son, their family and loved ones, and my Alec. It's said there are no words because it's impossible to express the shock and heartache of such a tragic accident, heartbreak, loss, support.\" The questions that remain unanswered, Charles, how on earth did a live round get into a gun that was about to be used on a movie set? Who put that live round in the gun, and why, Charles?"

      "utterance": "Hey, Charles. Right now, I'm standing in the steep, rugged terrain of the Sierra Foothills. And this is an area that was recently ravaged by the Dixie Fire. Now, over the summer, the Dixie Fire burned up nearly a million acres in this neck of the woods. But, recently, with this bomb cyclone, with this latest storm system moving through, the focus has turned to burn scar flooding. Now, burn scar flooding occurs when all the vegetation is burned off on the hillsides, because these fires, they destroy the trees, the vegetation, the duff on the forest floor that can help soak up the rain. And this can all lead to flash flooding when you have heavy rainfall like we have been experiencing here in Northern California. Vegetation also holds the soil in place. So mudslides and other erosion issues can be a problem on burn scars. And we have seen a big mudslide along Highway 70 about eight miles north of the town of Pulga. Caltrans has now shut down a large stretch of Highway 70 that runs along the Feather River Canyon and through the Dixie Fire burn scar. No word at this point when this stretch of Highway 70 will reopen or how long it will take to clear the debris from that mudslide. And all this rain can be destructive. It's also very needed. California is in the midst of a severe drought. Many of the lakes and reservoirs here are running low. That includes Lake Oroville, which is fed by the Feather River and is the state's second largest reservoir. Over the summer, lake levels hit only a quarter of the capacity of that lake. But now, with this rain, water levels in the lake are on the rise. Meanwhile, back here in Northern California, things are drying out. So we are getting some relief. There are going to be some scattered showers throughout the afternoon, but the risk of flash flooding should now be over -- Charles, back to you."

And we're selling mattresses like hotcakes, biggest record days over the last week continuously after the Astros got in the World Series.

So a lot of our mattresses suppliers are having shortages of foam. So we're selling whatever mattresses we can get. We sell a lot of made-in-America furniture, so we're a little bit more insulated than our friends are who buy most everything from China or Vietnam. But the supply chain has certainly been disrupted. But I think there's definitely a light at the end of the tunnel. It's going to get better."
