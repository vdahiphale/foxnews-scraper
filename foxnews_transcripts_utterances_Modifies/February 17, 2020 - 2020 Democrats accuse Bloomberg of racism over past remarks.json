House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has reaction and speaking of Nancy, the man trying to unseat her is here later tonight to tell us about his confrontation. This was wild with a San Francisco radical. You've got to see it to believe it.  Plus 2020 Dems open up a new attack on Bloomberg. He's a racist now. Candace Owens always explains why this is giving her 2016 flashbacks. Also we have a big exclusive for you tonight.  The three girls who filed a federal suit against transgender athletes competing with them are here live in Washington. You don't want to miss their message. Two of them from my old high school. But first, a party of snobs. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Every now and then, a politician unintentionally reveals who he really is and what he really believes.",

It was hilarious but I have to say, to be fair there's context - context to explain these comments from Bloomberg. Now look at this headline in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel today. Bloomberg appears to be insulting farmers but there's more to the story. Now, I have a question. Why don't conservatives ever get the same chance to explain our context? Because for us, there's never more to the story. They just jump to boycotts and total condemnation. Never the less, here's more of what Bloomberg did say.",

He's just dripping with condescension and remember on the respect front what we're talking about the respect front. Now women, when you think about the whole thing, women aren't really respected as women who can have different views in the Democrat party because if they are pro-life, the entire party has driven pro-life women from their ranks. They've basically said as much. Women who are pro-life are not welcome.   And Bloomberg's going to fit in just fine there. He's personally contributed, check this out, $14 million to Planned Parenthood from 2014 to 2017. Figures probably up by now. 5.8 million to women vote. That's Emily's list pack. That's since 2012.  And he headlined Emily's list 2018 New York City convention. Now remember Emily's list claims that it's just for electing more women to Congress. You look at their little website. That's what they say. 50,000 women but of course what they really mean is more pro-abortion women to Congress.  The party of inclusion is the opposite. It's more restrictive than it was 20 years ago when the Democrat party. When you really think about this and I thought - I thought about it a lot today, their big tent collapsed and that tent has been replaced by a safe space for leftists victims only. Think about Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He's basically a walking Democrat Stegosaurus.  He's pro-gun and he's pro-life. Not going to be many more of him anytime soon. Imagine what AOC plus three say about someone like Manchin behind closed doors. Get out of here. Now at the core of all of this, it's not just snobbery. It's not - yes, it's that but it's a deep and unwavering contempt for traditional American ideals because in this elitist view of sanctimonious snobs, the rights to life and to liberty without which the pursuit of happiness is meaningless are reserved only for those who truly deserve to have them.  You have to think the right way to have them and Bloomberg, he's kind of a miniature pony, trotting a well-worn Democrat path there. From Hillary's deplorable to Obama's bitter clingers, the left loves to trash the common man while claiming to stand up for him.

I'm not surprised those four crimes you put up, because, depending on the degree, all of those crimes, if they were misdemeanor crimes, those people would be let right out.

You probably know how I think about this, having been a female athlete, especially in high school. That's what these high school track and field stars argue in a new lawsuit to overturn the state athletic conference's transgender policy. According to their complaint, \"this reality is discrimination against girls that directly violates the requirements of Title IX. Because schools are permitting males to compete as girls and women, girls and women are losing competitive opportunities. To American girls -- those born with XX chromosomes -- the message is give up, you can't win.\" Joining me now exclusively, I'm so happy to see them all, it's like a Connecticut reunion here, the high school track and field stars behind this lawsuit, Chelsea Mitchell, Alanna Smith, and Selina Soule, and their attorney Christiana Holcomb.

It was hilarious but I have to say, to be fair there's context - context to explain these comments from Bloomberg. Now look at this headline in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel today. Bloomberg appears to be insulting farmers but there's more to the story. Now, I have a question. Why don't conservatives ever get the same chance to explain our context?

Any time President Trump's team tried to provide context after anything that people considered controversial like Charlottesville or after his comments about where the refugees, we admit come from, they're just ignored.

He's just dripping with condescension and remember on the respect front what we're talking about the respect front. Now women, when you think about the whole thing, women aren't really respected as women who can have different views in the Democrat party because if they are pro-life, the entire party has driven pro-life women from their ranks. They've basically said as much. Women who are pro-life are not welcome. And Bloomberg's going to fit in just fine there. He's personally contributed, check this out, $14 million to Planned Parenthood from 2014 to 2017. Figures probably up by now. 5.8 million to women vote. That's Emily's list pack. That's since 2012. And he headlined Emily's list 2018 New York City convention. Now remember Emily's list claims that it's just for electing more women to Congress. You look at their little website. That's what they say. 50,000 women but of course what they really mean is more pro-abortion women to Congress. The party of inclusion is the opposite. It's more restrictive than it was 20 years ago when the Democrat party. When you really think about this and I thought - I thought about it a lot today, their big tent collapsed and that tent has been replaced by a safe space for leftists victims only. Think about Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He's basically a walking Democrat Stegosaurus. He's pro-gun and he's pro-life. Not going to be many more of him anytime soon. Imagine what AOC plus three say about someone like Manchin behind closed doors. Get out of here. Now at the core of all of this, it's not just snobbery. It's not - yes, it's that but it's a deep and unwavering contempt for traditional American ideals because in this elitist view of sanctimonious snobs, the rights to life and to liberty without which the pursuit of happiness is meaningless are reserved only for those who truly deserve to have them. You have to think the right way to have them and Bloomberg, he's kind of a miniature pony, trotting a well-worn Democrat path there. From Hillary's deplorable to Obama's bitter clingers, the left loves to trash the common man while claiming to stand up for him.

Now, this is not only damaging to the rule of law. It's a massive threat to public safety. Now why? Well because Soros is funding DA's promising to ignore certain criminal laws altogether. Decriminalizing crime, theft, drug use, other quality of life crimes. You see it playing a lot of in places like San Francisco and New York, L. A. etcetera. Now Soros is basically trying to make the entire country look like the left coast. It's rapidly deteriorating. We all see it happening. Do you want that in your locality, in your town, in your city? And by the way, it's also happening just miles from where I'm sitting right here, in the nation's capital. Soros's millions propelled his candidates to victory in three wealthy DC suburbs including the town of my next guest.

Just the basic quality of life on the streets, the - what are you going to, walk to the grocery store without getting accosted or step in something you don't want to or someone coming into your house and parking for a while and thinking they're going to go to jail and they don't."

There are people who a year ago we would've called them bona fide progressives, people that got elected district attorney around the state, who have now come out and said guys, this is absolute bonkers. We cannot keep the public safe. New Jersey just across the river, enacted their version of bail reform. They at least allowed judges to keep discretion based on a person's reasonable threat to public safety. We did not do that in New York state.

Since 2019 in New York, 34 percent increase in robbery, 8.5 percent felonious assaults, 70 percent grand larceny auto, 10 percent grand larceny, period. These are those crimes you were talking about.

I'm not surprised those four crimes you put up, because, depending on the degree, all of those crimes, if they were misdemeanor crimes, those people would be let right out. And we have seen his time and time again. People were charged with bank robbery five and six times. Mr. Barry, the first person you put up on the screen, he was arrested 139 times, 139 times.

But this is something much different, much different from in decades past where people had spirited disagreements. People burned the flags in the 60s and 70s and called cops pegs and that was horrible. But the things where they are brazen about saying I want you dead, this individual has to be identified and prosecuted if possible."

He was doing all kinds of vulgar gestures to suburban moms who came in to clean up San Francisco. And he was also threatening every guy he could find in the crowd. So I wanted to go up and just diffuse the situation with him, and he got very aggressive, and he said I want you dead, which I thought was a nice icebreaker."

He is the racist because he looked at a white guy with gray hair who I guess is as Republican, and he says you must be racist. So he is a racist."

I've been watching these videos of Antifa attacking people for years. And for years I've been saying the same thing that you said in your tweet when you put that out there the other day, and thank you, by the way, for retweeting it. Where is Nancy Pelosi in all this? The people on the left, and this is largely left-driven violence, where is Nancy Pelosi? Where is Chuck Schumer? Where is Bernie Sanders? Where are all the presidential candidates? Where is AOC in all this business?"
