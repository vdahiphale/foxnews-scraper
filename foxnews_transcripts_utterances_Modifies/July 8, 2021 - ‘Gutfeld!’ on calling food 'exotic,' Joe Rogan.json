It's a big deal. Because like Brian Stelter without a training bra, surviving 10 years in cable isn't normal. I just want you to think about that image.

It's a live show in which people speak their minds which is as dangerous these days as walking a tightrope between two skyscrapers in heels basted in butter. We aren't have been at the forefront of canceled culture. We saw it coming because it came to us early on. In this day and age there's a cottage industry based on the dopamine hit one gets from attacking strangers. It's a pot shot theater on Twitter where people wait to pounce on us for saying something honest, because honesty is what gets you in trouble. You ever noticed that CNN, MSNBC ABC, CBS, NBC anchors they never get into trouble? I mean, with their pants on? And even while the late night shows kept quiet about it, we didn't, we took it on. And we keep at it every day, we show up and none of us bite our tongues except maybe Dana. You should hear her profanity laced rant about immigrants in the greenroom. I had no idea there were so many curse words that rhyme with Guatemalans. But the reason for \"THE FIVE's\" success and Fox's success and this show's success is risk. We are taking the risk every day to tell you the truth. And when the truth is especially under fire. We're the first responders to (BLEEP) and it's a tribute to the audience who support us. But it's so predictable how the media reacts to new Fox shows. It happened with \"THE FIVE\" 10 years ago and it happens with this show today. The recipe is always the same. A press release announces the show, haters to tune into trash it. They writes about the stuff they don't like, which ironically is the same things the fans love about it. And then the haters go away and the fans stay and the show becomes a hit and it runs for thousands of episodes. Repeat. So tonight our first block is dedicated to \"THE FIVE\" and everyone who contributed to its success, including you, the viewers who keep me employed and in silk stockings.",

It's a big deal. Because like Brian Stelter without a training bra, surviving 10 years in cable isn't normal. I just want you to think about that image. MTV didn't even play music that long. \"THE FIVE\" is like one of those super old Japanese ladies. They find out that just turned 120 years old. And everybody wants to know her secret.

We outlasted shows with bigger budgets, bigger staffs and better drugs. At Fox, we're lucky if we can snort crushed up a leave in the greenroom bathroom. I learned that trick from Stuart Varney.

      "utterance": "How many -- how many women does that guy gets? OK. Identify as women. But there is a very unique role that \"THE FIVE\" plays today. It's a live show in which people speak their minds which is as dangerous these days as walking a tightrope between two skyscrapers in heels basted in butter. We aren't have been at the forefront of canceled culture. We saw it coming because it came to us early on. In this day and age there's a cottage industry based on the dopamine hit one gets from attacking strangers. It's a pot shot theater on Twitter where people wait to pounce on us for saying something honest, because honesty is what gets you in trouble. You ever noticed that CNN, MSNBC ABC, CBS, NBC anchors they never get into trouble? I mean, with their pants on? And even while the late night shows kept quiet about it, we didn't, we took it on. And we keep at it every day, we show up and none of us bite our tongues except maybe Dana. You should hear her profanity laced rant about immigrants in the greenroom. I had no idea there were so many curse words that rhyme with Guatemalans. But the reason for \"THE FIVE's\" success and Fox's success and this show's success is risk. We are taking the risk every day to tell you the truth. And when the truth is especially under fire. We're the first responders to (BLEEP) and it's a tribute to the audience who support us. But it's so predictable how the media reacts to new Fox shows. It happened with \"THE FIVE\" 10 years ago and it happens with this show today. The recipe is always the same. A press release announces the show, haters to tune into trash it. They writes about the stuff they don't like, which ironically is the same things the fans love about it. And then the haters go away and the fans stay and the show becomes a hit and it runs for thousands of episodes. Repeat. So tonight our first block is dedicated to \"THE FIVE\" and everyone who contributed to its success, including you, the viewers who keep me employed and in silk stockings."

And you'll never guess why. Yes, you guessed it, it's racist. According to the Jeff Bezos vanity press, \"The first problem with the word it has lost its essential meeting. The second more crucial problem. It's used particularly as applied to food indirectly lengthens the metaphysical distance between one group of humans and another and in, so, doing reinforces xenophobia and racism. Yes, you know what writer, maybe stick to writing about food because no human could process that cold stew you just barked all over us. Speaking of an exotic dish, Boris Becker is catching heat for referring to a player's fiance as \"very pretty.\" The tennis legend made the offhand comment, not a backhand comment, little tennis humor, while covering, covering Wimbledon, which is like the Little League World Series for tennis. Spokeswoman, a spokes human for women in sport, who is probably ugly, something disgusting, sexist might say, condemned the remarks saying when men are comfortable talking about women in this way, never mind on live TV, it shows there is still more to do.
