And a lot of the things need to be flown in or brought in boats. And that takes some time. The air traffic control is a little bit congested. And we have assets on the ground. We have food. We have water. We have distributed them with FEMA. We have opened 11 regional centers that distribute food, water, over two million liters of water, over a million portions of food that have been delivered so that people can have access to those.  Fuel is beginning to pick up, although it's been our biggest challenge to be able to complete the logistic pathway to distribute fuel. So, the reality is that administration and the president, every time that we have spoken, I have had an ask. They have delivered.

So, what we have asked Congress -- and I'm sure they will -- and I'm confident that they will deliver -- I have heard the solidarity and the response from a bipartisan effort -- is that we need to have whatever the amount of this imbursement that is given to Puerto Rico needs to be consistent with the damage.
