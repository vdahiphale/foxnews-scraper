They've dug. They've subpoenaed and they have found exactly zero, an air ball on it. Meanwhile, ISIS is trying to take down the west including us. North Korea is testing nuclear weapons against us and our allies. Iran is testing torpedoes in the Strait of Hormuz where every single barrel of oil, at least, that part of the world passes through.

But she specializes in all things first amendment. Jamila Bey is here. Welcome, guys. This has been a crazy week.

It's a matter of whose ox is being gored. But it really is an important investigation. It needs to be out to rest. It's not going to be put to rest by brushing anything aside.

I might have gotten rid of him because he wasn't looking into the leaks to the satisfaction of the president, which, obviously, the president feels the leaks are significant, and many people do as well, maybe because he was out in the public eye. And I don't remember another FBI director who's been out in the public eye as much of Comey, and you really shouldn't be. You're the investigative branch. You're law enforcement branch. You're not a politician, so there maybe a variety of reason. I seriously doubt that curb the investigation was the motive."

This is the beauty of any high-functioning, and I really hold our FBI still in quite a high regard despite -- I have a strong distaste for Jim Comey, and have for quite a while. I agree with Judge Alex. He maybe -- political -- first of all, being so visible. That is not the point of a law enforcement official in this country, especially in that capacity. But this is the beauty. He's just a face, at that point. This point, Jim Comey was nothing more than the face of the FBI. The men and women on the ground are, so to speak, are in the trenches with files this high on their desk. They are going to work every day like this never happened. And, of course, it's disruptive, it might be distracting, but it is not going to take their eye off the ball. And you your point, Eric, here's the thing, ten months might seem like a long time. It's really not. And I'm not saying that to be suspicious. They might get to know. They ultimately might get to know, and I'm telling you that, absolutely, you're right. But we don't know yet. And the feds take a little bit longer because -- help me out, judge. I think their accuracy rate, conviction rate, around 98 percent. It's incredibly high. The federal government -- yeah, they tends to get it right, and the reason they do is because they take their time."

      "utterance": "To Jamila's point, and it's been said that if Hillary Clinton were the one who fired Comey, the Democrats instead of yelling and screaming would be applauding. I would flip it and say, in all honesty, if President Obama or Hillary Clinton fire the FBI director while they were investigating the email scandal, our same audience that is saying, what are you talking about, this is proper, would be going, this is the fix. It's like that meeting on the tarmac."

I don't blame President Trump for firing him at all. And I'm very consistent around that. I think when you broke the news, I think it's the strongest thing he's done as president. But we absolutely have to consider the context."

      "speaker": "FERRER",
      "utterance": "I think it's a judgment call for him. Personally, I understand the different things that Comey did. I may disagree with one or two of them, but I understand what he did and why he did it. His explanations, to me, made sense even though to a lot of people they were like, this is crazy, nobody ever done it before."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRER",
      "utterance": "Oh, no. I have a problem with that. I think -- this is my own personal feeling. My personal feeling is and, ironically, it's what he ended up doing, is that I think that Comey looked at it and said this is a close call for anybody but Hillary Clinton. I would go ahead and indict. But it's a close call. And by indicting her, I'm going to decide the next president of the United States. And I don't want to be the one who said Donald Trump is the next president of the United States. So being a close call, I think he decided to go ahead and fudge on the no-intent, when we all know that some of the crimes she was charged with did not require intent."

And then once he went in front of congress, once he sat in front of congress and sworn the investigation was over, and they started saying good, then we want the transcript of this testimony. I don't think he had a choice once those other emails came out. But to get up and say, I know I promised you this investigation was over under oath. It is now no longer over."
