And Fox on top of a little bit of over-the-top drama talking about these tax cuts on the same day, days, in fact, that we have heard the likes of AT&T, and Boeing, and Wells Fargo, and Comcast, for a variety of reasons, talk about good things they hope to do.

So, the question is, are companies going to use their tax savings? The answer is, they already are, at least some of them. First out of the gate here is AT&T. This is what they're doing, giving 200,000 of their workers a $1,000 bonus, also investing a billion dollars into the U.S. next year because they believe tax reform will drive growth and create jobs.  And yes, Neil, AT&T, I wouldn't call them friendly to the administration right now after it blocked of their purchase of Time Warner. Comcast also giving 100,000 workers $1,000 bonuses, plus investing more than $50 billion in infrastructure, thanks also to the recent repeal by the FCC of net neutrality. The company is adding -- quote -- \"With these investments, we expect to add thousands of new direct and indirect jobs.\"  Speaking of jobs, many bank workers will see their paychecks go up; 36,000 employees at scandal-ridden Wells Fargo will see the minimum wage hiked to $15 an hour. That starts in March.  And Wells Fargo will donate hundreds of millions to programs that help small businesses, as well as homeowners. Fifth Third Bancorp also hiking minimum wages for about 3,000 of their hourly employees and promising thousands more a bonus if tax reform is signed into law by Christmas.  Finally, Boeing investing $300 million in itself and in its work force. They're doling it out between charitable causes, employees training and their facilities.   So, all in, hours after tax reform was passed in Congress, we see corporate America putting their money to work. Two questions remain. Will more companies follow, Neil, or are the companies that do follow, were these companies just trying to get in the administration's good graces, like AT&T?",

And there's more to come. You're going to see I think more and more companies every day announcing these kind of benefits to workers, because there's an increased value in workers.

You are going to pay less in taxes now, but you are also going to be seeing more jobs created.

But once people start seeing that money come back in their paychecks and they see bigger paychecks at their office, they are going to actually realize how good of a bill this is. So, as soon as President Trump wants to sign it, I'm just excited we have a president who wants to sign this bill and who helped us get to this point. We wouldn't be at this point without the leadership of President Donald Trump, Vice President Pence. Their whole team at the White House has been great in helping us get that bill to his desk.

And of those eight times, in the following year, in no time did it go more than 24 percent, and only five times did it go up in the second year. So, we're in very special place, rarefied air.

The president tweeting about that very negative coverage, saying that it really wasn't fair. And, by the way, you could take a look at examples of that. You have obviously seen and heard what the president has tweeted on about this.

Usually, when you become president, you get to do speeches afterwards sometimes for $500 a pop or $500,000 a pop in Russia. So I doubt that they're doing this so they can line their own pockets. So that was an interesting narrative. And then other narratives were around polling, which some, including a CNN poll, showed that this tax bill was 55 percent disapproved by the public. Here's another piece of advice. Why don't we wait until this time next year and see what the benefits are in terms of GDP, in terms of jobs and all of those things? And, most importantly, let's see how the 2018 elections go, because if this becomes a referendum on how the economy is doing as a result of this tax bill, then Democrats shouldn't probably be as confident as they are sounding right now in terms of turning over the House and the Senate.",

And they found that 74 percent of coverage on this president was based on his character and his leadership, in other words, Trump the person, only 26 percent on policy. So, let's just do a little report card on how things have gone in terms on policy based on the issues that people voted on in the 2016 election that they deemed most important. Economy. You would have to say that that is probably an A based on GDP, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence, stock market, all of those things. I think even Democrats would agree with that. Who gets credit would probably be where the debate is. Then you have jobs. I just mentioned that as well as far as 17-year low in unemployment. Immigration, border crossing are vastly down, even though the will -- the wall -- excuse me -- hasn't started yet. So you could call that incomplete. Then you could go to health care. That was a failure in terms of repeal and replace. But the Obamacare mandate was part of this tax bill, and now that's gone. So you could say that there was some success, even though, probably you go with a D there. And finally ISIS, the caliphate has been decimated, and Trump said he would blow the hell out of them, even though these things tend to metastasize terrorists in terms of lone wolves. So it's not a solved problem, but certainly success there. So if we look back on those five issues and how this president has done from a performance perspective, which doesn't get covered that much by the media, you would have to say this first year has been a relative success.",

So, the question is, are companies going to use their tax savings? The answer is, they already are, at least some of them. First out of the gate here is AT&T. This is what they're doing, giving 200,000 of their workers a $1,000 bonus, also investing a billion dollars into the U.S. next year because they believe tax reform will drive growth and create jobs. And yes, Neil, AT&T, I wouldn't call them friendly to the administration right now after it blocked of their purchase of Time Warner. Comcast also giving 100,000 workers $1,000 bonuses, plus investing more than $50 billion in infrastructure, thanks also to the recent repeal by the FCC of net neutrality. The company is adding -- quote -- \"With these investments, we expect to add thousands of new direct and indirect jobs.\" Speaking of jobs, many bank workers will see their paychecks go up; 36,000 employees at scandal-ridden Wells Fargo will see the minimum wage hiked to $15 an hour. That starts in March. And Wells Fargo will donate hundreds of millions to programs that help small businesses, as well as homeowners. Fifth Third Bancorp also hiking minimum wages for about 3,000 of their hourly employees and promising thousands more a bonus if tax reform is signed into law by Christmas. Finally, Boeing investing $300 million in itself and in its work force. They're doling it out between charitable causes, employees training and their facilities. So, all in, hours after tax reform was passed in Congress, we see corporate America putting their money to work. Two questions remain. Will more companies follow, Neil, or are the companies that do follow, were these companies just trying to get in the administration's good graces, like AT&T?"

And there's more to come. You're going to see I think more and more companies every day announcing these kind of benefits to workers, because there's an increased value in workers.

This is the benefit that you are going to see, not just, again, in your paychecks, not when -- not only when you do your taxes. You are going to pay less in taxes now, but you are also going to be seeing more jobs created.

Look, President Trump had a great celebration at the White House yesterday, where he started the process of letting people know about this bill, because if you're just reading about it in your local newspaper, you're probably hearing a lot of this boogeyman, Frankenstein foolishness from the left, who are scared to death of people getting more of their money back. But once people start seeing that money come back in their paychecks and they see bigger paychecks at their office, they are going to actually realize how good of a bill this is. So, as soon as President Trump wants to sign it, I'm just excited we have a president who wants to sign this bill and who helped us get to this point. We wouldn't be at this point without the leadership of President Donald Trump, Vice President Pence. Their whole team at the White House has been great in helping us get that bill to his desk. And when he signs it, it's going to be an even bigger celebration for families and workers in the middle class who have been crying for this kind of relief for generations."

I love fighting for the people that I represent in Southeast Louisiana and just the things that we wanted to do to get our country back on track and restore the American dream. I knew what was right in front of us when I was fighting to get out of the hospital in August and finally in September. And I knew that we were going to be able to have this opportunity. But if we didn't put it together, it wouldn't happen. I have been through eight years under Barack Obama where our country was going in the wrong direction. And, frankly, a lot of us felt that we were losing the American dream, and we needed to fight to get it back. And we had a president who wanted to do this. So, I knew we only had maybe one moment to get this right. And if we didn't get it right, I think you would have easily been able to say this Congress was not a success at all, maybe a failure. But, instead, we did it. We said we were not -- failure wasn't going to be an option. And we stayed to get it done and we came together. You saw a lot of uniting and taking a lot of criticism from people who didn't even read this bill, but ultimately who now realize how good it's going to be for the country and to rebuild the middle class, Neil.

Now, we have had an unbelievable run since the 6000 or so Dow that we had in 2009. But we have relied on the consumer to drive that.

We don't have double-digit inflation. Those are the things that really drag a market down. They dragged them down in the '70s. It dragged them down in the '80s.

The president tweeting about that very negative coverage, saying that it really wasn't fair. And, by the way, you could take a look at examples of that. You have obviously seen and heard what the president has tweeted on about this. But we're going to rocket through a lot of these headlines with a guy who knows the comparison then and now, Joe Concha. And, Joe, it really is glaring. The health care thing, that was, you know, a religious event, this not so much. But, if you think about it, the rap against each was all lopsided by one party, right?"

Usually, when you become president, you get to do speeches afterwards sometimes for $500 a pop or $500,000 a pop in Russia. So I doubt that they're doing this so they can line their own pockets. So that was an interesting narrative. And then other narratives were around polling, which some, including a CNN poll, showed that this tax bill was 55 percent disapproved by the public. Here's another piece of advice. Why don't we wait until this time next year and see what the benefits are in terms of GDP, in terms of jobs and all of those things? And, most importantly, let's see how the 2018 elections go, because if this becomes a referendum on how the economy is doing as a result of this tax bill, then Democrats shouldn't probably be as confident as they are sounding right now in terms of turning over the House and the Senate."

And they found that 74 percent of coverage on this president was based on his character and his leadership, in other words, Trump the person, only 26 percent on policy. So, let's just do a little report card on how things have gone in terms on policy based on the issues that people voted on in the 2016 election that they deemed most important. Economy. You would have to say that that is probably an A based on GDP, unemployment at a 17-year low, consumer confidence, stock market, all of those things. I think even Democrats would agree with that. Who gets credit would probably be where the debate is. Then you have jobs. I just mentioned that as well as far as 17-year low in unemployment. Immigration, border crossing are vastly down, even though the will -- the wall -- excuse me -- hasn't started yet. So you could call that incomplete. Then you could go to health care. That was a failure in terms of repeal and replace. But the Obamacare mandate was part of this tax bill, and now that's gone. So you could say that there was some success, even though, probably you go with a D there. And finally ISIS, the caliphate has been decimated, and Trump said he would blow the hell out of them, even though these things tend to metastasize terrorists in terms of lone wolves. So it's not a solved problem, but certainly success there. So if we look back on those five issues and how this president has done from a performance perspective, which doesn't get covered that much by the media, you would have to say this first year has been a relative success."

All right, in the meantime, the fact of the matter is, whether they're late or on time, people are spending. In fact, this, we're told, is one of the busier Christmas shopping seasons in the better part of a decade. To retail watcher Hitha Herzog on what is going on. What is going on here with this, Hitha?"

So, to your point, it's is one of the best years that we have seen in terms of retail. So, I think really what is driving this, obviously, are people spending online, as well as their mobile devices. PayPal was estimating about 80 percent of U.S. consumers are spending via just their phones. So because it's so easy now, people are really heading to the stores or really heading offline to get their merchandise."

      "utterance": "I think this has been a long time coming. So, prior to the recession, people were really upping their savings. They didn't feel as great about the economy. But it's a real combination of this upped consumer sentiment and a feeling that things are going to get better. And, yes, of course, I think people are anticipating this tax cut coming. But now we're that seeing all these bonuses being put out, I think people are just going to start spending again, especially in the next couple months."

People -- there was this frugal -- frugal fatigue is what I talk about a lot. But, basically, that means that people are just sick of saving. They want to go out and spend. We are a society that likes to shop. So now that there is this feeling of -- euphoria might be too big of a word, considering what is going on in the rest of the country, especially in Puerto Rico and California, we had natural disasters hit those areas, but I think, for the most part, people are just definitely feeling better. And they feel a little bit more secure with their jobs and more secure about where their income is coming from."

But 128 countries still voted against the U.S. and Israel, even though that those countries received more than $21 billion in U.S. financial assistance last year alone. Yemen, for example, which co-sponsored the resolution condemning the U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, received nearly $600 million in aid this year.

Rebecca, obviously, all Israeli operations, government offices are in Jerusalem, as things stand now. So, for Israel, it won't really change much about their government locale and all of that. But is this a lot of faux rage at the United Nations, the whole threat notwithstanding on the part of Nikki Haley?"

      "speaker": "REBECCAH HEINRICHS, HUDSON INSTITUTE",
      "utterance": "I think it's a combination of faux rage and real rage. For me, I thought today was a great day actually for American leadership. It was just refreshing to see Nikki Haley defending the right of the United States to put its embassy where it wants to put its embassy. And that is in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel. And so, over the last eight years, the Obama administration sort of feigned that we didn't have the ability or we didn't have leverage at the U.N., which is just simply not true. So, I thought it was a good day for the United States. I know that's sort of a strange take. But I also think it's important that there's so many of U.S. allies that did abstain and that didn't vote with the Palestinian cause. Poland, the Czech Republic, Canada, Australia, those are countries that deserve, I think, to be applauded. And those are who are true allies really are here."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

They all advocated, Democratic and Republican administrations alike, Democratic and Republican candidates alike in the past, that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, that someday we should put our embassy there, whatever. They never followed up. This president did. So I understand the rage on the part of the administration's response to say, you know what? We might hold back aid to the United Nations in the future. Should they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "I think that it's wise, on a case-by-case basis, too, especially these particular countries that went ahead and voted against the United States. That is -- Nikki Haley said it right. This is an investment we make to the United Nations. The U.N. is just a tool to further U.S. interests. If it's not furthering U.S. interests, why are investing so much money? The point you made is so important, though. In 1995, Congress passed a law that recognized, and passed it overwhelmingly, Democrats and Republicans, that recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. And every subsequent president has used his waiver authority not to do that. President Trump just did it. And so he is responding and implementing the will of the people. And he doesn't work for the U.N. He works for Americans. And so that's what he did."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "That's the concern. That right there is the concern. And that's why I'm a little reluctant to just say we need to do it or we should just eliminate all funds. I mean, we need to take everything on a case-by-case basis and make sure that we're still furthering U.S. interests. Again, it's a tool. And so I don't think we need to make a sort of ideological stand against the U.N. here. We need to be careful. But certainly it should not just be a given that the U.N. is just the arbiter of all things right. The United States needs to do what is best for the United States."

And the debate on ANWR has not kept up with the advancements in technology and the high environmental standards that we have in Alaska. The final legislation that passed just has 2,000 acres, surface footprint acres, that can be developed. That's it. And we can do that because of the advancements in technology -- 2,000 acres, Neil, that's smaller than the Fargo, North Dakota, airport. That's going to be it. So we can do it responsibly, but, you know, that's..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, millions of acres are still off. You can't touch them. But I guess some of them were concerned, the way they explained it to me, sir, is that just getting to that will and getting to those acres, limited as they are, will cause an environmental mess. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SULLIVAN",
      "utterance": "No, I think that's completely false. As a matter of fact, before I was a U.S. senator, I was the commissioner of natural resources in Alaska. And we have the highest standards in the world. Even our exploration, we require companies to go out only in the winter on ice roads, ice pads. They melt after the winter season, zero impact on the tundra. And this is next to existing infrastructure. ANWR is right next to Thomson and Pump Station One on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline on state land. So, it makes sense from an environmental, responsible resource development standpoint, jobs, energy, security and national security, Neil. This is good for Alaska, good for the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Obviously, Alaskans, by and large, been polled on it, also in favor of it. They like the revenue that could be generated from this and the checks that Alaskans get as a result for doing this. Will it make a substantial difference in that regard?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SULLIVAN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. You know, the pipeline we have there, which is an incredible engineering feat, 40 years that pipeline has been pumping oil for America, but it's two-thirds empty. And we need to fill it up. The legislation splits the revenue between the state of the Alaska and federal government 50/50. So, both the state and the feds will benefit. But, again, we see this as very important not only for the state of Alaska, but for the country. And the president, to his credit, has made unleashing the American energy renaissance, what they -- what he calls energy dominance, which we can do as a nation, a top priority. And this is part of it. So, again, I want to applaud him and my members, my colleagues in the Senate and the House for passing this important legislation for Alaska and for the country."

And to the senator's point, it got to be included. For Alaskans, it could mean a lot more revenue, and it does touch on the small lands here. By the way, this measure to keep the government lights essentially passing in the House. It's anyone's guess what happens in the Senate. This is just a temporary measure to keep those government issues at bay until at least January 19. We will have more after this."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I hasten to add, that is not a gimme, and things can change.
