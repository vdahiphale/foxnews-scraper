      "sentences": "Welcome to this special edition of \"Hannity: Far-Left Overreach.\" I'm Jason Chaffetz, in tonight for Sean.  Tonight, we start on Capitol Hill where House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is about to ram through a $3 trillion liberal wishlist filled with proposals that are totally unrelated to COVID-19. The bill is so blatantly partisan and toxic that some Democrats are coming out against it.  Democratic Congresswoman Kendra Horn from Oklahoma wrote, quote: This is not the time for partisan gamesmanship.  Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger from Virginia tweeted: This bill stands far -- strays far beyond delivering relief or responding to an urgent crisis. And it has no chance of becoming law. She's right. This bill will die in the Senate. This is nothing more than a political stunt in the middle of a national crisis.  Joining us now live with the very latest detail is Chad Pergram -- Chad.",

      "sentences": "Good evening, Jason.  Well, they're in the middle of this vote right now. There are 12 nos on the board so the Democrats have a little bit of a cushion. They can lose up to 17.   This is the largest bill in U.S. history. There have been no hearings on this bill. It provides money for the Postal Service. There is food aid. There's direct payments that the Democrats wanted. The cost traumatized some Democrats. Now, think about some of these Democrats. You're moderate Democrats from battleground districts like Iowa, Cindy Axne, and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, opposed the bill. Some Democrats were concerned that Republicans would weaponize the bill against them. But it actually gives vulnerable Democrats like Axne and Spanberger a chance to vote no and show independence for the speaker of the House.   Now, the bill was written by Nancy Pelosi as a nod to her left flank, but it was actually liberals who wanted to delay the vote because of size and scope. Washington Democrat Pramila Jayapal was a \"no\". She said the measure didn't have enough money for minority-owned businesses and did not safeguard pensions. Now, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, he says he wants to hit the pause button on these big bills for coronavirus, but he has not ruled out doing another bill. And as you know, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, she is always in negotiation and from her perspective, this is the start of a negotiation. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, said that more money could boost the economy. Now, something else that happened just about an hour and a half ago, they have approved proxy voting in the House of Representatives, 217-189, that was a party line vote there. That means that on future votes, all members don't have to show up. They can essentially phone in their votes.  Now, I'm looking at my monitor here. The vote is still open. This bill is passing.   There are still 12 Democratic nos on the board, one Republican, this is expected to pass but it's going to be by a narrow margin. Jason, back to you.",

You know, you now signed on for San Francisco values and, by the way, what are you doing there? Why are you collecting a paycheck if you want Nancy Pelosi to be the one to vote for you and represent your district, and you are representing a swing state somewhere else? And so, this is going to be a tough vote for those people to explain. It's unconstitutional first of all, because a quorum under this -- just this resolution they passed, 20 people on the floor. 20 Democrats can constitute a quorum of the House of Representatives, 435 people. That goes against Article 1 of the Constitution, but they don't seem to care about any of that. They just want to consolidate power and spend money.

It extends unemployment in a way that will keep people out of work for almost another year.   I will add another one to that, it provides more money with local governments in the hundreds of billions and beyond what our local governments are even asking for.  So, Speaker Pelosi chose this hyper partisan path to nowhere rather than pursuing the alternative, which was working with President Trump, working with congressional Republicans and trying to negotiate a compromise. This is something to appease her left flank. Now, this is one, though, that turns off most of America, and she is going to end up with a bill that's dead on arrival in the Senate and not going anywhere.  It's a strategic failure on her part on multiple levels, on the process, on the substance.

They need to be legally allowed to go back to work. They need to be able to open up their shops.

Today, it's 51 percent of Democrats self identify as liberals. So, there's just hardly conservative or moderate Democrats left. So Biden is a modern day reflection of a party that is running to the far left. Now, putting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on this committee, a co-chair about climate? What type of terrible signal is that to put a socialist in charge of your climate committee and America's energy needs?  I mean, there is one thing about running to the left. There is another running off the cliff in the left. And that's an indication that he's heading that direction. It also just shows he's not strong enough to stand by his track record where he was previously known for some moderate votes. He's walked away from all of it.

While the Trump administration is doing everything, it can to get America reopened quickly and safely, some of the left appeared to be spreading fear about the push to reopen the country. Now that some governors have taken steps to loose and stay at home orders, the media is once again showing their liberal bias. For example, the governors of Georgia and Colorado have both taken similar steps to reopen their state. But Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican is getting singled out. \"The Atlantic\" accused him of experimenting with, quote, \"human sacrifice\". Despite the media's fearmongering, many Americans have had enough with the forced lockdown. Earlier today, hundreds of Pennsylvanians gathered around the state's capital to protest coronavirus restrictions put in place over two months ago by Democratic Governor Tom Wolfe. And don't forget the passionate rant against the lockdown by Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy that has gone viral. Elon Musk the owner of Tesla who stood up to the overbearing regulations in California praised Portnoy, saying he should run for office. Joining us now with reaction is author of \"Guilt by Accusation\", Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, and author of the \"Russia Hoax\", one of the best books on the topic, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us tonight. Gregg, I want to -- I want to start with you. You are actually in Georgia.

They are not taking shorthand and as you point out, these are not recordings. So, the 302s are never considered to be 100 percent accurate to start with.

      "utterance": "Good evening, Jason. Well, they're in the middle of this vote right now. There are 12 nos on the board so the Democrats have a little bit of a cushion. They can lose up to 17. This is the largest bill in U.S. history. There have been no hearings on this bill. It provides money for the Postal Service. There is food aid. There's direct payments that the Democrats wanted. The cost traumatized some Democrats. Now, think about some of these Democrats. You're moderate Democrats from battleground districts like Iowa, Cindy Axne, and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, opposed the bill. Some Democrats were concerned that Republicans would weaponize the bill against them. But it actually gives vulnerable Democrats like Axne and Spanberger a chance to vote no and show independence for the speaker of the House. Now, the bill was written by Nancy Pelosi as a nod to her left flank, but it was actually liberals who wanted to delay the vote because of size and scope. Washington Democrat Pramila Jayapal was a \"no\". She said the measure didn't have enough money for minority-owned businesses and did not safeguard pensions. Now, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, he says he wants to hit the pause button on these big bills for coronavirus, but he has not ruled out doing another bill. And as you know, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, she is always in negotiation and from her perspective, this is the start of a negotiation. The chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, said that more money could boost the economy. Now, something else that happened just about an hour and a half ago, they have approved proxy voting in the House of Representatives, 217-189, that was a party line vote there. That means that on future votes, all members don't have to show up. They can essentially phone in their votes. Now, I'm looking at my monitor here. The vote is still open. This bill is passing. There are still 12 Democratic nos on the board, one Republican, this is expected to pass but it's going to be by a narrow margin. Jason, back to you."

I've got to tell you, this does give Nancy Pelosi more power when she tells members of Congress -- you don't even need to show up anymore.

You just voted to give your voting card in Congress to Nancy Pelosi. And she doesn't represent the values of a lot of those districts. You know, you now signed on for San Francisco values and, by the way, what are you doing there? Why are you collecting a paycheck if you want Nancy Pelosi to be the one to vote for you and represent your district, and you are representing a swing state somewhere else? And so, this is going to be a tough vote for those people to explain. It's unconstitutional first of all, because a quorum under this -- just this resolution they passed, 20 people on the floor. 20 Democrats can constitute a quorum of the House of Representatives, 435 people. That goes against Article 1 of the Constitution, but they don't seem to care about any of that. They just want to consolidate power and spend money. I mean, a drunken sailor would be offended to be compared to them in with what they do but this bill -- money to illegals, taxpayer funding of abortion. This is crazy."

      "utterance": "Over 1,800 pages, $3 trillion. This isn't a bill that was drafted through partisanship, vetting, debates, compromise, none of that. It gives a stimulus checks to people who are illegally in the country, massive prison release. It legalizes throughout America ballot harvesting. It outlaws voter ID. It extends unemployment in a way that will keep people out of work for almost another year. I will add another one to that, it provides more money with local governments in the hundreds of billions and beyond what our local governments are even asking for. So, Speaker Pelosi chose this hyper partisan path to nowhere rather than pursuing the alternative, which was working with President Trump, working with congressional Republicans and trying to negotiate a compromise. This is something to appease her left flank. Now, this is one, though, that turns off most of America, and she is going to end up with a bill that's dead on arrival in the Senate and not going anywhere. It's a strategic failure on her part on multiple levels, on the process, on the substance. This is a waste of everyone's time and certainly a waste of a whole lot of tax dollars, especially all those liberal fantasy items -- totally unrelated to coronavirus response."

So, what I think what Republicans are saying, which is rational, is let's let all of the money -- we've already spent like drunken sailors because the government shut down American businesses. Let's that capitalize in the system. And, Jason, this is the critical point, which is more bridges and more stimulus is not what the American economy, nor its people need. They need to be legally allowed to go back to work. They need to be able to open up their shops. If you're a mom and pop, you should be able to be open just like the big box retailers are able to be open. We have these indiscriminate, silly rules out there by most blue state governors, and it needs to end. No business can survive if it can't make a product nor transact with customers.

How in the world to they go back to the American people and say, hey, we're the adults in the room, we're the ones that will work together to get things done, when they put this monstrosity in front of the Congress and then vote to say, hey, we don't even need to come back into session?"

Let's -- how in the world does piling $3 trillion in additional debt on hardworking Americans, how does that help them recover from this -- from this pandemic and recover from shutting down the economy?

I mean, why do members of Congress even get paid if they don't have to go to work? Postal workers go to work. Truckers are going to go to work. Health care workers go to work.

You know, there were about 24 members who couldn't make it out of 435. And so, to suggest that it's complicated to get here is just fallacy. So, why she did this, it's about a power grab and it certainly has nothing to do with health and safety, because as you mentioned, we have the front line workers back at home, in our hospitals, our grocery stores. Now, in Louisiana today, we just started opening up, so you can go into a restaurant today at 25 percent capacity. We can finally go back into places of worship. And yet, she's going to say that she doesn't want Congress to be meeting in Washington, debating bills. She just would rather just take your proxy vote and hold onto it so that she can vote for you. I'll tell you this and, of course, Jason, you would have never done this either -- Nancy Pelosi is not going to get my vote, she surely would not have gotten yours. But for any of those folks that voted for this bill today, how do they go back home and explain today they voted to allow Nancy Pelosi to vote for them so that they don't have to go to work anymore? Why don't they just resign their seat and send somebody up here who wants to come and fight for restoring the American dream up here in Washington?"

Like picking Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez to serve on his campaign's climate change panel. But tonight it could not be clearer with 171 days until Election Day, the Democratic Party finds itself in a state of dysfunction, division and all-out desperation. Joining me now for a reaction, FOX News contributor Ari Fleischer. Ari, I do appreciate you joining us tonight. I mean, you just -- I can be on the air every hour and probably give you a new Joe Biden blunder. But is that just prebaked into the electorate? Are they just going to accept that, hey, that's just the way he is, or at some point, does this actually catch up to him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "First of all, Jason, I think you've got to put into context, remember how exhausted he has to be from the travel he's doing. I do think you have to make an allowance for that. He's to go down for stairs to the basement, come upstairs from the basement. Travel can really wear you down when you are running for president. Look, I do think that it's baked in in a serious element where people kind of notice about Joe Biden. But the real question is, is something going on that is getting worse? This is where I regret the fact that the candidates are stuck home. It is only right for the American people to see these people in the thick of a campaign where they are mettle is tested. Let's see what Joe Biden has got. Let's see if this is just minor things and lots of people can get mixed up on words, gets statistics or numbers wrong. It does happen, but is this really a feature of Joe Biden that is getting worse or a one offset that we all have sometimes have? A campaign should test that. We want all our candidates to be seen and tested."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, it is. That's what I like about a campaign. It is vigorous. It is difficult and the camera is on you 24/7. It is grueling, but that's part of the way we kind of shake the tree and figure who the nuts are and you're right, walking in the basement, really not that much of a test. But one of the things I see Joe Biden continue to do is to do is lurch to the left. Normally, candidates when they wrap this up, they go to the center, but that's not what he's doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "No, he's not doing it because the Democratic Party stopped doing that a long time ago when it was going to the center. You know, I look at it up. There is a Gallup poll that showed in 1994 when Bill Clinton was president that only 25 percent of the Democrats self identify as liberals. Today, it's 51 percent of Democrats self identify as liberals. So, there's just hardly conservative or moderate Democrats left. So Biden is a modern day reflection of a party that is running to the far left. Now, putting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on this committee, a co-chair about climate? What type of terrible signal is that to put a socialist in charge of your climate committee and America's energy needs? I mean, there is one thing about running to the left. There is another running off the cliff in the left. And that's an indication that he's heading that direction. It also just shows he's not strong enough to stand by his track record where he was previously known for some moderate votes. He's walked away from all of it. What kind of strength, what kind of backbone you have when you change who you are, such a great degree so fast, including running toward AOC?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Now, the Senate is going to wrap up, or -- start to ramp up, I should say, some heavy-duty investigations. You have Attorney General Barr, and Durham doing their investigation. You have Lindsey Graham, Senator Johnson, Senator Grassley, very keen on getting to the bottom what happened with the whole Russia hoax. But that's going to come to play soon. How is Joe Biden going to handle that when he can't even admit he was part of unmasking Michael Flynn and it's in black-and-white?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "Well, you pointed out, Jason, one of the ways he's going to handle this is to shield him from having to handle it because the press won't go there. Even when you have a long-hour interview, as Lawrence McDonnell on MSNBC did, he didn't even ask him a question until the very end and then he let it go. No follow-up, no tough questions about it. Why do you need to unmask General Flynn? What were you told? What did Barack Obama say and what did you say to Barack Obama? None of that is being presented to Joe Biden in any way if there is pressure on him. So will conservative outlets be able to ask those questions when he is out on the stump? May be but they protect him then too. The staff will shield him, and this is what's so sad about the media breakdown today. These are legitimate, good, fair questions and who is asking them to Joe Biden?"

I've got to tell you, eight and a half years in Congress, it's one of my biggest disappointments that some of the icons in the national so-called mainstream media were not inquisitors. They did not call balls and strikes. They had an agenda and it was clear to me at the end of that. I know you are right in the thick of that as well. Ari, thank you so much for joining us tonight.

Now that some governors have taken steps to loose and stay at home orders, the media is once again showing their liberal bias. For example, the governors of Georgia and Colorado have both taken similar steps to reopen their state. But Brian Kemp of Georgia, a Republican is getting singled out. \"The Atlantic\" accused him of experimenting with, quote, \"human sacrifice\". Despite the media's fearmongering, many Americans have had enough with the forced lockdown. Earlier today, hundreds of Pennsylvanians gathered around the state's capital to protest coronavirus restrictions put in place over two months ago by Democratic Governor Tom Wolfe. And don't forget the passionate rant against the lockdown by Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy that has gone viral. Elon Musk the owner of Tesla who stood up to the overbearing regulations in California praised Portnoy, saying he should run for office. Joining us now with reaction is author of \"Guilt by Accusation\", Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, and author of the \"Russia Hoax\", one of the best books on the topic, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us tonight. Gregg, I want to -- I want to start with you. You are actually in Georgia. One of the things that bothers me is the way they treated Brian Kemp, the governor who took one of the first steps out there, compared to Jared Polis, a liberal Democrat who's the governor of Colorado, because they really did do similar things."

      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Yes, because -- excuse me, here in Georgia, I've been following it very closely. In a desperate treatment, Jason, is really quite striking. Governor Kemp, a Republican, has been bludgeoned daily by the mainstream media, mostly the national media. You are right, \"The Atlantic\" accusing him of human sacrifice and \"The National Journal\" three weeks ago wrote: Mark this day three weeks from now, there will be blood on Kemp's hands. And, of course, the opposite has actually occurred. The total number of cases declined by 12 percent and juxtapose that with the treatment of Jared Polis, the Colorado Democratic governor, nary a word of criticism by the media. So, you know, the lesson is really twofold. Number one, the media is perpetuately wrong, and number two, they're hopelessly and profoundly biased and thus the moniker \"fake news\", which is richly deserved."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "How do you read this? Because it doesn't seem, at least as conservative when I see Brian Kemp on this topic and it doesn't seem the same went Jared Polis was actually a friend of mine but he's about as liberal as you get out there in Colorado, they don't treat him anywhere close to being the same."

That's what we should be doing, getting a virus, giving it as quickly as possible, using all the resources. I don't care if it's Pelosi who does it, or Trump who does it. I refuse to be partisan when it comes to fighting this horrible coronavirus. I don't think we should be partisan. We're all in this together. It is a reflection of how bad things have become in this country that even the virus becomes a divisive issue based on partisanism. Again, you know, I was in Israel when this broke out. I was with my friend Benjamin Netanyahu on the two nights before election when he closed down their country. He got universal support when he closed down the country, near universal support. Now, he's opening up and he's getting support, not on partisan grounds. People still vote against him, but the issue of the disease has become partisan. I think that is true in most of the European countries. But in America, everything is partisan. Everything is who's side are you on. It's a tragic reality what's happening in America. We have to get together and fight this virus. It doesn't attack Democrats or Republicans, liberals or conservatives separately."

And remember, as Trey Gowdy pointed out, leaking Flynn's unmasked name to the media is a felony punishable up to ten years in prison. Joining is now correction the author of \"Revolution: Trump, Washington and We the People\", former U.S. deputy national security adviser, KT McFarland, and Michael Best Law president and former White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus. Thank you for being here. And, KT, I want to start with you first -- 302 is what is developed by the FBI. They don't report interviews, but they will take and make notes for the record and it's called a 302s. It's supposed to be done within five days of an interview. But the president points out and there hasn't been enough attention, where is this 302 that they did on Michael Flynn?"

      "speaker": "KT MCFARLAND, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Yes. This is got to be one of the most important set of notes taken by the FBI in decades. The fact that it is mysteriously missing is really just completely unbelievable. What a 302 this happen in my case as well is that the two FBI agent sit down, one of them is a note-taker, the more junior, and one of them more senior, one starts out asking the questions. Between the two of them, they take notes but the junior takes the note. They leaved and then the two agents are supposed to get together, go back and forth with each other and then make a, you know, as best they can record. So the problem with the 302 to start with because what if done inaccurately, what if they've taken things a little bit out of context? They are not taking shorthand and as you point out, these are not recordings. So, the 302s are never considered to be 100 percent accurate to start with. And the fact that these were edited -- General Flynn's were edited so many times and now the originals are just mysteriously gone, it just doesn't pass the smell test."

      "speaker": "REINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF",
      "utterance": "Well, I started -- thanks, Jason. I started telling Sean Hannity part of the story on Monday when the first \"New York Times\" story hit that said they were constant Russian contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. McCabe came into my office in the doorway shut. He told me that the story was B.S., was inaccurate. And I said, what can you do about it? I called -- he told me to call them back in two hours, I did that, there was nothing that I could do, but later in the afternoon, Jim Comey gave me a call and I said to him, what are we going to be able to do about this? McCabe came here. He said no, there's nothing that can be done about it. And he specifically told me that I could say that \"The New York Times\" story was inaccurate, overstated and wrong. That was in February of 2017 that the story was wrong. So I said, I can say this on television and I have been informed this story is inaccurate and wrong? The answer, yes. I mean, I was very careful. I'm not going to -- I was careful to a fault in fact. So I'm not going to go on TV and say something like that if I wasn't given authority to do that. So, I went on television. I went on \"FOX News Sunday\" and other shows and I told anyone who would listen that I have been informed by the intelligence community that story about constant Russian contacts and the Trump was wrong. And in fact, of course, it didn't matter because we spent the next two years fighting the same kinds of people that publicly were saying the story was true, but then privately, telling everybody that it was wrong, and obviously, it's been going on for years."

      "utterance": "A diversion? The Democrats are pulling even further left than we thought. Now apologizing for the communist party of China and downplaying their involvement in the spread of the coronavirus. But Republican lawmakers understand the threat all too well. According to an outlet run by the communist party, China is now considering punitive measures against Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt who filed a lawsuit against China for the damage caused to his state. Let's face it, the Chinese government cannot be trusted. According to \"The New York Post\", China isn't just fudging their death toll numbers by a little bit, try by over half a million. Joining me now with reaction, author of the \"The Coming Collapse of China\", Gordon Chang, and Chinese strategy director at the Hudson Institute, Michael Pillsbury. Gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us tonight. Michael, I want to start with you. Nancy Pelosi says, you know, this is just a diversion. Isn't this core to one of the big problems that's happening in the world right now?"

      "speaker": "MICHAEL PILLSBURY, HUDSON INSTITUTE CHINESE STRATEGY DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, and also China says the same thing. The Chinese and the Democrats in Congress have pretty much taken the same line over the past months but there is nothing to investigate and China. Both China and the Democrats have accused President Trump of botching the recovery. They have almost daily stories and their newspapers on the front page about how much Mr. Trump is not doing well and not doing the right thing. Today, Jason, they had a huge photo in color, Richard Bright, the whistle-blower, and said he is basically correct. So we have this strange enlightenment of the Democrats in Congress with the communist party in China. I can't explain it."

They also mentioned Senator Tom Cotton and Senator Josh Hawley. How big of a threat is this to the three Americans who are in elected office? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": I think what the communist party is worried about is that an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus are going to show the malign actions of Beijing. That Beijing took action that it knew would inevitably lead to the discredit of coronavirus me on China's borders. Now, you have Senator Cotton, Senator Hawley and a number of political figures who have been pressing China and not giving up. And that really is the important thing here because we need to get to the bottom of this because, you know, China says that we need to cooperate with him, but how can you cooperate with someone who has deliberately killed 87,000 Americans? Just -- to me, we have to answer that core question."

We have only got a few seconds left here. But to the core of the question that was asked at the beginning, Michael, why are the Democrats so hesitant to actually join Republicans and join America in the concern about what China was involved with the virus?"

If they admit that President Trump was right back in 2016 campaign, that China has been taking advantage of us and it is time to stop that behavior, they are essentially surrendering to President Trump's successful dealing with China. And it will look bad in the polls. They will probably lose the House and President Trump will stay in the White House. There's a lot at stake in this."
