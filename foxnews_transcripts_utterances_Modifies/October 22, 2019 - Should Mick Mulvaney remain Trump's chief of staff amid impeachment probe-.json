      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. Closed doors, coordinated leaks, and career bureaucrats. Well, can Americans trust this impeachment process as it's currently unfolding? House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Former Independent Counsel Ken Starr, and Former Acting AG Matt Whitaker are here with important insight. You do not want to miss it. Also tonight, how will Vice President Mike Pence figure into all of this? He is here exclusively tonight to tell us about that, and the recent ceasefire deal in Turkey, will it hold?  Plus, Bill Barr appointed prosecutor John Durham, and he zeroes in now on four key players behind the collusion smear. Former Governor Mike Huckabee and former FBI senior official Chris Swecker react.  But first, over the past few nights, we've been laying out the coordinated effort by a cabal of diplomatic and intel bureaucrats to upend the Presidency of Donald Trump.  Now, when the President called them out for their catastrophic failures of process and policy, they were offended. When he demanded that NATO countries start free writing on the U.S. taxpayers, they were horrified. And when he began making good on his promise to bring home our troops, they were shocked. And when the deep state's insurance policy and Russia collusion narrative imploded, they decided to bring in reinforcements. And of course, they found them in the House where Democrats are furiously trying to construct an abuse-of-power article of impeachment.  I have a question. If Trump is so obviously off the rails, why not hold their fake impeachment inquiry out in the open? Sunlight is, after all, the best political disinfectant. Well, easy answer. The closed-door shuffle allows Democrats to preset the theme of each witness, spin the secret testimony, cherry-pick then leak the phrases most favorable to their impeachment narrative. Acting Ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, a never-Trumper himself, had his turn in the star chamber today.",

      "sentences": "That's from Max Headroom. And it gets better. They don't just publish articles with completely anonymous sources. Last year, remember \"The New York Times\" published an entire op-ed written by an anonymous, supposedly a senior Trump official, who even claimed to be himself part of the resistance - patriotic resistance.  Well, of course, Mr. or Ms. Courageous also shopped a book deal. It drops next month. According to the publisher, the author sees this as an act of conscience and of duty. What a crock! Every anti-Trump or tattler is depicted as a selfless saint in the media. This all - it all smacks of desperation to me. The left's hatred for this President has been well documented. But what they are now openly signaling is that they don't like you, the American voter, either. They don't trust you to deliver a result that they want. So they will try to remove this entire process from your hands altogether.  The President won election nearly three years ago as an outsider. And I was thinking about this. And I think, today, ironically, he's still kind of an outsider. What do I mean? I mean that the bipartisan establishment, they never accepted him as legitimate.   Now, this despite his stellar economic record, record number of judges confirmed, and the leadership he's shown against the China threat. He's still a disrupter. He's still the ultimate Rorschach test for the old guard. The better America does under Trump, the more negatively they think that reflects on the so-called experts, who for decades squandered American prosperity for a globalist fantasy. So if they can impeach Trump even on a bogus narrative teased out in secret, the permanent resistance can say \"See, I told you so\" and feel vindicated. This is their revenge. Yet, as usual, they underestimate the common sense of the American people who may just have their own revenge against the globalist impeachment mob on November 2nd, 2020. Joining me now is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.  Congressman, how can Democrats run an impeachment inquiry like we're seeing unfold day-after-day?",

Former Governor Mike Huckabee and former FBI senior official Chris Swecker react. But first, over the past few nights, we've been laying out the coordinated effort by a cabal of diplomatic and intel bureaucrats to upend the Presidency of Donald Trump. Now, when the President called them out for their catastrophic failures of process and policy, they were offended. When he demanded that NATO countries start free writing on the U.S. taxpayers, they were horrified. And when he began making good on his promise to bring home our troops, they were shocked. And when the deep state's insurance policy and Russia collusion narrative imploded, they decided to bring in reinforcements. And of course, they found them in the House where Democrats are furiously trying to construct an abuse-of-power article of impeachment. I have a question. If Trump is so obviously off the rails, why not hold their fake impeachment inquiry out in the open? Sunlight is, after all, the best political disinfectant. Well, easy answer.

Well, of course, Mr. or Ms. Courageous also shopped a book deal. It drops next month. According to the publisher, the author sees this as an act of conscience and of duty. What a crock! Every anti-Trump or tattler is depicted as a selfless saint in the media. This all - it all smacks of desperation to me. The left's hatred for this President has been well documented. But what they are now openly signaling is that they don't like you, the American voter, either. They don't trust you to deliver a result that they want. So they will try to remove this entire process from your hands altogether. The President won election nearly three years ago as an outsider. And I was thinking about this. And I think, today, ironically, he's still kind of an outsider. What do I mean? I mean that the bipartisan establishment, they never accepted him as legitimate. Now, this despite his stellar economic record, record number of judges confirmed, and the leadership he's shown against the China threat. He's still a disrupter. He's still the ultimate Rorschach test for the old guard. The better America does under Trump, the more negatively they think that reflects on the so-called experts, who for decades squandered American prosperity for a globalist fantasy. So if they can impeach Trump even on a bogus narrative teased out in secret, the permanent resistance can say \"See, I told you so\" and feel vindicated. This is their revenge. Yet, as usual, they underestimate the common sense of the American people who may just have their own revenge against the globalist impeachment mob on November 2nd, 2020.

It was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel that had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.\" Now, did Taylor actually advance the Democrats' case that Trump's conduct was impeachable with that? KEN STARR, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL & CONTRIBUTOR: No, absolutely not. We're still not - first of all, we are in the context of the President's conduct of foreign relations. You're right, He's a disrupter and he chooses to use a different avenue. Is that wise or not? Hey, that's a policy squabble. But I simply don't think we're in impeachment land at all, and I would just add to your observations about the whole process. Speaker Pelosi needs to call for the vote, now more than ever, especially since we're hearing from the Senate side that the process is being viewed on the Senate side is illegitimate.

The American people can read the transcript of the phone call the president had with President Zelensky, and they will see there was no quid pro quo. And with regard to Ukraine, we were standing strong with Ukraine against Russian aggression where the last administration was only sending them blankets. We are sending resources, we're sending missiles. We're going to make it possible for our ally in Ukraine to be able to defend themselves and restore peace."

A source is also telling FOX News today if the rumors are true and findings in Durham's review will blast the conduct of the FBI's Russia investigation, it will justify Trump's warnings about the deep state acting to hobble his presidency. Jenny me now Governor Mike Huckabee, former 2016 presidential candidate and FOX News contributor, and Chris Swecker, former FBI assistant director.

I think John Durham and a very capable investigator Jack Eckenrode, former FBI investigator Jack Eckenrode, and Bill Barr are getting to the bottom of some things that we absolutely need to get to the bottom of."

And if anybody in the entire world knows something about using the power of government for political purposes, it's John Brennan. And I think that he ought to be very, very concerned, because it's increasingly apparent that there were many officials in the Obama administration, both in the White House as well as in the DOJ and FBI, that used their power -- and the CIA -- to first of all, try to make sure Donald Trump didn't get elected, and when he did, try to make sure that he didn't last the full four years, that he couldn't go the distance. I think the significant thing about John Durham leading this investigation is that he doesn't live in D.C. He's not in a bubble. He doesn't care if he gets invited to some Georgetown cocktail party. He's after the truth, he's after the facts, and that's what we all need and that's what we all deserve, nothing less than that."

There is a legal amount of information that rises to the threshold where you can open an investigation, a criminal investigation, or an intelligence investigation. It's not generally assisted by the CIA. The CIA are information gatherers, they're spies. The FBI are spy catchers. So usually there's not a lot of synergism between those two agencies where the CIA is actually trying to gin up predication for a criminal investigation. And I use the word \"gin up\" because I think that's the big issue here, did they artificially create predication to get into, open a criminal investigation into a presidential campaign and the president himself."

The people have their say, and yet there is a cabal inside the intel community, inside the diplomatic corps, obviously the media and a number on Capitol Hill, who don't find this to be legitimate. And they are the same people, governor, who talk about disenfranchising American voters, and they're always talking about voter suppression and so forth. I think this is one of the most catastrophic and obvious instances of an attempt to disenfranchise voters. From the beginning of Russia all the way to what we are seeing right now, and I find it appalling."

Not even one voter should ever lose his or her right to vote in the country who has a legal right to vote. But here, we have people within our government that we are paying their salaries, and it would appear that they worked hard to disenfranchise the very millions of people who elected the president. I think it's significant that Senator Chuck Grassley made the comment that he felt like that there was something about the report of the I.G., the reason it's taking so long to get was because it may be deep sixed by the deep state. Chuck Grassley, one of the most honorable, decent men in the U.S. Senate, has been there a long time, a good man, he is not given to hyperbole. He is not given to being excitable. He is not one who is typically is a person wrapped up in conspiracy theories. For him to say that was very, very telling."

She has been reportedly telling people in private that she would enter the primary if she thought she could win. And the \"Washington Post\" Bob Costa goes a step further, saying moments ago that Clinton has not ruled out jumping in. Joining me now, Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author and filmmaker, author of the book \"Death of the Nation,\" now out in paperback.

All her public statements have an element of kookiness to them, even her statement where she goes this time I think I could beat Trump again. Again? You beat him the last time, really? Why aren't you in the Oval Office? This would be like the boxer George Foreman after the Ali fight in Zaire, a fight in which he was knocked out, saying hey, listen, I won that fight because I threw more punches. That's not the rules of the game, sorry. So Hillary has I think been showing a kind of paranoid streak, and this latest Tulsi Gabbard is further reflection of that."

But this is a dream for Trump. They are, Dinesh, they are not wild about this Democrat field. Socialism isn't selling in this economy, the Trump hype of impeachment, I think people are already tiring of that. It seems like beyond an overreach. And so what are they left with? Elizabeth Warren, really? OK."

Ironically, there is somebody in the field, Gabbard herself, who would actually be a strong candidate, in my view, against Trump. Why? Because she's a veteran. She doesn't hesitate to say that she loves America. Bu precisely the things that would make her appealing to voters in the center are the things that make her unappealing within the Democratic Party, so I'm feeling actually really good because she has a virtually zero chance of getting the nomination."

Lynching in fact was not confined to African-Americans. Whites were the targets, too. But white Republicans, particularly white northern Republicans who were registering black voters in the south, these were the actual targets of lynching. So if you are the Democrats, the party of lynching now pretending like lynching is some kind of thing that they didn't do, it's a stain on the nation's history.
