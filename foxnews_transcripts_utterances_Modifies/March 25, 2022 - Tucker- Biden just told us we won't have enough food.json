      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. In retrospect, Joe Biden's first-term policy agenda seems very optimistic, almost comically optimistic. Shortly before his inauguration, Biden announced something he called the Build Back Better agenda. Of course, we mocked it at the time, but looking back, it was in some ways a hopeful document. America must have been a very rich country back then. And by \"back then\" we mean last year. There weren't a lot of essentials in Biden's agenda. The first three things that any normal nation needs and thinks about obsessively are food, water and energy. That's the standard. In China, for example, every government policy, foreign and domestic, is designed above all to secure adequate reserves of food, water, and energy and that makes sense. The Build Back Better agenda was the opposite of that. It did not suggest any concern at all about whether Americans might have enough to eat or could afford enough heating fuel to keep from freezing to death over the winter. Biden's agenda was focused on the kind of added extras you get to when you fixed everything else and then still have trillions left over. Build Back Better promised us something called \"environmental equity,\" whatever that is. It demanded amnesty for millions of illegal aliens because, at the time, the American economy seemed robust enough to share with the entire world. Universal healthcare for Honduras. Biden called for free solar panels for everybody and taxpayer funded pre-K for all American parents and so on and on. Build Back Better was the neoliberal version of flying cars. It was a dreamy Christmas list of luxuries that, for a moment in time, seemed almost within reach. A lot has changed. Nobody is talking about flying cars anymore. Here is Joe Biden from yesterday:",

As Joe Biden explained, you're paying more for gas because we have slapped sanctions on Russia and sanctioning Russia is the right thing to do. So, shut up and feel virtuous as you slowly go broke. Now, for some people, particularly those who don't drive cars, this might seem like an adequate answer, but others in good faith may ask, \"Okay, I'm not against sanctions in theory, but since they're clearly not hurting Putin and they clearly are now hurting my family, what is the point of sanctions? Is there a point? Let me know. Make me feel better.\" The answer is, \"Yes, America. There's a point to sanctions. Sanctions are designed to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine.\" We know that because not so long ago, Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, told CNN that, quote: \"The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war,\" and then Jen Psaki, the President's publicist, backed him up. Quote: \"Our intention is to have a deterrent effect with sanctions.\" Kamala Harris agreed. The difference, she said, \"The deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one.\" So, sanctions work, except they didn't actually work. Putin invaded Ukraine anyway. The sanctions failed. So, what's the response? Admit they failed, try something new? No. Joe Biden is pretending that the administration never claimed sanctions would deter Russia from invading Ukraine. Here's the new line.",

      "sentences": "What does that even mean? \"Sanctions never deter. Why do you keep saying that?\" He said. Well, because you kept saying that. Your White House Press Secretary, your Vice President, your Secretary of State all said that verbatim, but they're not acknowledging that hoping that our memories have been so damaged by the iPhone, we'll be as forgetful as Joe Biden himself. Now they want us to believe that sanctioning Russia can force Putin into withdrawing from Ukraine. Is that true? Can Putin be sanctioned into retreat? Well, we certainly hope it's true, sincerely, but there's no evidence that it is true. There's not even really an expectation that it's true. Even Joe Biden didn't claim that was going to happen. So, what is the point? We're not sure. That's a topic for another show, but in the meantime, this country, we know this for sure, is being badly hurt by those sanctions. As Reuters recently reported, quote: \"Western sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea, and other soil nutrients, have disrupted shipments of those key inputs around the globe. Fertilizer is key to keeping corn, soy, rice, and wheat yields high. Growers are scrambling to adjust.\" Are you following this? Those ingredients are necessary to put food on your table, at a price you can afford. If you don't have those ingredients, what do you get? Food shortages, which are a direct result of policy from the White House, a policy whose intended effect is still not clear. What is the point of this? If there's a good point, people will put up with it. Why don't you tell us what that point is? Fertilizer bills are expected to jump around 15 percent just this year, and they could go higher. Some farmers say they are already seeing fertilizer prices go much higher than that. Watch.

It's scary. But it's not just sanctions. There are a lot of reasons. It's not just the war in Ukraine. In response to energy and food shortages, the Biden administration is shutting down domestic oil and gas production. That makes food more expensive. It makes everything else more expensive. And as the pressure on American farmers rises and as food becomes scarcer and more expensive in this country, that same administration is allowing the government of China to buy up this country's farmland. According to POLITICO, and this was two years ago, Chinese investors own nearly 200,000 acres of U.S. Ag land, valued at least two billion. Now they're doing this, in part, with the help of subsidies paid for by U.S. taxpayers, and Chinese investors are continuing to buy more every single year. Again, food, water, energy. That's what you need for a country. The Chinese understand that. As Congressman Dan Newhouse put it, quote: \"The current trend in the United States is leading us toward the creation of a Chinese-owned agricultural land monopoly.\" In our country, the most productive farmland in the world now owned by what we used to call our main global rival and I think we can now say with a realignment in progress is our main global enemy, owned by a country that seeks to displace us and punish us. It's insane. Would the Chinese government permit American investors to buy its country's farmland or water resources? That's not even a real question. Of course, not. No sane country would do that, and no foreign entity should be allowed to control America's critical natural resources. So, how long until the Chinese start scooping up the Great Lakes, which are our largest reservoirs of fresh water? Food, water, energy. Don't laugh. That's where we're headed, and it could happen much sooner than anyone seems to realize. Fishing companies are paying such high costs, they're running out of business. Here's another Fox multimedia report.

The oceans themselves are being depleted of fish, entire species by the Chinese government. You hear a lot about the environment and saving the planet, by which they mean don't drive an SUV. But the actual planet, its actual resources, its oceans, the most important resource the planet has. It's not about climate. It's about the oceans and increasingly, they're polluted and bereft of fish and China is doing that. We're not and no one saying a word about it. So, instead of addressing any of these problems, our leaders are responding in the one way they know how.

What he doesn't say is the California has the highest gas prices in America, because it says the highest gas taxes in America, it is seven bucks a gallon in Los Angeles, seven bucks. He did that. But instead of fixing it, he is making you more dependent, and this is a trend. For the second time in two years, politicians are sending out welfare checks to compensate for economic crises that they caused.

Well, we are importing it because we are buying it from countries that don't follow the paradigm, the framework for our good labor practices. And frankly, we could even be paying our workers more.

And these people don't care. Look at Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is about to be nominated to the Supreme Court. She's easy on child pornography. Do you think that is an accident, Tucker?

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. In retrospect, Joe Biden's first-term policy agenda seems very optimistic, almost comically optimistic. Shortly before his inauguration, Biden announced something he called the Build Back Better agenda. Of course, we mocked it at the time, but looking back, it was in some ways a hopeful document. America must have been a very rich country back then. And by \"back then\" we mean last year. There weren't a lot of essentials in Biden's agenda. The first three things that any normal nation needs and thinks about obsessively are food, water and energy. That's the standard. In China, for example, every government policy, foreign and domestic, is designed above all to secure adequate reserves of food, water, and energy and that makes sense. The Build Back Better agenda was the opposite of that. It did not suggest any concern at all about whether Americans might have enough to eat or could afford enough heating fuel to keep from freezing to death over the winter. Biden's agenda was focused on the kind of added extras you get to when you fixed everything else and then still have trillions left over. Build Back Better promised us something called \"environmental equity,\" whatever that is. It demanded amnesty for millions of illegal aliens because, at the time, the American economy seemed robust enough to share with the entire world. Universal healthcare for Honduras. Biden called for free solar panels for everybody and taxpayer funded pre-K for all American parents and so on and on. Build Back Better was the neoliberal version of flying cars. It was a dreamy Christmas list of luxuries that, for a moment in time, seemed almost within reach."

It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well and because both Russia and Ukraine have been the breadbasket of Europe in terms of wheat, for example, just to give you one example."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Food shortages, Biden said, quote, \"They're going to be real.\" Once again, in case you missed it, to repeat: food shortages -- not in Sudan -- in Cincinnati, Reno, Spokane, and Norfolk and of course, in our big cities too where not a single person who was born here has any idea what a food shortage is. Our problem has always been having too much food. Now we won't have enough. We know that because the president of the United States just told us that on camera. So, what is this going to mean? How do food shortages affect the country? Well, if you're interested, go online and read about it. All of recorded history will answer your question. A food shortage is not like deciding to skip dessert. It's not a diet. It's not voluntary. A food shortage is different. It's scary. Food shortages topple governments. They turn moderates into revolutionaries. A food shortage is a big deal. You don't want one, but now we're getting one, just a little over a year into Joe Biden's presidency. Think forward. If the traditional calendar holds, we've got 1,032 days left of the Joe Biden administration, and you wonder what things will look like by then. We're already speeding toward dystopia, not the White House seems aware of it or to care in any way. Here's Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen from this morning, for example, letting you know it's time to stop whining about gas prices because actually, they're not very high."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's not a big deal. Settle down and there's a reason for it. As Joe Biden explained, you're paying more for gas because we have slapped sanctions on Russia and sanctioning Russia is the right thing to do. So, shut up and feel virtuous as you slowly go broke. Now, for some people, particularly those who don't drive cars, this might seem like an adequate answer, but others in good faith may ask, \"Okay, I'm not against sanctions in theory, but since they're clearly not hurting Putin and they clearly are now hurting my family, what is the point of sanctions? Is there a point? Let me know. Make me feel better.\" The answer is, \"Yes, America. There's a point to sanctions. Sanctions are designed to prevent Russia from invading Ukraine.\" We know that because not so long ago, Tony Blinken, the Secretary of State, told CNN that, quote: \"The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war,\" and then Jen Psaki, the President's publicist, backed him up. Quote: \"Our intention is to have a deterrent effect with sanctions.\" Kamala Harris agreed. The difference, she said, \"The deterrence effect of these sanctions is still a meaningful one.\" So, sanctions work, except they didn't actually work. Putin invaded Ukraine anyway. The sanctions failed. So, what's the response? Admit they failed, try something new? No. Joe Biden is pretending that the administration never claimed sanctions would deter Russia from invading Ukraine. Here's the new line."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIDEN",
      "utterance": "Let's get something straight. Do you remember, if you covered me from the very beginning, I did not say that, in fact, the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that. Sanctions never deter. The maintenance of sanctions -- the maintenance of sanctions, the increasing the pain and the demonstration, why I asked for this NATO meeting today is to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we're doing not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year. That's what will stop him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "What does that even mean? \"Sanctions never deter. Why do you keep saying that?\" He said. Well, because you kept saying that. Your White House Press Secretary, your Vice President, your Secretary of State all said that verbatim, but they're not acknowledging that hoping that our memories have been so damaged by the iPhone, we'll be as forgetful as Joe Biden himself. Now they want us to believe that sanctioning Russia can force Putin into withdrawing from Ukraine. Is that true? Can Putin be sanctioned into retreat? Well, we certainly hope it's true, sincerely, but there's no evidence that it is true. There's not even really an expectation that it's true. Even Joe Biden didn't claim that was going to happen. So, what is the point? We're not sure. That's a topic for another show, but in the meantime, this country, we know this for sure, is being badly hurt by those sanctions. As Reuters recently reported, quote: \"Western sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea, and other soil nutrients, have disrupted shipments of those key inputs around the globe. Fertilizer is key to keeping corn, soy, rice, and wheat yields high. Growers are scrambling to adjust.\" Are you following this? Those ingredients are necessary to put food on your table, at a price you can afford. If you don't have those ingredients, what do you get? Food shortages, which are a direct result of policy from the White House, a policy whose intended effect is still not clear. What is the point of this? If there's a good point, people will put up with it. Why don't you tell us what that point is? Fertilizer bills are expected to jump around 15 percent just this year, and they could go higher. Some farmers say they are already seeing fertilizer prices go much higher than that. Watch."

It's scary. But it's not just sanctions. There are a lot of reasons. It's not just the war in Ukraine. In response to energy and food shortages, the Biden administration is shutting down domestic oil and gas production. That makes food more expensive. It makes everything else more expensive. And as the pressure on American farmers rises and as food becomes scarcer and more expensive in this country, that same administration is allowing the government of China to buy up this country's farmland. According to POLITICO, and this was two years ago, Chinese investors own nearly 200,000 acres of U.S. Ag land, valued at least two billion. Now they're doing this, in part, with the help of subsidies paid for by U.S. taxpayers, and Chinese investors are continuing to buy more every single year. Again, food, water, energy. That's what you need for a country. The Chinese understand that."

It's insane. Would the Chinese government permit American investors to buy its country's farmland or water resources? That's not even a real question. Of course, not. No sane country would do that, and no foreign entity should be allowed to control America's critical natural resources. So, how long until the Chinese start scooping up the Great Lakes, which are our largest reservoirs of fresh water? Food, water, energy. Don't laugh. That's where we're headed, and it could happen much sooner than anyone seems to realize. Fishing companies are paying such high costs, they're running out of business.

The oceans themselves are being depleted of fish, entire species by the Chinese government. You hear a lot about the environment and saving the planet, by which they mean don't drive an SUV. But the actual planet, its actual resources, its oceans, the most important resource the planet has. It's not about climate. It's about the oceans and increasingly, they're polluted and bereft of fish and China is doing that. We're not and no one saying a word about it. So, instead of addressing any of these problems, our leaders are responding in the one way they know how. They're throwing more money at the problem and in the process devaluing the U.S. dollar that we're going to desperately need to stay solvent. California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, just announced he's about to give his residents another free credit card."

So we're going to give you a tax refund, whether or not you pay taxes, it is welfare and that's going to solve the problem. What he doesn't say is the California has the highest gas prices in America, because it says the highest gas taxes in America, it is seven bucks a gallon in Los Angeles, seven bucks. He did that. But instead of fixing it, he is making you more dependent, and this is a trend. For the second time in two years, politicians are sending out welfare checks to compensate for economic crises that they caused. So if you wanted to increase inflation, if you wanted to make the population weak and dependent upon you, this is what you'd probably do. Free bread, next.

And the same thing happens with labor when it comes to food, right? Why are we importing all of our food? Well, we are importing it because we are buying it from countries that don't follow the paradigm, the framework for our good labor practices. And frankly, we could even be paying our workers more. So we buy it from countries where they actually have slave labor, and then it puts it on our plate cheaper and we are supporting those horrible practices instead of just looking at the United States as an opportunity to domesticate our own supply chain."

So there is now an American imposed media blackout in Poland, that country shares a border with Ukraine. Journalists are not allowed to ask what exactly is going on there. Thousands of U.S. troops have just been deployed to Poland. Now officially, the Biden administration said that U.S. troops have no plans to enter Ukraine. But today, Joe Biden found himself in Poland, and as the cameras rolled, he told the U.S. troops that they can expect to be inside Ukraine's borders soon.

Most Americans support Ukraine, most Americans do not support a Hot War with Russia, with American troops putting their lives on the line.

He is a citizen, but they were not that interested. So he decided on a new approach. Alex Stein adopted the alter ego, Primetime Number 99, Alex Stein. He became a lot more valuable, and in the process showed us how unhinged our own leaders have become. Here for example is Alex Stein at a recent meeting of the Dallas City Council explaining why mandatory vaccinations are essential."

      "utterance": "Tucker, man, it's such a pleasure. But let me tell you something, because we're under constant trauma based mind control from the media. So what I did is I said I'm not going to just lay down and let them control my life. So I said, I'm going to go start talking to these politicians. And I was dead serious at first. And they disregarded me. When I said I didn't really think the lockdowns were affected, they didn't pay attention. So the crazier I got, I realized that's how you invoke a response. These people are what I call non playable characters in the video game of life. They don't want to interact with us. When they get elected, they think all of a sudden, we work for them and that is not the case. So what I'm trying to do is I'm just trying to put a mirror up to the mainstream media and show what the narrative is and how idiotic it is because everything I say, is just regurgitated from Brian Stelter, Don Lemon, and some idiot at CNN. So it's really actually pretty easy doing what I do, Tucker."

      "utterance": "Well, it's actually -- it is when you turn on CNN, every single second, you're going to see a death scroll. They're going to try to scare you, because that's how they control you. They want to keep us in what is called fight or flight. They want everybody scared out of their mind so they can't make a decision. They don't only want us to see one inch in front of our face. So we can't see the big picture because what happens is, we have what is called the mockingbird media. They admit the C.I.A. has liaisons in every single form of our entertainment from the radio, television, news, and film. So you have a media that will say Hunter Biden's laptop is fake, yet they have to come out six months later and say, oh, no, that's real and they are going to give us the crack pipe all day long, yet on that same laptop, there is supposedly child pornography on it. And these people don't care. Look at Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is about to be nominated to the Supreme Court. She's easy on child pornography. Do you think that is an accident, Tucker? None of this is done on accident. It is a purposeful destabilization of the middle class, and that's what I am. I'm a middle class person trying to save it. And I'm not here to virtue signal. I'm just saying I'm tired of being tinkled on and the government telling me it's raining."

    {
      "speaker": "STEIN",

So people are nervous. So what I tried to do is, I try to put the heat on them. I want to make the politicians nervous of what I'm going to do and the reason why is you go out there and all day long, the news is going to tell us about the border between Ukraine and Russia. But I'm in Dallas, Texas, and the border between Texas and Mexico right now is just being flooded with sex trafficking, with Chinese fentanyl that I've had friends and family die of. So the real war is right here in America, yet this Biden administration wants to just confuse us and make us think that it's a valid excuse to go fight World War Three, yet the military industrial complex just lost a 20- year war in Afghanistan, and now they are chomping at the bit because, Tucker the reason is, is our country is not being run by human beings. It's being run by multinational corporations that actually want to destabilize America in order to gain a global control and that's what's happening. You look at these companies like Halliburton, you just look at all these companies that are destroying America on purpose, in my opinion, Tucker."

And I always say I beat the drum wherever I'm talking about Washington State. Right here in Washington State, it is so much worse than what you read in the paper or see on the news. I toured a K-8 school this summer, Broadview Thompson School in Seattle that had a homeless encampment, which rendered it unable for children to play in that school yard inside the school fence, Tucker. I was followed. I was taunted. I saw people doing drugs. It's a real issue. Not only that, it is not only in Seattle. It is in Bellingham. A hundred and seventy six cars have been stolen in just the first 79 days of this quarter. It's real. And you know, this is why we have a shot of winning not just for Washington State, but for all of our country because our children's livelihood is on the line. Not only that, our small businesses are struggling, it has an economic impact as well. So you know what, you know how you fix it? You fund our police.

He started his own razor company. It's called Jeremy's Razors. It is already more popular than Harry's. We haven't tried the razor, can't vouch for the razor.

So they just insult us any chance they get. But I'm also tired of this sort of nonprofit mentality on the right that responds to every attack with the same tired sort of cycle of lose, complain and beg for donations. That's just a recipe for failure. We have to be constructive. We have to be building a future and I wanted that to be the statement that we made and I thought if we actually sell some razors that would just make the joke that much funnier and boy have we sold razors, like I say 30,000 in the first 72 hours so now, we're the dog who caught the car, we're having to learn how to chew through steel, and stand up an actual razor company, which we are doing.

And then they come back to their own towns in Minnesota, and pass laws that make it impossible to build anything that is worth caring about. You know, they'll turn Main Street into a six-laner.

Don't we have a Transportation Secretary? Wasn't he a Rhodes Scholar? Wasn't he the Mayor of South Bend, Indiana? What's going on with our transportation system? We noticed. We're doing a segment on it on Monday. In the meantime, have a great happy and relaxing weekend with the ones you love. We will see you in two days. END"
