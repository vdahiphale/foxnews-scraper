In the next few days, you are going to see many states across this country certify their results and in each, both sides must agree that they are ready to submit those final tallies.  It's an important responsibility but what happened in Wayne County Michigan last night when two Republicans on the county board of canvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartman did not say they were ready to certify those results, that they didn't add up in Detroit, voters to vote exactly, the reaction. Well, I'll let you judge for yourself. Watch this.",

This past summer, 72 percent, this one 71. What does that mean? It means a precinct has to say these are how many absentee ballots we sent out to voters who requested them so say we sent out a 100 and then they get 200 back. How does that happen? You have to align the poll book with saying how many ballots went out, with how many came in and that's the problem so when  71 percent in this election don't match, it means that only 29 percent worked.  That's a failing grade. They are doing absolutely the right thing to not certify that and to see them be harassed and bullied and attacked, it's mob rule.",

She said that you're part of a plan to steal the election in Michigan.   She said there were no irregularities in the vote. She said they're just clerical errors.

And this is what happened last night. The Democrats on the committee said you know what, we will do an audit, we promise you and if you certify it and within seconds Jocelyn Benson got on TV and said that's not binding, we're not going to do an audit. We're not going to look into it.   Listen Martha, if you have nothing to hide, what's the harm in doing an audit. We've just found 6000 votes that were not counted in Georgia, that were not counted, they were missed because of an audit. With this type of discrepancy in Wayne County, it's very reasonable to say we should look into this especially when it's happened in three or four subsequent elections and the Secretary of State refuses to deal with this issue. And it's hurting the whole state of Michigan because people are losing faith in our election process so fix it. Don't call Republicans racist, don't go there. These are nice people. These are hardworking people. They have families they were derided and bullied and attacked last night and that's what's happening to any Republican right now who's speaking up.

That's why you see 73 million people vote for President Trump, the highest of any president in history because of our outreach and we are making inroads with Hispanic and African-Americans and Asian-Americans because of the economic opportunity and the things that this party stands for. So I am sick and tired of people calling Republicans racist and dividing our country. You are making our country more divided.

We cannot have these discrepancies and we need to have faith in our election process and I would tell you right now if it were a Republican county that didn't let people poll watch, that didn't let people observe like we had in Wayne County and then had 72 percent of the precincts not match up, I would be like all for it, we should look into that.

One, yes, encourage the development of these new vaccines as quickly as possible and Congress provided $27 billion as you know in the CARES Act to do that. But second what was brilliant I think by the Trump administration was to say there will be a dual track. At the same time we'll be manufacturing this vaccine which as you heard earlier normally takes years. So you have the development of the vaccine and the manufacturing going on, on two tracks at the same time. If the FDA approval doesn't come, you throw away those vials but if it does come which we hope it will for Moderna and Pfizer which are out front it appears with 90 and 95 percent efficiency, unbelievable.  Effective rates of 95 percent, that's just extraordinary then those vaccines are ready to go and you can get them on the market right away.

It's a gene based technology that triggers the immune system to produce protective antibodies. The Wall Street Journal reports, \"the strong early results for two leading COVID-19 vaccines have implications that go far beyond the current pandemic. They suggest the time is come for a gene based technology that could provide new treatments for cancer, heart disease and other infectious diseases.\" Here now Dr. Richard Besser, President and CEO of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former Acting Director of the CDC. Dr. Besser, thanks for being - coming back tonight. If you could explain to everybody in a very civilian way what Messenger RNA is and why it sort of allows you to get to not start from the - from square one but from something farther along square one in order to teach these cells how to fight off things? DR. RICHARD BESSER, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION: Yes, this is - it's really fascinating market. It's a new technology for making - making vaccines and as you said, it's gene based. So the normal way of making a vaccine is, you find a way to present to your immune system, a protein, something that's on the outside of a virus or bacteria. So your immune system can react to that and so when you see the actual virus or bacteria, you're protected. You've created the antibodies and other protections. This works differently. It injects into you a gene based material that causes your own cells to make a protein that's normally found on the outside of the coronavirus.  It's called the spike protein and so this gene based material, it goes into your own cells, you make the spike protein and then your immune system responds to that spike protein and so it is different from other approaches. The development of these types of vaccines can occur much, much faster and the results that we're seeing so far are really, highly encouraging. The big concerning question is given that it's new, there will only be about two months of safety data on this before it's likely they're going to be available to people.",

So you know, it's those two things to balance. There are likely going to be other types of vaccines coming along that are made with more traditional technology and you know doctors are going to have to inform their patients which way they think they should go.

As a more Republican leaning student on campus, I think I learned a lot from democratic students, democratic-leaning professors as well and it's no secret that Harvard is a more democratically-leaning school. But I think really, it's -- it marks kind of a disconnect between some of the more progressive students, some of the most progressive students, I would say, and in the administration at Harvard who think actually is in good faith very much trying to promote more intellectual diversity. They're bringing on more Republican-leaning students. And on top of that, they've actually already hired in the past and in present, they've hired a number of Trump -- former Trump administrative personnel like Gary Cohn and Dina Powell as well.

This past summer, 72 percent, this one 71. What does that mean? It means a precinct has to say these are how many absentee ballots we sent out to voters who requested them so say we sent out a 100 and then they get 200 back. How does that happen? You have to align the poll book with saying how many ballots went out, with how many came in and that's the problem so when 71 percent in this election don't match, it means that only 29 percent worked.

She said that you're part of a plan to steal the election in Michigan. She said there were no irregularities in the vote. She said they're just clerical errors. The Mayor of Detroit said that just 357 votes out of 250,000 cast had discrepancies so how do you - how do you respond to that?

And this is what happened last night. The Democrats on the committee said you know what, we will do an audit, we promise you and if you certify it and within seconds Jocelyn Benson got on TV and said that's not binding, we're not going to do an audit. We're not going to look into it. Listen Martha, if you have nothing to hide, what's the harm in doing an audit. We've just found 6000 votes that were not counted in Georgia, that were not counted, they were missed because of an audit. With this type of discrepancy in Wayne County, it's very reasonable to say we should look into this especially when it's happened in three or four subsequent elections and the Secretary of State refuses to deal with this issue. And it's hurting the whole state of Michigan because people are losing faith in our election process so fix it. Don't call Republicans racist, don't go there. These are nice people. These are hardworking people. They have families they were derided and bullied and attacked last night and that's what's happening to any Republican right now who's speaking up. McCarthyism at its best. Let's not hire people from the Trump administration, let's censor them, let's attack them, let's silence their voices.

A president who's funded HBCUs at a higher level, who created economic opportunity zones and a Republican party that had offices in urban areas and black communities to turn out the black vote, to compete for the black vote this election. That's why you see 73 million people vote for President Trump, the highest of any president in history because of our outreach and we are making inroads with Hispanic and African-Americans and Asian-Americans because of the economic opportunity and the things that this party stands for. So I am sick and tired of people calling Republicans racist and dividing our country. You are making our country more divided. We are reaching out to every American and President Trump's policies showed that it lifted the boats for every single American with record low unemployment. Now what you're saying you know historic gains in jobs coming back and the stock market. This is a president who put good policies in place for everyone."

We cannot have these discrepancies and we need to have faith in our election process and I would tell you right now if it were a Republican county that didn't let people poll watch, that didn't let people observe like we had in Wayne County and then had 72 percent of the precincts not match up, I would be like all for it, we should look into that.

It's a private-public partnership that allows us to do two things. One, yes, encourage the development of these new vaccines as quickly as possible and Congress provided $27 billion as you know in the CARES Act to do that. But second what was brilliant I think by the Trump administration was to say there will be a dual track. At the same time we'll be manufacturing this vaccine which as you heard earlier normally takes years. So you have the development of the vaccine and the manufacturing going on, on two tracks at the same time. If the FDA approval doesn't come, you throw away those vials but if it does come which we hope it will for Moderna and Pfizer which are out front it appears with 90 and 95 percent efficiency, unbelievable. Effective rates of 95 percent, that's just extraordinary then those vaccines are ready to go and you can get them on the market right away.

The Wall Street Journal reports, \"the strong early results for two leading COVID-19 vaccines have implications that go far beyond the current pandemic. They suggest the time is come for a gene based technology that could provide new treatments for cancer, heart disease and other infectious diseases.\" Here now Dr. Richard Besser, President and CEO of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former Acting Director of the CDC. Dr. Besser, thanks for being - coming back tonight. If you could explain to everybody in a very civilian way what Messenger RNA is and why it sort of allows you to get to not start from the - from square one but from something farther along square one in order to teach these cells how to fight off things?"

      "speaker": "DR. RICHARD BESSER, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION",
      "utterance": " Yes, this is - it's really fascinating market. It's a new technology for making - making vaccines and as you said, it's gene based. So the normal way of making a vaccine is, you find a way to present to your immune system, a protein, something that's on the outside of a virus or bacteria. So your immune system can react to that and so when you see the actual virus or bacteria, you're protected. You've created the antibodies and other protections. This works differently. It injects into you a gene based material that causes your own cells to make a protein that's normally found on the outside of the coronavirus. It's called the spike protein and so this gene based material, it goes into your own cells, you make the spike protein and then your immune system responds to that spike protein and so it is different from other approaches. The development of these types of vaccines can occur much, much faster and the results that we're seeing so far are really, highly encouraging. The big concerning question is given that it's new, there will only be about two months of safety data on this before it's likely they're going to be available to people."

You know, the fact that 250,000 people have died is concerning and so you have to weigh those two things and it's going to be very important that people who've been in these vaccine trials are followed for long periods of time, months and years to see how long this protection lasts and are there any side effects that appear later on. So you know, it's those two things to balance. There are likely going to be other types of vaccines coming along that are made with more traditional technology and you know doctors are going to have to inform their patients which way they think they should go. But given the consequences of the pandemic so far, there truly is hope that we could see an end to this in 2021."

So if you can get yourselves to make a protein for a virus, maybe you can get yourselves to make a protein that's abnormal in particular cancers and your immune system can go after those cancer cells instead of going after virus or another infectious agent.

You know, there wasn't a lot of foreign policy discussion over the course of the campaign but there was a bit. And here is something that Joe Biden said about how he looks at China and Russia. Watch this. I'm going to read it to you. In the near time, Russia, which seeks to undermine our democracy and our partners in Europe -- sorry, including the members of the NATO alliance, in the medium-term, a rising China poses the greatest strategic challenge to the United States and our allies in Asia and in Europe. Ultimately, over the long term, the greatest geopolitical threat, he said, an existential threat to all countries is climate crisis. So, what do you make of where he appears to stand there?"

First, I want to commend the State Department especially Peter Berkowitz, the director of policy planning, the State Department's internal think tank for producing an outstanding report about the Chinese Communist Party and its ambitions to replace the United States as the world's dominant super power. It's reminiscent of what George Kennan wrote the so-called long telegram at the beginning of the Cold War. And it's something that Joe Biden needs to read. Joe Biden, according to former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates who served in the Obama-Biden administration has been wrong about nearly every major foreign policy and national security decision for the last 48 years. Should he become president I wish that he would change that record but it doesn't sound he is going to. I mean, I remember when Barack Obama made fun of Mitt Romney for saying that Russia was our chief threat."

You know, I want to ask you about this Afghanistan-Iraq discussion and the drawdown to 2,500 troops by January as we heard from the new defense secretary yesterday.

That's exactly what happened in Iraq and in Syria in 2011 to 2014. President Obama drew down our troops to zero and then the Islamic state rose to power and we had to return to those countries to protect our citizens. At the same time, the president has said all along that he wants to continue this steady and gradual removal of our troops from Afghanistan and those small - and in Iraq and other countries in the Middle East in no small part so we are better postured around the world to confront the genuine long-term threat to security which is a rising in communist China. But president -- I'm sorry, Senator McConnell made those remarks before the announcement yesterday. He was speaking, I believe about an exit entirely. The announcement that acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller said is that we are going to move a couple thousand troops home. Again, if that's what the commanders on the ground say that they need to maintain the support for the fragile peace agreement in Afghanistan and to prevent it from becoming a terrorist safe haven --"

Many people remember Benghazi but the very fact that we launched that war to begin with without any plan for stability afterwards to turn that country into an open civil war zone where they are still engaged in the slave trade, which allowed millions of migrants to cross the Mediterranean Sea if they survived the crossing and flood into Europe. That's the example of the kind of terrible judgment that Susan Rice displayed in the Obama administration. It's why a Democratic Senate couldn't confirm her in 2012 when Barack Obama wanted to make her a secretary of state.

This proposal would be particularly unfair to students who disagree with many of the policies of the Trump administration. As a more Republican leaning student on campus, I think I learned a lot from democratic students, democratic-leaning professors as well and it's no secret that Harvard is a more democratically-leaning school. But I think really, it's -- it marks kind of a disconnect between some of the more progressive students, some of the most progressive students, I would say, and in the administration at Harvard who think actually is in good faith very much trying to promote more intellectual diversity. They're bringing on more Republican-leaning students. And on top of that, they've actually already hired in the past and in present, they've hired a number of Trump -- former Trump administrative personnel like Gary Cohn and Dina Powell as well. So, I think halting that I think is very shocking and also in terms of upholding the sort of ideals of democracy, punishing political opponents in my opinion doesn't quite seem to be consistent with that."

Here's Kayleigh McEnany, the former -- the press secretary I should say, at the White House, and she went to Harvard Law School. Here's what she said this morning."

I hope the administration, the same way they did when I was there, rebukes this movement because censorship should not be tolerated, our academic communities should be bastions of free speech."

We reached out to Harvard, no comment on the petition as of this point. But I thank him for being with us tonight. So that is THE STORY of Wednesday, November 18th, 2020. But as always, THE STORY continues, so we will see you back here tomorrow night at seven o'clock. Tucker Carlson will be joining us next, so stick around for that. Have a great night, everybody.
