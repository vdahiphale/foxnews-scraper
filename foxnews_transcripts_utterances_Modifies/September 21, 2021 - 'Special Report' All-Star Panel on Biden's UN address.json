      "sentences": "President Biden at the United Nations General Assembly today. The former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley giving FOX a quote about that speech. \"President Biden,\" in her words, \"President Biden's speech ignored the reality and seriousness of America's threats and enemies. China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Afghanistan, and terrorism to name a few. Under the Trump administration the world knew where we stood. With Joe Biden asleep at the switch our friends don't trust us and our enemies are rejoicing.\" Let's bring in our panel. We'll start there, Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for \"Axios,\" and former Education Secretary Bill Bennett. Jonathan, it's obviously night and day as far as the speech and the message from President Biden to what we saw from President Trump in his address to the United Nations. But it was interesting that he didn't talk about China or Russia. Your thoughts? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Yes, there was no mention whatsoever of China or Russia, which is notable given that the administration is orienting itself towards power competition. It's focused on Asia. China was referenced in indirect ways. So he was sort of putting out these non-confrontational messages. The big one you grabbed there, which was that we don't want a new cold war. It was sort of trying to lower the temperature. He has got a real problem with the China strategy that he is trying to pursue right now. The strategy sounded good on paper. It was this idea that we can compete and confront China in all those areas where we need to like trade, but we'll also cooperate with them on climate change. That's not how China likes to operate. And China sent a very clear message to Biden, if you keep talking to us about the genocide in Xinjiang, we are not going to be sitting down with John Kerry. We're going to be doing Zoom calls with him and we're going to be humiliating him when he comes over here. So that's probably one of the biggest strategic challenges they face.",

I like that he pretty much put it out there, Bret, that we, the United States, are the ones that are going to lead the rest of the world, and this is so true, through climate change and through COVID. In other words, we need to work together. We don't need to have these unnecessary wars. We're going to be your leader, and in a sense, you need us. And they do. The world does need the United States, and the world does need our leadership. I loved the fact that he talked about Sudan and Belarus, and he talked about protesters there, and I liked the fact that I felt he owned it and took responsibility. He didn't shirk it on Afghanistan. But he didn't dwell on it too long in his speech either.",

Take a look at this, President Biden's job approval in Iowa 31 percent according to \"The Des Moines Register\" poll, has dropped significantly.

If China doesn't do something, if we don't force or use our efforts to get China to do something, nothing better will happen. He doesn't seek a cold war, but he is in a cold war. Somebody should tell him that he is already in it. China must be very happy with that speech. The border is a disaster. It is a catastrophe. And the human catastrophe here of these 15,000, 16,000 people is just exacerbated by the catastrophe of the Secretary Mayorkas who says the border is closed. There you are, you want to believe secretary of Homeland Security or are you going to believe your own eyes? This is ridiculous. Is there a breaking point on this issue? Is there a breaking point?",
