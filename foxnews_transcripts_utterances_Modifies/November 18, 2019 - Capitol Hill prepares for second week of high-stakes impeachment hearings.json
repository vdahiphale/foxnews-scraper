Tuesday, four witnesses, including Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, Director for European Affairs at the National Security Council, he was on the call. Wednesday is really the biggest of all of the testimony. And that is Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Thursday, Fiona Hill. And, also, they just added David Holmes, political counselor to the U.S. embassy in Ukraine. He is said to have heard this phone call between Sondland and President Trump. Meantime, we learn today, from Senator Lindsey Graham, that the Inspector General of the Justice Department, Michael Horwitz, will be testifying on December 11th about his report that is expected out in days. But we know December 11th is already on the calendar. So, that's something new we learned moments before the show.  Let's bring in our panel: Chris Stirewalt, politics editor here at Fox News; Mollie Hemmingway, senior editor at the Federalist; and Michael Crowley, White House correspondent for the New York Times. Okay. Where we are now and this set of hearings, Mollie, and how this affects, kind of going forward? You know, we've seen last week this is going to be a big week of testimony.",

This specifically is one that came out in testimony on Friday, in which Sondland allegedly took a call from the president in a Kyiv restaurant on his cell phone when there were two embassy staffers there. And by the accounts that were given to the House, the president said to Sondland pretty directly, you know, \"We're -- I'm really interested in these investigations. What's going on with the investigations?\" furthering the idea that this is really what the president's interest was in his Ukraine policy. So, will Sondland now say, \"I forgot about that.
