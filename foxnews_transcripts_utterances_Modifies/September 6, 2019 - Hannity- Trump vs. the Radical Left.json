      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "And welcome to special edition of \"Hannity: Trump vs. the Radical Left.\" And tonight, we start with some pretty amazing news. Look at this. I doubt the media mob will be focused on it. But Donald Trump economy just broke another huge record.  For the first time in recorded history, the African-American unemployment rate in the United States is down to 5.5 percent. That is an all-time low. And that's not all. The unemployment gap between white Americans, black Americans, is also at a record low.  In other words, our economy is now humming on all cylinders, and thankfully working for our entire family, all Americans.  The president's tax cuts, they were a huge success. The president's deregulation, a huge success. The new trade deals with Mexico, Canada, the European Union, Japan, a big win for American goods. And, by the way, I would expect that the deal with China is going to be free and more fair at the end of the day. And then top it all off, Americans are now safer. Look at this. Nationwide, violent crime is down significantly by a lot. And, oh, by the way, construction of the wall, the biggest unreported story this week, is well underway.  The president this week -- the media is not focused on it, Nancy Pelosi is mad -- after securing the $3.6 billion in new funding, the wall is going up, as we speak. The video on your screen is showing the progress at the border in Yuma, Arizona -- well, that's from last week alone, and the president is saying we'll get 500 miles built by the end of next year. Nancy Pelosi tonight is furious. She vowed to challenge the funding in court.  The problem is there are laws that we have cited on this program as it relates to the president legally being able to build walls and barriers to stop drug corridors. And that law also is backed up by something called the Constitution. And you see the Constitution says he is the commander in chief. And we don't want the 90 percent of heroin in this country that crosses that border to enter any longer. So, we can end the terrible cycle of losing nearly 300 Americans a week.   Now, Nancy Pelosi, a lot of Democrats, they supported Obama's wall, but they don't support Trump's wall. That's their problem. In fact, Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to address the crisis at our southern border at all. And even though today, by the way, in her own state of California -- look at this, Nancy, it's like we showed a mile from your house, needles, urination, defecation problems -- an illegal immigrant accused of shooting police officers was just apprehended after a high speed pursuit. Now, here's another problem, Ms. Pelosi, Madam Speaker, if you are speaker in name only, he was previously released, allegedly because of California's cities and their state sanctuary laws. Oh, in other words aiding and abetting those people that committed crimes and not handing them over to ICE to be deported.   And meanwhile, in Maryland, look at this, six illegal immigrants, one U.S. citizen just charged in the stabbing death of a 21-year-old. Now, according to statistics from the administration, during a two-year period, 4,000 murders were committed by illegal immigrants in this country, 100,000 assaults, carried out, 30,000 sexual crimes carried out. Each and every week, heroin is killing -- opioids are killing approximately 300 Americans. Ninety percent of heroin and now fentanyl are coming in through our southern border. This is a national security crisis. The president -- he's absolutely right to make the border a priority. And that means we can prevent those drugs from getting into the hands of American kids.  Now, the president is also dedicated to improving the quality of life for everyone in this country.   And, by the way, for all of you conservatives that said Hannity is just supporting the president, I said, no, the president didn't give up on the border wall, he just changed strategies. And I've now been proven correct because the money has been reallocated. It is legal. It is constitutional. Now, despite significant gains in safety, security, prosperity of Americans here at home, you've got Democrats, their number one supporters, contributors, allies, and the media mob, they are seething with anger and pessimism and despair and even hoping for recessions, openly.  If you watch the terrible climate, oh my gosh, seven-hour disastrous marathon on fake news CNN this week, you heard Democrats warning the destruction of Planet Earth because of the evils of capitalism and plastic straws and, oh, the combustion engine. Others on the left are actively using the politics of race and division to stoke fear among American voters and divide us. That is a classic political tactic from Democrats and the media mob. But this year, it's even more depraved than ever.  Look at this, for example, remember former ESPN commentator Jemele Hill wrote an article calling for voluntary racial segregation in college sports in order to, quote, disrupt the reign of an amateur sports system that uses the labor of, quote, black folks to make, quote, white folks rich.  And while Hill is using the politics of race to divide this country, one prominent author is stoking fear and resentments surrounding anybody who dares to wear any red hat -- any red hat, no writing on it. Now, the Pulitzer nominated author tweeting, quote: If anyone else made really uncomfortable these days by anyone wearing any kind of red baseball cap like I see on my heart does weird bleep and I finally realize that only says Titleist or whatever. Maybe don't wear red caps anymore, normal people? I like red caps. And, by the way, if you're a Boston Red Sox fan and a Cincinnati Reds fan, apparently, your team's hats are scaring the snowflakes. They might think you might be one of us smelly Walmart shoppers.  I love Walmart, I love Costco, I love those stores. They're great. You know why? You save money, get the same products.   And irredeemable deplorables, that likes the president, that likes the success we're having, that likes the economy that's creating jobs and getting people off food stumps, and made us energy independent for the first time in 75 years. Now, sadly, Trump derangement syndrome, it's become so bad, Trump donors, they are now being targeted with harassment and public shaming and boycotts. Former press secretary, Sarah Sanders, now a FOX News contributor -- we're glad to have her -- a private citizen, still confronted in public by angry, psychotic Trump-hating lunatics. Take a look.",

Unfortunately, the mob and the media is constantly stoking -- well, this resentment, because they just hate Trump every second, minute, hour, of every 24-hour day, every week, every month, every year. Russia, Russia, Stormy, Stormy, racist, racist, impeachment, impeachment.  Sharpie, sharpie, sharpie is the latest. That insane, obsessive, nonstop hysteria over drawing a map.  According to NewsBusters, on Wednesday, fake news CNN and, yes, MSDNC, the conspiracy network, dedicated a whopping 145 minutes of airtime to sharpie coverage and analysis. And, of course, the breathless, hysterical reporting in an attempt to make the president look bad. That's what they do. They're the ones who appear detached from reality. They're the ones that pretty much pushed every lie, conspiracy theory and a hoax for 2-1/2 years.  Does the media mob not know how insane they look? Do they even care? Apparently not. They're now totally blinded by this anti-Trump rage. If Donald Trump cured cancer, I doubt they would say a good about it. The left's lunacy has now reached an all-time low.   Joining us now, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp, author of the book \"Still Winning\", Charlie Hurt.  I'm not sick of winning, Charlie.

And then that's only when they're not obsessing over sharpiegate and all of this nonsense. The thing about the tweets, the tweets that caused all of the hysteria about the weather report, is that everything that President Trump included in that tweet about Hurricane Dorian came from who? The weather service people. He simply repeated what they all predicted, which is at one point, the cone of the storm was going to hit a part of Alabama.

They care about having a good job, being able to pay their bills.   And all of those fundamental questions, the president is passing with flying colors. I think we're at a crackdown moment for the left, Sean, where these crazy views that Democrat candidates for president and the squad and others are talking about really are dissonant with the American people.

      "sentences": "All right. Thank you both. Matt, Charlie, I appreciate it. All right. We turn now to some other big breaking news surrounding the deep state, the president versus the left. Yesterday, a federal judge healed private meeting with Lieutenant General Flynn's legal counsel. His new lawyer, Sidney Powell, after she accused the special counsel lawyers of withholding exculpatory evidence from the defense, also raising questions about whether he was illegally surveilled, something we have talked about at length on this program.  This could have massive ramifications for Flynn's case. It could shed light on the rampant prosecutorial misconduct in the Weissmann-led special counsel probe. Clearly, Robert Mueller didn't know what Fusion GPS was an had no idea Jeannie Rhee was once a lawyer for Clinton, he didn't look like he was too in charge. We'll have analysis of all this in a moment. But, first, one more big update from Judicial Watch, a federal judge has just granted significant new discovery surrounding documents related to the Clinton e-mail scandal. Judge also blasted government officials in the State Department and the DOJ for not complying with Freedom of Information Act requests. We'll keep you updated with any new discoveries in that case.  Also tonight, a breaking new development from Congressman Devin Nunes and his suit against Fusion GPS. He, of course, accusing the shady firm responsible for Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier of trying to impede his investigation with smears, lies, and intimidation. Now, a prominent businessman is also claiming to be the target of Fusion's dirty smear tactics and is even saying that Fusion's founder, Glen Simpson, is paid by individuals connected to the Russian government. OK, mind- boggling twist.  Now, keep in mind, \"The New York Times\" reported that Fusion's dirty dossier could be Russian disinformation, likely Russian disinformation from the get-go. In other words, that would mean that Russia, Putin, knew Hillary was paying for the lies about hookers urinating in beds, and everything else, and that Hillary would use it to bludgeon Trump. Which might raise the question of, oh, the media has been telling us, oh, that the Russians wanted to help Donald Trump. Maybe they were trying to help Hillary if they knew about the dirty dossier.  And for nearly three-plus years here, Donald Trump has faced a witch hunt into Russian collusion, not Hillary Clinton. And I know I've been saying this for a while, thanks to the Durham-Barr investigation, hopefully, we will see justice and truth coming. And even though the process is slower than we'd like, my message to you, we the American people, is hang in there. I want to see the I.G. report on FISA abuse and I want to learn if those FISA warrants were obtained illegally, whether premeditated fraud was committed on that FISA court, because if they used the dirty and unverified dossier, said it's verified and they warned not to use it, that to me -- well, that meets the definition of premeditated fraud on the court, that would be illegal warrant, obtained illegally based on lies, propaganda, paid for by the other candidate.  My message to all you deep state actors, you know, the ones that tried to rig an election and then destroy a president-elect, and then a duly-elected president, I'd say tick-tock for you tonight. Joining us now, author of the big new book \"Ball of Collusion\", Andy McCarthy, along with the author of the important, upcoming book, \"Witch Hunt\", FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, and FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter. Andy, I want to go you specifically. Now, we know that the DOJ and the FBI and Comey were all warned that, uh-oh, don't trust, Steele, he's got an agenda, it's not verified. And we also know they were told twice, Kathleen Kavalec, and they're told once by Bruce Ohr, yes, Hillary paid for it. So, now we know it's an unverifiable document, because not even Steele stands behind it. Does that sound to you -- you worked in the prestigious, I mean the sincerely, Southern District of New York, does that sound like premeditated fraud and illegal warrant effort?",

So I think that between the bias that he had, which was quite obvious and as you point out was known throughout the unit in the FBI and the Justice Department who was looking at this, the fact that at least we know somebody at the justice department had problems with their lack of transparency with respect to Steele, and the fact that they knew that he was wrong about something fundamental, which normally in an investigation, that means you put the brakes on everything and make sure that you scrub what the guy has given you to make sure that it's not only verifiable, but actually verified.

I agree with Andy entirely that, you know, when you concealed vital evidence from the FISA court and deceived the judges, you're perpetrating a fraud on the court, you're also committing perjury, because Comey who signed the first FISA warrant applications, signed a certification under penalty of perjury, verifying that the information was true and accurate, when he knew it wasn't. They hadn't verified any of the collusion allegations upon which they relied. And not only that, when they received subsequent information, Rule 13 tells them they must immediately run back to the FISA court and notify the judges of new information, so that the judges may reevaluate whether the spying and surveillance on Carter Page could continue. They didn't do that either. So, they broke, as identify in my book, a myriad of laws in my judgment, including six different felonies.",

If what we are hearing, if all of the evidence that we've obtained over the last 2 1/2 years, is accurate as I believe it is, and all of the sourcing that we've been told that that these FISA applications were fraudulent signed, remember, I think a lot of people forget this, but the former Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, when she was under questioning by Congress behind closed doors, she basically had selective amnesia when they got to these questions, did you know about this, did you review those FISA applications? And she said, no, she did not review the FISA applications even though it was under her purview, because the buck stops with her. So, not only is she responsible, but certainly the people, the signatories, Comey as well as Andrew McCabe. Remember the fourth FISA application, actually renewal, was signed by Rod Rosenstein. So, that's going to be very interesting. What was in all of these renewal applications? So, yes, I absolutely believe that Horowitz is going to find a mountain of evidence in that. It's going to be a scathing report. It's going to point directly at all of the malfeasance because the only reason why they would ignore that evidence is because they wanted to spy.",

That's her, right now, last weekend. She's doing great. The previous one right there is us holding hands before we went in to surgery. I have to admit now that I was trying to be brave. But at the time I didn't know what was going to come out on the other end. I thought that the risk was low for me and that's why, one of many reasons I wanted to do it. One of my great fears, was that may be we would do all of this and maybe it still wouldn't work. I didn't know how I would cope with that if I were to lose my sister. I can't bear to think about that. We both had faith. And she texted me the morning of the surgery, she's so strong, she's my younger sister. I was getting ready at the hotel with my wife to go over to Mount Sinai here in New York. That morning I didn't know what was going to happen. I was kind of get the strength, the courage you were talking about. I didn't have it, frankly. My sister did.",

      "utterance": "And welcome to special edition of \"Hannity: Trump vs. the Radical Left.\" And tonight, we start with some pretty amazing news. Look at this. I doubt the media mob will be focused on it. But Donald Trump economy just broke another huge record. For the first time in recorded history, the African-American unemployment rate in the United States is down to 5.5 percent. That is an all-time low. And that's not all. The unemployment gap between white Americans, black Americans, is also at a record low. In other words, our economy is now humming on all cylinders, and thankfully working for our entire family, all Americans. The president's tax cuts, they were a huge success. The president's deregulation, a huge success. The new trade deals with Mexico, Canada, the European Union, Japan, a big win for American goods. And, by the way, I would expect that the deal with China is going to be free and more fair at the end of the day. And then top it all off, Americans are now safer. Look at this. Nationwide, violent crime is down significantly by a lot. And, oh, by the way, construction of the wall, the biggest unreported story this week, is well underway. The president this week -- the media is not focused on it, Nancy Pelosi is mad -- after securing the $3.6 billion in new funding, the wall is going up, as we speak. The video on your screen is showing the progress at the border in Yuma, Arizona -- well, that's from last week alone, and the president is saying we'll get 500 miles built by the end of next year. Nancy Pelosi tonight is furious. She vowed to challenge the funding in court. The problem is there are laws that we have cited on this program as it relates to the president legally being able to build walls and barriers to stop drug corridors. And that law also is backed up by something called the Constitution. And you see the Constitution says he is the commander in chief. And we don't want the 90 percent of heroin in this country that crosses that border to enter any longer. So, we can end the terrible cycle of losing nearly 300 Americans a week. Now, Nancy Pelosi, a lot of Democrats, they supported Obama's wall, but they don't support Trump's wall. That's their problem. In fact, Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to address the crisis at our southern border at all. And even though today, by the way, in her own state of California -- look at this, Nancy, it's like we showed a mile from your house, needles, urination, defecation problems -- an illegal immigrant accused of shooting police officers was just apprehended after a high speed pursuit. Now, here's another problem, Ms. Pelosi, Madam Speaker, if you are speaker in name only, he was previously released, allegedly because of California's cities and their state sanctuary laws. Oh, in other words aiding and abetting those people that committed crimes and not handing them over to ICE to be deported. And meanwhile, in Maryland, look at this, six illegal immigrants, one U.S. citizen just charged in the stabbing death of a 21-year-old. Now, according to statistics from the administration, during a two-year period, 4,000 murders were committed by illegal immigrants in this country, 100,000 assaults, carried out, 30,000 sexual crimes carried out. Each and every week, heroin is killing -- opioids are killing approximately 300 Americans. Ninety percent of heroin and now fentanyl are coming in through our southern border. This is a national security crisis. The president -- he's absolutely right to make the border a priority. And that means we can prevent those drugs from getting into the hands of American kids. Now, the president is also dedicated to improving the quality of life for everyone in this country. And, by the way, for all of you conservatives that said Hannity is just supporting the president, I said, no, the president didn't give up on the border wall, he just changed strategies. And I've now been proven correct because the money has been reallocated. It is legal. It is constitutional. Now, despite significant gains in safety, security, prosperity of Americans here at home, you've got Democrats, their number one supporters, contributors, allies, and the media mob, they are seething with anger and pessimism and despair and even hoping for recessions, openly. If you watch the terrible climate, oh my gosh, seven-hour disastrous marathon on fake news CNN this week, you heard Democrats warning the destruction of Planet Earth because of the evils of capitalism and plastic straws and, oh, the combustion engine. Others on the left are actively using the politics of race and division to stoke fear among American voters and divide us. That is a classic political tactic from Democrats and the media mob. But this year, it's even more depraved than ever. Look at this, for example, remember former ESPN commentator Jemele Hill wrote an article calling for voluntary racial segregation in college sports in order to, quote, disrupt the reign of an amateur sports system that uses the labor of, quote, black folks to make, quote, white folks rich."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And while Hill is using the politics of race to divide this country, one prominent author is stoking fear and resentments surrounding anybody who dares to wear any red hat -- any red hat, no writing on it. Now, the Pulitzer nominated author tweeting, quote",
      "utterance": "If anyone else made really uncomfortable these days by anyone wearing any kind of red baseball cap like I see on my heart does weird bleep and I finally realize that only says Titleist or whatever. Maybe don't wear red caps anymore, normal people? I like red caps. And, by the way, if you're a Boston Red Sox fan and a Cincinnati Reds fan, apparently, your team's hats are scaring the snowflakes. They might think you might be one of us smelly Walmart shoppers. I love Walmart, I love Costco, I love those stores. They're great. You know why? You save money, get the same products. And irredeemable deplorables, that likes the president, that likes the success we're having, that likes the economy that's creating jobs and getting people off food stumps, and made us energy independent for the first time in 75 years. Now, sadly, Trump derangement syndrome, it's become so bad, Trump donors, they are now being targeted with harassment and public shaming and boycotts. Former press secretary, Sarah Sanders, now a FOX News contributor -- we're glad to have her -- a private citizen, still confronted in public by angry, psychotic Trump-hating lunatics. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Now, the vilification of political differences, that's got to stop. No one deserves to be harassed in their private lives. Unfortunately, the mob and the media is constantly stoking -- well, this resentment, because they just hate Trump every second, minute, hour, of every 24-hour day, every week, every month, every year. Russia, Russia, Stormy, Stormy, racist, racist, impeachment, impeachment. Sharpie, sharpie, sharpie is the latest. That insane, obsessive, nonstop hysteria over drawing a map. According to NewsBusters, on Wednesday, fake news CNN and, yes, MSDNC, the conspiracy network, dedicated a whopping 145 minutes of airtime to sharpie coverage and analysis. And, of course, the breathless, hysterical reporting in an attempt to make the president look bad. That's what they do. They're the ones who appear detached from reality. They're the ones that pretty much pushed every lie, conspiracy theory and a hoax for 2-1/2 years. Does the media mob not know how insane they look? Do they even care? Apparently not. They're now totally blinded by this anti-Trump rage. If Donald Trump cured cancer, I doubt they would say a good about it. The left's lunacy has now reached an all-time low. Joining us now, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp, author of the book \"Still Winning\", Charlie Hurt. I'm not sick of winning, Charlie. Let me ask you, does this ever stop or is it always going to be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the big reason that President Trump and all of his supporters are still winning, is because the DNC spent seven hours on CNN last night talking about all of their goofy, crazy, expensive, power-grabbing environmental nonsense. And then that's only when they're not obsessing over sharpiegate and all of this nonsense. The thing about the tweets, the tweets that caused all of the hysteria about the weather report, is that everything that President Trump included in that tweet about Hurricane Dorian came from who? The weather service people. He simply repeated what they all predicted, which is at one point, the cone of the storm was going to hit a part of Alabama. And everything that followed since then is just pure Donald Trump derangement syndrome hysteria."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And, Matt, I'm looking at this. I really believe that the president caused -- if he cured cancer and gave every American citizen $5 million, they'd still hate him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATT SCHLAPP, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION CHAIR",
      "utterance": "Yes, and there's no question about it. If you actually look at what the American people care about, it isn't climate change and it isn't all of this other alarmism we're getting from the Democrats. They care about their families. They care about having a good job, being able to pay their bills. And all of those fundamental questions, the president is passing with flying colors. I think we're at a crackdown moment for the left, Sean, where these crazy views that Democrat candidates for president and the squad and others are talking about really are dissonant with the American people. And I think when the Democrats lose badly over these radical policies. I actually think they might rethink some of these craziness."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Thank you both. Matt, Charlie, I appreciate it. All right. We turn now to some other big breaking news surrounding the deep state, the president versus the left. Yesterday, a federal judge healed private meeting with Lieutenant General Flynn's legal counsel. His new lawyer, Sidney Powell, after she accused the special counsel lawyers of withholding exculpatory evidence from the defense, also raising questions about whether he was illegally surveilled, something we have talked about at length on this program. This could have massive ramifications for Flynn's case. It could shed light on the rampant prosecutorial misconduct in the Weissmann-led special counsel probe. Clearly, Robert Mueller didn't know what Fusion GPS was an had no idea Jeannie Rhee was once a lawyer for Clinton, he didn't look like he was too in charge. We'll have analysis of all this in a moment. But, first, one more big update from Judicial Watch, a federal judge has just granted significant new discovery surrounding documents related to the Clinton e-mail scandal. Judge also blasted government officials in the State Department and the DOJ for not complying with Freedom of Information Act requests. We'll keep you updated with any new discoveries in that case. Also tonight, a breaking new development from Congressman Devin Nunes and his suit against Fusion GPS. He, of course, accusing the shady firm responsible for Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier of trying to impede his investigation with smears, lies, and intimidation. Now, a prominent businessman is also claiming to be the target of Fusion's dirty smear tactics and is even saying that Fusion's founder, Glen Simpson, is paid by individuals connected to the Russian government. OK, mind- boggling twist. Now, keep in mind, \"The New York Times\" reported that Fusion's dirty dossier could be Russian disinformation, likely Russian disinformation from the get-go. In other words, that would mean that Russia, Putin, knew Hillary was paying for the lies about hookers urinating in beds, and everything else, and that Hillary would use it to bludgeon Trump. Which might raise the question of, oh, the media has been telling us, oh, that the Russians wanted to help Donald Trump. Maybe they were trying to help Hillary if they knew about the dirty dossier. And for nearly three-plus years here, Donald Trump has faced a witch hunt into Russian collusion, not Hillary Clinton. And I know I've been saying this for a while, thanks to the Durham-Barr investigation, hopefully, we will see justice and truth coming. And even though the process is slower than we'd like, my message to you, we the American people, is hang in there. I want to see the I.G. report on FISA abuse and I want to learn if those FISA warrants were obtained illegally, whether premeditated fraud was committed on that FISA court, because if they used the dirty and unverified dossier, said it's verified and they warned not to use it, that to me -- well, that meets the definition of premeditated fraud on the court, that would be illegal warrant, obtained illegally based on lies, propaganda, paid for by the other candidate. My message to all you deep state actors, you know, the ones that tried to rig an election and then destroy a president-elect, and then a duly-elected president, I'd say tick-tock for you tonight. Joining us now, author of the big new book \"Ball of Collusion\", Andy McCarthy, along with the author of the important, upcoming book, \"Witch Hunt\", FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, and FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter. Andy, I want to go you specifically. Now, we know that the DOJ and the FBI and Comey were all warned that, uh-oh, don't trust, Steele, he's got an agenda, it's not verified. And we also know they were told twice, Kathleen Kavalec, and they're told once by Bruce Ohr, yes, Hillary paid for it. So, now we know it's an unverifiable document, because not even Steele stands behind it. Does that sound to you -- you worked in the prestigious, I mean the sincerely, Southern District of New York, does that sound like premeditated fraud and illegal warrant effort?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDY MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Sean, what I would be most concerned about and alarmed about was, we now know that in connection with the Kavalec incident, which was only days before they went for the warrant, they were told that Steele had been wrong about something that was fundamental. So I think that between the bias that he had, which was quite obvious and as you point out was known throughout the unit in the FBI and the Justice Department who was looking at this, the fact that at least we know somebody at the justice department had problems with their lack of transparency with respect to Steele, and the fact that they knew that he was wrong about something fundamental, which normally in an investigation, that means you put the brakes on everything and make sure that you scrub what the guy has given you to make sure that it's not only verifiable, but actually verified. That's very problematic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And, Gregg, this is what you've been saying, your follow-up book, the number one bestseller, lays it out. That was all true. Hillary's investigation was rigged. I think we've proven that point over and over again with real evidence. And then, of course, we have the issue of, well, did we outsource, subcontract spying abroad with our allies for the purpose of circumventing American law."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, all of that is true and I hope will be the subject of the inspector general's forthcoming report, which should come out some time this month. I agree with Andy entirely that, you know, when you concealed vital evidence from the FISA court and deceived the judges, you're perpetrating a fraud on the court, you're also committing perjury, because Comey who signed the first FISA warrant applications, signed a certification under penalty of perjury, verifying that the information was true and accurate, when he knew it wasn't. They hadn't verified any of the collusion allegations upon which they relied. And not only that, when they received subsequent information, Rule 13 tells them they must immediately run back to the FISA court and notify the judges of new information, so that the judges may reevaluate whether the spying and surveillance on Carter Page could continue. They didn't do that either. So, they broke, as identify in my book, a myriad of laws in my judgment, including six different felonies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Sara, you've been at this for 2 1/2 years. I feel we have overwhelming, incontrovertible evidence that Hillary Clinton violated multiple aspects of the Espionage Act. I believe what she did with the deletions and everything else, I believe all of that was obstruction. I believe that -- these warrants, these FISA warrants were obtained illegally. I believe a premeditated fraud was committed on the court. And I also believe that we accused the intelligence to spy on Americans by outsourcing it. Do you believe the inspector general will find that those four warrants, the original and the four on the three subsequent renewals, were obtained illegally?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, I absolutely do believe that he's going on do that. And we're going to see that in Horowitz' report, and I think John Durham is going to drill right in to that, because this is the - - in essence, this is the law that we physically can see was broken, Sean. If what we are hearing, if all of the evidence that we've obtained over the last 2 1/2 years, is accurate as I believe it is, and all of the sourcing that we've been told that that these FISA applications were fraudulent signed, remember, I think a lot of people forget this, but the former Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, when she was under questioning by Congress behind closed doors, she basically had selective amnesia when they got to these questions, did you know about this, did you review those FISA applications? And she said, no, she did not review the FISA applications even though it was under her purview, because the buck stops with her. So, not only is she responsible, but certainly the people, the signatories, Comey as well as Andrew McCabe. Remember the fourth FISA application, actually renewal, was signed by Rod Rosenstein. So, that's going to be very interesting. What was in all of these renewal applications? So, yes, I absolutely believe that Horowitz is going to find a mountain of evidence in that. It's going to be a scathing report. It's going to point directly at all of the malfeasance because the only reason why they would ignore that evidence is because they wanted to spy."

That's a pretty significant fact."

For example, I got a commitment from President Bush he was not going to go to war in Iraq. He looked me in the eye in the Oval Office. He said he needed the vote to be able to get inspectors in into Iraq to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program. He got them in and before we know, we had shock and awe. Immediately the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "OK. But the little problem with all that, you see, Biden was still out publicly backing the war for many, many months, more than he's claiming. Here's a sample of his remarks back in 2003 and 2004. Joe needs to learn to tell the truth."

But the cost of not acting against Saddam, I think, would have been much greater, and so is the cost and so will be the cost of not finishing this job. I'm convinced that we can still succeed, if we level with the American people about the costs and the risks, if we develop a coherent plan for success, and if we bring the Iraqi people and the rest of the world with us."

And, of course, we told you this would happen. Biden wouldn't be able to keep his stories straight and escape his past. He'd be spinning in a million different directions.

It is revealing, first of all how far left that party has moved just in the past five years. The radical things they're talking about were the fringe just five years ago. Now they're mainstream in the Presidential race. But also revealing because about what they want to do? If you listen to this, you come to realize just how convenient a crisis climate is right? Most things you got a problem in the banking sector, you got to go fix the banks. This one, if you got a climate problem it means the left gets to rule everything in your life. It can tell you what you can eat, what can you drive, what toilet paper can you use, what kind of house can you live in, what we have to teach in school, what the military looks like? What industries are allowed to exist and how they are to be regulated? It is the ultimate tool for running the country.

Now there's weather Joe, and weather Joe and climate Joe intersect because I was taught from a very early age that the foundation you stand on today was built yesterday to reach for tomorrow. And ignorance about the past leads to arrogance about the future. So what did I do? I realized that the weather is a majestic system, it doesn't stop, I went back and gave what my father taught me to do. Go back and look at the past. Study the past. Study your history and then when you see something show up on the weather maps chances are you have an up on it. I will tell you this; I'll give you an example. Do you think for one minute that Mayor of South Bend knows that in 1963, '64 and '66 three category-4 hurricanes hit in the same spot in Hispaniola? Does he know hurricane Flora in 63 stalled for four days with 100 inches of rain over Eastern Cuba? Well, how about Jeanne, in '63. Three loops of the eastern sea board, there were countless examples Sean. I even mailed you something, well I don't know if you saw it. The 1924 hurricane, the third one of the season had almost the same exact track and movement as Dorian, except it was 50 to 60 miles further North in the Bahamas.

And although the unemployment rate has solved some of issues, some of the community is still struggling. And I guarantee that the Democrats Party proposals, isn't going to help improve the community. I think that's what you see with Isaiah. He is not pleased with any political party. He's just saying who's going to save my community?

We have now close to 8 million Americans that were on food stamps under Biden-Obama that are off. We have 8-plus million new jobs created. We have manufacturing coming back.

Mr. Washington said it best, when he basically was a critical thinker about it, and said I vote for the policies not the party, not the person. And because I stepped back and evaluated my community and what has changed in the past 50 years, which has been nothing. Then I asked these critical questions. Instead from the left in the mainstream media we get simply don't wear any hat that is red or you might trigger someone or let's boycott this business.

But at the time I didn't know what was going to come out on the other end. I thought that the risk was low for me and that's why, one of many reasons I wanted to do it. One of my great fears, was that may be we would do all of this and maybe it still wouldn't work. I didn't know how I would cope with that if I were to lose my sister. I can't bear to think about that. We both had faith. And she texted me the morning of the surgery, she's so strong, she's my younger sister.
