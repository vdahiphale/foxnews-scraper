It's always like some tiny bird on a plate - all bones and veins. It's like you're eating an old lady's fist. Trump's been there many times.

Anyway, this media response again proves two things. The press will use anything to trash Trump and it's as if the trashing is always in lockstep, because it is. According to the Media Research Center, for Trump in 2018, coverage was 90% negative and for the second year in a row, Russia was the most covered Trump topic, which makes me think if space aliens landed on earth and proceeded to devour the human race, annihilating billions of innocent humans in a brutal rampage of mutilation and dismemberment, the surviving media would ask how does this affect the Mueller probe?

To get to D.C., I have to take a train through Delaware and Baltimore first, which is like having sex with two goats in order to have sex with a mule.

America loves the underdog even if he's a dog. Number two, if you kick Trump out of office, that leaves us with Pence who is Conservative he makes Trump look like Mother Teresa and number three, if it succeeds, you still have Trump around who's folk hero status will make him bigger than Paul Bunyan and he's not going away, friends.

It's always like some tiny bird on a plate - all bones and veins. It's like you're eating an old lady's fist. Trump's been there many times.

Anyway, this media response again proves two things. The press will use anything to trash Trump and it's as if the trashing is always in lockstep, because it is. According to the Media Research Center, for Trump in 2018, coverage was 90% negative and for the second year in a row, Russia was the most covered Trump topic, which makes me think if space aliens landed on earth and proceeded to devour the human race, annihilating billions of innocent humans in a brutal rampage of mutilation and dismemberment, the surviving media would ask how does this affect the Mueller probe?

The best thing that they should do, it's a razor company so maybe talk about if you're hairy, try this razor. You know what I am saying?

If you take that brain and put it in a machine whose sole purpose is to stay alive, procreate and kill things around it that's a threat and it can manufacture itself into a larger size, you can kiss our human asses goodbye and there will be no debating with it. You need to be careful with this type of technology because that brain has been around for a really long time. It's almost perfect in terms of survival and moving on. It might decide that you'll throw a bunch and they'll realize - a little sick tiny dude. He kept us in his sick jacket is worth eating, so they'll take you down."
