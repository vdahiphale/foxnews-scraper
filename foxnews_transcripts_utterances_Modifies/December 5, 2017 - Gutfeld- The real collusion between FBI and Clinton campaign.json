      "utterance": "If Flynn's lies warrant a charge, why don't Huma and Cheryl? It's a good question. Especially when the same lawyer also change a vital phrase in Comey's statement about Hillary's email. \"Grossly negligent,\" my nickname, became \"extremely careless.\" That small change reduced Hillary's action from criminal to merely incompetent and that ironically preserved Hillary's nomination, helping pave the way for Donald Trump. That's pretty hilarious, if you're not a Democrat -- you should be really angry. So do these revelations mean Mueller probe is biased? Maybe. But this whole thing went from being about colluding with Russians to anything involving a Russian. If you rooted for Drago in \"Rocky IV\" then you're guilty. I did."
