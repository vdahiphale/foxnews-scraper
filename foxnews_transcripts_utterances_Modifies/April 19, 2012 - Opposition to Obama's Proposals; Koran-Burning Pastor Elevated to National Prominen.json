The public and the electorate view of the economy is cooked in the cake and I think has been for a month or more.   But there is one extremely good idea in this, and that is the accelerated depreciation for business investment, which I think they said might cost $100 billion or more, maybe even up to $200 billion. Now it -- obviously it would have to be enacted first, but it may be too little, too late for the campaign, but it's not too little to really help the economy. Remember in 1981, and some of us can, they were part -- accelerated depreciation was part, along with the reduction in the individual tax rates, of the Reagan stimulus package, which famously worked. And this is something that accelerated depreciation, which should have been in the stimulus from the beginning. Spending $50 billion more on infrastructure, which I don't think will pass anyway, you know, that's just more of what has already failed. But the problem -- but the problem here is the one that John Boehner mentioned.   On the one hand if you get this accelerated depreciation passed, that would have an effect on economic growth, a good effect. But then if you let the tax increases for the people making over $200,000 if you're single or $250,000 for a couple, the tax increases that go into effect on capital gains, that will have the opposite effect.",

Look, there is one oddity in the president, and we saw it in the clip that you played earlier, in which he stands up and he says we're going to do a stimulus -- a mini-stimulus -- with all these wonderful effects, the rail and airports and road projects, and then he says we will do the targeted tax cuts that will improve our economy, stimulate growth, improve employment. And then he says because it's a political season, the Republicans oppose it for pure partisan advantage. There is a raging contradiction in the middle of that. These ideas are so self-evidently good and they're going to help everybody and the economy, what possible advantage would anybody have, Republican or otherwise, in opposing it?   Now, it's a ridiculous argument, but he makes it because he does not want to engage the opposition on the substance of his proposals. What we have is a deep philosophical difference. Democrats -- Republicans like broad-based, across the board cuts in taxes, so you give the money to the entrepreneur who can dispense with it as he thinks the business needs. Democrats love the targeted tax cut because it gives power in Washington of deciding where capital ends up. So for example, there's nothing inherently wrong with a rebate if you invest in office equipment and stuff like that. However, what if your business needs not that but more money spent on marketing?  The better idea is to keep the Bush cuts, all the money to remain in pocket of entrepreneur and have him decide, much more efficiently, on where the money ought to be spent instead of experts in Washington deciding how to direct it.",

But it does give the Democrats something to talk about. Their original economic message is now inoperable because the economy didn't improve. That -- plan \"a\" was that there would be a recovery summer and things would be better by now, and they could say it's not great, but it's going in the right direction. The recovery stalled and they need something else to talk about. But Boehner doesn't want to talk about this. He wants to talk about the bigger debate, which they're going to have over the Bush tax cuts."

      "utterance": "Well, there must have been a shovel shortage. Look, there is one oddity in the president, and we saw it in the clip that you played earlier, in which he stands up and he says we're going to do a stimulus -- a mini-stimulus -- with all these wonderful effects, the rail and airports and road projects, and then he says we will do the targeted tax cuts that will improve our economy, stimulate growth, improve employment. And then he says because it's a political season, the Republicans oppose it for pure partisan advantage. There is a raging contradiction in the middle of that. These ideas are so self-evidently good and they're going to help everybody and the economy, what possible advantage would anybody have, Republican or otherwise, in opposing it? Now, it's a ridiculous argument, but he makes it because he does not want to engage the opposition on the substance of his proposals. What we have is a deep philosophical difference. Democrats -- Republicans like broad-based, across the board cuts in taxes, so you give the money to the entrepreneur who can dispense with it as he thinks the business needs. Democrats love the targeted tax cut because it gives power in Washington of deciding where capital ends up. So for example, there's nothing inherently wrong with a rebate if you invest in office equipment and stuff like that. However, what if your business needs not that but more money spent on marketing? The better idea is to keep the Bush cuts, all the money to remain in pocket of entrepreneur and have him decide, much more efficiently, on where the money ought to be spent instead of experts in Washington deciding how to direct it."

So it's not as if it's widespread or represents anything. And with Petraeus being important figure in American life expressing himself, and the State Department expressing itself, it makes it a much larger issue than otherwise would be. So I regret that, though I'm not sure if Petraeus had a choice. He had to express himself since the troops, there were stones thrown as a passing patrol and it could get worse."

What I think is remarkable is right after 9/11, there were a lot of people who thought there would be tremendous anti-Islam, anti-Muslim sentiment in the United States, and there wasn't. There wasn't for a very long time. I think that is to many people's credit, including George W. Bush, who spoke out often about how Islam is a religion of peace, and radical terrorists are not representatives of the religion. But now you are seeing this, and I think the only thing good about it is I haven't seen anybody come out and support what the church is doing."

And this is a provocation and that's what General Petraeus is worried about. This is what Terry Jones said -- you know, he put together 10 reasons to burn Koran and put together five more, up to 15 now. But he also said this, that his church and so on is not responsible for the violent actions anyone may take in retaliation to our protests. Well, if Americans are killed in Afghanistan or somewhere else then they are responsible, and that's why he should not do this. And besides, that, this is not an act a Christian pastor ought to be doing. Christians are assigned the job of the Great Commission, which is to go out and convert the world. Burning the Koran is not a good evangelical tool, believe me."
