      "sentences": "Tucker, good to see you. The President of course campaigned on making America great again, so tonight's first big theme is what they call \"Choosing Greatness\" at the White House. He is going to try to make the case, he's already accomplished a lot of that despite distractions from various investigations, plus a Democratic Party dominated by resist.  They stage for the President to lay the groundwork for his 2020 reelection by touting gains in the economy from low unemployment to rising wages as he also zeros in on what he wants to get done this year in the face of an even more hostile political environment, with of course, Speaker Nancy Pelosi be front and center tonight. She is now running a House populated with lawmakers who want to block his agenda, possibly even impeach him.  White House officials previewing he will focus on this -- safe and legal immigration, protecting American workers, rebuilding America, lowering the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs and protecting America's national security.  That sounds fairly bipartisan, yet yesterday, 24 hours before the speech, Democrat Chuck Schumer charged the speech will be full of lies and that the state of the Trump Presidency is full of incompetence. Not a good sign for the second big them of the speech, \"Unity,\" nor is the fact that Schumer today declared the President is just a warm-up act for former Georgia State House Minority Leader, Stacey Abrams giving the Democratic response. That explains why breaking tonight, \"The New York Times\" is quoting aides as saying the President has been privately complaining early drafts of this speech were too kind to Democrats. And sources I have spoken to say they have been meeting with the President in recent days, they say he is saying in private, the administration has already found billions of dollars in unspent military construction funds that could be re-spent on a border wall, repurposed. One way he could go around Democrats in the Congress without formally declaring a national emergency, Tucker.",

Well, you are looking now at live pictures of the U.S. Capitol building, the steps where we are now. The President will deliver his State of the Union address there in a little over an hour. We will have continuing coverage of that, of course all night. But first, we want to bring you more news from the newly volatile Commonwealth of Virginia. Just 24 hours ago, it was a completely different picture. At that point, the state's Lieutenant Governor, Justin Fairfax fully expected a job promotion, of course, because the Governor, Ralph Northam was found to have a Klan hood on his med school yearbook page.  But that is not how it worked out. Now, Justin Fairfax himself is stands accused of serious wrongdoing. A politics professor from California called Vanessa Tyson says that Fairfax sexually assaulted her in her hotel room at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Her description of that is graphic.   Now, Tyson is an active Democrat. She's got degrees from Princeton and University of Chicago. It is not easy to dismiss her claims out of hand, and yet Fairfax is. He says there was a sexual encounter between the two, but he described it as consensual. Here is the interesting thing, his Democratic colleagues are standing with him and against her tonight. In other words, in the space of just a few months, the standard for believing sexual assault accusers has changed completely. So here, in case you have forgotten, is how prominent Democrats responded to the unsubstantiated allegations brought against Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, watch.",

It is just a he said-she said story, they said, pushed by some professor out in California. The irony is unbelievable but it's definitely not worthy of print. Just so you know the standard.

I think something happened to her, but then we determined as this unfolded that it was likely not Brett Kavanaugh.

Ms. Tyson now is being abandoned by the very same people who said that, you know, this is the most important issue in the world and they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh over this, and it happens to women all the time and every day.

Those are human lives, no one doubts that, the snuffed out on their way to birth because we allow it and we allow it later in pregnancies than many other countries do. And this is just the latest example. Then comes along Dr. Northam, now, Governor Northam describing a process where the child is born, resuscitated if necessary, made comfortable, so alive for sure, and then a discussion would ensue between the mother and her doctor about -- and only thing I can think that that could possibly refer to is whether they will let the baby live or not.

Also, there has been shifting demographics in the State of Georgia, so the Democratic Party would like to see Georgia more competitive for a Presidential race in 2020, so having a strong candidate on the ballot running statewide would help Democrats in that effort. Further, since she lost her gubernatorial bid for governor, she started this group called Fair Fight, and as you know, voter suppression railing against it was a key campaign theme of hers in gubernatorial bid. But a lot of those accusations really did not hold water because if you look at it, the midterm elections in Georgia reached near historic levels. Also leading up to the election, there was a historic amount of voters registered to vote. Further, a lot of the things she took issue with like the purging of the voter rules, those were existing laws like \"use it or lose it\" and a similar law in Ohio was upheld by the Supreme Court.

She supports single payers. She said that she advocated for illegal immigrant voting. She said that was going to be a pathway for the blue wave. Also, when she was in the state legislature in Georgia, she cosponsored legislation that would ban certain weapons and also opened the door for gun confiscations.

I am going to be speaking with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow on Fox Business at 7:00 a.m. and I am going to ask him about the military side of China. Because right now, what you have going on is so-called Confucius Centers in and around Silicon Valley where they are acting like a seeding place, where they are sharing research. People are going -- working at Stanford back to the Confucius Centers. There is a lot of sharing of information going on with China away from trade. There is also issues about espionage. How is the world going to trust China when we know that there is spying going on? That they are talking with African countries and saying \"Look, we will set up your telecom infrastructure,\" and then they are tapping right into their entire information and intelligence. There is that -- they even did that with Poland, by the way. Then there is the issue of USMCA, NAFTA 2.0. Will the President give us news on that tonight? Many Democrats that you've spoken with, I've spoken with continue to say, \"I'm not voting for it in the form that it is.\" If we do not see USMCA pass, that's going to be a major blow for this administration because if we can't get a deal done with Canada and Mexico, what does that mean for the Europeans? What does that mean for other countries that the President is trying to do trade deals with? So I would say trade is probably one of the most important issues that the President can discuss can tonight and we will see what he says. The China story is so much bigger than just the Chinese buying more stuff from the United States. We know that China is willing to open up its markets to financial services, what about the President's manufacturing base? We know that China wants to buy more soybeans and more grain, what about IP theft and the forced transfer or technology? These are the important issues.

The President also lobbied some major pharmaceutical companies not to raise their drug prices last summer, and because of easing regulations and speeding up approvals, in Fiscal 2018, the FDA approved more generic drugs than ever before. Tonight, you will likely hear the President tout the next step, which is to eliminate rebates. That is money paid by drug manufacturers to make sure their drugs are covered by health insurance companies so that pharmacies can easily sell them to consumers. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says rebates drive up patients cost though some medical experts disagree. Meantime, on the other side of the aisle, the rallying cries clearly Medicare for All, with the goal of scrapping private insurers in favor of government run healthcare. There are a few iterations of single payer healthcare, but the common denominator is higher taxes and as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says quote, \"Medicare for all would bankrupt us for a very long time.\" Tucker.",

The people who run the country are gathered in one large group under the dome tonight, but not Rick Perry. The White House, by the way, says the President will focus on national security in the speech tonight. There is no shortage of topics he can address. The proposed withdrawal from Syria, the peace talks in Afghanistan, the status of North Korea's nuclear program -- those are just three of them.

And then they need to understand that that is why we are engaged in this trade war, which, by the way has been pretty darn successful. So I would want him to focus on that particular piece. The second, I want him to really hone in and talk about why we need to untangle ourselves from some of these wars that we have been involved in, because it no longer serves the national interest or we just can't get the job done, right? So we have seen this in Afghanistan, around about a trillion dollars of spending including $8 billion for an Afghani Air Force that does not particularly function. And yet, we can't find $5 billion to fund a wall. So we need to frame some of these mistakes, some of these challenges in that way and we need to talk about Syria, as well which you referenced earlier. And we need to have a very clear understanding that 2,000 troops is not going to solve the Syrian crisis.

One of them of course is whether he can get out of this shutdown business that he is facing once again with some money for a wall and a deal that he can claim as a victory. And the second thing is, he needs to make a deal with China on trade that will take the China standoff out of the danger range for the U.S. economy and give him a better chance of having this economy still going briskly along when his reelection comes around next year. And I think those two things rank very high. It would be very interesting to hear what he says about those two issues. It will be interesting to see if in an effort to make a deal, he extends further concessions or suggest the possibility at least of further concessions to the Democrats on border security and immigration where he's got a lot of room to move there.

The President of course campaigned on making America great again, so tonight's first big theme is what they call \"Choosing Greatness\" at the White House. He is going to try to make the case, he's already accomplished a lot of that despite distractions from various investigations, plus a Democratic Party dominated by resist. They stage for the President to lay the groundwork for his 2020 reelection by touting gains in the economy from low unemployment to rising wages as he also zeros in on what he wants to get done this year in the face of an even more hostile political environment, with of course, Speaker Nancy Pelosi be front and center tonight. She is now running a House populated with lawmakers who want to block his agenda, possibly even impeach him. White House officials previewing he will focus on this -- safe and legal immigration, protecting American workers, rebuilding America, lowering the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs and protecting America's national security. That sounds fairly bipartisan, yet yesterday, 24 hours before the speech, Democrat Chuck Schumer charged the speech will be full of lies and that the state of the Trump Presidency is full of incompetence. Not a good sign for the second big them of the speech, \"Unity,\" nor is the fact that Schumer today declared the President is just a warm-up act for former Georgia State House Minority Leader, Stacey Abrams giving the Democratic response. That explains why breaking tonight, \"The New York Times\" is quoting aides as saying the President has been privately complaining early drafts of this speech were too kind to Democrats. And sources I have spoken to say they have been meeting with the President in recent days, they say he is saying in private, the administration has already found billions of dollars in unspent military construction funds that could be re-spent on a border wall, repurposed. One way he could go around Democrats in the Congress without formally declaring a national emergency, Tucker."

We will have continuing coverage of that, of course all night. But first, we want to bring you more news from the newly volatile Commonwealth of Virginia. Just 24 hours ago, it was a completely different picture. At that point, the state's Lieutenant Governor, Justin Fairfax fully expected a job promotion, of course, because the Governor, Ralph Northam was found to have a Klan hood on his med school yearbook page. But that is not how it worked out. Now, Justin Fairfax himself is stands accused of serious wrongdoing. A politics professor from California called Vanessa Tyson says that Fairfax sexually assaulted her in her hotel room at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Her description of that is graphic. Now, Tyson is an active Democrat. She's got degrees from Princeton and University of Chicago. It is not easy to dismiss her claims out of hand, and yet Fairfax is. He says there was a sexual encounter between the two, but he described it as consensual. Here is the interesting thing, his Democratic colleagues are standing with him and against her tonight. In other words, in the space of just a few months, the standard for believing sexual assault accusers has changed completely. So here, in case you have forgotten, is how prominent Democrats responded to the unsubstantiated allegations brought against Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, watch."

I think something happened to her, but then we determined as this unfolded that it was likely not Brett Kavanaugh.

And what I predicted during Kavanaugh has come true. Ms. Tyson now is being abandoned by the very same people who said that, you know, this is the most important issue in the world and they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh over this, and it happens to women all the time and every day. And now, we are looking at women suspiciously. If you are a Democrat, if you are accusing a Democrat, you aren't to be taken seriously. If you are accusing a Republican, you should.

Richard Goodstein may know, he was an advisor to both of the Clintons and he joins us tonight. And I would just say two things really quick in preface. One, you were on a lot during the Kavanaugh hearings, and you were not one of the people saying that we have to believe all women simply because they are women. We checked the tape today actually, so good for you. But many in your party made that case on the specific question of sexual assault. They said it's not like bank fraud or even regular assault, it's a very different category and people who have been victims of it must be believed automatically, axiomatically, and if you don't believe them, people said this on our set and got emotional saying it, then you're a misogynists.

Republican Ben Sass introduced legislation after Democrats in multiple states advanced legislation that makes it possible to have an abortion right to the end of the third trimester right into dilation.

I just wanted to -- I should point out that what that Sass bill did was to say that if a child wanted or unwanted is somehow born and survives abortion, they should get medical care. And obviously should not be put to death. And the Democratic objection to it was that, \"Well, you know, we have laws against killing and infanticide, so this was not needed.\" But this was a little more than that. It did require medical attention which rather than have a doctor be able to simply say, \"Well, after consulting with the mother,\" as Ralph Northam described, \"The kid is in bad shape, just let the little critter die.\" Well, that would be forbidden by this bill, and a single -- and it needed unanimous consent to proceed on the Senate floor, and they didn't get it.

And they cheered the passage of that. You know, that is the kind of a measure that if found it necessary for some medical reason, I can't really imagine, but if there were such a reason you would pass it soberly and with regret that it was needed."

They think abortion should be celebrated. And we are now at the point where we're in the neighborhood of 60 million abortions. Those are human lives, no one doubts that, the snuffed out on their way to birth because we allow it and we allow it later in pregnancies than many other countries do. And this is just the latest example. Then comes along Dr. Northam, now, Governor Northam describing a process where the child is born, resuscitated if necessary, made comfortable, so alive for sure, and then a discussion would ensue between the mother and her doctor about -- and only thing I can think that that could possibly refer to is whether they will let the baby live or not. And his aides have claims have claimed that's not what he meant and then of course, his further misfortunes ensued after that and now, we have another issue as you have just been talking about, about Justin Fairfax. Two issues that the Democrats thought were helpful to them -- abortion and race -- now working against them it seems to me."

      "speaker": "LISA BOOTHE, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Hi, Tucker. Well, yes, so Stacey Abrams, as you know, she ran for Governor in 2018 against Bryan Kemp and she lost, and the reason why she was tasked tonight is because Senator Chuck Schumer would love to see her run for Senate in 2020 against David Perdue. Also, there has been shifting demographics in the State of Georgia, so the Democratic Party would like to see Georgia more competitive for a Presidential race in 2020, so having a strong candidate on the ballot running statewide would help Democrats in that effort. Further, since she lost her gubernatorial bid for governor, she started this group called Fair Fight, and as you know, voter suppression railing against it was a key campaign theme of hers in gubernatorial bid. But a lot of those accusations really did not hold water because if you look at it, the midterm elections in Georgia reached near historic levels. Also leading up to the election, there was a historic amount of voters registered to vote. Further, a lot of the things she took issue with like the purging of the voter rules, those were existing laws like \"use it or lose it\" and a similar law in Ohio was upheld by the Supreme Court. Further, that law was passed by a Democratic state legislator and was signed into law by a Democratic governor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, there has been some Republicans tonight that have kind of been making fun of her for her non-concession speech. She said that democracy failed Georgia, but as I pointed out, it didn't. And I think another thing that's really interesting tonight about her giving the Democratic response is just how far the party has shifted because there is this controversy over Bernie Sanders also giving his own state of the response tonight, but, there is really not a lot of daylight between Stacey Abrams' policies and his. She supports single payers. She said that she advocated for illegal immigrant voting. She said that was going to be a pathway for the blue wave. Also, when she was in the state legislature in Georgia, she cosponsored legislation that would ban certain weapons and also opened the door for gun confiscations. So there's not a lot of daylight between her policies and Bernie Sanders, so it is sort of interesting to me to see the Democratic Party in this controversy and uproar over Bernie Sanders giving his own response when her policies and her positions really aren't that different from his."

That has been put to bed. And if you think about that, the plan, if you actually read his plan and listen to his plan, the $5.7 billion is only for 230 miles of additional barrier. If you add what we already have, that still leaves a thousand miles of the southwest border that does not have a barrier. So I hope he is able to really talk to the facts, and so the American people really understand what his plan is. He supports what the Democrats want - technology. He supports what the Democrats want as more personnel. So I hope he's actually able to get that across to the American people."

No one has ever said that - the experts. What they said is it's an integral part of multilayered approach, but they are not listening. Although, I will say in 2006, they listened, in 2013, the Senate passed bipartisan bill.

This is one of the most important issues that he can talk to us about tonight. Obviously, the usual suspects are on the agenda -- immigration, trade, infrastructure, prescription drug prices, but when you are talking about trade, the China talks well beyond just trade. I am going to be speaking with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tomorrow on Fox Business at 7:00 a.m. and I am going to ask him about the military side of China. Because right now, what you have going on is so-called Confucius Centers in and around Silicon Valley where they are acting like a seeding place, where they are sharing research. People are going -- working at Stanford back to the Confucius Centers. There is a lot of sharing of information going on with China away from trade. There is also issues about espionage. How is the world going to trust China when we know that there is spying going on? That they are talking with African countries and saying \"Look, we will set up your telecom infrastructure,\" and then they are tapping right into their entire information and intelligence. There is that -- they even did that with Poland, by the way. Then there is the issue of USMCA, NAFTA 2.0. Will the President give us news on that tonight? Many Democrats that you've spoken with, I've spoken with continue to say, \"I'm not voting for it in the form that it is.\" If we do not see USMCA pass, that's going to be a major blow for this administration because if we can't get a deal done with Canada and Mexico, what does that mean for the Europeans? What does that mean for other countries that the President is trying to do trade deals with? So I would say trade is probably one of the most important issues that the President can discuss can tonight and we will see what he says. The China story is so much bigger than just the Chinese buying more stuff from the United States. We know that China is willing to open up its markets to financial services, what about the President's manufacturing base? We know that China wants to buy more soybeans and more grain, what about IP theft and the forced transfer or technology? These are the important issues. We will see if the President brings these topics up along with the other list of items."

They will speed over to Capitol Hill and then of course, there's the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Vice President of the United States shaking hands with the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi standing at the podium. Of course, the Vice President being the head, at least ceremonially of the Senate and the tiebreaker. Civics lesson over, on to this, politicians have been promising to increase healthcare coverage and lower healthcare costs for decades and the President may weigh into that tonight in the speech. Do the two parties have anything in common on the question of healthcare? Fox's Trace Gallagher has been looking closely at this issue and joins us tonight on that -- Trace."

      "utterance": "Hey, Tucker, when the President talked tonight about his administration's pushed to lower prescription drug prices, he is building on significant momentum because despite critics going into the fact-check frenzy every time Mr. Trump talks numbers, the Council of Economic Advisors has confirmed the President's claim that during 2018, U.S. consumers saved $26 billion on prescription medication. The President also lobbied some major pharmaceutical companies not to raise their drug prices last summer, and because of easing regulations and speeding up approvals, in Fiscal 2018, the FDA approved more generic drugs than ever before. Tonight, you will likely hear the President tout the next step, which is to eliminate rebates. That is money paid by drug manufacturers to make sure their drugs are covered by health insurance companies so that pharmacies can easily sell them to consumers. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says rebates drive up patients cost though some medical experts disagree. Meantime, on the other side of the aisle, the rallying cries clearly Medicare for All, with the goal of scrapping private insurers in favor of government run healthcare. There are a few iterations of single payer healthcare, but the common denominator is higher taxes and as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says quote, \"Medicare for all would bankrupt us for a very long time.\" Tucker."

Democrats have been advocating, in many cases, policies that were considered far too radical, even during the Obama administration two and a half years ago. You're hearing Democrats' campaign on, among other things, Medicare for All, a top tax rate of 90%, a Green New Deal that would ban fossil fuels within 12 years, shut down America's burgeoning energy industry, make commercial air travel impossible and make your car or illegal. The shift has been so profound that a majority of Democratic voters told Pew just last month they think their party should be quote, \"more moderate.\" Should it be more moderate? Jon Summers served as Communications Director for Senator Harry Reid and he joins us now and even as he joins us, of course, you are watching the President of the United States enter his vehicle for the trip down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Congress. Jon, thanks a lot for joining us tonight."

I think there is a robust discussion that is taking place right n ow, and I think it is one that we've talked about before that needs to take place at this moment in time. So I'm one of the many people who is actually excited about the primary that we have coming up, the diverse field of candidates that we have coming up to the plate because I think they bring a variety of ideas that are worthy of public debate. So we are expanding beyond the typical Republican talking points and Democratic talking points."

I completely agree and that is why I can't stand the censorship that is underway in this country right now. But some of these ideas are probably nonstarters -- like shutting down the entire energy industry in 12 years, banning fossil fuels which would obviously, ban commercial air travel. I mean, that is not a thing that anybody supports, right?"
    },

      "speaker": "SUMMERS",

We are always going to have to have energy, but what we need to do is make a transition from dirty fossil fuels to clean energy. That is where we are. I mean, President Trump talked a lot about how he is going to put coal miners back to work. More coal plants have closed during the first two years of his Presidency than the entire first term of Obama and that is because we are making a shift toward clean energy, so let's embrace that and the jobs --"

What they are talking about is finding cleaner, more efficient ways of fueling those things. And so, you know, I think there is a lot more that we are on agreement on.

Can you went on this stuff? I think maybe -- by the way, obviously, am I biased at first? Things that seem crazy, seem normal if you say them enough. So I'm not sure what the answer is. What do you think?"

I mean, we are talking about how unrealistic it is to ban cars were or to ban airplanes within 12 years. It would destroy the economy. It would destroy job creation, and that has real effects on people. And so I am not sure it would go over well for Democrats to be pushing those ideas. You have something like Medicare for All which at least sounds good, it's more of a sentiment than an actual policy idea. You talk about destroying the economy or banning cars or doing these things that have real problems. I don't think there is much of a market for that. It doesn't make sense for people why they should accept something that would tax them to high heaven and destroy any chance that their children will have job and for what?"

The people who run the country are gathered in one large group under the dome tonight, but not Rick Perry. The White House, by the way, says the President will focus on national security in the speech tonight. There is no shortage of topics he can address. The proposed withdrawal from Syria, the peace talks in Afghanistan, the status of North Korea's nuclear program -- those are just three of them. Bryan Dean Wright is a Democrat who served in the Central Intelligence Agency, and now sits on our set frequently, good to see you."

      "speaker": "WRIGHT",
      "utterance": "I would have him focus on China because what I certainly know from talking to folks in the military and the intelligence committee, we are already in a low-grade war against the Chinese and that needs to be framed to the American people. They need to understand what we face and how hard it is going to be. And then they need to understand that that is why we are engaged in this trade war, which, by the way has been pretty darn successful. So I would want him to focus on that particular piece. The second, I want him to really hone in and talk about why we need to untangle ourselves from some of these wars that we have been involved in, because it no longer serves the national interest or we just can't get the job done, right? So we have seen this in Afghanistan, around about a trillion dollars of spending including $8 billion for an Afghani Air Force that does not particularly function. And yet, we can't find $5 billion to fund a wall. So we need to frame some of these mistakes, some of these challenges in that way and we need to talk about Syria, as well which you referenced earlier. And we need to have a very clear understanding that 2,000 troops is not going to solve the Syrian crisis. So I would say those three and certainly North Korea which we can talk about as well would round out my big concerns that I want him to express to the American people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But China would be the center of it, you said and I'm wondering because the points you made about China and the point the President often makes about China or hard to dispute, they are our greatest geostrategic rival, they spy on us more than any other country, they take a lot of our industrial secrets and use them to beat us in the marketplace and et cetera, et cetera. Do you think that he will find sympathetic ears among any Democrats in the room when and if he says that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WRIGHT",
      "utterance": "Well, I sure hope not, certainly as an American and definitely, as a Democrat because there is no real space or there shouldn't be in the party for having a compassionate or understanding perspective for the Chinese government or quite frankly, for the Chinese people other than they are existing under the tyranny, under the yolk of this communist regime and they have for many years, and that needs to be part of that focus as well. Reminding the American people that the over billion folks are suffering under a communist regime."

It's a sign, they say, these Democrats of supporting all women and they want to show the President, clearly, who will be looking straight at them, that they support women. Now, it is interesting because we've got experts from the President's remarks and at one point he says, \"All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.\" So that is only one quick excerpt. So clearly, the White House knew maybe something like this was coming and he is going to address it that he supports women in the workforce. He wants equal pay. Those kinds of things to just kind of say, \"Look, this is for show obviously,\" and it also is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is one of the organizers of this because she is on social media posing with her guests tonight who she gave a ticket to, and it is the activists who confronted Senator Jeff Flake in that elevator during the Kavanaugh confirmation process over sexual assault issues.

Within about 24 hours, the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who you see front and center said, \"Wall is not on the table. No money for the wall.\" So to your question about symbolism, they say everything is on the table on immigration and border security. Within 24 hours, the Speaker of the House says no."

And I don't know that this will be any different. And I think coming up are two things that will turn out to be more important for this presidency and its future prospects. One of them of course is whether he can get out of this shutdown business that he is facing once again with some money for a wall and a deal that he can claim as a victory. And the second thing is, he needs to make a deal with China on trade that will take the China standoff out of the danger range for the U.S. economy and give him a better chance of having this economy still going briskly along when his reelection comes around next year. And I think those two things rank very high. It would be very interesting to hear what he says about those two issues. It will be interesting to see if in an effort to make a deal, he extends further concessions or suggest the possibility at least of further concessions to the Democrats on border security and immigration where he's got a lot of room to move there. And I think, he would be inclined to do it if he thought he was going to get a reception."
