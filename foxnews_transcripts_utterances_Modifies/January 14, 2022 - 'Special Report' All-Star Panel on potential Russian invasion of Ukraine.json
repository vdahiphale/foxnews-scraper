Meantime, if you talk to intel folks or Defense officials, privately they'll tonight they feel more confident that Russia is going into Ukraine. Here is how \"The New York Times\" writes it, \"Russian President Vladimir Putin's extraordinary new demands and threats following his military buildup on the borders of Ukraine has brought NATO back to basics -- continuing Russian power and imperium. The more the discussion evoked the Cold War with its firm dividing line through Europe and its competing Russian and western systems and spheres of influence, the more it reminded European and American allies of NATO's purpose.\" We'll start there with our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent of \"The Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for Reuters. Jeff, let me start with you. I think we heard from the national security adviser, we heard from the Pentagon, and there are more and more words suggesting that Russia is increasingly aggressive. JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"REUTERS\": Absolutely, and the evidence of that is beyond rhetorical. It's also the amount of troops that are along the Russia-Ukraine border. And the president of Russia appears not to have made up his mind, at least that's what the United States is saying, but he certainly seems to be leaning that direction. This country is ready, the administration is ready. I think it is one of the biggest foreign policy challenges that President Biden will face, perhaps in the same scale as the drawdown from Afghanistan in terms of foreign policy challenges. But they have laid out and made very clear both to the public and directly to the Russians what they will do in terms of economic sanctions if that is in fact what Putin decides to do.",

The question isn't really whether we are going to use our military to defend Ukraine, or whether NATO will use its military to defend Ukraine, or whether we are going to be honest with them about how we are not going to be doing that. That does not mean that there aren't things that we can do. It's really also interesting to note that weakness can be provocative. Every time that Putin has made an incursion, it has been at a time of unique American weakness, whether that was when George W. Bush got embroiled in the Middle East, whether that was when Obama was doing his apology tour. This is where we saw incursions of Georgia and Crimea. And now once again we are dealing with this again, and it's very interesting that the one president of the last four presidents who didn't have this with Putin was the one who was not doing the foreign policy that much of the establishment supports. But Ukrainians did have us be honest with them so that they can make really good decisions about how they are going to handle what does appear to be a very serious threat there, and a likely incursion.",

In both cases the outcomes were within reach. However, his failures pursued the exact opposite approach. Instead of setting achievable goals, he set unrealistic expectations, and in a number of cases picked battles that he knew in advance he would lose.\" Thoughts?"

      "utterance": "I'm not sure. It seems that President Biden is taking much of the blame for what is pretty standard Democratic policy positions. All of these things that he has been pushing are supported by basically every single Democrat in the House and nearly every single Democrat in the Senate. And so I think that the media are always demonizing Republicans, but they don't deal with the chaos and confusion that's happening in the Democratic Party where the policies that work really well to get you elected in San Francisco and New York and in these gerrymandered districts that they have are not appealing to the rest of the country. And the rest of the country is giving Joe Biden poor performance ratings because the policies are not appealing to the American people. They are not moderate or unifying, as he promised."
