And the president says that undercuts Robert Mueller's probe with collusion and obstruction of justice.   Joining me now from South Carolina, Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy, chair of the House Oversight Committee. Mr. Chairman, we get to the I.G. report, I want to discuss how President Trump and his lead lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, are using the I.G. report.

Obstruction of justice, Chris, good luck having your star witness being Jim Comey in any prosecution, from shoplifting to obstruction of justice. Good luck if that's your start witness. For me, the Mueller is about what Russia did in 2016 and who, if anyone, they did it with. So, that's what I mean when I say Mueller probe, and I hope he does right to definitive accounting of what Russian did, but there's no evidence Donald Trump did it with them and Jim Comey would be about the starriest witness that I can imagine the prosecutor could have.",

The campaign and the presidency, we'll stop the campaign and if it doesn't work, the day after the election, he's talking about impeachment. So, how would you like that to be your lead investigator?

There are a lot of questions I have for him. Number one, you know, the Hillary Clinton failure to prosecute was predicated upon two things. Number one, that her emails were not exposed to foreign actors. There's some evidence that that's not true.  Number two, that there was no evidence of intent. Of course, there's no evidence of intent. He didn't bother to ask her. You went into the interview knowing that she was not going to be charged.  So, I think some members will ask about that. A lot of members are going to ask about the bias.

Why did you write an exoneration memo six weeks before she was interviewed? Why did you start playing in your press conference two months before the investigation was over? Here's where I depart from Chris Wray -- I don't think it's my job to prove the bias impacting the investigation. I think it's job to probe that it did not. Here's what I know: they exonerated her before the interview. They said she did nothing wrong before they even bothered to talk to her and the same group said Donald Trump should not be the president and/or should be impeached before the investigation even began.   If that is not textbook bias, which is the prejudging of an outcome, I mean, that's what bias is. We are prejudging the outcome. We're prejudging her innocence before we talk to her. We're prejudging his guilt before you even began to look into the fact pattern. That's bias, and, yes, it impacted the outcome.  She -- the most important element is intent. That's what they told us. She did not have the intent to commit a crime. The best way to figure that out is to talk to her. But they went into the interview, Chris, saying the only thing she'll be charged with is maybe lying to us.  If you're Donald Trump or if you're any other defendant in the country, how would you like that deal? We're not going to charge with anything as long as you tell us the truth. That is blanket immunity and everyone in the country would like that as they go into an interview with the FBI.",

It is a counterintelligence investigation that's become public. Most of them do not. It's a criminal investigation that has political overtones, most of them do not. Combine the two. It is a public counterintelligence investigation with political overtones. This is not your traditional investigation. So, I would encourage Bob Mueller, keep doing exactly what Rod Rosenstein hired you to do.  Bob Mueller did not volunteer. We're here because Rod Rosenstein decided we needed a special counsel. Do the very best you can with the evidence and the witnesses you have. But understand that this is being used by political enemies to hurt Donald Trump. Adam Schiff wants to be the chairperson of the House Intelligence Committee. Nancy Pelosi wants to be the speaker of the House. They want Bob Mueller want to do what Peter Strzok and Hillary Clinton could not do, which is beat Donald Trump. So, just be aware that you're being used would be my advice to Bob Mueller.",

When it comes to -- when it comes to the inspector general's report, I just want to point out, there's an uncomfortable reality buried in the inspector general's report for the Trump administration which is that they got five of the most important national security departments and agencies unfilled inspector general positions -- Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, the CIA.

His sorted record on human rights, on mistreating his own people was not only ignored, but, frankly, contradicted in many respects by the president's comments. The sanctions regime, which, again, the president, I think, and his staff did very well in putting it together, will dissipate given the lack of enthusiasm for enforcement, guarantees about the security of North Korea, which the president seemed to imply and is different than -- than the -- the maximum pressure campaign he's put on.

But I think if he just makes no more threats and doesn't test again, he's gotten away with becoming a nuclear nation, being recognized by the world and I think there will be more economic advantages to him. I think China will trade more and we won't punish China for trading with North Korea. And I think that, you know, yay him. Just one other comment. There are two winners here short term I think. One is China, which now has much more of an advantage in Asia now that we're suspending our exercises and possibly reducing or eliminating our troops in South Korea. But the other is Russia. Because of what we did with the G-7 and the new tariff plan -- let's not call it a war -- Europe is destabilized and that gives Russia huge advantages with respect to Ukraine and in the Middle East because were renounced the Iran deal, it seems to me, Russia has more free reign in Syria and parts of the Middle East.",

But when it comes down to policy matters here, there's one major challenge the Trump administration's facing that President Obama didn't really have to deal with back in 2012, '13 and '14, and that is North Korea's continued super aggressive gray zone warfare in cyberspace. I've been speaking to cyber expert and tech experts this week who say that during the lead up to the summit, even as the summit was ongoing, North Korea sponsored hackers were infiltrating U.S. banks, financial institutions and carrying out attacks on them. And this is something that they've not yet dealt with.

It used to be to the policy that if you came across the border, if you were a Mexican, you were immediately removed out of the country. Now apparently they're going to charge the Mexicans with an immigration violation. That makes it impossible for them to enter the country legally in the future to work or become a U.S. citizen. So the administration had taken the zero tolerance policy and rather than taking, you know, OTM's, we would hold them and move them out of the country within 30 or 35 days.

He's never told anyone what evidence he has. So, there's no evidence of collusion. Obstruction of justice, Chris, good luck having your star witness being Jim Comey in any prosecution, from shoplifting to obstruction of justice. Good luck if that's your start witness. For me, the Mueller is about what Russia did in 2016 and who, if anyone, they did it with. So, that's what I mean when I say Mueller probe, and I hope he does right to definitive accounting of what Russian did, but there's no evidence Donald Trump did it with them and Jim Comey would be about the starriest witness that I can imagine the prosecutor could have."

And I have never seen this level of bias. So, you have Peter Strzok who can't think of a single American who can vote for Donald Trump and you got Peter Strzok who says, we'll stop it. The campaign and the presidency, we'll stop the campaign and if it doesn't work, the day after the election, he's talking about impeachment. So, how would you like that to be your lead investigator? Two weeks after you're assigned to look into what a foreign country did to us, the only thing he can think to talk about is an insurance policy to keep Donald Trump from winning, and then he says we'll stop it.

And the good news, Chris, is Michael Horowitz proved what we wanted the FBI and the DOJ to do, which is that you can have an investigation that is fact-centric and fair and even-handed. There are a lot of questions I have for him. Number one, you know, the Hillary Clinton failure to prosecute was predicated upon two things. Number one, that her emails were not exposed to foreign actors. There's some evidence that that's not true. Number two, that there was no evidence of intent. Of course, there's no evidence of intent. He didn't bother to ask her. You went into the interview knowing that she was not going to be charged. So, I think some members will ask about that. A lot of members are going to ask about the bias.

If that is not textbook bias, which is the prejudging of an outcome, I mean, that's what bias is. We are prejudging the outcome. We're prejudging her innocence before we talk to her. We're prejudging his guilt before you even began to look into the fact pattern. That's bias, and, yes, it impacted the outcome. She -- the most important element is intent. That's what they told us. She did not have the intent to commit a crime. The best way to figure that out is to talk to her. But they went into the interview, Chris, saying the only thing she'll be charged with is maybe lying to us. If you're Donald Trump or if you're any other defendant in the country, how would you like that deal? We're not going to charge with anything as long as you tell us the truth. That is blanket immunity and everyone in the country would like that as they go into an interview with the FBI."

It is a public counterintelligence investigation with political overtones. This is not your traditional investigation. So, I would encourage Bob Mueller, keep doing exactly what Rod Rosenstein hired you to do. Bob Mueller did not volunteer. We're here because Rod Rosenstein decided we needed a special counsel. Do the very best you can with the evidence and the witnesses you have. But understand that this is being used by political enemies to hurt Donald Trump.

You had Devin Nunes, Bob Goodlatte, myself, and everyone you can think of from the FBI and the DOJ and we went item by item. On both of those outstanding subpoenas, we either have compliance, we have partial compliance, or we have noncompliance. And Paul made it very clear. There is going to be action on the floor of the House this week if the FBI and DOJ do not comply with our subpoena request. So, Rod Rosenstein, Chris Wray, you were in the meeting in the meeting, you understood as just as clearly as I did. We're going to get compliance, or the House of Representatives is going to use its full arsenal of constitutional weapons to gain compliance. This is too important. It was important before the I.G. report. The I.G. report has even heightened the need for us to understand what happened in 2016, so the new guys can either be part of the cleanup crew or they can be part of the cover-up crew.

Well, Karl, I've got to say, that was a different Trey Gowdy that we have heard because for weeks, for months, he's been the one Republican kind of pushing back on other Republicans and certainly the Trump White House or rushing to judgment, the Mueller is fake, he pushed back on spygate. Today, he was basically, it seemed to me, saying, that the I.G. report and what it found in terms of rampant bias on the part of Comey and Strzok and others has blown the Mueller investigation out of the water as far as it concerns president Trump."

But, it raises questions about what the FBI did in 2016 in Papadopoulos, and others in the Trump campaign. But at the end of it, we have in May of 2017, the appointment of Bob Mueller. And when he finds out literally in matter of days and weeks later, the text messages with Peter Strzok, he essentially fires him. He removes him from his position as head of the counterespionage section of the FBI. And because you can't fire an FBI agent, he has some detailed to human resources.

The Trump campaign leaks than worse than any I've seen in my life. If there was any collusion, we would have heard a hint about it from somebody inside the campaign. But at the end of the day, Mueller's investigation is going to be judged by the report of the Mueller investigation. We're going to make a judgment about it, and my sense is, is that it's going to clear the present of any question of collusion between his campaign and the Russians and there will be people like Paul Manafort who have real liability and have real legal problems because of their actions unconnected to the campaign."

Yes, he is a compromised witness, if he ever becomes a witness. All of that is right. But let's understand, let's -- that there are two different investigations. One was the investigation and what the I.G. looked at with the Clinton emails and things that happened in 2016. And the second is, Mueller's investigation.

And it's something that I think is causing a lot of -- causing people to pause and reflect upon their service in the intelligence community. When it comes to -- when it comes to the inspector general's report, I just want to point out, there's an uncomfortable reality buried in the inspector general's report for the Trump administration which is that they got five of the most important national security departments and agencies unfilled inspector general positions -- Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, the CIA. Even White House inspector general position is currently vacant. So, it's quite -- every time they lob sort of criticism against the Obama administration for the way they policed themselves, it highlights the fact that they are choosing not to police themselves at all -- at least up until now."

His sorted record on human rights, on mistreating his own people was not only ignored, but, frankly, contradicted in many respects by the president's comments. The sanctions regime, which, again, the president, I think, and his staff did very well in putting it together, will dissipate given the lack of enthusiasm for enforcement, guarantees about the security of North Korea, which the president seemed to imply and is different than -- than the -- the maximum pressure campaign he's put on. And then conceding with that any other quid pro quo, the exercises that we conduct with the South Koreans was, I think, a mistake. Indeed, the president chose to call them provocative war games, which are not the case at all. So, at the end of that summit, Kim Jong-un walked away, I think, with a great deal. And we're just now beginning to try to put together -- put it back together."

The top Democrat in the Senate Armed Services Committee, the president did agree to suspend joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States.

And if this goes for a long period of time, operationally we'll lose the skills that we need to collaborate with our colleagues in the region.

They have abused, in many respects, the free trade arrangements that have been built up over generations. They don't allow American companies to compete in China or international companies, as they are allowed to in other countries. They have, I think, used the trade system to their advantage. So the president, I think, is right in taking action. The question is, are these actions coordinated? I don't think so. I mean he -- before he left for the Singapore summit, he had a very, very difficult meeting with the G- 7. So he's not going into this trade battle with China with the unified effort by the western powers. And then, second, I think a lot of his judgements seem to be snap judgements. He imposed tariffs on countries aiming at China and it wound up sort of hitting Canada and other countries where we have not only trade relationships but very strong national security relationships. So the concept, I think, is right to go after China. The methods, I think, he employs, just, in many cases, is counterproductive. But to the trade war issue is, we are -- could be dangerously approaching such a trade war."

We had, a few months ago, we thought, a deal with the president with respect to some enhancement of water -- border security, including stretches of the wall. In return, the DACA, the dreamers, would be allowed to stay. At the last moment, that blew up. That was a fair, comprehensive, bargained negotiation and he just sort of walked away from it.

One was at the G-7, with Trump's sitting like this, glaring at Angela Merkel, and the second one in the exact same timeframe was shaking hands with Kim Jong-un and slightly later saluting in return to his salute a North American -- A North Korean general. How do I assess it? I think it's a short-term propaganda win for Kim. He got almost everything he wants. Jack Reed just said that, Senator Jack Reed, on your program. But I think if he just makes no more threats and doesn't test again, he's gotten away with becoming a nuclear nation, being recognized by the world and I think there will be more economic advantages to him. I think China will trade more and we won't punish China for trading with North Korea. And I think that, you know, yay him. Just one other comment. There are two winners here short term I think. One is China, which now has much more of an advantage in Asia now that we're suspending our exercises and possibly reducing or eliminating our troops in South Korea. But the other is Russia. Because of what we did with the G-7 and the new tariff plan -- let's not call it a war -- Europe is destabilized and that gives Russia huge advantages with respect to Ukraine and in the Middle East because were renounced the Iran deal, it seems to me, Russia has more free reign in Syria and parts of the Middle East."

One thing to point out that, you know, a lot of -- in the wake of -- of this summit, it seems to be that the response is breaking down along political lines, much like it did to President Obama's overtures to the Iran regime. But when it comes down to policy matters here, there's one major challenge the Trump administration's facing that President Obama didn't really have to deal with back in 2012, '13 and '14, and that is North Korea's continued super aggressive gray zone warfare in cyberspace. I've been speaking to cyber expert and tech experts this week who say that during the lead up to the summit, even as the summit was ongoing, North Korea sponsored hackers were infiltrating U.S. banks, financial institutions and carrying out attacks on them. And this is something that they've not yet dealt with. They might be able to get to some kind of a de- neutralization deal without addressing that, but it will ultimately fall apart unless the Trump administration confront this head on. I hope they're doing it behind the scenes through covert channels."

So the administration's on firm ground. The president's not on as firm a ground when it comes to his description of the -- of the detention of minors and separation from -- of families. This is being driven by a decision by the Justice Department for zero tolerance. That is to say anybody who comes across the border is now going to be charged. It used to be to the policy that if you came across the border, if you were a Mexican, you were immediately removed out of the country. Now apparently they're going to charge the Mexicans with an immigration violation. That makes it impossible for them to enter the country legally in the future to work or become a U.S. citizen. So the administration had taken the zero tolerance policy and rather than taking, you know, OTM's, we would hold them and move them out of the country within 30 or 35 days. Now you have to hold these people until the whole process of charging them, litigating in a court, finding them guilty or not and then processing them out of the country takes place. And we only have two facilities in which you can put families intact. A small one in a big facility in Taylor, Texas, but the courts have made us, in essence, restricted and then Obama closed it down."

They ought to find a way to resolve the situation, which is, provided an opportunity for the dreamers, to -- to -- and this is also incumbent upon the Republicans in the House. The dreamers get a path to citizenship and get to remain here and there are other changes on the other side, including money for the border wall. Look, we have a border -- we have a wall along, I think, 600 miles of the board. It needs to be replaced and upgraded. That's primarily what the president is talking about. He has given up on the notion of -- of building a wall at the top of the canyon in Santa Elena Canyon in Texas, which -- where the U.S. border is 1,500 feet in the air.
