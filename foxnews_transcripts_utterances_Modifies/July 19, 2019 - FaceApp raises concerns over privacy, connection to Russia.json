Users have to download the app and upload personal pictures to it. All that data is reportedly stored on Russian servers and shared with companies like Facebook and Google. Senator Chuck Schumer has asked for an investigation citing privacy concerns. And the Democratic National Committee has warned campaigns to immediately delete the app. They're worried. Laura, there's cause for concern. You authorize when you download the app every photo on your device this app has access to it. That's what you authorize.

But the Trump administration rolled out a new asylum rule on Tuesday. You may not have seen that. That change impacts Central American migrants crossing the southern border. They are now ineligible for asylum in the U.S. if they passed through another country along the way. The question is, of course, will it work? Here to discuss is Art Arthur, a fellow for the Center for Immigration Studies, and Allen Orr, an immigration attorney and activists. Gentlemen, welcome aboard. Obviously, this is a situation affecting every single American. I have to ask Allen, what's interesting here is that I believe that we all want America to do well and we want people to thrive, and America has always been a beacon for immigrants and those that need help. But even the European Union has a rule about stopping in the nearest countries, the first country you come to when you are seeking asylum.

But in Europe, there are a lot of countries that are friendly countries, safe countries. We're saying now that these people are coming through Central America that we have already said is invaded by MS- 13 should stop in Mexico. We have travel advisories ourselves for Americans who travel to Mexico to be safe from kidnappings. So it's not a safe zone. So this doesn't really work that way. And the policy side, even Mexico hasn't agreed to take these individuals back. So it's not a good resolution. What, in fact, it does is end asylum for everybody in Central America.",

Here to weigh in about all of this, OB/GYN Dr. Omar Hamada who is himself very pro-life. Dr. Hamada, Planned Parenthood seems to be at a crossroads. A lot of people focus on the NRA at a crossroads, leadership challenges there. But what about this? She's only on the job eight months. She says she wants to focus on healthcare, whatever that means, healthcare for Planned Parenthood. But then she wouldn't use trans inclusive language, meaning exactly what? Men who identified as women who claim that want abortions -- no, they can't have abortions because they're still biologically or genetically male. So I'm not following any of this, but it seems way off the rails. DR. OMAR HAMADA, PRO-LIFE OB/GYN: Laura, it's not P.C. to say that men can't get pregnant anymore, is it. But they can't biologically. And Dr. Wen knew that as a physician and a scientists, and that's why she refused to use that trans inclusive language.

They know, we've seen through at least a one internal democratic poll leaked to Axios, that they are toxic. The talk of socialism is toxic for the Democrats with Trump swing voters. Are you at all concerned, like Paul Begala is, about the nature of how they're talking about issues?

We're talking about ways to get health care prices down. We're talking about ways to expand Medicare, which most Americans still like. Republicans want to cut Medicare. Other than that, they have no health care plan at all, except to keep prices going up. These are issues that Americans care about. And Donald Trump, rather than focusing on issues, is just trying to be as racist as he can possibly be. He's not attacking AOC on what she says. He is saying send her back to where she came from, including these people - these members of Congress who were born in the United States. Who have family here longer than Donald Trump had here."

Separately, sources confirmed to Fox News that Republican house investigators are seeking the opposition research from Nellie Ohr that focused on the Trump family. During her closed-door testimony last year, Ohr told lawmakers that she was willing to provide the research that focused on the Trump family's foreign travel and foreign contacts or did opposition research for Fusion GPS, the same firm behind the DNC Clinton campaign funded dossier.

And if we look at all the other presidential contenders that are running now, so many of them are so far to the Left and they're embracing socialist policies, such as the disastrous Green New Deal.

All right, and now a follow up to the exclusive report we brought you last night. At least five of the 22 MS-13 gang members arrested in connection with a killing spree in California this week sought asylum in the United States. But the Trump administration rolled out a new asylum rule on Tuesday. You may not have seen that. That change impacts Central American migrants crossing the southern border. They are now ineligible for asylum in the U.S. if they passed through another country along the way. The question is, of course, will it work? Here to discuss is Art Arthur, a fellow for the Center for Immigration Studies, and Allen Orr, an immigration attorney and activists. Gentlemen, welcome aboard. Obviously, this is a situation affecting every single American. I have to ask Allen, what's interesting here is that I believe that we all want America to do well and we want people to thrive, and America has always been a beacon for immigrants and those that need help. But even the European Union has a rule about stopping in the nearest countries, the first country you come to when you are seeking asylum. And wouldn't that make sense if you're fleeing a horrible situation to want to find asylum and safety as soon as possible? Why is it wrong to recognize the importance of that kind of a rule and apply it here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALLEN ORR, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "I don't think it's wrong to recognize that type of rule. I just think it can't be done from the president's office. It needs to come from Congress because that's the way our asylum laws work. So he's rewriting. He's doing exactly what he claimed the Obama administration did wrong, which is a lot of executive orders and executive rewriting of rules that should be administered by Congress. But you're correct. But in Europe, there are a lot of countries that are friendly countries, safe countries. We're saying now that these people are coming through Central America that we have already said is invaded by MS- 13 should stop in Mexico. We have travel advisories ourselves for Americans who travel to Mexico to be safe from kidnappings. So it's not a safe zone. So this doesn't really work that way. And the policy side, even Mexico hasn't agreed to take these individuals back. So it's not a good resolution. What, in fact, it does is end asylum for everybody in Central America."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Now, when it comes to the conservative end, if I may ask, we have got a whole framework here for Americans, and obviously we're caring about those who are migrants trying to come through as well. But when it comes to the national security issue, he's declared that we have a national security emergency. Isn't this exactly the kind of rule that we need? The president is an executive individual. He's a man of action. Congress has not been willing to work with him. That's obvious. So from the conservative perspective, is this a proper thing for government to do, sir?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ART ARTHUR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES",
      "utterance": "Tammy, if you take a look at the Immigration and Nationality Act, the attorney general is actually given the authority to said conditions on eligibility. Congress has given the attorney general almost a blank check as it relates to that. So I disagree with the fact that the president doesn't have this authority. And again, this is logical to do. The double with regulation in Europe does exactly what you say it does. All seven countries in Central America and Mexico are asylum-granting countries. And in fact, Mexico's asylum laws are much broader than out. It covers a sort of internal problems and general conditions of violence that American law doesn't. American law is very limited. You can only get asylum based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. People who are fearing generalized violence aren't eligible."

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Art, that brings up an important point for Allen. If we really do want people -- I understand your arguments are technical. But the fact is, when it comes down to it, if someone is fleeing something awful, don't we want them to get security and safety as quickly as possible? Just principally, would you not agree, that is a good goal to have?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ORR",
      "utterance": "Yes. But Mexico and the countries in between do not reach that goal. And since we were supposed to talk about national security, the people that we have seen in cages at our border should not be a threat to the largest and most powerful nation in the world."

And abortion providers, though, they're not happy or unified. Earlier this week, Planned Parenthood secretly fired its CEO, Leana Wen, after just eight months on the job. What was the reason? Apparently, Wen said she wanted to focus on women's healthcare, and perhaps worse for Planned Parenthood, she refused to use trans inclusive language. Here to weigh in about all of this, OB/GYN Dr. Omar Hamada who is himself very pro-life. Dr. Hamada, Planned Parenthood seems to be at a crossroads. A lot of people focus on the NRA at a crossroads, leadership challenges there. But what about this? She's only on the job eight months. She says she wants to focus on healthcare, whatever that means, healthcare for Planned Parenthood. But then she wouldn't use trans inclusive language, meaning exactly what? Men who identified as women who claim that want abortions -- no, they can't have abortions because they're still biologically or genetically male. So I'm not following any of this, but it seems way off the rails. DR. OMAR HAMADA, PRO-LIFE OB/GYN: Laura, it's not P.C. to say that men can't get pregnant anymore, is it. But they can't biologically. And Dr. Wen knew that as a physician and a scientists, and that's why she refused to use that trans inclusive language. In addition, I think she said that it would turn people off especially in the midwest and in the south, and it does because it makes no scientific sense."

And I'll just read a clip, July 22nd, 95. \"Sources both inside Planned Parenthood and outside said that Mrs. Maraldo had aroused opposition with her emphasis of reshaping Planned Parenthood into a broad health organization.\" Maraldo at the time was the leader at the time.

For OB/GYNs today, is there a lot of pressure within the medical establishment for them to basically be OK with the abortion procedure or even learn about abortions? I know there are conscience objections and so forth, and you can opt out. But does the medical establishment give a sense to young physicians, aspiring OB/GYNs that you need to not be a problem here when it comes to abortion?"

In fact a lot of residents who want to train in OB/GYN are told that if they're not OK with abortion, they shouldn't be choosing OB/GYN. And there's a lot of pressure for them. Our national organization, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, is basically tied at the hip with Planned Parenthood association. And they fully support abortion on demand. But there are a huge number of us who are OB/GYNs who are pro-life and who do not agree with that whatsoever.
