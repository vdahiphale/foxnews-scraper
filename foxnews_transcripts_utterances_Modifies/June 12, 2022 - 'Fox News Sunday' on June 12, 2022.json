Marchers gathered in Washington to push for control in response to the massacre at a Texas elementary school. Inflation rose again and the average price of gas hit a painful $5 a gallon nationwide. The challenges facing the nation hitting the White House hard as President Biden struggles to push his agenda midway through the primary season. In a moment, we will speak with Democratic Senator Chris Coons about his party's struggles.

And I'm optimistic after several conversations with House leadership that they will. Frankly, as you also referenced in the introduction, Bret, the January 6th hearing that just took place was a riveting reminder of the dangers of politically motivated violence in our country. And the gun massacres, the shootings that happened at a grocery store in Buffalo and at an elementary school in Uvalde, are also a call to action.

I do think we need to take stronger action to make sure that our federal judiciary is safe because that's part of making sure our democracy is safe, which really is the core issue of the January 6th hearings, is how do we make sure that the fundamentals of our democracy, the safety and security of Congress, the peaceful transfer of power, and I would also at the safety and security of our federal judiciary is insured.

The point of the January 6th hearing is to prove that that is in fact what President Trump did, that he, in the words of Congresswoman Cheney, summoned the mob, stirred up the mob and then lit the fuse that sent them storming the Capitol of the United States.

And in the face of Russia's brutal invasion, their aggression against Ukraine, President Biden has shown a masterful skill at pulling together the E.U. and NATO in order to push back, in order to support Ukraine's brave resistance to Russian aggression. Here at home, his predecessor talked about infrastructure over and over, was never able to get a bill on infrastructure to the floor, and to his desk.

We do need to improve the supply of oil and gas to our Western European partners in order to help sustain their support for Ukraine's fierce resistance against Russia's invasion. And I do expect the president will be addressing both the human rights record of the leadership of Saudi Arabia and our shared security concerns. Our concerns about Iran, our concerns about the war in Yemen, our concerns about oil a gas supply. But I think this is another moment where the president may well make significant steps forward in terms of supporting the security of our vital partner, Israel, in the region, and of addressing the real threat to security posed by Iran and Iran's nuclear program. So I'm optimistic that this will be another productive step forward on the world stage by one of America's most seasoned foreign policy leaders, President Biden.",

Now, the whole premise of the hearing is that President Trump is criminally responsible, and that's the case that they're trying to make. As Bill Barr has said, I think that is a heavy lift. I don't see the factual basis for that. You can make the case, and I would agree, that he is politically, and morally responsible but much of what has happened. But in terms of criminal liability, I think the committee has a long way to go before they could establish that. I think the key thing politically is that the American public does not want us to focus on the past. It's an important review, but I think the Democrats make a mistake if they simply want to relitigate what they did in the impeachment. It's about the future always and solving problems.

And when Putin invaded Ukraine four days before the end of the month, it's now 8.582 percent in May. That means that 90 percent of the inflation that we have had since the time that Joe Biden took office occurred before Putin invaded Ukraine, 90 percent. And people feel that. They know that this is not Putin. They know this is bad decisions that were made in 2021 by this administration with the America Rescue Plan and too much spending. I mean, I quote my favorite current Democrat economist, quote: \"Over the last 75 years, every time inflation has exceeded 4 percent and unemployment has been below 5 percent, the U.S. economy has gone into recession within two years.\" Today inflation is north of 6 percent, when he wrote it, it's now north of 8.5.

So it is a problem, there's very little the president can do. It's up to the Fed. Oftentimes when the Fed tightens we get a recession, 85 percent of Americans, I think, in the latest Quinnipiac poll said that they expect there's going to be a recession, so it's a real problem.",

Marchers gathered in Washington to push for control in response to the massacre at a Texas elementary school. Inflation rose again and the average price of gas hit a painful $5 a gallon nationwide. The challenges facing the nation hitting the White House hard as President Biden struggles to push his agenda midway through the primary season.

And as you know these days, not enough things get through the Senate with the kind of uniform universal support that that bill enjoyed. The House is working to add a provision that would allow the marshal of the Supreme Court to decide to extend protection to staff and families of staff of the Supreme Court. I think that's appropriate, that's an acceptable compromise. More than anything, I think the House needs to take it up and pass it early next week. And I'm optimistic after several conversations with House leadership that they will. Frankly, as you also referenced in the introduction, Bret, the January 6th hearing that just took place was a riveting reminder of the dangers of politically motivated violence in our country. And the gun massacres, the shootings that happened at a grocery store in Buffalo and at an elementary school in Uvalde, are also a call to action. And I'm grateful to be working with Senator Cornyn as a part of a broad bipartisan group that's working to address mental health and gun safety as well."

We passed a bill through the Senate months and months ago that would also provide further protections obscuring the addresses, for example, of justices and judges. That's something we took up in the wake of a horrifying attack on the family of a federal court judge in New Jersey where her son was killed. I do think we need to take stronger action to make sure that our federal judiciary is safe because that's part of making sure our democracy is safe, which really is the core issue of the January 6th hearings, is how do we make sure that the fundamentals of our democracy, the safety and security of Congress, the peaceful transfer of power, and I would also at the safety and security of our federal judiciary is insured. We should act."

As an elected official, I've certainly had protests out front of my house. Many of us have who serve in Congress and other elected offices. But we need to make sure that all appropriate actions are being taken to ensure the safety of members of our federal judiciary, including Supreme Court justices."

And I'm not going to say this protester or that protester ought to be arrested. I just think that that's a judgment call to be made by law enforcement, not by a senator on a Sunday show."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Understood, but they haven't been arrested yet and nobody has for protesting outside these judges' homes that were published online, only the conservative justices. What -- I want to also ask you, is the president hasn't said anything publicly about this specific threat about Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh. The White House press secretary said a couple of things in a gaggle to reporters that the president condemns violence of any kind. But should the president have said something publicly about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "Bret, the president has repeatedly spoken out against politically motivated violence in our country, the risk of politically motivated violence in our country. And as you well know, presidents often speak more through their press secretaries to events of the day. I certainly have denounced this latest threat against Justice Kavanaugh. But it's important that we remember there are threats of political violence of many kinds and types. Folks who are watching this morning who didn't watch the January 6th hearing should take a few moments and review what Congresswoman Liz Cheney, an unimpeachable he conservative from Wyoming, had to say in her opening statement. I think there are risks of political violence we should all be speaking out against and acting to ensure we control, manage, and reduce."

      "utterance": "So here's a key distinction. What Senator Schumer was saying was that he was upset. He was alarmed, he was concerned at the prospect that justices would reverse decades of a well-established fundamental constitutional right in our country. What he did not say was let's go attack them. The point of the January 6th hearing is to prove that that is in fact what President Trump did, that he, in the words of Congresswoman Cheney, summoned the mob, stirred up the mob and then lit the fuse that sent them storming the Capitol of the United States. I do think there's a distinguishable difference between what we just heard from Senator Schumer and the actions taken by former President Trump and his circle of advisors in the days before January 6th."

Frankly, as one of the members of the Senate who had to be escorted out along with the vice president by Capitol police just feet ahead of an angry mob, I do think that we are at risk of a season of political violence in this country, and all of us should reduce the temper and level of our rhetoric."

I certainly don't think the Congresswoman Cheney or Congressman Kinzinger were trying to impact the midterm election chances of Democrats. I think the point here has been to take a hard and clear-eyed look at what happened on January 6, and new evidence that they've uncovered about the role of the former president's close advisors in how they shaped the events that led to that really critical moment in our modern American history. We've never had our Capitol stormed by Americans. We've never had an attempt through an insurrection, through a riot to try and interrupt the peaceful transfer of power. And, Bret, right now, I'm working with a bipartisan group of senators to try to make reforms to the Electoral Count Act to make it clear that Vice President Pence did the right thing on the night of January 6th, that no vice president has the power, nor should they, to unilaterally overturn the will of the American people."

I'm just saying that as of now, it's my understanding that the president intends to seek a second term, and I understand why. His leadership on the world stage has been impressive. He's just returned from a successful Summit of the Americas. He's pulled together four critical partners in the Indo Pacific in a new organization called the Quad, a new partnership with allies. And in the face of Russia's brutal invasion, their aggression against Ukraine, President Biden has shown a masterful skill at pulling together the E.U. and NATO in order to push back, in order to support Ukraine's brave resistance to Russian aggression. Here at home, his predecessor talked about infrastructure over and over, was never able to get a bill on infrastructure to the floor, and to his desk. President Biden signed into law one of the biggest investments in infrastructure in American history. And President Biden and Democrats in the Senate have a plan for how to reduce prescription drug prices, how to tackle health care costs that I remain optimistic we will get done."

This is a summit that's being hosted by the Saudi Kingdom that will allow him a chance at one time at one place to meet with a whole range of heads of state from the Persian Gulf, from the Middle East. The president, as you know, has decades of experience in foreign policy, and I trust his firm hand, his leadership, in this moment. We do need to improve the supply of oil and gas to our Western European partners in order to help sustain their support for Ukraine's fierce resistance against Russia's invasion. And I do expect the president will be addressing both the human rights record of the leadership of Saudi Arabia and our shared security concerns. Our concerns about Iran, our concerns about the war in Yemen, our concerns about oil a gas supply. But I think this is another moment where the president may well make significant steps forward in terms of supporting the security of our vital partner, Israel, in the region, and of addressing the real threat to security posed by Iran and Iran's nuclear program. So I'm optimistic that this will be another productive step forward on the world stage by one of America's most seasoned foreign policy leaders, President Biden."

      "speaker": "HUTCHINSON",
      "utterance": "My reaction to the hearing is that it's an important review as to what happened on January 6th. I've always said we need to do this. This is not the most bipartisan effort in it, but it is a review that is important. Obviously, as they present the case, Americans see this, and they want to hold the people who are responsible for the January 6th attack accountable. Now, the whole premise of the hearing is that President Trump is criminally responsible, and that's the case that they're trying to make. As Bill Barr has said, I think that is a heavy lift. I don't see the factual basis for that. You can make the case, and I would agree, that he is politically, and morally responsible but much of what has happened. But in terms of criminal liability, I think the committee has a long way to go before they could establish that. I think the key thing politically is that the American public does not want us to focus on the past. It's an important review, but I think the Democrats make a mistake if they simply want to relitigate what they did in the impeachment. It's about the future always and solving problems. We have enough problems to address and that's what the American people want us to focus on to a greater extent."

      "speaker": "HUTCHINSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I hope that the future of the Republican Party is different than former President Trump's leadership. I hope we move in a different direction. I believe that what happened on January 6th is a lot at his feet. It was wrong for our country and for him to continue to push that theory I agree is the wrong direction for the Republican Party. I think there's many Republicans that are looking for an off-ramp, new opportunities to find leadership in the future. Obviously, what President Trump -- there's a lot of things that he did that were very good, that the base and I agree with. But he got off track in January 6th and that was a costly error for our democracy. And I agree with a lot of the comments. He is -- he has a responsibility there. We need to make sure that's clear. I think Republicans need to do a lot of soul-searching as to what is the right thing here, what is the right thing to say for our party and our democracy and our future, and not simply appeal to the basest instincts of some of our base."

Up on Capitol Hill, Senate negotiators are in the middle of trying to find some compromise on finalizing bipartisan agreement on a narrow set of goals for gun control proposals. Here's what they're looking at, we're told: enhanced school safety, federal support for meal health programs, state incentive red flag laws, expansion to federal background checks and raising the minimum purchase age for an AR-15 or the like to 21. Arkansas' minimum age to purchase is currently at 18. There are no red flag laws. What about this effort on Capitol Hill, Governor?"
    },

      "speaker": "HUTCHINSON",

It's a discussion that we absolutely need to have and I applaud them for doing it. As you know, I joined a letter from the National Governors Association to create a bipartisan review by governors and part of it is to evaluate what's going to be coming out of the Senate, making comments because the governors are going to be the one to implement mental health policy and strengthening that, it's going to be responsible for school safety. So I hope that there are some positive things that can come out of this. When you look at the age of 21 or 18, there's constitutional issues there, but that has to be part of this discussion. But it's difficult. It's going to be a narrow path but it's a conversation that is important and governors are willing to engage in that and particularly look at what comes out of the Senate side."

He was engaging in blaming everyone from Senator Scott to Putin, he was blaming corporate America, and really did not provide the leadership that is needed during this time. Americans want a leader that will lay out challenge that we face, what is the solutions and the directions we need to go. And what we are going to be looking at in October and November of this year. And so, I thought the blame game is not presidential. I don't think that's what we needed. Arkansans right now are paying $500 more per month than they did in January of 2021 simply because of inflation. This hurts the pocketbook of hardworking Americans and what we've heard so far is not sufficient. Energy is a big driver in this. Gas prices, and that impacts our agriculture, that impacts our production in every commodity, really. And that's where this president has failed us in effective energy policy that America produces and is independent."

You had that pretty compelling video of the Proud Boys going up before he gave the speech. There has also been some new information about members of Congress seeking pardons, about what President Trump said about hanging Mike Pence. So I think it has been pretty compelling.

If they were in communication in advance of January 6th with the Willard command center, Bernie Kerik, Rudy Giuliani, Steve Bannon, John Eastman, we know that they -- the command center was in communication with the White House. If the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys were in communication with the command center, then it will raise the question of what did the president know and when did he know it. That's going to be, I think, the key moment."

We are such a highly polarized country, Bret, that if you were to say 40 percent of the American people just aren't going to change their mind, they are just locked in their perception, high number of Republicans continue to say that, you know, Trump is the likely nominee next time going around. And there's a high percentage of Democrats who say Trump clearly was a cancer on the American body politic. But in between you might have let's say 20 percent who might be persuadable and who are people -- and this comes a little bit from the discussion you were having with Senator Coons, who are saying, well, what's going on in my life now, what about gas prices, what about food prices, inflation, immigration, guns? But nonetheless, those are people who might hear in these hearings, and they had 20 million people apparently tuning in, might hear things and say, you know, this is an attack on democracy itself. Democracy was under attack on January 6th. We now have people who are running for office who continue to perpetrate the big lie. And you know what, it's a little unsettling. And that my drive people who would turn out or not turn out in the midterms."

      "speaker": "JOSH KRAUSHAAR, NATIONAL JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Well, there wasn't a whole lot new, and I think that is both significant on the substance and on the politics. We learned a few details about the Proud Boys and their planning. But this was more of a documentary. We are reminded of the pain that everyone followed on January 6th. And that isn't going to move the political needle a whole lot. People are feeling more pain economically, as Juan was just talking about, then want to focus on the past, a painful moment in our past. So I don't think there's going to be a whole -- there may be a pretext for the DoJ to make a move, but I think this was more a P.R. display more than a pretext for legal action by the White House."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. I mean, this is -- look, this is sort of personal. I know Ashley and Brett Kavanaugh personally from our time together in the White House. And I -- it's amazing to me. The law is clear, you quoted it. It goes on to say \"with the intent of influencing any judge.\" And I love it, the American Civil Liberties Union says, yes, this is the statue but we interpret it the following way. We point to a Supreme Court case that suggests that as long as they keep moving in front of the house -- if they are stationary, they should be arrested but if they are moving in front of the house they have a right to try and influence a Supreme Court justice. And that is ridiculous. And if it is true, I didn't see Senator Schumer moving very much behind that microphone in front of the U.S. Supreme Court where he had a clear intent of influencing a Supreme Court justice. So we either ought to apply the law or we ought to just simply say it's open season judges, because that's what we're doing."

We have primaries in Nevada, Maine, North Dakota, South Carolina, a Texas special election, but Democrats are facing headwinds this election. You have this new poll out showing the president's job approval for everybody sits at 33 percent approve, disapprove 55 percent. But then you look at independents, this is the Quinnipiac poll, 25 percent approval for President Biden. That is not just a headwind, that's a gust."

You've got a Senate race, a governor's race, three of the four Democratic numbers of congress in tough races that we heard on the segment by Aishah. It could be a sweep for Republicans in a state they haven't won, at least at the presidential level, since 2004. So there's a lot of headwinds the Democratic Party is facing, the economy is the biggest issue, a lot of Nevadans having trouble making ends meet."

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "No rebuttal. There's a reason why the number is 33, and it goes back to something that Senator Coons said when he said this inflation is all on Putin. Inflation was running at 1.4 percent in January of 2021. It was running at 7.871 percent in February. And when Putin invaded Ukraine four days before the end of the month, it's now 8.582 percent in May. That means that 90 percent of the inflation that we have had since the time that Joe Biden took office occurred before Putin invaded Ukraine, 90 percent. And people feel that. They know that this is not Putin. They know this is bad decisions that were made in 2021 by this administration with the America Rescue Plan and too much spending."

      "utterance": "\"Over the last 75 years, every time inflation has exceeded 4 percent and unemployment has been below 5 percent, the U.S. economy has gone into recession within two years.\" Today inflation is north of 6 percent, when he wrote it, it's now north of 8.5. And unemployment is south of 4 percent, Larry Summers. And we've got a recession coming and it will be coming before the 2024 election in all likelihood."

      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Inflation defeats presidents. And inflation is one of those things, I actually disagree with Karl, the American Rescue Plan might have contributed, but inflation is global. The reasons for it are about supply chains, a whole bunch of other things. But, the problem is that there are a lot of things that aren't the president's fault but they are his problem, and inflation, which is the single economic indicator that affects people the most every single day. So what if hiring is really on fire, they still have to fill their car up with gas and inflation is eating away all those wage gains that the White House likes to talk about. So it is a problem, there's very little the president can do. It's up to the Fed. Oftentimes when the Fed tightens we get a recession, 85 percent of Americans, I think, in the latest Quinnipiac poll said that they expect there's going to be a recession, so it's a real problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "speaker": "LIASSON",

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Juan, besides the economy, the inflation, there are also issues like crime, and you have this recall in San Francisco of the district attorney, Chesa Boudin, getting recalled in San Francisco because of how he's dealing with crime. Similar to other places, you may see that in Los Angeles as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think crime, again, especially violent crime and guns are a huge issue right. We talk about inflation. We talk about abortion and the potential for anger over that decision. But I think there's a lot of frustration with the inability of the political class to do anything when you see children being slaughtered and people in the afternoon supermarket being slaughtered. And so right now there's a sense that there has to be some change, that people are looking for change. There's a lot of resentment out there. I think, you know, we've been talking about midterm politics. Well, you know, you look at -- you go back to, well, you know, go back even to Bill Clinton in '92. You go to -- you know, come forward, President Obama in '10, President Trump in '18. All of them lost big in midterms. That's the historical model. And I think the reason -- a lot of the reason for that is there's frustration, resentment in the direction of the country, and people are speaking out in frustration against the elected class, the party in power."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "But the question is, if they do lose, like if it was held tomorrow, it would be a big red wave, would they do like Bill Clinton did in '94 and change and kind of use some Republican policies to their own? Do you see that or do you still see progressives running the Democratic Party?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I think progressives right now are the energy. But let me just say, Joe Biden is a moderate, and he's the head of the party for now, even the people who may have skepticism about his future. He's the head of the party and he models sort of reasonableness, decency, empathy. And I think that that's the drive. But people on the Democratic side oftentimes want him to be more aggressive because they see the Republicans as the aggressors and Biden is not fighting back, saying that Mitch McConnell is his buddy."
