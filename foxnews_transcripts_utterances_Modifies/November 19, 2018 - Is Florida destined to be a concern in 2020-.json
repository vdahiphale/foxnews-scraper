There was another issue in 2016 regarding provisional ballots and the state took another opportunity to look at their laws there. So, you know, that's very important.  I mean, this state was not foreign to the concept of revisions to election laws, and these laws were in place for a reason. Certainly, when you have an opportunity to test them out like we did in this recount, there are going to be things that we want to review and see if we can do differently.  But these laws were in place and they had to be followed. Every single lawsuit that Governor Scott put his name on was intended to make sure the rule of the law was followed.

But yet, the entire state was put through this long, prolonged recount process.  You know, lots of folks taken away from their families, from their jobs to volunteer, and it was entirely unnecessary. The will of the voters was clear.  You know, in the history of American politics, we have never had a recount overturn a margin of more than 1,200 votes. So, you know when we're sitting here looking at a margin of 12,000 votes, and 1,200 votes is the most we've ever seen overturn, you knew that this was going to go the way of the voters. Thank God.",

They are unwilling to believe that.   And so, they are taking their fight to the courthouses. I feel like it's our job and we did this with Governor Scott's lead. You know, it's our job to make sure that these rules are followed.  And to protect the decision that the voters made on November 6th, you know, I don't think there was voter suppression.

You know, the counties are required to provide notice to voters to tell them if their signatures not good enough, so they can go in and have an opportunity to correct that. There are plenty of protections in place to make sure that -- you know, their votes are counted. I mean, Republicans want people to vote. They want their votes to be counted. It's Democrats that want to change the law, so that valid legal votes are worthless because they're bringing in a lots of illegal votes.  I mean are we to the place where, you know, if people are interested in Georgia, that they should start voting. Or, you know, if people really care about this race, their vote should count twice.

Then to counter the Me Too crowd some conservative activists held a Him Too rally of about 40 people aiming to raise awareness for men who are falsely accused of sexual misconduct. But in recent months the far-left anti-fascist group Antifa has become very prominent in Portland. The group has repeatedly promised to use violence to defend the city and repeatedly lived up to that promise. On Saturday, Antifa member Hannah McClintock was captured on video confronting both police and conservative protesters. At one point, with Me Too supporters chanting, quote, \"we believe survivors.\" McClintock waves on some of the Him Too demonstrators apparently hoping to gin up a physical altercation. Now watch McClintock spit and shout obscenities followed by Him Too protesters unwilling to take the bait. Watch.",

In fact, Andy Ngo, the independent journalist who shot all the video you have been watching says he was victimized by Antifa members at the rally claiming he was assaulted by a mob of masked individuals dressed in black who went after his equipment and called him a fascist and an Islamophobe. Antifa members in Portland have also been involved in other violent incidents in recent months including back in August when they attacked a liberal who supported Bernie Sanders and voted for Hillary Clinton. The young man had just taken American flag away from a conservative prayer group when an Antifa member struck him in the head with a metal rod.

So that fight over Me Too and Him Too coming just hours after huge announcement was made by the Trump administration that will dramatically change the way that Me Too cases are handled on college campuses. Encouraging true due process for the accused and for the accuser. Critics say that it will discourage victims from coming forward and it's going to be a very hot topic going forward on college campuses. Jason Riley is a Wall Street Journal columnist and he joins me now. Jason, thank you very much for being with us this evening. You know, in many ways the college campuses went through the Me Too movement before the rest of the country did. And they were given rules by the Obama administration that were very strict. In essence saying, if you are not tough enough on these people who are accused, we could potentially take away your federal funding?",

So, breaking tonight, contested elections laying an unnerving precedent as we look forward to the 2020 election. While most candidates like Bill Nelson, and Martha McSally, and Andrew Gillum, ultimately accepted the will of the voters. The Georgia candidate Stacey Abrams claims that there was voter suppression in that race. Although, there appears to be no evidence of that. Here is part of her speech that raised eyebrows."

Lesser-known than Democrat lawyer, Mark Elias, whose name is known to many as the Clinton attorney. He flew to Bill Nelson's side to push for the recount. Johnson was crucial to Governor Scott's outcome and is watching Florida and Georgia's matching laws ahead of the presidential race, and she joins me now. Good to have you with us, Jessica, this evening. Thanks for being here."

      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, as an election law attorney, I certainly recognized his name. And when I saw that he was interested in this race, and he was going to be a really big deal. I also knew that -- you know, Governor Scott was victorious on November 6th. He won by more than 12,000 votes. So, I knew if Mark Elias was still interested in this race after a 12,000 vote victory, I knew that I needed to pay attention to it too."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, in terms of the rules that needs to be governed or perhaps changed, what are they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I think that's a really important question. And I think, after the 2000 election, you know, Florida took a long hard look at these election laws. Obviously, they didn't want to repeat of that situation. There have been subsequent changes since. There was another issue in 2016 regarding provisional ballots and the state took another opportunity to look at their laws there. So, you know, that's very important. I mean, this state was not foreign to the concept of revisions to election laws, and these laws were in place for a reason. Certainly, when you have an opportunity to test them out like we did in this recount, there are going to be things that we want to review and see if we can do differently. But these laws were in place and they had to be followed. Every single lawsuit that Governor Scott put his name on was intended to make sure the rule of the law was followed. Every single lawsuit the Democrats tried to bring forward was to do something about that law in order to make sure their candidate could win."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What about what Stacey Abrams said about the legitimacy of the Georgia race?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, I think that's so interesting and unfortunate.  And I think the reason for her statement, perhaps, is that Democrats have shown that they're not willing to respect the will of the voters. You know, Rick Scott, won on election night. You know, he was successful, it was -- you know, 12,000 vote margin. The voter spoke. They were incredibly clear on November 6th. But yet, the entire state was put through this long, prolonged recount process. You know, lots of folks taken away from their families, from their jobs to volunteer, and it was entirely unnecessary. The will of the voters was clear. You know, in the history of American politics, we have never had a recount overturn a margin of more than 1,200 votes. So, you know when we're sitting here looking at a margin of 12,000 votes, and 1,200 votes is the most we've ever seen overturn, you knew that this was going to go the way of the voters. Thank God."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What about the claim of voter suppression and the evidence?  Does it exist or not exist in Georgia?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "You know, I think that the Democrats look at elections these days as an opportunity for litigation. You know, they -- it's just like redistricting. They haven't been successful at the ballot box, and they're unwilling to believe that the same voters that could put Donald Trump in the White House would be the voters that would select their representatives now. They are unwilling to believe that. And so, they are taking their fight to the courthouses. I feel like it's our job and we did this with Governor Scott's lead. You know, it's our job to make sure that these rules are followed. And to protect the decision that the voters made on November 6th, you know, I don't think there was voter suppression. I think it was important to make sure the law was followed, and I was proud to be a part of Governor Scott's mandate to make sure that happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "In terms of the matching laws, matching the name to what's on the ballot when people check in to vote, there's a lot of suggestion that, that was overly onerous for voters. Your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, you know, this was something the state looked at in 2016. This is something they've looked at incredibly recently. And again, there, they put protections in place to make sure that it wasn't overly onerous for voters. You know, the counties are required to provide notice to voters to tell them if their signatures not good enough, so they can go in and have an opportunity to correct that. There are plenty of protections in place to make sure that -- you know, their votes are counted. I mean, Republicans want people to vote. They want their votes to be counted. It's Democrats that want to change the law, so that valid legal votes are worthless because they're bringing in a lots of illegal votes. I mean are we to the place where, you know, if people are interested in Georgia, that they should start voting. Or, you know, if people really care about this race, their vote should count twice. I mean, it -- I -- you know, it's kind of seen sometimes but that's what Democrats are looking for here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, one last question. In terms of the laws that they tried to amend after the election was over, in terms of how long they could go ahead counting ballots. Are there challenges on that, that you're pushing against as you prepare for the 2020 presidential election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. You know, I think the Democrats really showed their hand here. They showed what they're willing to do. You know, to throw out deadlines I have been established for years to require these new -- you know, requirements for voters in order to get their vote counted. I mean it's just quite ridiculous. And so, yes, you know, I think the NRSC at Governor Scott's lead, and we're going to see what we can do about continuing to fight these battles.  Because I think it's incredibly important to make sure that when a person goes into vote, you know, they read on the rules, they understand what they have to do. They've done it correctly. They need to know that their vote will be counted, they also need to know that people who haven't followed the rules, these rules that are designed to make sure people can vote they need to know that their votes won't be counted."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the clear issue for me is she was saying, you know that people have to know that there is a procedure, you have to follow the procedure in order to vote. But I think lots of people, especially, I would point out in Georgia, did just that. They apply, they registered to vote. And it's over 50,000, Martha, voter registration cards that were rejected by guess who? Brian Kemp, who was the Secretary of State, who was also the candidate for governor of Georgia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, are these -- are these 50,000 people -- you know, where is -- where is the outcry from them that their vote did not end up counting?  Because -- you know, a number of accounts of this say that they -- that doesn't seem to exist, that they're not seeing that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think we are seeing it. But again, what you're dealing with especially in the Abrams campaign is an effort to get people who were not participating in the election to come out to vote for the first time. Lots of first-time voters. We're talking here about young people minorities who typically are not quick to participate in the midterms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, why did they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It is not appropriate for her to charge that there was voter suppression. And if you -- we can't cite something, if it doesn't exist as evidence of voter suppression, she's frustrated --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "The 53,000 ballots do, voter registration cards exist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "She's frustrated and are making this argument because the Secretary of State Brian Kemp, cleaned up the voter rolls eight years ago that somehow he was suppressing the vote. But the problem is that when we don't clean up voter rolls, A, it's illegal to do that. And B, that is breathing ground for voter fraud. And so, it is the Secretary of State's job in every single state, not just Georgia to make sure that those rules are cleaned up. And I just have to say, you know, in America, we pride ourselves on the peaceful transition of power. And this continuing -- that's continuing -- you know, refusal to accept the legitimacy of elections when you just don't like the outcome, we keep hearing all about attacks on democracy, the delegitimization of our elections. Not accepting a result just because you don't like it without any evidence to back up your claims of voter suppression or voter fraud, even that causes real problems about undermining democracy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, people do have to have a confidence in the system. And that it -- and that the system works on all sides. You know, when you look back into this idea of voter suppression, it was a law that was passed in 1997 under a democratic legislature and Democrat Governor Zell Miller, to make sure that people who had died and people had moved out of Georgia were not on those voter rolls. Because they didn't want anyone to abuse those lists of dead and moved away in order to, to have to create vote fraud. Isn't that a good thing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "That's a great thing. That's a great thing, but here is the thing. There is no evidence of any voter fraud. We're not discussing that. We're talking about people who filled out a registration form and saw it thrown out. We're talking about people who are absentee ballots being discarded. We're talking about polling places, Martha being closed and being told, \"Oh, the toilets don't work. Oh, it's a black neighborhood that's why we're closing those polling places.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "OK. Well, that was a lot to unpack there. But I want to go back to your claim about there is no voter fraud here. That is exactly the point. The reason why the Secretary of State goes through the rolls and make sure that there are not eligible people on the rolls is to prevent those kinds of voter fraud. And this idea that you're arguing that there were suppression in polling places closed purposely in black communities to keep them out of the voting places is a pretty serious charge to make, and we haven't seen evidence of that happening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No, we have seen, because we know about those polling place being closed. Let's go to Florida for a second --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "But it wasn't -- but, Juan, it wasn't because they were close, (INAUDIBLE) keeping African-Americans from voting."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "OK, so, I think that what you're seeing here is a situation where Republican candidates say we're going to choose our voters rather than have voters choose the candidates. And they do that by focusing on suppressing voters who they think are young, minorities, and oftentimes women, Martha, who they think are not going to vote Republican."

Some reports that he was shot in the face, some reports that he shot himself. Witnesses say the incident started just before 3:30 this afternoon local time when a man and a woman were walking here near Mercy Hospital. They had a conflict. The woman ended up on the ground and the gunman stood over her and discharged multiple shots then continued into the hospital. Again, that is according to witnesses from the scene here.

Now, stretches from the beach in California to the San Ysidro Port of Entry and around that port of entry in places. Today they shut it down for several hours there to lay concrete barriers and new wire to keep order there where there are reports that migrants may attempt to rush the port to gain entry.

I think based on the size of this caravan, based on the violence and the force that we had seen used by this caravan, we really thought that it was in our best interest to take a look at our vulnerabilities and some of the gaps we had at the border and quickly make those assessments and do what we could to put up some additional infrastructure on our borders, at our ports of entry to ensure we didn't have mass incursions."

We promised to change the status quo and we intend to deliver on that promise, they wrote. But the president wants her to win. So could Republicans help Pelosi keep the gavel? Joining me now, Jason Chaffetz who once ran for House Speaker himself and Richard Fowler syndicated radio talk show host, both are Fox News Contributors. Welcome gentlemen, good to have you with us this evening.  So the Democrats right now are at 232. That number could increase if we just show the balance of power, undecided is for right now as some of those races are continuing to be decided. And then we have the list of 22 who are now in the House who promised that they would oppose Pelosi when she -- if indeed they were they were elected.

So I think she's counting the votes and she's talking to her folks and she's trying to figure out you do it. Don't get me wrong. I think that you know, Pelosi is going to have to make some changes and some concessions. One of that is going to -- she's got to come for the concession plan -- concession a plan when she's no longer the speaker. I think she probably have one more term. And I think two, we're going to have to do the Republicans at a long time ago and that some chairman -- have some you know, term limits on chairmanships and some other things, and also diversifying her leadership team so it looks more like her caucus.

But I don't think the Democrats are going to go there. Nancy Pelosi has raised more money than anybody in the history of the United States Congress, Democrat, Republican, House, or Senate. She rules with an iron fist. She's not going to let it go and that's why they don't have the votes today.

Then to counter the Me Too crowd some conservative activists held a Him Too rally of about 40 people aiming to raise awareness for men who are falsely accused of sexual misconduct. But in recent months the far-left anti-fascist group Antifa has become very prominent in Portland. The group has repeatedly promised to use violence to defend the city and repeatedly lived up to that promise. On Saturday, Antifa member Hannah McClintock was captured on video confronting both police and conservative protesters. At one point, with Me Too supporters chanting, quote, \"we believe survivors.\" McClintock waves on some of the Him Too demonstrators apparently hoping to gin up a physical altercation. Now watch McClintock spit and shout obscenities followed by Him Too protesters unwilling to take the bait. Watch."

In fact, Andy Ngo, the independent journalist who shot all the video you have been watching says he was victimized by Antifa members at the rally claiming he was assaulted by a mob of masked individuals dressed in black who went after his equipment and called him a fascist and an Islamophobe. Antifa members in Portland have also been involved in other violent incidents in recent months including back in August when they attacked a liberal who supported Bernie Sanders and voted for Hillary Clinton. The young man had just taken American flag away from a conservative prayer group when an Antifa member struck him in the head with a metal rod. Apparently, his crime was carrying the flag which Antifa calls a fascist symbol. The man needed four staples to close the gash on his head. Martha?"

So that fight over Me Too and Him Too coming just hours after huge announcement was made by the Trump administration that will dramatically change the way that Me Too cases are handled on college campuses. Encouraging true due process for the accused and for the accuser. Critics say that it will discourage victims from coming forward and it's going to be a very hot topic going forward on college campuses. Jason Riley is a Wall Street Journal columnist and he joins me now. Jason, thank you very much for being with us this evening. You know, in many ways the college campuses went through the Me Too movement before the rest of the country did. And they were given rules by the Obama administration that were very strict. In essence saying, if you are not tough enough on these people who are accused, we could potentially take away your federal funding?"

And I think she deserves a lot of credit for that. But you're right. The issue here is due process. And the accused were not getting the due process that they should get. If the process is going to have any integrity whatsoever, and even the courts have started to recognize this. There have been a number of state and federal decisions that have said that the accuse have had a right to cross-examine the accuser and that is not happening in a lot of college campuses."

That is the CIA's assessment with high confidence, Martha. So, President Trump has been hesitant to accept the conclusion of the CIA on a number of issues. We know he wants to work closely with the Saudis but really, it's disappointing that he seems to be overlooking the intelligence assessment because he has made some calculation about what's in the national security interest of the United States, vis-a-vis, Iran or the oil prices or whatever. I would argue that letting the Saudis get away with this and making excuses for them is actually very much not in our national security interests and he can decide whether or not he wants to side with the CIA or the Saudis, that choice should not be hard."
