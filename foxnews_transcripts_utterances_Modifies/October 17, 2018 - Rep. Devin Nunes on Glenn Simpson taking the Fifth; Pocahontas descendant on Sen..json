      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Political campaigns are all about how you finish. You can be more popular than your opponent is for months, even for years, forever. But if you're less popular on Election Day, you lose. It's all that matters. It's a pretty simple truth but it's easy to forget. Democrats may re-learn it the hard way very soon. Up until a few weeks ago, virtually, every Democrat in America considered the upcoming mid-term elections a certain win.  Why? Well they looked at the numbers. The majority of voters remain unsettled about Donald Trump. And if an election is a pure referendum on him, they believe the Republicans would lose, and lose big.  But what if it's not all about Trump? What if there's another side to the equation? Well there is. And Democrats have just reminded the country of that. It all began with Brett Kavanaugh.  Democrats had plenty of ideological reasons to oppose his nomination to the Supreme Court. He'd written hundreds and hundreds of decisions, but they barely mentioned any of that. Instead, in their frenzy to oppose all that Trump endorses, they tarred Kavanaugh as a rapist. They tried to destroy his family and his life. Evidence and due process were irrelevant, they told us again and again. And if you didn't agree with that, they would scream at you.",

But they wouldn't do that or maybe they couldn't do that or maybe they no longer recognize what crazy is. In any case, they refuse to make a rational case for their own program and, therefore, accelerated their own collapse.   Elizabeth Warren led the way in this. In a bizarre self-inflicted injury that she committed on national television yesterday, much to the confusion of everyone else, Elizabeth Warren released a video trying to show that she really is an American Indian.

You can be more popular than your opponent is for months, even for years, forever. But if you're less popular on Election Day, you lose. It's all that matters. It's a pretty simple truth but it's easy to forget. Democrats may re-learn it the hard way very soon. Up until a few weeks ago, virtually, every Democrat in America considered the upcoming mid-term elections a certain win. Why? Well they looked at the numbers. The majority of voters remain unsettled about Donald Trump. And if an election is a pure referendum on him, they believe the Republicans would lose, and lose big. But what if it's not all about Trump? What if there's another side to the equation? Well there is. And Democrats have just reminded the country of that. It all began with Brett Kavanaugh. Democrats had plenty of ideological reasons to oppose his nomination to the Supreme Court. He'd written hundreds and hundreds of decisions, but they barely mentioned any of that. Instead, in their frenzy to oppose all that Trump endorses, they tarred Kavanaugh as a rapist. They tried to destroy his family and his life. Evidence and due process were irrelevant, they told us again and again. And if you didn't agree with that, they would scream at you."

But they wouldn't do that or maybe they couldn't do that or maybe they no longer recognize what crazy is. In any case, they refuse to make a rational case for their own program and, therefore, accelerated their own collapse. Elizabeth Warren led the way in this. In a bizarre self-inflicted injury that she committed on national television yesterday, much to the confusion of everyone else, Elizabeth Warren released a video trying to show that she really is an American Indian.

This is a middle-age framework where people were burnt at the stake, where heads were cut off, where if you - if you moved a little bit away from the orthodoxy, you were going to be declared a heathen or something else. This is now turning into a religion. And there is no room for any kind of - of movement about and any kind of differences or differences of opinion or - or point of view. But we live in a modern age which recognizes faith and the importance of that, and the importance of us having our opinions.

Now, that's so far back. It's not impossible that her most recent native ancestor is literally Pocahontas. And that question made us think it could be time to speak to Debbie White Dove again. She rejoins us tonight. Debbie, it's great to see you tonight.
