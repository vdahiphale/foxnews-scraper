      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Believe it or not, it was a year ago this week that a constellation of left-wing activist groups cooked up a series of outlandish lies designed to Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court. The national news media as you remember, joined the smear campaign. They repeated and magnified the slurs. But in the end, it was to no effect.  Kavanaugh was confirmed any way. Why? Because not a single allegation against him turned out to be true -- not one. And so the only lasting effect was to traumatize Brett Kavanaugh's wife and children.  And yet the left never to this day, apologized for their dishonesty or their profound cruelty, nor did they ever accept defeat. They never do accept defeat. Why? Because when politics is your religion, acknowledging reality looks like sin, and so it continues.  Over the weekend, The New York Times revived the attacks on Brett Kavanaugh. The newspaper ran a story, an excerpt from a book written by two of its reporters that claimed that while in college, more than 30 years ago, Kavanaugh exposed himself in effect to another student while drunk at a party. It was the flimsiest kind of charge. Where did it come from? Well, it came second hand from a single classmate of Kavanaugh's, a man who worked as a left-wing activist, later worked for the Clintons, in fact.  So 20 years ago, no credible news organization would have run a story like that on the basis of that sourcing. The Times didn't hesitate, and it was picked up everywhere of course, instantly. On NBC's cable channel, for example, they immediately denounced Brett Kavanaugh as a gang rapist.",

Whatever they tell you, don't let them tell you that justice has any role in this. Of course, this is a pure power grab. The left feels entitled to run the country truly entitled to and they feel entitled to control the Supreme Court. If they don't, it drives them crazy.  Kavanaugh frustrates their political hopes, so any smear against him is acceptable, no matter what it is. But don't kid yourself. It's not just about destroying Brett Kavanaugh, he is ancillary. It's about destroying the entire legitimacy of our third branch of government, the judiciary. Plenty on the left are using the Kavanaugh saga to justify packing the court, adding more justices to make it reliably left wing or to change the rules so they can remove any judge the left doesn't approve of. This is the opposite of what the third branch was meant to do or be. The judiciary was meant to change slowly. The courts change over decades, rather than in response to a single election cycle. That's the way it was designed and for a reason, and for more than 200 years, it's worked. But to the modern left, that's totally intolerable.   They're committed to remaking this country completely right now. America needs a new system they tell us, one with open borders and far fewer pesky individual rights. Rights like the freedom to speak clearly out loud. The Freedom of Expression, the right to bear arms, the Freedom of Religion -- no. To create this new utopia of obedient happy serfs, they're going to have to destroy all of that, two centuries of precedent and tradition.  Maybe even destroy the country itself, whatever. They're happy to do that. As Robespierre noted, when you make omelets, you break eggs.  Ryan Lovelace is the author of \"Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign against Brett Kavanaugh,\" and he joins us tonight. So Ryan, thanks a lot for coming on.

You know, it's not simply enough that The New York Times had to run a correction -- a correction that explained precisely what actually went on here. A correction that said of the woman who is alleged to have been victim has been telling folks that she wasn't a victim, that she hasn't been able to confirm this story for these \"New York Times\" reporters for more than a year. It's also about their failure to disclose their own personal relationship with the story. This is personal for these two women that have covered this story. Robin Pogrebin, one of the reporters is a classmate of Brett Kavanaugh's, and I think that's hugely important, because that's something that wasn't disclosed in this excerpt from their book, and yet, it's the whole reason for the story.",

It spread through a blog, \"The Intercept,\" that there was an allegation alleging an incident, then Senator Feinstein came through and said, \"Yes, I've heard of that, and I've now referred it on.\"   And then after that point, reporters like me in the national press didn't bother looking into the truth or falsity of the matter.

No. It was simply the amorphous attack on all Americans, but most important, it was an attack on Omar herself. She suffered more than you did. In other words, not only is Ilhan Omar more ungrateful, anti-American, she is also not surprisingly, a narcissist. Well, last week on the show, we spoke with Jim Kreindler. He is an attorney who represents the families of 9/11 victims. They've been shooting Saudi Arabia. Those families are hoping the F.B.I. would declassify documents related to Saudi's role in the attacks. Following our interview, the F.B.I. gave those families a victory, but only a small one. The F.B.I. gave Kreindler the name of a man who may have ordered two Saudi officials to assist the hijackers. But we'll let him share that name with any of the 9/11 families. They said its State secrets and refusing to declassify the F.B.I. report that contains Saudi ties to 9/11 hijackers. Why? D.O.J. did this on the grounds of what they call an active investigation. Instead, it would hurt relations with a foreign ally. Kriendler called the D.O.J.'s position, ridiculous and said they, quote, \" ... want to keep the information of their failures secret.\" He has vowed to have that information declassified, we will of course, keep you updated on that. So Americans are not allowed to know the extent of Saudi's involvement with 9/11. Many people think it's America's obligation, though, to fight wars on behalf of the Saudi Kingdom. You're seeing that all over today. Once again, tensions are rising in the Persian Gulf after an alleged Iranian attack on a Saudi oil facility that shut down about half that country's refining capacity. This under normal circumstances would be a flat out disaster for the United States, and yet fracking -- fracking has meant that the United States is now energy independent. We have some buffer. We don't need to fight Middle Eastern wars over oil anymore. We don't as of today. That is until we shut down our own energy sector to implement a Green New Deal, which many are proposing on the left. Daniel Turner is Executive Director of Power the Future, and he joins us tonight. Daniel, thanks so much for coming on. So for decades, literally, you heard politicians, most of them Democrats say something that was correct. We're dependent on foreign oil, and as a result, we have to intervene in these wars where Americans die and our Treasury gets drained. Now, thanks to new modes of energy exploration, fracking, we're not as dependent. You'd think we'd be celebrating that.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" Believe it or not, it was a year ago this week that a constellation of left-wing activist groups cooked up a series of outlandish lies designed to Brett Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court. The national news media as you remember, joined the smear campaign. They repeated and magnified the slurs. But in the end, it was to no effect. Kavanaugh was confirmed any way. Why? Because not a single allegation against him turned out to be true -- not one. And so the only lasting effect was to traumatize Brett Kavanaugh's wife and children. And yet the left never to this day, apologized for their dishonesty or their profound cruelty, nor did they ever accept defeat. They never do accept defeat. Why? Because when politics is your religion, acknowledging reality looks like sin, and so it continues. Over the weekend, The New York Times revived the attacks on Brett Kavanaugh. The newspaper ran a story, an excerpt from a book written by two of its reporters that claimed that while in college, more than 30 years ago, Kavanaugh exposed himself in effect to another student while drunk at a party. It was the flimsiest kind of charge. Where did it come from? Well, it came second hand from a single classmate of Kavanaugh's, a man who worked as a left-wing activist, later worked for the Clintons, in fact. So 20 years ago, no credible news organization would have run a story like that on the basis of that sourcing. The Times didn't hesitate, and it was picked up everywhere of course, instantly. On NBC's cable channel, for example, they immediately denounced Brett Kavanaugh as a gang rapist."

      "utterance": "I've never heard of a guy who is a one-time rapist. I've never heard of a guy who is a one-time sexual assaulter. I grew up with guys like this. He is from around this area, right? He is the fifth guy in a gang gape. Okay? He is the guy who comes in after he is drunk, as everybody else encourages, he can get away with it. And he has been pretty much covered his entire life. But this amazes me that we have an administration that out of the millions of people who are qualified in this country of all races and genders, they consistently find men who beat, abuse and sexually assault women."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Imagine saying something like that about somebody, where there's no evidence that it's true and a lot of evidence that it's not, but they didn't hesitate.

      "utterance": "A sexual predator who must be impeached. Okay. But wait, here's a late breaking addition to the story. It turns out that the woman it supposedly happened to, the alleged victim back at Yale more than 30 years ago, I turns out that person has no memory whatsoever of the incident. Now, the paper knew that, but somehow neglected to include it in their account, probably because it strongly suggests that their story is once again, a total crock, yet another lie. They should have told you that and they didn't. It's dishonest, of course. And you'd think it would spur the Democratic candidates, the one who called for Kavanagh's impeachment to rethink their positions. New evidence? Maybe that would shape their view. But no, not at all. They said exactly as they did a year ago. Remember this?"

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "We're not trying to convict him, we're just trying to destroy him and his family, so no due process, no presumption of innocence. Fairness is irrelevant. Whatever they tell you, don't let them tell you that justice has any role in this. Of course, this is a pure power grab. The left feels entitled to run the country truly entitled to and they feel entitled to control the Supreme Court. If they don't, it drives them crazy. Kavanaugh frustrates their political hopes, so any smear against him is acceptable, no matter what it is. But don't kid yourself. It's not just about destroying Brett Kavanaugh, he is ancillary. It's about destroying the entire legitimacy of our third branch of government, the judiciary. Plenty on the left are using the Kavanaugh saga to justify packing the court, adding more justices to make it reliably left wing or to change the rules so they can remove any judge the left doesn't approve of. This is the opposite of what the third branch was meant to do or be. The judiciary was meant to change slowly. The courts change over decades, rather than in response to a single election cycle. That's the way it was designed and for a reason, and for more than 200 years, it's worked. But to the modern left, that's totally intolerable. They're committed to remaking this country completely right now. America needs a new system they tell us, one with open borders and far fewer pesky individual rights. Rights like the freedom to speak clearly out loud. The Freedom of Expression, the right to bear arms, the Freedom of Religion -- no. To create this new utopia of obedient happy serfs, they're going to have to destroy all of that, two centuries of precedent and tradition. Maybe even destroy the country itself, whatever. They're happy to do that. As Robespierre noted, when you make omelets, you break eggs. Ryan Lovelace is the author of \"Search and Destroy: Inside the Campaign against Brett Kavanaugh,\" and he joins us tonight. So Ryan, thanks a lot for coming on. You spent a year thinking about this, reporting on it. Were you nevertheless surprised by the shoddiness of the story that \"The Times\" printed?"

    {
      "speaker": "RYAN LOVELACE, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "I was surprised by the shoddiness of it, but I was also in some ways, you know, warning that this was part of a larger pattern -- a pattern of not disclosing what actually is going on here. You know, it's not simply enough that The New York Times had to run a correction -- a correction that explained precisely what actually went on here. A correction that said of the woman who is alleged to have been victim has been telling folks that she wasn't a victim, that she hasn't been able to confirm this story for these \"New York Times\" reporters for more than a year. It's also about their failure to disclose their own personal relationship with the story. This is personal for these two women that have covered this story. Robin Pogrebin, one of the reporters is a classmate of Brett Kavanaugh's, and I think that's hugely important, because that's something that wasn't disclosed in this excerpt from their book, and yet, it's the whole reason for the story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "speaker": "LOVELACE",
      "utterance": "Correct. And you know that's really interesting because she was an undergraduate there at the same time, and that's her whole authority for writing this book with \"The New York Times.\" You know, she is not a legal reporter. She is a culture reporter. And the way she is approaching this is because of her personal relationships with those in the Yale community at the same time, Kavanaugh was there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Remarkable. The story itself sounds a lot like the three or four other different allegations that we heard at great length a year ago, in that there's no evidence whatsoever that it's true -- none."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOVELACE",
      "utterance": "Right. And one of the important parts about it too is it's trading up the chain in just the same way that those allegations did last year. Now, looking back now to last July, Christine Blasey-Ford, the first primary accuser came forward, and when she first tried to get the attention of \"The Washington Post\" by an encrypted app, they didn't pay attention to her. Then she threatened to go to \"The Times.\" But immediately it spread online. It spread through a blog, \"The Intercept,\" that there was an allegation alleging an incident, then Senator Feinstein came through and said, \"Yes, I've heard of that, and I've now referred it on.\" And then after that point, reporters like me in the national press didn't bother looking into the truth or falsity of the matter. They simply decided, \"Well, is this going to help him? Is this going to hurt him? How is it going to affect him?\" And they never ever bothered looking into the truth of the matter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOVELACE",
      "utterance": "That's correct. And it's really one of the new phenomenon that Supreme Court Justice nominations are going to have to experience for years going forward. You know, thinking back to Judge Bork and Justice Thomas and other Supreme Court nominations that have been bitterly fought, this didn't exist before. And so much else of this didn't exist before either. You know, in reporting out \"Search and Destroy,\" I expected the advice and consent process to unfold as it had with Merrick Garland, President Obama's pick that the Senate rejected and with Justice Neil Gorsuch, who the Senate confirmed that was President Trump's pick. But what I really found was a search and destroy process that began even before Judge Kavanaugh was selected."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOVELACE",
      "utterance": "Well, the left had said from the very beginning, we're going to oppose whoever, whoever Trump picks and demand justice. A new organized dark money group on the left pledged to spend $5 million opposing whoever the pick was. And that group is run by Brian Fallon. He is a Hillary Clinton campaign flack. He said no at the time. It wasn't even so much about canceling whichever nominee was picked. It's about building the muscle memory to organize around the courts looking towards 2020."

So there's actually no story here, yet, they haven't taken back those calls for impeachment. But does it surprise you? Because you saw how Democrats weaponized these baseless allegations during the confirmation hearing. Senator Feinstein sat on that information for six weeks and Democrats weaponized it at the 11th hour despite multiple times where they could have come forward with this information whether it was Brett Kavanaugh testifying closed doors, 1,300 questions that were submitted to Brett Kavanaugh that could have been in that, or even in these meetings sitting down with Brett Kavanaugh as well. Senator Feinstein could have done it then."

This is a lifetime appointment, probably nothing you could do about it, unless, you know, we learn something very dramatic But on the basis of what we just learned, and of course, he's not going to be impeached.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

I mean, you watch the career of the Chief Justice who has moved left in really kind of the most mindless conceivable way, I would argue, and what is that a product of? Maybe his judicial philosophy has changed? Or maybe it's just really hard to live here in Washington, if you don't kind of toe the line?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, that would be a good question for him, but I think another thing that's important with all of this that doesn't get discussed as much, it's just how thoroughly vetted Brett Kavanaugh was, right? He went through seven background checks. When he was a staff secretary for George W. Bush, he went through a vetting process with that because of his access to sensitive information. When he was confirmed to the District Court of Appeals, he also went through a vetting process and confirmation process. The Senate Judiciary Committee investigated and looked at 45 different witnesses, 25 witness statements, produced a 414-page report looking at all of this. So I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. I mean, this guy has been as vetted as possible. You even now have Justice Ginsburg, who is singing his praises, which we need to take a listen to what she has had to say about him as well."

So -- and there's also been a lot of character witnesses that have stepped forward knowing him from his time in high school saying, \"Look, this guy is salt of the Earth, right? This is not something he would do.\" And one thing I would like to ask because I wonder why the mainstream media, why they haven't looked further in to his accusers? Why are they not concerned that Leland Keyser doubts Christine Ford's story, right? This is one of the eyewitnesses that Christine Ford gave, someone who was supposed to be one of our best friends who told the F.B.I. that she was being pressured by Christian Ford's friends to change her story. And it was also reported that Christine Ford's dad congratulated Brett Kavanaugh's dad on his confirmation. So if you don't have your own dad behind you that certainly raises questions."

The candidates jump on it and come to this conclusion that we need to impeach Brett Kavanaugh. And then the newspaper itself admits in effect that the story is a crock, actually. That the supposed victim doesn't remember it and says she is not a victim. So isn't it time then to say, \"Oh, wow, you know, now I have new information.

Dick Morris and James Carville should be teaching this in political campaigning master class. It's brilliant. I did an impromptu parody of a Joe Biden anecdote on your show last week. This is like a parody of my parody. I was floundering toward the end and threw in Brigitte Bardot. He went Esther Williams -- that's brilliant. You can't -- and for the benefit of your younger viewers, by which I mean Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Esther Williams was the star as you know of \"Million Dollar Mermaid: Dangerous when wet.\" And my personal favorite \"Scotts Ahoy.\" We all know if you're surrounded by MS-13 members that they absolutely -- they don't mind -- they let it go when Adlai Stevenson compared them to Sonja Henie in \"Sun Valley Serenade\" and when LBJ said, \"That pillbox hat makes you look a little bit like Doris Day,\" they let that go. But if you call them Esther Williams, you better be prepared to have a six- foot metal chain with you. And Biden has -- I think Biden has this. You know, Kamala Harris says she smoked weed listening to Tupac and Snoop Dogg.

Many Americans found themselves now having their Civil Rights stripped from them. As a Muslim, not only was I suffering as an American who was attacked on that day, but the next day, I woke up as my fellow Americans were now treating me a suspect."

No. It was simply the amorphous attack on all Americans, but most important, it was an attack on Omar herself. She suffered more than you did. In other words, not only is Ilhan Omar more ungrateful, anti-American, she is also not surprisingly, a narcissist. Well, last week on the show, we spoke with Jim Kreindler. He is an attorney who represents the families of 9/11 victims. They've been shooting Saudi Arabia. Those families are hoping the F.B.I. would declassify documents related to Saudi's role in the attacks. Following our interview, the F.B.I. gave those families a victory, but only a small one. The F.B.I. gave Kreindler the name of a man who may have ordered two Saudi officials to assist the hijackers. But we'll let him share that name with any of the 9/11 families. They said its State secrets and refusing to declassify the F.B.I. report that contains Saudi ties to 9/11 hijackers. Why? D.O.J. did this on the grounds of what they call an active investigation. Instead, it would hurt relations with a foreign ally. Kriendler called the D.O.J.'s position, ridiculous and said they, quote, \" ... want to keep the information of their failures secret.\" He has vowed to have that information declassified, we will of course, keep you updated on that. So Americans are not allowed to know the extent of Saudi's involvement with 9/11. Many people think it's America's obligation, though, to fight wars on behalf of the Saudi Kingdom. You're seeing that all over today. Once again, tensions are rising in the Persian Gulf after an alleged Iranian attack on a Saudi oil facility that shut down about half that country's refining capacity. This under normal circumstances would be a flat out disaster for the United States, and yet fracking -- fracking has meant that the United States is now energy independent. We have some buffer. We don't need to fight Middle Eastern wars over oil anymore. We don't as of today. That is until we shut down our own energy sector to implement a Green New Deal, which many are proposing on the left. Daniel Turner is Executive Director of Power the Future, and he joins us tonight. Daniel, thanks so much for coming on. So for decades, literally, you heard politicians, most of them Democrats say something that was correct. We're dependent on foreign oil, and as a result, we have to intervene in these wars where Americans die and our Treasury gets drained. Now, thanks to new modes of energy exploration, fracking, we're not as dependent. You'd think we'd be celebrating that."

Elizabeth Warren said on her first day, she will make fracking illegal as did Bernie Sanders on their very first day. That's millions of jobs, without a doubt, ruining small towns across America. But most importantly, what would it do to our energy supply? What would it do to oil prices? And what we see with these attacks that happened in Saudi Arabia, we're going to feel the price at the pump. There's no doubt about it because it's a global commodity.

Armond White is a film critic of many years who writes for \"National Review.\" He just published an essay in \"The New York Post\" calling Netflix quote, \"An Obama propaganda machine.\" We're happy to have Armond White join us tonight. Mr. White, thanks very much for coming on. ARMOND WHITE, FILM CRITIC, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": I'm happy to talk to you again, Tucker."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Thank you. So what is the problem that you have with the Obama's reaching this producing deal with Netflix? Why is that bad?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "Well, I suppose they have the right to do it, of course. But the thing that bothers me is the lack of disclosure, the lack of transparency about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "Netflix promotes it as a great thing, as a great advance for the Obama's, and a message from them to the American people. But they are not honest about it being propaganda. And that's the problem that I have with it as a film viewer and as a film critic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So you believe that there is a political cast to it that they're putting their thumb on the scale that's there's a political message to the content."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "Oh, surely, there certainly is. In fact, there was an article about this film, \"American Factory\" in \"The Wall Street Journal\" last week that talks about how the film itself ignores Obama's -- the part that Obama played in the factory in Ohio that the film deals with itself. That's one part of the lack of disclosure about this, but the part that really bothered me that I focus on in the article is the way the film media -- culture media -- decided to cheer the Obama's connection with Netflix. And it's the kind of illusion, I'm sorry, it is a kind of collusion that Americans should be very worried about and concerned about, especially the lack of disclosure there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, sure. Why would it ever be a good idea for a politician to be involved in the content business, in making entertainment or news for that matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "Never, never. And it's worrisome when you think about a politician leaving office, then all of a sudden becoming a mogul, a mogul in the film industry, and a mogul not to simply give entertainment to people, but to give political ideology. And that's very worrisome as well. The fact that Obama has become a movie mogul, to me it's just a continuation of his -- of that too cozy relationship he has always had with the media -- with the corporate media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "And that's got to be of concern to everyone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So really quick, do we know how much he is making from this? He and his wife? And do we know what Netflix is doing it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "We don't know the amount. Netflix has not disclosed the amount the way the publishing industry disclosed the $65 million that was given -- that gifted to the Obama's."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "But clearly, Netflix is a part of Hollywood. Hollywood has always been leftist, primarily leftist, and especially the documentary genre. People need to know this, I think that it wasn't just Michael Moore who ruined the documentary genre. But in Hollywood, documentary has always been a form for political ideology, not for information."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "That's the difference between Hollywood docs and true journalism --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's a really good point that I think most consumers don't understand. Armond White, one of the very few critics to think for himself and for that reason, we're always happy to have you on the show. Thank you very much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Tucker. My pleasure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night and every week night at 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and especially groupthink, which is everywhere. President Trump will start speaking any moment now in New Mexico. For now, we turn things over to our friend, Sean Hannity standing by in New York.
