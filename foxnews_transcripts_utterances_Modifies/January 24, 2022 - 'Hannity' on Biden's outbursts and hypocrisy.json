      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right. Tucker, thank you. And welcome to HANNITY. Tonight, as the Biden White House implodes, poor Joe Biden, he's lashing out today. He called our own Peter Doocy, a, quote, stupid son of a bitch. Whoo, now, it's angry Joe. Biden once promised to restore civility, telling his appointees he would fire them on the spot if they disrespected others. Of course, the rules they don't apply to Joe and his comments about Peter Doocy are especially ridiculous given that Biden's own weakened mental abilities. In a moment, we're going to play the tape and Peter Doocy will respond. Also, we're just learning at this second that Biden apparently called Peter Doocy just a short time ago and we'll find out how that went. All right. But first tonight, major cities all around the country, they are now reeling from another weekend of violence. In New York City, a career criminal viciously targeting two NYPD officers, killing one, critically injuring another. Officer Jason Rivera was only 22- years-old. Officer Wilbert Mora, he was only 27 years old. He's fighting for his life tonight. And according to reports, the deranged killer, quote, kept firing at the wounded cops even as they lay helplessly on the floor, a complete execution. Now, sadly, as we speak, cops all across the country, they're being targeted at an alarming rate, according to the FBI, while intentional police killings have now reached a 20-year high. Three hundred and forty-six officers were shot in the line of duty in 2021 alone, another multi-year high. Meanwhile ambush style attacks against cops, that was up a whopping 115 percent over the previous year, and it's not just New York. On Sunday morning in Washington. D.C., an officer was rushed to the hospital after getting shot. On the same day in Houston, Texas, Corporal Charles Galloway was murdered during a, quote, routine traffic stop. There's no such thing. In city after city, violent crime is spiraling out of control. Carjackings -- look at this -- they're up by a whopping 510 percent. Now, downtown shootings in Chicago, wow, you think it can't get higher they're already up a whopping 220 percent. California just recorded the most murders in 20 years. In 2021, at least 12 U.S. cities set a new record for murder. Why is it happening? Well, if you listen to the Democrats and propagandist Jen Psaki, guns are just magically floating through the air by themselves. The guns are the problem. The guns hijack -- carjacking the cars? Anyway, they're terrorizing the communities they say all across the country. The reality is this defund, dismantle, no bail is all responsible for this major wave of violence. In city after city, police budgets have been slashed, including a billion dollar cut into the New York Police Department. Now to make matters worse, you got far left prosecutors, they stopped prosecuting crimes in the name of equality and equity. You have some jurisdictions now even eliminating bail for many crimes and turning jails into revolving doors and our streets into a violent free-for-all. Terrified by his radical base, Joe Biden is doing nothing to reduce crime by the way in many states now you can just steal as long as you don't steal up to a thousand dollars, 950 bucks, you're only going to get a ticket. During the 2020 summer of violence, Joe Biden all but ignored all of the carnage. We had dozens of Americans dead, thousands of cops injured, billions in property damage, arson, looting. Kamala Harris actually promoted the bail fund to get violent criminals out of jail. She praised the LAPD police cuts, you know, protecting the peaceful law-abiding Americans. Why don't we protect them? This administration is providing cover for criminals, all while supporting groups like the group Black Lives Matter. You know, recently, they complained that murder police officers are treated like heroes in tear- jerker press conferences. The group Black Lives Matter apparently prefers - - oh that's right -- what do we want, dead cops, when we want them, now. Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon, or so they say. But today, when pressed by our own Peter Doocy, a rare moment of truth. Peter had a battle with Jen Psaki who admitted that an underfunding of police departments has led to a surge in crime.

So he called you a stupid SOB. And I was thinking, that, I did not hear that. And I went downstairs and I opened up my phone and he did. And so, I my response was delayed. But, Sean, and we have some news tonight, after years of clips of the president and I kind of mixing it up on the campaign trail and during the transition and here at the White House, within about an hour of that exchange, he called my cell phone and he said, it's nothing personal pal, and we went back and forth, and we were talking about uh just kind of moving forward.

Now, no one knew it at the time but the arrogance of ignoring the possibility of what doctors have always known which is treat the patient in front of you, it's not a one-size-fits-all plan. Of course, try to prevent illness but have a strategy, a backup plan. Fauci is never taking care of patients. He's a virologist. He works in test tubes. And so, there's no approach to patient care, the ministering of people who are ill that's required and that's where you need leadership and it's not been there.

He called our own Peter Doocy, a, quote, stupid son of a bitch. Whoo, now, it's angry Joe. Biden once promised to restore civility, telling his appointees he would fire them on the spot if they disrespected others. Of course, the rules they don't apply to Joe and his comments about Peter Doocy are especially ridiculous given that Biden's own weakened mental abilities. In a moment, we're going to play the tape and Peter Doocy will respond. Also, we're just learning at this second that Biden apparently called Peter Doocy just a short time ago and we'll find out how that went. All right. But first tonight, major cities all around the country, they are now reeling from another weekend of violence. In New York City, a career criminal viciously targeting two NYPD officers, killing one, critically injuring another. Officer Jason Rivera was only 22- years-old. Officer Wilbert Mora, he was only 27 years old. He's fighting for his life tonight. And according to reports, the deranged killer, quote, kept firing at the wounded cops even as they lay helplessly on the floor, a complete execution. Now, sadly, as we speak, cops all across the country, they're being targeted at an alarming rate, according to the FBI, while intentional police killings have now reached a 20-year high. Three hundred and forty-six officers were shot in the line of duty in 2021 alone, another multi-year high. Meanwhile ambush style attacks against cops, that was up a whopping 115 percent over the previous year, and it's not just New York. On Sunday morning in Washington. D.C., an officer was rushed to the hospital after getting shot. On the same day in Houston, Texas, Corporal Charles Galloway was murdered during a, quote, routine traffic stop. There's no such thing. In city after city, violent crime is spiraling out of control. Carjackings -- look at this -- they're up by a whopping 510 percent. Now, downtown shootings in Chicago, wow, you think it can't get higher they're already up a whopping 220 percent. California just recorded the most murders in 20 years. In 2021, at least 12 U.S. cities set a new record for murder. Why is it happening? Well, if you listen to the Democrats and propagandist Jen Psaki, guns are just magically floating through the air by themselves. The guns are the problem. The guns hijack -- carjacking the cars? Anyway, they're terrorizing the communities they say all across the country. The reality is this defund, dismantle, no bail is all responsible for this major wave of violence. In city after city, police budgets have been slashed, including a billion dollar cut into the New York Police Department. Now to make matters worse, you got far left prosecutors, they stopped prosecuting crimes in the name of equality and equity. You have some jurisdictions now even eliminating bail for many crimes and turning jails into revolving doors and our streets into a violent free-for-all. Terrified by his radical base, Joe Biden is doing nothing to reduce crime by the way in many states now you can just steal as long as you don't steal up to a thousand dollars, 950 bucks, you're only going to get a ticket. During the 2020 summer of violence, Joe Biden all but ignored all of the carnage. We had dozens of Americans dead, thousands of cops injured, billions in property damage, arson, looting. Kamala Harris actually promoted the bail fund to get violent criminals out of jail. She praised the LAPD police cuts, you know, protecting the peaceful law-abiding Americans. Why don't we protect them? This administration is providing cover for criminals, all while supporting groups like the group Black Lives Matter. You know, recently, they complained that murder police officers are treated like heroes in tear- jerker press conferences. The group Black Lives Matter apparently prefers - - oh that's right -- what do we want, dead cops, when we want them, now. Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon, or so they say. But today, when pressed by our own Peter Doocy, a rare moment of truth. Peter had a battle with Jen Psaki who admitted that an underfunding of police departments has led to a surge in crime. Take a look."

In a different way, I'll ask you, when you put the polls together, the media now for the first time are critical. They've never been critical up to this point.

His biggest problem, Sean, is that he cast his lot with Bernie Sanders instead of Joe Manchin. If he had come into office with a 50-50 Senate and with a narrowly controlled House and said, I'm going to govern as a moderate, I'm going to lead America as a moderate, the era of big government remains over, he'd been in a very different position as president.

His numbers with Hispanics are down. Hispanics are more leaning towards Republican. Blacks are down in numbers. It is the base of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party has already used Joe Biden. He's useless to them now. So they're looking for someone else. He got the White House for them and now they're going to cast him aside.

You will lose 10 or 15 liberal Democrats and AOC in the House. That's the exchange that he needs to make. He cannot win off of the progressive base.

And amid Joe Biden's non-stop weakness and outright foreign policy confusion, let's be brutally honest here -- 8,500 troops on a higher state of alert and readiness is embarrassing and it's humiliating. The Russians have anywhere between 100,000 and 200,000 troops on the border. They have tanks. They have military equipment and Joe Biden is not going to war with Russia or Vladimir Putin, frankly nor should he. So let's stop to make pretend, oh, we have a state of readiness for 8,500 troops tough guy talk because Putin is laughing. Now, President Joey wants to hurt Vladimir, he got the answer. He's a hostile actor, this is a hostile regime, must be taken seriously. If you want to break Vladimir Putin and defeat him, the best way -- take back the pipeline waiver you gave him, number one, and then in this country, open up completely all natural gas and oil and coal production to our maximum capacity, and then you can help bankrupt Russia when we go back to being energy independent, and we can go back to being a net exporter of energy instead of making him and Russia rich again. Now, press propaganda circle back Jen Psaki said today, Americans in Ukraine should leave now, and reiterated that no evacuation effort is planned should Russia invade.

One of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom.

You're right, Vladimir Putin has over 100,000 troops massed on the border of Ukraine. He's not leaving. We don't have the leverage to induce him to leave, and Ukraine wants more from us.

All right. Let's focus on Aaron Rodgers. Aaron Rodgers came under heavy fire for suggesting he was vaccinated, wasn't fully vaccinated. You know, he's a healthy athlete, why aren't more people willing to accept that the idea of freedom, medical privacy, doctor-patient confidentiality, and now that we know that whether you're vaccinated or boostered and had natural immunity you're still going to get it, why does he still say it's a it's a disease of the unvaccinated?"

And, Sean, one of the lessons that we can take from sports leagues, whether it's the NBA, whether it's the NHL or whether it's the NFL is they have this nearly 100 percent overall vaccination rate, right? And when you look at the numbers, I believe it's a hundred percent in the NHL, 97 percent in the NBA, and 95 plus percent in the NFL. The guys are still testing overwhelmingly positive, even with either or nearly 100 percent vaccination rate. It's actually a fascinating window into what the larger United States would look like and the answer is the pandemic doesn't go away even if everyone is vaccinated. So what Aaron Rodgers has, Sean, is he's got the ability because his contract is guaranteed, because he's one of the best quarterbacks to ever play the game to say exactly what he thinks, much like Kyrie Irving in the NBA and also like Novak Djokovic in tennis. These are three of the greatest athletes in the world, all unvaccinated, all looking at the data, and making rational choices for themselves based on consultation with medical professionals. They've all had it to my knowledge COVID and all been fine just like me who's had it twice, Sean.

In fact, that's what I want to jump off into this issue with Bill Maher because folks are anxious, and a lot of frontline workers who see the hypocrisy, they see the duplicity. And what we've really got right now is a caste system. We have staff who have to wear masks, and customers, they can do whatever they want. And even -- everyone at home think about this, as you walk into the restaurant, you have to put a mask on. You sit down now, they tell you, you can take your mask off. Really? Where's the science there? This is what undermines our confidence and what fibbing Fauci's been saying all along. The flip-flopping is not just a little bit of a problem in translation, it is undermining our ability to trust what we're hearing and you're being gaslit at home. People are telling you things like you'll have to wear masks forever, which is what they're actually thinking and it's complete utter nonsense."

You told me that no, they're not working as well on omicron as GSK sotrovimab, I think I've said it right. And it turned out to be true. Now, they're actually saying it. Now, these other companies that have done a phenomenal work. I'm sure they're going to adjust their monoclonal antibody formula and probably adapt to new variants. If breakthrough cases, in other words, if you're vaccinated, you have a boost or a natural immunity, and it's -- you're still getting COVID, this is no longer a disease of the unvaccinated. Why is Fauci talking about, you know, fourth and fifth booster shots?"

      "speaker": "OZ",
      "utterance": "He's got to defend what he's been saying, and he's too arrogant to pull back from the precipice. And everyone now sees what's happening. You point out the good example which is the virus shifted, the monoclonal antibodies have to shift. We completely ignored the possibility of therapeutics, although you and I talked about this literally the first week that we knew about the pandemic and we got slammed for it. But it turns out in retrospect, it was probably the best path. Now, no one knew it at the time but the arrogance of ignoring the possibility of what doctors have always known which is treat the patient in front of you, it's not a one-size-fits-all plan. Of course, try to prevent illness but have a strategy, a backup plan. Fauci is never taking care of patients. He's a virologist. He works in test tubes. And so, there's no approach to patient care, the ministering of people who are ill that's required and that's where you need leadership and it's not been there. I got to say, one thing I've noticed in Pennsylvania is when you get in front of folks and say, Washington got it wrong, COVID's a good example, but the authoritarian overreach, the power grab that you spoke of is continuing in other areas, people resonate to that. I mean, part of the reason they're coming out in droves is because they want to get confident again and they know what's out there. They have someone who's got a bold voice to go to Washington and say, enough. We've got to stop thinking about how liberals evaluate the world. It's not all about victims. It's not caring about caring. It's caring about fixing."

When are they giving those back? Where's the commitment to truth, facts and transparency? Now, there has been wondering was constantly under fire.

I say that it's economics. It's fear. It's -- \"The New York Times\" for example actually in concert for big corporations and FBI who raided my apartment after a source transited me a document, Sean. You mentioned \"New York Times\" defaming me and me suing them for defamation. It's up to us the people now. We, the people have to do the job that newsrooms used to do. It is a complicated problem. A lot of people are hopeless, but I kind of have written a book about how to do journalism, Sean, in the clown world."

We wish her well and hope she recovers quickly. But this is now, Times v. Sullivan, which is for public figures standard. You have to prove malice seems to be teetering on the brink here.

They said that we were deceptive, \"The New York Times\" reported that our videos of September 2020 were deceptive. That is the guy who had ballots in their car. We sued that for defamation. The judge in New York state, Charles Wood, arguing, denying their motion to dismiss our lawsuit, said it was \"The New York Times\" who engaged in this and ration and deception. Also a Christmas Eve ruling, Sean, where they had to sequester our memos, Sean, \"The New York Times\" published my private lawyer correspondence after the FBI raided my home and the judge ruling against \"The New York Times\" twice. \"The New York Times\" attacked the judge. So there is no recourse in this country to hold the media accountable. In many ways, \"The New York Times,\" and organizations like it, are more powerful than our own government because they work in concert with big tech which in turn works in concert with big pharmaceutical companies. So, how do you break through that? Well, I wrote a book about how to break through that. In fact, we're winning. We're winning in a lawsuit and also having whistle-blower is not go to \"The New York Times\" but come to Project Veritas because to quote them, Sean, there is simply nowhere for them to go."
