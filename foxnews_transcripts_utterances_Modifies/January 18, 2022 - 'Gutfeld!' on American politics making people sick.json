      "sentences": "Clap. Clap like you're about to die. Clap. Happy Tuesday, everyone. What a great show we have tonight. Like a packet of smoked meat sticks. We got two Slim Jims. Jim Norton and Jimmy Failla. Yes. One looks like it escaped serial killer who targets the homeless, and the other one looks like his next victim. Dagen looks like the one who'd find the body while she was jogging and then takes the watch. While Kat takes a kidney. She says it's good for the skin. Now there's a good chance that I make you sick to your stomach, like say a 40 percent chance about the same as you'd get if you eat the clam plate at Denny's. That's according to University of Nebraska experts who claim that four in 10 people cite politics as a top life stressor. It's so bad that it causes insomnia, destroys relationships, and for at least five percent causes them to feel suicidal. And so does watching Emily in Paris, but I'm not quitting that either. It really is delightful. In the second season getting picked up for a third. They blame politics for causing fatigue, anger and compulsive behaviors. And that's just from the staff of \"FOX AND FRIENDS.\" Quarter claim they're thinking of moving because of the politics in their state, especially California, which explains why you halls are harder to find than an actress with her real nose. Can you blame them? Politics suck. And our politicians are suckier. Look at them. Their faces should be on the back of household cleaning products to induce vomiting if swallowed. And Pelosi's is investment success has raised some eyebrows, including hers to the top of her forehead. Were a country run by evil rejects from the Muppets, except they've got their hands up your butt. And it doesn't feel as good as it used to. So much like smoking weed. Politics started as a thing to prevent people from killing each other. You created a process that enables debate to eliminate the need for duels, which is good. Tried buying a decent sword on Amazon. I've tried. But over time, politics has become less of a mayhem reducer and more of the opposite of conflict stirrer. Why is it getting worse? Well, experts blame social media Web sites podcasts and the nonstop T.V. news cycle. But notice how they leave out legacy media. It's on us and not them. But one thing is true. Cable News has a content problem, which is a time problem. How do you fill 24 hours with 20 minutes of news? It's like trying to feed Brian Stelter only one box of Twinkies. So you just repeat it over and over and over again. Back when I was a kid, you got your news at 6:00 p.m. Then you finished your Swanson's T.V. dinner, adjusted your polio braces and all was right with the world. Too soon? I don't know. Now we can take one story and like the skin on Jerry Nadler's trunk stretch it for three days. The media declares a crisis then covers their coverage of it then covers reaction to their coverage. No wonder people feel bad. But just imagine how much happier you be if you tuned it all out.",

According to Gallup in just one year, we saw a swing from a nine-point Democratic advantage to a five-point GOP edge. That's a shift of 14 points according to our points shifting department. Shout out to Seth. Good job. That's pretty big when you consider the media it's still 95 percent liberal. And also that Biden was supposed to be a jar of relief factor after Trump's four-year rug burn. Biden was supposed to bring people together, except we didn't know would be in a line waiting for COVID tests. So people feel worse under Joe perhaps because he's more divisive than a -- than a magician with a circular saw. Now your instinct is to blame these guys. Understandable. They're a-holes, but they're being led by bigger a-holes. Our politicians now Chase recognition from the most extreme media types. To get the dopamine rush the Dems throw that beast more red meat and 24 hours than a zookeeper on Ritalin, which why Biden instead of fighting crime or inflation, calls half of America bigots. His staff is merely checking what crap tends to trend on woke Twitter and then spoon feeds it to the old coot like his wife does his strain beats. What say you, Joe?",

What Jim Norton calls a solid nine. Study finds the people most vulnerable to political stress are younger, lean Democrat, and are more actively engaged in political causes. They're more likely to dye their hair shocking colors, too. That's nature's way of warning you about poisonous frogs, or a poisonous liberal arts major. But it makes sense. If you choose an angry, bitter framing of the world, you too will be angry and bitter. If you view everything through a racial prism, you might end up with your own show on MSNBC. But you won't find a moment of happiness in your life. Everything's racist, it's joyless. You'll be constantly pissed off by your faulty framing, and no one wants to be around that. Finally, the researchers see their data as a bad sign for democracy that people view politics as harmful, they won't get involved. And why is that bad exactly? They just said the more involved you are, the worse it is. Maybe swallowing all that junk food is bad for you. If you're injecting politics into everything from sports to house pain, you're replacing knowledge with rhetoric and losing friends, family and your mind in the process. So if your head hurts, because you keep hitting it with a hammer, then put down the hammer. Or if you're Don Lemon keep at it, it can only help.",

They just want their side to be right. And what happened to the left, the reason they're hemorrhaging support is they're not a cool party anymore. Like the left used to be a free speech, sex, drugs and rock'n'roll party. They were cool. They want every culture war, rather on the wrong side of that issue.

Fact is the NBA makes way more money ignoring Chinese genocide. But after taking more heat than a jockstrap full of Tiger Balm. Oh. He tweeted some clarifying comments, quotes. In re-listening to this week's podcast I recognize I come across as lacking empathy. As a refugee my family fled a country with its own set of human rights issues. So this is something that's very much apart of my lived experience. To be clear my belief is that human rights matter whether in China the United States or elsewhere full stop. Oh. Full stop. I knew he was lying when he claimed he re-listened to a podcast. No one's done that ever. He also said full stop, before actually telling us what P.R. firm wrote that. As for the Warriors, they're running from Chamath faster than Jim Norton from a Catch a Predator film crew. They call him a limited investor who doesn't speak on their behalf.

      "sentences": "Wow. Spent a lot of time on that. Yes, some random idiot randomly attacked a Michael Jackson impersonator in Las Vegas. His name? Santana Jackson. Look at this, apparently, while the Tribute Artists was performing, the man suddenly started hitting them. Too bad he didn't know that Santana, in addition to annoying pedestrians, is also a pretty good wrestler, and honed his grappling skills with Tito, Jermaine, and Jackie, and Marlon. I don't believe that. That's caught on video by terrible people that contribute nothing except to our show. He sweeps the assailants leg, takes him down with a chokehold, and then he applies several skillful chokeholds until the attacker is subdued like a sleeping baby. Yes, the dumb drunk turned a Michael Jackson impersonator into the Terminator. Now, I watched this video 17.5 times. I stopped in the middle to check my stocks. That's how well I'm doing. But the ending is priceless. With the battered idiot appearing days drunk and confused like he taken too much (INAUDIBLE). So, being that this is \"T-SHIRT TALES,\" let's take a look at that T-shirt, shall we? Closing in on it? It reads, can't fix stupid. Of course, it's never been more correct. But if you look closer, it's got a Dallas Cowboy fan using a urinal incorrectly, while two Philly Eagles fans use it the right way. So, clearly, this beaten man is an Eagles fan. Which means getting your ass kicked on a subway platform by a street performer is what they call Wednesday. Jimmy, I don't think there's anything better than watching an unassuming person beat the crap out of someone who thinks they can fight and picks the fight.",

As a lot of new music seems to have trouble gaining traction, they just don't make them like they used to -- talking about songs not shoelaces used to strangle transients, Jim. I don't know why. Several songs from Creedence Clearwater Revival made the list. For example, have you ever seen the rain with that number 16? Apparently, it's a strip club classic for blind lap dancers. says a jerk. But that's eight spots higher than Adele's \"Oh my God,\" which was written about me, and it's also much higher than The Weeknd's new single \"Sacrifice,\" which isn't even the top 100 anymore. Learned that spell jerk. He can't spell his own name that's kind of pathetic. Anyway, Jack Antonoff in The Bleachers, whatever that is just appeared on SNL, didn't make the list which is embarrassing considering the fact that music from the most underrated band in the world Nickelback did. I'm so tired of the nickel-bashing, you're just jealous that they wrote \"Let It Be\" and you didn't.

      "utterance": "Clap. Clap like you're about to die. Clap. Happy Tuesday, everyone. What a great show we have tonight. Like a packet of smoked meat sticks. We got two Slim Jims. Jim Norton and Jimmy Failla. Yes. One looks like it escaped serial killer who targets the homeless, and the other one looks like his next victim. Dagen looks like the one who'd find the body while she was jogging and then takes the watch. While Kat takes a kidney. She says it's good for the skin. Now there's a good chance that I make you sick to your stomach, like say a 40 percent chance about the same as you'd get if you eat the clam plate at Denny's. That's according to University of Nebraska experts who claim that four in 10 people cite politics as a top life stressor. It's so bad that it causes insomnia, destroys relationships, and for at least five percent causes them to feel suicidal. And so does watching Emily in Paris, but I'm not quitting that either. It really is delightful. In the second season getting picked up for a third. They blame politics for causing fatigue, anger and compulsive behaviors. And that's just from the staff of \"FOX AND FRIENDS.\" Quarter claim they're thinking of moving because of the politics in their state, especially California, which explains why you halls are harder to find than an actress with her real nose. Can you blame them? Politics suck. And our politicians are suckier. Look at them. Their faces should be on the back of household cleaning products to induce vomiting if swallowed. And Pelosi's is investment success has raised some eyebrows, including hers to the top of her forehead. Were a country run by evil rejects from the Muppets, except they've got their hands up your butt. And it doesn't feel as good as it used to. So much like smoking weed. Politics started as a thing to prevent people from killing each other. You created a process that enables debate to eliminate the need for duels, which is good. Tried buying a decent sword on Amazon. I've tried. But over time, politics has become less of a mayhem reducer and more of the opposite of conflict stirrer. Why is it getting worse? Well, experts blame social media Web sites podcasts and the nonstop T.V. news cycle. But notice how they leave out legacy media. It's on us and not them. But one thing is true. Cable News has a content problem, which is a time problem. How do you fill 24 hours with 20 minutes of news? It's like trying to feed Brian Stelter only one box of Twinkies. So you just repeat it over and over and over again. Back when I was a kid, you got your news at 6:00 p.m. Then you finished your Swanson's T.V. dinner, adjusted your polio braces and all was right with the world. Too soon? I don't know. Now we can take one story and like the skin on Jerry Nadler's trunk stretch it for three days. The media declares a crisis then covers their coverage of it then covers reaction to their coverage. No wonder people feel bad. But just imagine how much happier you be if you tuned it all out."

According to Gallup in just one year, we saw a swing from a nine-point Democratic advantage to a five-point GOP edge. That's a shift of 14 points according to our points shifting department. Shout out to Seth. Good job. That's pretty big when you consider the media it's still 95 percent liberal. And also that Biden was supposed to be a jar of relief factor after Trump's four-year rug burn. Biden was supposed to bring people together, except we didn't know would be in a line waiting for COVID tests. So people feel worse under Joe perhaps because he's more divisive than a -- than a magician with a circular saw. Now your instinct is to blame these guys. Understandable. They're a-holes, but they're being led by bigger a-holes. Our politicians now Chase recognition from the most extreme media types. To get the dopamine rush the Dems throw that beast more red meat and 24 hours than a zookeeper on Ritalin, which why Biden instead of fighting crime or inflation, calls half of America bigots. His staff is merely checking what crap tends to trend on woke Twitter and then spoon feeds it to the old coot like his wife does his strain beats. What say you, Joe?"

What Jim Norton calls a solid nine. Study finds the people most vulnerable to political stress are younger, lean Democrat, and are more actively engaged in political causes. They're more likely to dye their hair shocking colors, too. That's nature's way of warning you about poisonous frogs, or a poisonous liberal arts major. But it makes sense. If you choose an angry, bitter framing of the world, you too will be angry and bitter. If you view everything through a racial prism, you might end up with your own show on MSNBC. But you won't find a moment of happiness in your life. Everything's racist, it's joyless. You'll be constantly pissed off by your faulty framing, and no one wants to be around that. Finally, the researchers see their data as a bad sign for democracy that people view politics as harmful, they won't get involved. And why is that bad exactly? They just said the more involved you are, the worse it is. Maybe swallowing all that junk food is bad for you. If you're injecting politics into everything from sports to house pain, you're replacing knowledge with rhetoric and losing friends, family and your mind in the process. So if your head hurts, because you keep hitting it with a hammer, then put down the hammer. Or if you're Don Lemon keep at it, it can only help."

I think people are rooting for their party so hard that they're just blindly taking sides now regardless of whether or not it's good or it's sane, or it's factual. They just want their side to be right. And what happened to the left, the reason they're hemorrhaging support is they're not a cool party anymore.

Fact is the NBA makes way more money ignoring Chinese genocide. But after taking more heat than a jockstrap full of Tiger Balm. Oh. He tweeted some clarifying comments, quotes. In re-listening to this week's podcast I recognize I come across as lacking empathy. As a refugee my family fled a country with its own set of human rights issues. So this is something that's very much apart of my lived experience. To be clear my belief is that human rights matter whether in China the United States or elsewhere full stop. Oh. Full stop. I knew he was lying when he claimed he re-listened to a podcast. No one's done that ever. He also said full stop, before actually telling us what P.R. firm wrote that. As for the Warriors, they're running from Chamath faster than Jim Norton from a Catch a Predator film crew. They call him a limited investor who doesn't speak on their behalf.

Look at this, apparently, while the Tribute Artists was performing, the man suddenly started hitting them. Too bad he didn't know that Santana, in addition to annoying pedestrians, is also a pretty good wrestler, and honed his grappling skills with Tito, Jermaine, and Jackie, and Marlon. I don't believe that. That's caught on video by terrible people that contribute nothing except to our show. He sweeps the assailants leg, takes him down with a chokehold, and then he applies several skillful chokeholds until the attacker is subdued like a sleeping baby. Yes, the dumb drunk turned a Michael Jackson impersonator into the Terminator. Now, I watched this video 17.5 times. I stopped in the middle to check my stocks. That's how well I'm doing. But the ending is priceless. With the battered idiot appearing days drunk and confused like he taken too much (INAUDIBLE). So, being that this is \"T-SHIRT TALES,\" let's take a look at that T-shirt, shall we? Closing in on it? It reads, can't fix stupid. Of course, it's never been more correct. But if you look closer, it's got a Dallas Cowboy fan using a urinal incorrectly, while two Philly Eagles fans use it the right way. So, clearly, this beaten man is an Eagles fan. Which means getting your ass kicked on a subway platform by a street performer is what they call Wednesday. Jimmy, I don't think there's anything better than watching an unassuming person beat the crap out of someone who thinks they can fight and picks the fight."

As a lot of new music seems to have trouble gaining traction, they just don't make them like they used to -- talking about songs not shoelaces used to strangle transients, Jim. I don't know why. Several songs from Creedence Clearwater Revival made the list. For example, have you ever seen the rain with that number 16? Apparently, it's a strip club classic for blind lap dancers. says a jerk. But that's eight spots higher than Adele's \"Oh my God,\" which was written about me, and it's also much higher than The Weeknd's new single \"Sacrifice,\" which isn't even the top 100 anymore. Learned that spell jerk. He can't spell his own name that's kind of pathetic. Anyway, Jack Antonoff in The Bleachers, whatever that is just appeared on SNL, didn't make the list which is embarrassing considering the fact that music from the most underrated band in the world Nickelback did. I'm so tired of the nickel-bashing, you're just jealous that they wrote \"Let It Be\" and you didn't. So, what's the secret behind these resurgent oldies besides the faint whiff of cocaine and Vapor Rub? Well, we know what fans of the GUTFELD! show are most familiar with.
