      "sentences": "One little variation, I'm like, OK, not good. Great show. Welcome to “Hannity.”  Tonight, we have breaking news from Canada of all places. This year, a photograph from 2001, a yearbook photograph, yes, it shows far left Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface. And Trudeau now says he didn't think the brownface was racist at the time. We're going to have much more on this story coming up in the show.  Also, tonight, President Trump has ordered harsh new sanctions against the hostile regime, the mullahs of Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he is calling the recent attack against a Saudi oil field an act of war. And remember, the president said, the United States is locked and it is loaded, as the administration, at this hour is now weighing its options against Iran's malignant aggression. We'll have more on this developing situation tonight.  But tonight, we're also tracking several other breaking news stories including brand-new revelations surrounding DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz. Now, today, Horowitz, in fact, appeared on Capitol Hill and where he faced questions from Republican lawmakers about the unethical conduct of Mr. Super Patriot himself, Jim Comey. Now, this was the I.G.'s first public testimony since he issued that unprecedented rebuke of the fired FBI director, and a report solely focused on one small issue -- Comey's illicit leaking. And in that report, Horowitz noted that the FBI director set a dangerous example for everyone in the FBI.  And today, Horowitz doubled down on this damning accusation, explained that the office of the inspector general was concerned that Comey's actions will set a troubling precedent. And as I have said before, this just the beginning for Jim Comey, Super Patriot, this is the tip of the iceberg. This is the low-hanging fruit. Comey has escaped charges so far, but Horowitz, he's just getting started. Let's see what happens.  Now, keep in mind, the most damning evidence of Comey's rampant abuse of power stems from two issues that Horowitz was unable to discuss today. That includes the Horowitz investigation into the FISA abuse, and then later, the Durham-Barr investigation into the origins of the Russian witch hunt. And to top it all off, just today, Horowitz indicated that he would also look into irregularities surrounding Comey's sworn testimony on Capitol Hill. Remember, showed lack of candor. Let's see where this goes.   And Horowitz also seemingly agreed that Comey tried to deceive President- elect Trump during the now infamous meeting at Trump Tower in early 2017, by probing Trump for information and reaction to the dirty dossier that he said was salacious and unverified. What he didn't tell the president is that just a couple of months earlier, a couple of months, hang on, a couple of months earlier, yes, he was signing a FISA warrant based on Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier, yes, the one that he didn't verify, the one that he was warned wasn't true on multiple occasions. We know of three, there maybe as many as five or more occasions, Comey and others were warned, don't trust Christopher Steele. And the fact that the president-elect, remember he told him and that Trump Tower meeting, he was not the subject of an investigation. That was also a huge lie. And it was one of the many traps that Comey set in what was Operation Crossfire Hurricane. And a brand-new book from Comey's former assistant says today, his one time boss recklessly bucked protocol in order to set up Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, as we've been telling you, saying, quote: We just decide, you know, screw it.   Well, remember, Comey bragging about taking advantage of General Flynn. He sent his investigators to the White House to question him during the first few chaotic days of the incoming administration, day four to be specific. It was from the beginning a perjury trap, plain and simple, like a tag team. Andrew McCabe says, oh, you don't need a lawyer. And Comey says he did something he'd never do under the Bush or Obama administrations. And then, sadly, and perhaps more importantly, a 33-year veteran of this country was told he didn't need a lawyer when he absolutely needed a lawyer. Is that how we at now treat our veterans? That's how Comey, Mr. Super Patriot, he's treating an American war hero, served this country, 33 years, two foreign wars? But the boomerang of justice as we've been telling you is now in full effect. Now, in the coming days, weeks, pay very close attention because the next shoe to drop will be the I.G.'s findings on FISA abuse. He signed three of the four warrants. That means Comey.  The inspector general's completed report is now in the hands of the attorney general, Barr, who along with the FBI Director Wray is reviewing this material for possible redactions. Now, Director Wray seems to be hesitant, he really does, and wanting to fix what is the greatest, the premier law enforcement agency in the entire world.   I hope Director Wray changes course and commits himself to implementing the changes so that 99.9 percent of law-abiding FBI agents that keep us safe every day that we can have confidence in all of them. It's about one-tenth of 1 percent. Now, the changes here that's he needs to look at are so we prevent the massive abuse of power, so that it will never happen again.  Here with the very latest, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. And also joining us, North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows, I think, basically, we have this all wrapped up. We've presented the evidence. He was warned, I know of three occasions. I am told as many as five occasions, Comey, about the dossier, the Russian dossier being unverified.  They were told ahead of time. It was her dossier, not verified. He used it anyway as the bulk of information. So, to me, that's premeditated fraud on a FISA court, denying one American his constitutional rights, but more importantly spying on a presidential candidate, then transition team and then president.",

The only thing that has been consistent is the fact that he was willing to break protocol relentlessly to go after this president. And, we do know, as you mentioned, a number of times, not only warning signs but red stop signs that say, do not go further, because there are credibility issues, there are certainly different motives that are here. And yet, those were never discussed with the president. You know, when that infamous briefing happened in Trump Tower, they didn't say, oh, by the way, the Democrats are paying for this. By the way, we have concerns with credibility, and by the way, we know that the very person, Christopher Steele, is leaking to the press.  They didn't say any of that.

I thought one very interesting thing that happened was that Horowitz specifically said, you know, that it is in the process of being reviewed right now for classification review, to see what will be declassified, and then it will be turned back over to Horowitz. So once Barr and once Wray are finished reviewing the documents with their team, they will turn it back over to Horowitz. At that point, Horowitz makes it very clear, that he can assess with his team what they declassified and if they feel they didn't declassify enough or maybe declassified one particular part that Horowitz thought shouldn't be declassified, he can go back and fight them on that. He can go back and actually discuss that with them and try to see if they could maybe review that process once more.  So, that's certainly available.

McCabe was fired from the FBI for lying and leaking, which as you can see was pretty much status quo in Comey's FBI.

Now, after nearly three years of lies, smear, slander, and nonstop hysteria over a hoax, a Russian collusion witch hunt, the Department of Justice is now -- well, riding that ship. We hope. Truth, facts, sanity are making a comeback, hopefully, in the swamp, the sewer of D.C. And the left are not very happy about it. Now, without a reckless conspiracy theory to push, and Mueller didn't deliver the goods they wanted, Democrats on the Hill, they are coming apart of the seams. You got an intramural civil war emerging. They are turning on each other.  And according to reports, speaker in name only, Nancy Pelosi, is very angry at the Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler. The chairman has given into his radical base, launched a very sloppy so-called impeachment proceeding against the president, really for no reason at all. It's an official proceeding without an official reason, for the basis of the impeachment. We saw yesterday, Corey Lewandowski owned and embarrassed every one of those House Democrats at the first official hearing. This has now become such a dumpster fire that Pelosi has instructed her colleagues to tell the press, leak it, she says. The Democrats don't have enough votes for impeachment. Now, of course, the proceedings will continue without any way, of course, because Pelosi, she has no control over the caucus. The radical, extreme socialist Democrats, they are in charge. This is a political disaster, suicide mission for the Democrats. If they want any hope in 2020, President Trump will never be impeached, she's right. The fantasies of the left are now dead and buried. The mob, which is the mainstream media, cannot hide their disappointment. Their psychotic rage, Trump derangement syndrome is so bad, members of the media are actually rooting for a sitting U.S. president to be impeached because of Hillary's bought and paid for Russian lies that the FBI even when they finally looked at and said, no, this isn't untrue. This is sick, this is ugly, this is twisted, and more evidence journalism is dead in this country, as I told you back in 2007. Here now is the author of the soon-to-be-released sequel to his number one best seller, \"Witch Hunt\", FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. You were in the hearings yesterday with Corey Lewandowski. I'm watching Corey Lewandowski and even Democrats are today expressing their frustration, get owned by Corey Lewandowski.  What page is that, Congressman? What page? Can you please refer to the page, the paragraph, where is that, sir, so I can recall exactly what it is you're talking about?",

      "utterance": "One little variation, I'm like, OK, not good. Great show. Welcome to “Hannity.” Tonight, we have breaking news from Canada of all places. This year, a photograph from 2001, a yearbook photograph, yes, it shows far left Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wearing brownface. And Trudeau now says he didn't think the brownface was racist at the time. We're going to have much more on this story coming up in the show. Also, tonight, President Trump has ordered harsh new sanctions against the hostile regime, the mullahs of Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he is calling the recent attack against a Saudi oil field an act of war. And remember, the president said, the United States is locked and it is loaded, as the administration, at this hour is now weighing its options against Iran's malignant aggression. We'll have more on this developing situation tonight. But tonight, we're also tracking several other breaking news stories including brand-new revelations surrounding DOJ inspector general Michael Horowitz. Now, today, Horowitz, in fact, appeared on Capitol Hill and where he faced questions from Republican lawmakers about the unethical conduct of Mr. Super Patriot himself, Jim Comey. Now, this was the I.G.'s first public testimony since he issued that unprecedented rebuke of the fired FBI director, and a report solely focused on one small issue -- Comey's illicit leaking. And in that report, Horowitz noted that the FBI director set a dangerous example for everyone in the FBI. And today, Horowitz doubled down on this damning accusation, explained that the office of the inspector general was concerned that Comey's actions will set a troubling precedent. And as I have said before, this just the beginning for Jim Comey, Super Patriot, this is the tip of the iceberg. This is the low-hanging fruit. Comey has escaped charges so far, but Horowitz, he's just getting started. Let's see what happens. Now, keep in mind, the most damning evidence of Comey's rampant abuse of power stems from two issues that Horowitz was unable to discuss today. That includes the Horowitz investigation into the FISA abuse, and then later, the Durham-Barr investigation into the origins of the Russian witch hunt. And to top it all off, just today, Horowitz indicated that he would also look into irregularities surrounding Comey's sworn testimony on Capitol Hill. Remember, showed lack of candor. Let's see where this goes. And Horowitz also seemingly agreed that Comey tried to deceive President- elect Trump during the now infamous meeting at Trump Tower in early 2017, by probing Trump for information and reaction to the dirty dossier that he said was salacious and unverified. What he didn't tell the president is that just a couple of months earlier, a couple of months, hang on, a couple of months earlier, yes, he was signing a FISA warrant based on Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier, yes, the one that he didn't verify, the one that he was warned wasn't true on multiple occasions. We know of three, there maybe as many as five or more occasions, Comey and others were warned, don't trust Christopher Steele. And the fact that the president-elect, remember he told him and that Trump Tower meeting, he was not the subject of an investigation. That was also a huge lie. And it was one of the many traps that Comey set in what was Operation Crossfire Hurricane."

      "utterance": "We just decide, you know, screw it. Well, remember, Comey bragging about taking advantage of General Flynn. He sent his investigators to the White House to question him during the first few chaotic days of the incoming administration, day four to be specific. It was from the beginning a perjury trap, plain and simple, like a tag team. Andrew McCabe says, oh, you don't need a lawyer. And Comey says he did something he'd never do under the Bush or Obama administrations. And then, sadly, and perhaps more importantly, a 33-year veteran of this country was told he didn't need a lawyer when he absolutely needed a lawyer. Is that how we at now treat our veterans? That's how Comey, Mr. Super Patriot, he's treating an American war hero, served this country, 33 years, two foreign wars? But the boomerang of justice as we've been telling you is now in full effect. Now, in the coming days, weeks, pay very close attention because the next shoe to drop will be the I.G.'s findings on FISA abuse. He signed three of the four warrants. That means Comey. The inspector general's completed report is now in the hands of the attorney general, Barr, who along with the FBI Director Wray is reviewing this material for possible redactions. Now, Director Wray seems to be hesitant, he really does, and wanting to fix what is the greatest, the premier law enforcement agency in the entire world. I hope Director Wray changes course and commits himself to implementing the changes so that 99.9 percent of law-abiding FBI agents that keep us safe every day that we can have confidence in all of them. It's about one-tenth of 1 percent. Now, the changes here that's he needs to look at are so we prevent the massive abuse of power, so that it will never happen again. Here with the very latest, Fox News contributor Sara Carter. And also joining us, North Carolina Congressman Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows, I think, basically, we have this all wrapped up. We've presented the evidence. He was warned, I know of three occasions. I am told as many as five occasions, Comey, about the dossier, the Russian dossier being unverified. They were told ahead of time. It was her dossier, not verified. He used it anyway as the bulk of information. So, to me, that's premeditated fraud on a FISA court, denying one American his constitutional rights, but more importantly spying on a presidential candidate, then transition team and then president."

And, we do know, as you mentioned, a number of times, not only warning signs but red stop signs that say, do not go further, because there are credibility issues, there are certainly different motives that are here. And yet, those were never discussed with the president. You know, when that infamous briefing happened in Trump Tower, they didn't say, oh, by the way, the Democrats are paying for this. By the way, we have concerns with credibility, and by the way, we know that the very person, Christopher Steele, is leaking to the press. They didn't say any of that.

      "utterance": "No. The only way to clean this up is if Director Wray sheds light on everything that happened, exposes that to the sunshine and to the American people and cleans out what happened at the bureau, so that it never happens again. I thought one very interesting thing that happened was that Horowitz specifically said, you know, that it is in the process of being reviewed right now for classification review, to see what will be declassified, and then it will be turned back over to Horowitz. So once Barr and once Wray are finished reviewing the documents with their team, they will turn it back over to Horowitz. At that point, Horowitz makes it very clear, that he can assess with his team what they declassified and if they feel they didn't declassify enough or maybe declassified one particular part that Horowitz thought shouldn't be declassified, he can go back and fight them on that. He can go back and actually discuss that with them and try to see if they could maybe review that process once more. So, that's certainly available. If this is the process we're in right now, it may take some weeks, Sean. It may take less than a week. We just don't know."

So, it's incumbent upon DOJ, Attorney General Barr and John Durham to make sure that what is at the core of all of this gets declassified so that we don't hide behind this mystique of this classified, in the secret room.

McCabe was fired from the FBI for lying and leaking, which as you can see was pretty much status quo in Comey's FBI. Federal prosecutors have now paved the way for McCabe to potentially face charges for his misconduct. And the possible grand jury will weigh in on a possible indictment. On this show, we are clear.

Now, after nearly three years of lies, smear, slander, and nonstop hysteria over a hoax, a Russian collusion witch hunt, the Department of Justice is now -- well, riding that ship. We hope. Truth, facts, sanity are making a comeback, hopefully, in the swamp, the sewer of D.C. And the left are not very happy about it. Now, without a reckless conspiracy theory to push, and Mueller didn't deliver the goods they wanted, Democrats on the Hill, they are coming apart of the seams. You got an intramural civil war emerging. They are turning on each other. And according to reports, speaker in name only, Nancy Pelosi, is very angry at the Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler. The chairman has given into his radical base, launched a very sloppy so-called impeachment proceeding against the president, really for no reason at all. It's an official proceeding without an official reason, for the basis of the impeachment. We saw yesterday, Corey Lewandowski owned and embarrassed every one of those House Democrats at the first official hearing. This has now become such a dumpster fire that Pelosi has instructed her colleagues to tell the press, leak it, she says. The Democrats don't have enough votes for impeachment. Now, of course, the proceedings will continue without any way, of course, because Pelosi, she has no control over the caucus. The radical, extreme socialist Democrats, they are in charge. This is a political disaster, suicide mission for the Democrats. If they want any hope in 2020, President Trump will never be impeached, she's right. The fantasies of the left are now dead and buried. The mob, which is the mainstream media, cannot hide their disappointment. Their psychotic rage, Trump derangement syndrome is so bad, members of the media are actually rooting for a sitting U.S. president to be impeached because of Hillary's bought and paid for Russian lies that the FBI even when they finally looked at and said, no, this isn't untrue. This is sick, this is ugly, this is twisted, and more evidence journalism is dead in this country, as I told you back in 2007. Here now is the author of the soon-to-be-released sequel to his number one best seller, \"Witch Hunt\", FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. You were in the hearings yesterday with Corey Lewandowski. I'm watching Corey Lewandowski and even Democrats are today expressing their frustration, get owned by Corey Lewandowski. What page is that, Congressman? What page? Can you please refer to the page, the paragraph, where is that, sir, so I can recall exactly what it is you're talking about?"

And even Anthony Brindisi, a New York Democrat, saying, look, if you're just a regular American, you are wondering how your insulin is going to get paid for, if you watch what the liberal Democrat mob is doing in Washington, D.C., it is demoralizing to regular Americans who just want to see the government working for them. I think this division among Democrats shows that they have a losing strategy and it is existent with all of the polling that says that the American people want us focused on immigration, border security, the key issues and not a phony impeachment that is free of facts."

Correct me if I'm wrong, Congressman Matt Gaetz. He's been before the Senate committee. I think he spent 15 hours before Mueller special counsel. At what point does this become harassment? At what point do people say, I'm pleading the Fifth because you're setting me up for a perjury trap because one itsy bitsy thing that may contradict, even if it's a small fact, you are going to claim I'm lying, and now I'm going to be brought up on perjury charges?"

You're not going to get anything out of him. Of course you're not. He's already testified multiple times. He spoke with the special counsel. He hewed strictly to the statements he gave and the documents he gave to the special counsel, and yet, you know I heard illegal commentators say, oh, this is, you know, conclusive evidence now of obstruction of justice. You know, in what legal world does that exist?

Alani did not disclose to investigators that he traveled to Iraq in March. Today, the judge denied bail, saying he is a flight risk. While Alani blamed a labor dispute for his actions. Prosecutors said he attempted to sabotage an American Airlines flight by gluing Styrofoam inside the nose of the aircraft. That has the effect of disabling critical flight data, including airspeed. Alani's public defenders said his client is a seasoned mechanic who understood his alleged actions would ground the aircraft and not directly put passengers at risk.

But the question is whether we choose to target some of those military bases from which Iran launched the cruise missiles and the drones against Saudi Arabia. There's no question Iran wants to induce us--"

Well, you have one frequent guest on conspiracy television. That's Roswell, Rachel Maddow's network, MSDNC, one of their guests over there at that network said he often fantasizes about doing the same every time he drives by a Trump property. OK. Is he still working there? She's still a lot on the air. We'll debate. We'll discuss next."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. So, the media mob, they're biased on full display. The bombshell pro-Kavanaugh development that Christine Blasi Ford's friend, said she doesn't believe the story about Kavanaugh, barely got any coverage by the big three networks, according to the MRC. Meanwhile, while following a horrific car crash in the lobby of a Trump property in Nora Shell, New York, and MSNBCDNC panelists conspiracy TV host well tweeted about his own wishes to do the same every time he passes a Trump property. Here with reaction, co-author of the book Justice on Trial, The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court Chief Counsel. Judicial Crisis Network. Carrie Severino. And she is now with Women for Trump and she is their national Co-Chair. Gina Loudon is back with us. Gina, if you ever said this as a conservative against the liberal about, fantasizing about doing that to an Obama property, or if you lied about a Democratic appointment the way they treated Kavanaugh. Why do I believe things would be very different?"

      "utterance": "Well, things are always different for conservatives. We're always up to a different standard. Thank God for the example that President Trump sets in fighting back over and over again. And I'll tell you something else, Sean. In my capacity with Women for Trump, I am hearing from women all the time who are saying to me that it is exactly this sort of behavior. Things like Madonna saying she'd like to blow the White House up."

    {
      "speaker": "Things like Kathy Griffin holding the bloodied head of the President, the American people elected and things like this statement about crashing into a Trump property, literally threatening people like you and me and other citizens just innocently living our lives simply for believing differently than them. It's those kinds of things that are going to give President Trump a massive landslide again in the next election. HANNITY",

    {
      "speaker": "CARRIE SEVERINO, JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK CHIEF COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, this isn't really - this is really a symptom of a whole problem we have where people don't want to debate issues. The liberals just want to push their policies down everyone's throat. They're attacking the courts because that is the place where we would enforce these checks and balances and keep the government in check. They're trying to push conservatives off the Internet, out of boardrooms, out of campuses. They don't want a debate. They really just would like to silence us. And I think that's Elie Mystal's fantasies about doing that in a violent way are the worst possible example of that."

Donald Trump, somehow, they want every - they want Donald Trump to fight for trade deals, lower taxes, conservative justices, a border wall, repealing Obamacare, all the things he promised. But boy, I've never seen character assassination that like the level, like this. And they seem to want to convince every woman not to vote for Donald Trump. Will that work?"

And these donations are smaller amounts, which also says these are coming from grassroots women who just feel inspired because they're tired of their children being taught lessons by the Leftist media that is complicit. It has been weaponized against people simply for what they believe."

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Well, prosecutors say Ed Buck is a violent sexual predator, Sean, who preys on men struggling with addiction and homelessness, luring them with drugs, money and shelter. In the latest case, Buck is accused of injecting a 37-year-old man with, \"dangerously large doses of methamphetamine on September 11th.\" That man survived. But in the past two years, two other men, both black, were found dead in Buck's West Hollywood apartment. 26-year-old Gemmel Moore and 55-year-old Timothy Dean both overdosed on methamphetamine. There apparently wasn't enough evidence to charge Buck, even though Gemmel Moore wrote in his journal, \"I'd become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth. And an attorney from Moore's family says, it's about time that Buck faces the consequences. Ed Buck is a longtime Democratic donor. Previously giving hundreds of thousands of dollars to the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Barack Obama. Some who got money from Buck like LA Mayor Eric Garcetti gave it back or donated to charity. Sean."
