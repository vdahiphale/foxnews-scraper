      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Judge Jeanine Pirro, Harold Ford, Jr., Jesse Watters, and Brian Kilmeade. It's five o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE. Twelve days of horror in Ukraine as Vladimir Putin carves an even larger trail of destruction. Russia being accused of war crimes after raining down artillery shells on civilians trying to flee to safety. At least eight people, including children killed in a city outside of Kyiv.  Ukraine says Russia is using medieval style siege tactics to punish cities. In Mariupol where 200,000 civilians are struggling to escape, the city has been without water and power for days. With carnage and suffering increasing, Russia has now seen nearly 100 percent of its forces staged at the border into Ukraine. President Zelenskyy, once again calling on the west for more help.   VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): This is murder, deliberate murder. Think of the sense of impunity of invaders. They announced their plan of atrocities and why? Because there is no reaction, because there is silence. Not a word as if western leaders dissolved tonight. The audacity of the aggressor is a clear signal to the west that sanctions against Russia are not enough.",

      "sentences": "It is, Dana, yes. And the moment it's quiet here in Kyiv but I can tell you just a few hours ago, there were heavy shelling across large parts of the city around all the outskirts to our north, our northwest and our west.  Clearly, Vladimir Putin's forces making now an ever-bigger push for the city. Look, on the one hand today, we have seen a real escalation on the attacks of civilians. I mean, you see some of the pictures coming from cities like Kharkiv, and Mariupol and Kherson. It is devastating. The whole districts are absolutely flattened and leaving no doubt whatsoever that Putin is indiscriminately now bombing the cities, hitting schools and hospitals.   And then on the other hand, you have Putin offering humanitarian corridors, potential peace talks, but everyone here knows those are an absolute farce. You talk about humanitarian corridors, out of Mariupol yesterday where buses are supposed to go and rescue those 200,000. The Red Cross today saying that that route out had been mined, on other attempts to get them out, shells further on the buses making it impossible to evacuate anyone. And then today, another humanitarian corridor out of six areas they were all leading to Russia and Belarus. Asking the very people who are fleeing to head right into their captives' hands. And so right now, the trust in Vladimir Putin is incredibly low. Nevertheless, there was a third round of negotiations today between the Russians and Ukrainians in Belarus. There was no outcome specifically. They said they discussed further humanitarian efforts, but nothing really came of it. And so right now, we have this scenario where the escalation is all on Putin's side, he is hitting towns, he is hitting villages and he is inching closer to villages.   But the fact is, the Ukrainians are still doing remarkable well of holding back the Russians. And so, what the Russians have started to do, is use their longer-range weapons. We have seen them use longer-range artillery more from the air and that is a lot less precise and that's why we are seeing civilian casualties rise dramatically. Also reports that the Stingers were being so successful at these planes that were coming in low to drop dumb bombs, those planes have just started flying a lot higher. That also means far less accuracy. So, again, it is a scorched move at the moment the same way that we had seen in Aleppo and Grozny. It is really worrying right now what we are seeing and it is all because Ukrainians have fought so well, so bravely at holding them back that we are seeing this rise in indiscriminate attacks.

We've been sitting here for 12 days, OK, and talking about him. You know, Zelenskyy put it perfectly. This is murder, deliberate murder with impunity with no consequence. And how is it that one man is allowed to up in the world like this? How is it that he is able to push everyone's buttons and basically kill indiscriminately?  Children with cancer who were simply trying to get their cancer treatment, children being killed with their families leaving. I don't need to describe it. All you have to do is turn on the television while the world watches. We're just voyeurs in this. I, you know, I understand the no-fly zone, but even Canada has said, we're not going to accept any oil from Russia. And now, what we are doing and I don't want to get into the later part of the show, but we want to work with Venezuela. We did. We hate Maduro. We want to work with Iran. Well, aren't we going to fund the nuclear bomb with Iran? And you know, why? It's so easy to just make a left turn a lower turn and go to Texas, go to Pennsylvania.  We can be energy independent and the truth, do you remember last week, Dana, when I said 48 percent of Americans are willing to suffer and pay higher prices? Today it's 71 percent of Americans are willing to suffer the higher prices in order to help these people. People are -- we're good people across the world and this pig has got his thumb on and his knee on our neck.",

I think in the beginning people were shocked by the horror that Vladimir Putin was imposing on these people. You know, it's shocking, but we shouldn't be shocked.  This guy is a barbarian. It's Napoleonic what he is doing. And it's going to get worse. And the American people have to understand that because in the beginning we thought the sanctions were super effective. And could we do this, we've never seen anything like that. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets a lot better.   And the president has not prepared the country for a long game. And this is a long game. Our American strategy, the western strategy is to turn the Russian empire into a graveyard in Ukraine. And that's going to take a very long time. And we are going to see a lot of dead bodies. And it's going to be sad. Right now, it's -- I'm not sure in the next couple of weeks or months, the American people are going to vote the same way as they did in that poll. We are in recession territory pretty much. We are already in correction territory. We can't afford $200 oil. We can't afford $5 oil. Joe Biden has not said, construction costs are going up. Technology costs are going up. What's he done about wheat prices? What's he done about food prices, fertilizer? The Black Sea is basically done. No one, no shipping company is going in there. No one is underwriting any sort of trade in the entire region.  So, I'm afraid that you are going to have a domino effect that's going to spiral out of control right as you come out of a recession. This country is not going to have a recovery if we are going to be hit in the face with $500 a gallon gasoline. And the American people are not prepared for this. The president has not prepared the country for this and we are heading really fast to a potential war.  Talking about a no-fly zone. People are getting trigger-happy. We are sending in planes potentially. What happens if a NATO ally sends in a plane and that NATO plane from a NATO country shoots down a Russian plane? You think Russia is going to be OK with a Polish plane shooting dead Russians at their doorstep? I don't -- I don't think Joe Biden has wrapped his head around where we're going here.",

I think the president has done a lot better job of trying to prepare the country for the consequences. In fact, even if he doesn't, we are living the consequences, we are paying more for gasoline, we are paying more for food, we are paying more for food. I call at the new PPP, protect, punish, and power back. Our interest are at risk in Ukraine, democracy, decency, humanity, sovereignty. You can't let this nation cross that line particularly in nation with the history that the Soviets has and with the language that he is talking.  We kept together NATO. It's been hard. Now I know that there is an interest on some to try to score political points with this but when problems, huge problems are in front of you, you got to solve it. And if that means bringing people together who don't disagree -- who you disagreed within the past in your party and the other party you've got to figure out how to do it. So, you got to punish Putin.  And here is where the question becomes how much and how willing are we to pay is 71, 76, 77 percent, whatever the number will be. How high will that number stay? And you raised this. If prices get to $10, $11, $12 a barrel, we've unplugged them from the world financial system. Are we willing to ban the kind of ban that people want and some are proposing on their oil and energy products, perhaps similar to what Canada did? If we do that, those -- there are some who criticized this White House for not tackling inflation. I would dare say we've not seen inflation if we ban oil and energy products like we're seeing. And finally, we got to power back. And judge, this is where I agree with you wholeheartedly, that power back we have to think about ways to restart energy projects here in the country, be it Keystone be it on other leases on lands that we're not. There was some talk in the White House about doing that. I think they need to go further.",

I thought he was a perfect person to say this is historic time. And I think what he was trying to say is Vladimir Putin is a bad actor and nothing we will ever do will change the way he is. Not much different than the guy he dealt with when he came in after President Obama when he came in for President Bush replacing Don Rumsfeld and then for President Obama. And he thought it was a huge mistake when President Obama said blankets and MREs when he took parts of Georgia.   So here is the thing. Jesse, as much as I agree with the sentiment, we are not living in a world in which we're calling the rules right now. Right now, we are dealing with an actor that has no interest in dialing back and coming back. This is the moment that we have to stand out and choke him out or it's going to get so much worse in two years as he takes Moldova and starts moving on the Baltic nation. And then the rule five is not going to be a gray area, it's going to be yes or no area.  Here is what I found. Macron is also on another planet. He came out and says Russia too must be respected as a country. There is no durable peace if Russia is not part of a great architectural of peace in our continent because history and geography are stubborn. He -- Vladimir Putin is the problem. He cannot be brought in to the family of nations. We have tried and he has left in our face. He has destroyed a country. He's killing children and he doesn't care about it. He has press conference with flight attendants having a great time. He does not feel this pain. We have to have total oil sanctions and convince the Europeans to get off oil. And my goodness, do we stand for anything? 1-800-Venezuela? Iran, we'll deal with, we'll let you fulfill what we used to get from Russia and now we are going to actually, we're actually going to say it's only 7 percent of their output is our input on their oil? So that's why we should not worry about stopping Russia's input of oil from coming into our country? Of course, we should.   We backstop with friendly nations. We have to stand for something. We don't have relations with Maduro of Venezuela. We don't recognize him. How dare we cut an oil deal with him? With Iran? Do you know what's happening with this Iranian deal? This is a travesty what's about to happen with the Iranian deal. We are going to be fueling terror in the Middle East for the next 50 years.",

So, Dana, to your point about some of the record prices, we went down during COVID. And we are going find ourselves going back up.

And they get on a train there. You don't need a ticket for this train any longer. It doesn't leave on schedule. As soon as the passenger cars are full, the train leaves and heads to this town, Lviv. There are more trains coming in, at least more seats coming in than are going out. So, you have people piling up here in Lviv. Most people are looking to keep moving. That's why you have that 1.7 million people who have already crossed the border. A million of those have gone into Poland. And you see Poland stepping up as best as they can. You have the government pitching in with temporary housing. They're establishing a fund that will ultimately amount to about $65.00 a piece that they'll give the people crossing the border. You have businesses that are stepping up with temporary housing and even individuals who are going as far as to cook soup for the people who are so cold as they've crossed the border. Keep in mind that you've had about a million Ukrainians cross into Poland since 2014 as the fighting got bad here. So, you do have some diaspora there who are willing and very sympathetic. So, they're very willing to open their doors to put a roof over these people's heads, and they get a hot meal into them because they have so much need. You've seen remarkable things, even people leaving baby carriages there at the border. So, when they people cross with children, they have something to put them in. Guys?",

Because she said she felt like she was being hunted and that it was never going to -- she was never going to be able to rest as long as he was her neighbor. And when -- as a kid, I worked with -- my mom and dad worked with Lutheran World Relief on resettling refugees from the former Soviet Union in Denver, Colorado. And my sister and I would tag along on the weekends as they helped them figure out how to ride the bus and figure out, you know, where they're going to send their kids to school, where they would be able to get their favorite chicken recipes, ingredients for their recipes that they wanted to make, deliver a washer and dryer. With these people are going through, 1.7 million of them right now, is just something that's very hard to fathom. Imagine that they said, OK, you have to go now and you have your backpack on your phone and that's it. Many people had to leave behind their pets. Many people had to leave behind their husbands, their fathers, their brothers, their uncles. And the mental anguish that they're going through is something that the world has to figure out a way to deal with. This is similar to what we saw in terms of the refugees leaving Afghanistan. And the all the paperwork gets all boxed up, and it gets screwed up. And then you have the State Department that's going like, well, we're trying, we're trying. The Polish people have done a great job, so as actually Romania, Moldova, and trying to take them. But this is 1.7 million people. In Ukraine, there's four -- the population is 44 million people.

Russia being accused of war crimes after raining down artillery shells on civilians trying to flee to safety. At least eight people, including children killed in a city outside of Kyiv. Ukraine says Russia is using medieval style siege tactics to punish cities. In Mariupol where 200,000 civilians are struggling to escape, the city has been without water and power for days. With carnage and suffering increasing, Russia has now seen nearly 100 percent of its forces staged at the border into Ukraine. President Zelenskyy, once again calling on the west for more help."

And the moment it's quiet here in Kyiv but I can tell you just a few hours ago, there were heavy shelling across large parts of the city around all the outskirts to our north, our northwest and our west. Clearly, Vladimir Putin's forces making now an ever-bigger push for the city. Look, on the one hand today, we have seen a real escalation on the attacks of civilians. I mean, you see some of the pictures coming from cities like Kharkiv, and Mariupol and Kherson. It is devastating. The whole districts are absolutely flattened and leaving no doubt whatsoever that Putin is indiscriminately now bombing the cities, hitting schools and hospitals. And then on the other hand, you have Putin offering humanitarian corridors, potential peace talks, but everyone here knows those are an absolute farce. You talk about humanitarian corridors, out of Mariupol yesterday where buses are supposed to go and rescue those 200,000. The Red Cross today saying that that route out had been mined, on other attempts to get them out, shells further on the buses making it impossible to evacuate anyone. And then today, another humanitarian corridor out of six areas they were all leading to Russia and Belarus. Asking the very people who are fleeing to head right into their captives' hands. And so right now, the trust in Vladimir Putin is incredibly low. Nevertheless, there was a third round of negotiations today between the Russians and Ukrainians in Belarus. There was no outcome specifically. They said they discussed further humanitarian efforts, but nothing really came of it. And so right now, we have this scenario where the escalation is all on Putin's side, he is hitting towns, he is hitting villages and he is inching closer to villages. But the fact is, the Ukrainians are still doing remarkable well of holding back the Russians. And so, what the Russians have started to do, is use their longer-range weapons. We have seen them use longer-range artillery more from the air and that is a lot less precise and that's why we are seeing civilian casualties rise dramatically. Also reports that the Stingers were being so successful at these planes that were coming in low to drop dumb bombs, those planes have just started flying a lot higher. That also means far less accuracy. So, again, it is a scorched move at the moment the same way that we had seen in Aleppo and Grozny. It is really worrying right now what we are seeing and it is all because Ukrainians have fought so well, so bravely at holding them back that we are seeing this rise in indiscriminate attacks. Dana?"

And how is it that one man is allowed to up in the world like this? How is it that he is able to push everyone's buttons and basically kill indiscriminately? Children with cancer who were simply trying to get their cancer treatment, children being killed with their families leaving. I don't need to describe it. All you have to do is turn on the television while the world watches. We're just voyeurs in this. I, you know, I understand the no-fly zone, but even Canada has said, we're not going to accept any oil from Russia.

We can be energy independent and the truth, do you remember last week, Dana, when I said 48 percent of Americans are willing to suffer and pay higher prices? Today it's 71 percent of Americans are willing to suffer the higher prices in order to help these people. People are -- we're good people across the world and this pig has got his thumb on and his knee on our neck."

I think in the beginning people were shocked by the horror that Vladimir Putin was imposing on these people. You know, it's shocking, but we shouldn't be shocked. This guy is a barbarian. It's Napoleonic what he is doing. And it's going to get worse. And the American people have to understand that because in the beginning we thought the sanctions were super effective. And could we do this, we've never seen anything like that. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets a lot better. And the president has not prepared the country for a long game. And this is a long game. Our American strategy, the western strategy is to turn the Russian empire into a graveyard in Ukraine. And that's going to take a very long time. And we are going to see a lot of dead bodies. And it's going to be sad. Right now, it's -- I'm not sure in the next couple of weeks or months, the American people are going to vote the same way as they did in that poll. We are in recession territory pretty much. We are already in correction territory. We can't afford $200 oil. We can't afford $5 oil. Joe Biden has not said, construction costs are going up. Technology costs are going up. What's he done about wheat prices? What's he done about food prices, fertilizer? The Black Sea is basically done. No one, no shipping company is going in there. No one is underwriting any sort of trade in the entire region. So, I'm afraid that you are going to have a domino effect that's going to spiral out of control right as you come out of a recession. This country is not going to have a recovery if we are going to be hit in the face with $500 a gallon gasoline. And the American people are not prepared for this. The president has not prepared the country for this and we are heading really fast to a potential war. Talking about a no-fly zone. People are getting trigger-happy. We are sending in planes potentially. What happens if a NATO ally sends in a plane and that NATO plane from a NATO country shoots down a Russian plane? You think Russia is going to be OK with a Polish plane shooting dead Russians at their doorstep? I don't -- I don't think Joe Biden has wrapped his head around where we're going here."

I think the president has done a lot better job of trying to prepare the country for the consequences. In fact, even if he doesn't, we are living the consequences, we are paying more for gasoline, we are paying more for food, we are paying more for food. I call at the new PPP, protect, punish, and power back. Our interest are at risk in Ukraine, democracy, decency, humanity, sovereignty. You can't let this nation cross that line particularly in nation with the history that the Soviets has and with the language that he is talking. We kept together NATO. It's been hard. Now I know that there is an interest on some to try to score political points with this but when problems, huge problems are in front of you, you got to solve it. And if that means bringing people together who don't disagree -- who you disagreed within the past in your party and the other party you've got to figure out how to do it. So, you got to punish Putin. And here is where the question becomes how much and how willing are we to pay is 71, 76, 77 percent, whatever the number will be. How high will that number stay? And you raised this. If prices get to $10, $11, $12 a barrel, we've unplugged them from the world financial system. Are we willing to ban the kind of ban that people want and some are proposing on their oil and energy products, perhaps similar to what Canada did? If we do that, those -- there are some who criticized this White House for not tackling inflation. I would dare say we've not seen inflation if we ban oil and energy products like we're seeing. And finally, we got to power back. And judge, this is where I agree with you wholeheartedly, that power back we have to think about ways to restart energy projects here in the country, be it Keystone be it on other leases on lands that we're not. There was some talk in the White House about doing that. I think they need to go further."

Not much different than the guy he dealt with when he came in after President Obama when he came in for President Bush replacing Don Rumsfeld and then for President Obama. And he thought it was a huge mistake when President Obama said blankets and MREs when he took parts of Georgia. So here is the thing. Jesse, as much as I agree with the sentiment, we are not living in a world in which we're calling the rules right now. Right now, we are dealing with an actor that has no interest in dialing back and coming back. This is the moment that we have to stand out and choke him out or it's going to get so much worse in two years as he takes Moldova and starts moving on the Baltic nation. And then the rule five is not going to be a gray area, it's going to be yes or no area. Here is what I found. Macron is also on another planet. He came out and says Russia too must be respected as a country. There is no durable peace if Russia is not part of a great architectural of peace in our continent because history and geography are stubborn. He -- Vladimir Putin is the problem. He cannot be brought in to the family of nations. We have tried and he has left in our face. He has destroyed a country. He's killing children and he doesn't care about it. He has press conference with flight attendants having a great time. He does not feel this pain. We have to have total oil sanctions and convince the Europeans to get off oil. And my goodness, do we stand for anything? 1-800-Venezuela? Iran, we'll deal with, we'll let you fulfill what we used to get from Russia and now we are going to actually, we're actually going to say it's only 7 percent of their output is our input on their oil? So that's why we should not worry about stopping Russia's input of oil from coming into our country? Of course, we should. We backstop with friendly nations. We have to stand for something. We don't have relations with Maduro of Venezuela. We don't recognize him. How dare we cut an oil deal with him? With Iran? Do you know what's happening with this Iranian deal?

And Dana, I know you know this. Senator Ben Cardin voted against the 2015 deal, Senator Schumer voted against the deal, Senator Menendez voted against the deal.

Just like there are crazies on the Republican side. There are unstable thinkers on the Republican side, there are unstable Democratic thinkers as well and we got to share with them all. Two, prior to COVID, prior to COVID our barrels per day usage in America 100 million plus barrels, as much as 103 million barrels a day. We're now down as of 2021, we were at 96.2 billion barrels a day. So as demand gets back up to where we were before obviously prices could go back up. So, Dana, to your point about some of the record prices, we went down during COVID. And we are going find ourselves going back up. Finally, this energy thing I struggle like you do with this, Brian, and it's the worst of options. So, we ask the Saudis to produce more? There are things that we are concerned about there. There are certainly positive things or negative things. Do we go to Venezuela, or do we go to Iranians? I mean, I don't know. I would rather go he worst of those options to Venezuela because I think we can strike a simpler deal, but I'll leave that -- I'll leave that to the diplomats.

And I want to be cautious because a lot of times you have these foreign entanglements, you have these alliances that can be trip wired, and the next thing you know, you're fighting a land war in -- right next to Russia. I do like the idea of getting the MIGs there. I mean, they're more familiar with that type of aircraft. But you got to slow up this stuff. You know, I don't trust Joe Biden to just be like throwing airplanes at this thing. He's not a smart person. And he's surrounded by lobbyists and dumb diplomats who have bumbled our way into many, many screw-ups throughout the world. These are the same people that did the Iran deal that miscalculated Afghanistan, so now they want to like load up the Ukrainians with fighter jets., and we're doing deals with the Pols. Slow down. What happens if a Polish jet gets shot down or shoots down a Russian aircraft, Russia considers that conventional war, and who knows what happens after that? I agree if he's dangerous and evil enough to shell civilian corridors, then what's stopping him from dropping a tactical nuclear weapon when Russia feels like its own survival is at stake?"

And they get on a train there. You don't need a ticket for this train any longer. It doesn't leave on schedule. As soon as the passenger cars are full, the train leaves and heads to this town, Lviv. There are more trains coming in, at least more seats coming in than are going out. So, you have people piling up here in Lviv. Most people are looking to keep moving. That's why you have that 1.7 million people who have already crossed the border. A million of those have gone into Poland. And you see Poland stepping up as best as they can. You have the government pitching in with temporary housing. They're establishing a fund that will ultimately amount to about $65.00 a piece that they'll give the people crossing the border. You have businesses that are stepping up with temporary housing and even individuals who are going as far as to cook soup for the people who are so cold as they've crossed the border. Keep in mind that you've had about a million Ukrainians cross into Poland since 2014 as the fighting got bad here. So, you do have some diaspora there who are willing and very sympathetic. So, they're very willing to open their doors to put a roof over these people's heads, and they get a hot meal into them because they have so much need. You've seen remarkable things, even people leaving baby carriages there at the border. So, when they people cross with children, they have something to put them in. Guys?"

If she was on THE FIVE, we would have given her permission to make an analogy and she would have gotten the award for best analogy of the year. Because she said she felt like she was being hunted and that it was never going to -- she was never going to be able to rest as long as he was her neighbor. And when -- as a kid, I worked with -- my mom and dad worked with Lutheran World Relief on resettling refugees from the former Soviet Union in Denver, Colorado. And my sister and I would tag along on the weekends as they helped them figure out how to ride the bus and figure out, you know, where they're going to send their kids to school, where they would be able to get their favorite chicken recipes, ingredients for their recipes that they wanted to make, deliver a washer and dryer. With these people are going through, 1.7 million of them right now, is just something that's very hard to fathom. Imagine that they said, OK, you have to go now and you have your backpack on your phone and that's it. Many people had to leave behind their pets. Many people had to leave behind their husbands, their fathers, their brothers, their uncles. And the mental anguish that they're going through is something that the world has to figure out a way to deal with. This is similar to what we saw in terms of the refugees leaving Afghanistan. And the all the paperwork gets all boxed up, and it gets screwed up. And then you have the State Department that's going like, well, we're trying, we're trying. The Polish people have done a great job, so as actually Romania, Moldova, and trying to take them. But this is 1.7 million people. In Ukraine, there's four -- the population is 44 million people. So, you still have at least 42 million people there that are under his guns."

I mean, the last major refugee crisis that happened was from the Mideast to Europe. But this is going to be a little bit different because the Ukrainians, I think, are able to assimilate in a -- in a better way just because they're neighboring all these countries they're going to, you have a language similarity, religious similarity. So, there's that. And you'd hope that these -- a lot of them are women and children, but you'd hope that they would add value to the countries they're going to. They both share a distaste for Russia with the countries they're going to Poland, Slovakia, you know, Romania. So, I guess, there is -- there is some good to come to this, hopefully."

We tried to get Navy SEALs out of prison for something that's dicey. We put the -- we put that conversation on trial and then we debate the case. They're actually aiming for the good people, for people that just happen to be going to school that day or go into their machine shop that night. So, they are really traumatized.

And in the end, it doesn't matter because Russia and China are going to get back together again because they hate the West. This is just a temporary bump in the road where Russia and China -- you know, Russia -- China may spin off a little bit. They may have wanted to join Russia in making sure that they could collaborate on this because China wants to go after Taiwan. And I don't know if that's going to be happening now if the -- and we were talking about this during the break, if maybe the American government sends Taiwan some weapons or something that might protect it.
