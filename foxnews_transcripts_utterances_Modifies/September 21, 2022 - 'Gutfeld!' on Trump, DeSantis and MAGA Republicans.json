So ever since Joe Biden's speech from the innermost circle of hell, I've been thinking a lot about the future of this country. He warned us of a terrible threat. And, no, not that he ate fiber before boarding the roller coaster at Six Flags. It's the extreme-MAGA Republican who apparently number in the dozens or perhaps millions. We really never get a head count on the threat. We're not even sure they have heads. But the vagueness of the threat certainly is convenient, mainly because it's hard to count something that doesn't really exist. Unlike, say, the persistent and violent crime we now experience every single day across this country. Oddly, none of that is caused by people in red hats. Fact is, extreme-MAGA aren't like sheep. You can't count them to fall asleep because there's really not enough of them. And for a Democrat, it's best never to know how truly big the threat is or it might actually end up going away. Fact is, Trump supporters are the new climate change. We can't quantify it, but we can tell you it's evil. But the fear tactic, it's effective. Thanks to Joe and the media, we now have a Democratic majority in a poll who believe that Trump supporters are a serious threat to democracy. Hell, they even got 25 percent of Republicans to agree. But let's be honest, those are the really dumb ones. When those who heard 25 percent they thought, all right, our best approval numbers ever. And of course, you had the Democrats pushing the idea that violence is looming around the corner. Here's Eric Swalwell, in between bouts of rampant farting and having sex with Chinese spies, talking about the coming wave of violent Republicans.",

So since Joe and the media never ever name the actual threats, referring to it to be an amorphous, anonymous blob like manmade climate change or Joy Behar's body odor.

So ever since Joe Biden's speech from the innermost circle of hell, I've been thinking a lot about the future of this country. He warned us of a terrible threat. And, no, not that he ate fiber before boarding the roller coaster at Six Flags. It's the extreme-MAGA Republican who apparently number in the dozens or perhaps millions. We really never get a head count on the threat. We're not even sure they have heads. But the vagueness of the threat certainly is convenient, mainly because it's hard to count something that doesn't really exist. Unlike, say, the persistent and violent crime we now experience every single day across this country. Oddly, none of that is caused by people in red hats. Fact is, extreme-MAGA aren't like sheep. You can't count them to fall asleep because there's really not enough of them. And for a Democrat, it's best never to know how truly big the threat is or it might actually end up going away. Fact is, Trump supporters are the new climate change. We can't quantify it, but we can tell you it's evil. But the fear tactic, it's effective. Thanks to Joe and the media, we now have a Democratic majority in a poll who believe that Trump supporters are a serious threat to democracy. Hell, they even got 25 percent of Republicans to agree. But let's be honest, those are the really dumb ones. When those who heard 25 percent they thought, all right, our best approval numbers ever. And of course, you had the Democrats pushing the idea that violence is looming around the corner. Here's Eric Swalwell, in between bouts of rampant farting and having sex with Chinese spies, talking about the coming wave of violent Republicans."

But it was either that or bare knuckle boxing with Dagen McDowell and her office. Besides, my intern was busy with my laundry. Kilmeade, is such a heavy bleeder. So since Joe and the media never ever name the actual threats, referring to it to be an amorphous, anonymous blob like manmade climate change or Joy Behar's body odor. I wanted to see if I could put a name to this demon. Perhaps it's one of these Republican candidates running for office. After all, all they ever talk about is pornography."

Oh, so yes, it's kinky and all, but is it a threat to democracy? Unless by democracy you mean my pants. However, that's terrible. However, I think I finally found the threat to this great republic.

      "speaker": "KUSHNER",
      "utterance": "According to what I hear, sometimes I do think they are. You know, I think what the people in Washington didn't understand about Trump voters is that they wanted things like low gas prices, low taxes, they wanted peace in the world. They didn't want to have wars in Ukraine, or, you know, China being provocative. And that was really why I wrote the book. I want people to understand all the things that happened during the Trump administration, despite all the craziness, you would constantly see in the press. Whether it was accusing us, you saw Eric Swalwell earlier accusing us of colluding with Russia for two years, which turned out we didn't collude with Russia, we want to campaign. And so you had all these different currents that we wanted to cover. And that's what -- when I traveled the country, I saw it Trump voters were just good people who wanted their country restored in the way that they wanted to live. And so, that was what I tried to portray."

I'll put that in. But you had to change, you had to go out, you had to -- you got to hang out with these people. And you turn out, well, this thing is real. These are real people. And I thought that was interesting. I'm going to piss off so many people. But I thought that this book is the best book about the administration. And I think that will probably upset a few people that are -- come on this show, just because like -- I tell you, you can explain behind the scenes of a lot of stuff that I like, you know, I wanted like the middle -- the Middle East peace process, you knew nothing about this. You didn't even know you were going to work on it."

      "utterance": "But I will say -- well, first of all, thank you, you could do more of that if you'd like to. I can just be quiet and let you go. But I will say that I think that what was very important for me to portray to people is that I wasn't a New York liberal. I think I was somebody who was a pragmatist. And I think that we have all the titles today, but I really show what it was like to travel through the country, explore, meet people, have an open mind and learn about things like the Middle East. Learn about things like what the policies were that people wanted, and then see how President Trump and his administration delivered those things."

A YouTuber interviewed a woman named Elena Redondo who showed off her tiny pad which doesn't have an onion -- which doesn't have an oven, a shower or even a toilet. Just how I like it. So, it has no toilet but it does have a sink. I've never really understood the difference. But this audience -- Redondo shares the bathroom down the hall with their neighbors.

And now, it's going back that way. Portland is the same way. My family lived in Portland for a long time back in the heyday. Now, you go there and you can't recognize it. It's, it's an absolute mess. But my favorite story going to the tiny apartment thing, because talking about the decline of American cities, I find that very depressing. In the story, my favorite quote from the story was as for sleeping, and you alluded to this in the in the clip, the bed is loft and close to the ceiling, which prevents guys from staying over. It wouldn't actually prevent guys from staying over if they weren't going to hope they engage in sex. But that's the point of the story is that it's so close to the ceiling that they can't do the mess around right because I mean, that's, that's what she's implying by this right?
