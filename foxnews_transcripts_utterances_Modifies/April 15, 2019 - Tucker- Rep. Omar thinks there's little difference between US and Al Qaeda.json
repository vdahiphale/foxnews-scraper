      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" It was a horrifying scene in Paris today, an island in the middle of the Seine where Notre Dame Cathedral sits and has for 850 years, a living symbol of Christianity, of France, of Western civilization itself -- all but melted down, its steeple toppling on live television. There you have the pictures.  The final damage is still being assessed tonight, but it looks to be a near total loss. The interior of the Cathedral famously called \"The Forest,\" 800-year-old timbers ignited like a tinderbox. Trace Gallagher has been on this story all day and he joins us tonight in studio.",

      "sentences": "And the reason they call it \"The Forest,\" Tucker is because 52 acres of timber, some eight or nine hundred years ago, that's what it took to actually build this thing, 800 years ago and the timber of course has been drying for that long so when this thing went up it was a tinderbox for all intents and purposes.  It happened a little after 6:00 p.m., right, we're talking about Paris time, a little after six, you could see some of the smoke coming up out of the Cathedral and people were wondering what the smoke was and then minutes later, you look at the pictures, you could see the flames, you could see the smoke had gotten much darker. The firefighters say they were actually there as soon as the workers -- because they're now in the process of renovating or they were in the process of renovating this fire -- the workers were there and the firefighters were trying to bring them out. But the problem was, there were no resources which is odd because the people who were on the scene said it was unbelievable that you had this thing burning and you see that Notre Dame is actually on an island and there's a river that runs right by the back of the property, so the wonderment was why wasn't there any water being pushed or being pumped on this thing and for some reason, for 30 or 40 minutes, they struggled to be able to get some water on this.  They actually considered using helicopters like we see in wildfires out west to dump on there, but the concern then would be would it be enough water to put the fire out and would it do more damage. They also thought about bringing in these tankers which we also see in firefights out west, but the question is that's not an exact science and then you run the risk of having these big tankers come through and dropping this water and doing damage to not only the buildings, but maybe some of the people who were around there. So by the time they got there, all this would -- the entire Cathedral was going down and they were saying later, they had no idea if they were going to be able to put the fire out, period -- Tucker.",

Mark, thanks a lot for coming on.   There's so many things to say about this, but the one I can't get out of my mind is we haven't built anything like Notre Dame Cathedral in the West in so long.

The men who set to work on this knew that they would not see it finished in their lifetime, but their sense of a transcendent meaning to life was so strong that the idea of building the most beautiful buildings to the glory of God, they took naturally in a way that we don't anymore.",

Three years ago in that terrible summer that began with the Nice truck killings when it seemed as if the entire French state was unraveling, I went to Rouen Cathedral for the funeral of Father Hamel, the French priest who had his throat cut at mass, and I then went to the Basilica of Saint Denis which is in the north of Paris where the French Kings are buried and basically is a Christian Museum in the heart of what is now a Muslim suburb in effect. There's no sense of Christianity outside the walls of that Cathedral and it was after that that I went to then Notre Dame because you do have the sense that a living breathing faith is just becoming actually a museum, an art gallery, a storage facility and the French who were on the streets in tears this evening, on the streets of Paris, they're not mourning -- I don't think they're mourning just history or architecture or art or culture. They're mourning something else but what that's something else post- Christian France can't quite identify it and that's really the conundrum when Monsieur Macron says, \"Oh we're going to rebuild it.\" Rebuild it for what?",

Since then, some diehard conspiracy nuts have suggested that Barr lied in his summary because he's in on it, too, trying to help Vladimir Putin waiting for his vodka payment even now, apparently. So, we're going to find out very soon whether they were right or not. We're going to have the complete report the moment it drops with the exception of the redactions, and if those people were wrong, do you think they'll apologize? We're going to ask them to.

So it's not selling any copies and yet here's the amazing part, the \"New York Times\" put it 14th on the bestseller list, so a book that sold no copies made the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. So a book industry insiders spoke to \"The Daily Caller\" News Foundation and described that as quote, \"inconceivable.\" So inconceivable in fact that there's only one explanation for it -- fraud. It turns out there are private companies that will buy an author's book in bulk for a fee in order to guarantee bestseller status. We're not saying that happened, we're just strongly suggesting that it must have happened. Until now Jarrett's accomplishment in life was being friends with Barack and Michelle Obama, but now she has a new fake achievement -- best-selling author. Congrats. Well for years, Democratic leaders have fought against securing the border. They passed sanctuary city laws. They made it clear that in their view, there are only two kinds of people in the world -- the defective Americans who already live here -- you and me; and the superior future Americans who inhabit the rest of the planet, but should be allowed to come here as swiftly as possible.   If you disagree by the way, you're a bigot. It's as simple as that. This rhetoric worked perfectly for Democrats up until something unexpected happened. The President threatened to agree with them. Last week, he said he was ready to give them exactly what they've been demanding -- illegal immigrants fresh from the border, as many as possible bussed directly to their front doors like a package from their favorite company, Amazon.  You think they'd be thrilled, but they weren't. They were angry. They said Trump was going to dump immigrants on them. Dump like used cars and tires in the woods.

Instead, he is in Guatemala and El Salvador. Newsom says he's there to learn about the area's troubles including poverty and crime and to find out what California can do to help. What California can do to help other countries work on their homeless and poverty related issues. Huh. Imagine if he was that focused on his own state, which he's supposed to be running.

They were offered a plea deal, but turned it down because it included mandatory jail time. Then they got hit with another charge of money- laundering with a max sentence of 20 years and \"People Magazine\" is now reporting at that point, Loughlin and Giannulli wanted to negotiate, but prosecutors took the deal off the table, so they had no choice but to plead guilty. Now that's significant because both charges carry 20 years each. First- time offenders are never going to get 40 years, but experts say it's possible they could get four to six years. Neither Lachlan nor Giannulli have commented on the allegations, but even if this does not go to trial and prosecutors decide to cut an eleventh-hour plea deal, experts say it looks like Loughlin and her husband will serve years, not months. On the other hand, actress Felicity Huffman who has already pleaded guilty to boosting her daughter's SAT score and expressed remorse is looking at maybe a few months behind bars and now, there are reports that adult students involved in the cheating scandal could also face criminal charges. That's on top of their applications being rejected, potentially being kicked out of school or even having their diplomas revoked. The legal experts say it's going to be a lot more difficult to prove the students knew their parents were cheating on their behalf, but it gets more interesting as we go along in days, Tucker.",

Like what are we really angry about? Cheaters are bad. Cheaters are bad because when people cheat, people who don't cheat get taken advantage of and that's just fundamentally not fair. We all get that. But rich cheaters seem to really upset us especially and I think part of part of what's crystallized the outrage around this story is the fact that the people who most egregiously cheated had an awful lot of money and for my money, you know, as I step back to look at it, I was like, \"Well, yes that is kind of disgusting,\" but where is the outrage for the cost of college in general? I mean you don't have to be rich or famous to believe that your kid is doomed to fail if they don't get a four-year degree. There are millions of parents in the country right now, millions, who genuinely feel that if they don't do everything they can to get their kid into a good school, they will fail the kid. So where's the outrage for the pressure that we put on a 17-year-old to borrow $100,000.00. So much of that pressure comes from their mom and dad. It's well intended, but it's kind of tragic and where's the outrage for the guidance counselors who continually say the best path for the most people just happens to be the most expensive and the politicians and the lobbyists who exacerbate the same myth and employers who still insist on only interviewing people with a four-year degree? We set the table in a pretty self-evident way and when we scratch our heads, you're exactly right. The cost of tuition has increased faster than inflation, but also faster than healthcare, faster than real estate, faster than food, faster than energy. Never before in the history of Western civilization has anything so potentially important become so egregiously expensive. So, yes college is expensive because we freed up an unlimited pile of free money and told an entire generation they were doomed to fail if they didn't borrow it and that's happened in every single tax bracket, not just the top one.",

So for instance, I know we've talked about this before, but it just seems so clear now when four-year degree universities needed a PR campaign 40 years ago, they got one, but the PR came at the expense of all other forms of education. So it wasn't just, \"Hey, Tucker go get your Liberal Arts degree because it will give you a broad-based appreciation for the humanities.\" It was, \"If you don't go get that degree, you're going to wind up over here turning a wrench or running a welding torch or doing some kind of vocational consolation prize.\" We promoted the one thing at the expense of all of the others and that one thing just happened to be the most expensive thing and so look, I don't think the skills gap is a mystery. I think it's a reflection of what we value. Seven million jobs are available now, most of them don't require a four-year degree. They require training, and yet we're obsessed not really with education, what we're obsessed with is credentialing. And so people are buying diplomas and they're buying their degrees. It's a diploma dilemma, honestly and it's expensive and it's getting worse and it's not just the kids who are holding the note. It's us. We're underwriting all the time.",

There you have the pictures. The final damage is still being assessed tonight, but it looks to be a near total loss. The interior of the Cathedral famously called \"The Forest,\" 800-year-old timbers ignited like a tinderbox. Trace Gallagher has been on this story all day and he joins us tonight in studio."

It happened a little after 6:00 p.m., right, we're talking about Paris time, a little after six, you could see some of the smoke coming up out of the Cathedral and people were wondering what the smoke was and then minutes later, you look at the pictures, you could see the flames, you could see the smoke had gotten much darker. The firefighters say they were actually there as soon as the workers -- because they're now in the process of renovating or they were in the process of renovating this fire -- the workers were there and the firefighters were trying to bring them out. But the problem was, there were no resources which is odd because the people who were on the scene said it was unbelievable that you had this thing burning and you see that Notre Dame is actually on an island and there's a river that runs right by the back of the property, so the wonderment was why wasn't there any water being pushed or being pumped on this thing and for some reason, for 30 or 40 minutes, they struggled to be able to get some water on this. They actually considered using helicopters like we see in wildfires out west to dump on there, but the concern then would be would it be enough water to put the fire out and would it do more damage. They also thought about bringing in these tankers which we also see in firefights out west, but the question is that's not an exact science and then you run the risk of having these big tankers come through and dropping this water and doing damage to not only the buildings, but maybe some of the people who were around there. So by the time they got there, all this would -- the entire Cathedral was going down and they were saying later, they had no idea if they were going to be able to put the fire out, period -- Tucker."

Notre Dame is about a 10-minute walk from the Pompidou Center named for the late President Pompidou and it is -- that is one of the like almost every modern building in Paris, that is one of the ugliest things you've ever seen and when you go back eight and a half centuries to the time when this building began construction, it took a century for the for the first part of it to be completed. The men who set to work on this knew that they would not see it finished in their lifetime, but their sense of a transcendent meaning to life was so strong that the idea of building the most beautiful buildings to the glory of God, they took naturally in a way that we don't anymore."

So this is not -- and we want to be clear -- speculating about the cause of this fire though you know it happened as Trace Gallagher just noted at beginning of Holy Week and it is not the only Church that has caught fire in France in the last year or it would seem quite a few desecrations of churches; again, not saying this is one of them, but give us a sense of the scale of what's been happening."

Three years ago in that terrible summer that began with the Nice truck killings when it seemed as if the entire French state was unraveling, I went to Rouen Cathedral for the funeral of Father Hamel, the French priest who had his throat cut at mass, and I then went to the Basilica of Saint Denis which is in the north of Paris where the French Kings are buried and basically is a Christian Museum in the heart of what is now a Muslim suburb in effect. There's no sense of Christianity outside the walls of that Cathedral and it was after that that I went to then Notre Dame because you do have the sense that a living breathing faith is just becoming actually a museum, an art gallery, a storage facility and the French who were on the streets in tears this evening, on the streets of Paris, they're not mourning -- I don't think they're mourning just history or architecture or art or culture. They're mourning something else but what that's something else post- Christian France can't quite identify it and that's really the conundrum when Monsieur Macron says, \"Oh we're going to rebuild it.\" Rebuild it for what?"

I mean everyone knows the hunchback of Notre Dame, the Victor Hugo novel, which actually did quite a lot to restore the importance of Notre Dame in the minds of the French people, but Michel Houellebecq, a controversial novelist, he wrote a novel called \"Submission,\" which posits that France elects a Muslim President and he knows -- the central character knows this is going to mean something and he actually makes a conscious effort to try and recover his lost Catholic faith and that character goes on the kind of pilgrimage and he is moved by it as music and he is moved by it as ritual. But he can't quite make the final step and reconnect with God and the Catholic faith and that scene in that book is in a certain sense the question raised by this fire tonight. Is it a hole in the soul or is it just a missing building burned to the ground?"

The Department of Justice announced today that the Mueller report will in fact be released to the rest of us this Thursday. It's been three weeks since the Attorney General William Barr released his first summary of the report that exonerated the President and his staff from claims that they colluded with the government of Vladimir Putin. Since then, some diehard conspiracy nuts have suggested that Barr lied in his summary because he's in on it, too, trying to help Vladimir Putin waiting for his vodka payment even now, apparently. So, we're going to find out very soon whether they were right or not. We're going to have the complete report the moment it drops with the exception of the redactions, and if those people were wrong, do you think they'll apologize? We're going to ask them to. Up next, for years Democrats said that Americans should welcome every migrant -- legal or illegal -- but since President Trump offered to grant them their wish, they've been strangely unexcited about it.

The book is called, \"Finding My Voice,\" and we're not being mean, just honest it's not even in the top 1,000 on Amazon or Barnes and Noble. It has almost no reviews. I think four reviews. So it's not selling any copies and yet here's the amazing part, the \"New York Times\" put it 14th on the bestseller list, so a book that sold no copies made the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. So a book industry insiders spoke to \"The Daily Caller\" News Foundation and described that as quote, \"inconceivable.\" So inconceivable in fact that there's only one explanation for it -- fraud. It turns out there are private companies that will buy an author's book in bulk for a fee in order to guarantee bestseller status. We're not saying that happened, we're just strongly suggesting that it must have happened. Until now Jarrett's accomplishment in life was being friends with Barack and Michelle Obama, but now she has a new fake achievement -- best-selling author. Congrats. Well for years, Democratic leaders have fought against securing the border. They passed sanctuary city laws. They made it clear that in their view, there are only two kinds of people in the world -- the defective Americans who already live here -- you and me; and the superior future Americans who inhabit the rest of the planet, but should be allowed to come here as swiftly as possible. If you disagree by the way, you're a bigot. It's as simple as that. This rhetoric worked perfectly for Democrats up until something unexpected happened. The President threatened to agree with them. Last week, he said he was ready to give them exactly what they've been demanding -- illegal immigrants fresh from the border, as many as possible bussed directly to their front doors like a package from their favorite company, Amazon. You think they'd be thrilled, but they weren't. They were angry. They said Trump was going to dump immigrants on them. Dump like used cars and tires in the woods.

Thousands of middle-class residents fleet every year. Boise is one of the fastest-growing places in the country. Fear not though, the new governor, Gavin Newsom, formerly the mayor of San Francisco is on the case. He is taking an ambitious three-day poverty tour to learn about the struggles of low-income people and what he can do about it. He has always been rich, so he needs to do a little reporting on the subject, but wait. It turns out he is not doing this tour in Skid Row or Stockton or the Central Valley. Instead, he is in Guatemala and El Salvador. Newsom says he's there to learn about the area's troubles including poverty and crime and to find out what California can do to help. What California can do to help other countries work on their homeless and poverty related issues. Huh. Imagine if he was that focused on his own state, which he's supposed to be running.

There is no epidemic of hate crimes. We checked. We know what the numbers are. We checked for California, the biggest state, the most liberal state. Here are the number. In 2017, the state of California convicted a total of 65 people of hate crimes, statewide. Sixty five out of a population of almost forty million people.

You know, I've been traveling the world over the last year and I talk to people about free speech and all of these issues and everyone in Europe -- everyone in Europe is jealous that we still have the First Amendment. They wish they had the First Amendment. So this is what we must stand for. I'd have to say as someone that lived in New York during 9/11, I was in my early 20s watching the videos of the planes crashing, every time I see it, it's horrific, obviously. But the dismissiveness that Omar went. The way she laughs at it or smiles when she's talking about it or just sort of shifts the way that you should feel about it, it's not about what happened to the people who actually died, it's might happen to her."

      "utterance": "It really sounds like Lori Loughlin and her husband, the fashion designer, Mossimo Giannulli really didn't underestimate the serious charges they're facing and now they're underestimating how motivated prosecutors are when they were first charged with bribing their daughters into the University of Southern California by having them designated as recruits of the crew team despite never having competed in the sport. They were offered a plea deal, but turned it down because it included mandatory jail time. Then they got hit with another charge of money- laundering with a max sentence of 20 years and \"People Magazine\" is now reporting at that point, Loughlin and Giannulli wanted to negotiate, but prosecutors took the deal off the table, so they had no choice but to plead guilty. Now that's significant because both charges carry 20 years each. First- time offenders are never going to get 40 years, but experts say it's possible they could get four to six years. Neither Lachlan nor Giannulli have commented on the allegations, but even if this does not go to trial and prosecutors decide to cut an eleventh-hour plea deal, experts say it looks like Loughlin and her husband will serve years, not months. On the other hand, actress Felicity Huffman who has already pleaded guilty to boosting her daughter's SAT score and expressed remorse is looking at maybe a few months behind bars and now, there are reports that adult students involved in the cheating scandal could also face criminal charges. That's on top of their applications being rejected, potentially being kicked out of school or even having their diplomas revoked. The legal experts say it's going to be a lot more difficult to prove the students knew their parents were cheating on their behalf, but it gets more interesting as we go along in days, Tucker."

      "utterance": "Every year American colleges seem to teach less but charge more. The price of the college degree has been going up faster than inflation for many years, but as the recent Varsity Blues scandal shows, some people willing to spend still more -- thousands even millions more -- to ensure their child gets a seat at a particular University. Why is this? Mike Rowe has spent years calling out colleges for wasting the time and money of students and their parents. He has got a brand new book coming out called, \"The Way I Heard It,\" which you can pre-order and you should because it's amazing, but in the meantime he joins us in the flesh, Mike Rowe joins us tonight. Mike Rowe thanks very much for coming on, so what -- I've been wanting for the past two weeks to get your view of this college scandal because it intersects with so many things you've been talking about for so long. What's your view of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE ROWE, AUTHOR",
      "utterance": "Well the first and obvious thing to say is I'm outraged. Everybody is outraged, but you step back and you look at it, you know I think it's fair to say, what is most outrageous? Like what are we really angry about? Cheaters are bad. Cheaters are bad because when people cheat, people who don't cheat get taken advantage of and that's just fundamentally not fair. We all get that. But rich cheaters seem to really upset us especially and I think part of part of what's crystallized the outrage around this story is the fact that the people who most egregiously cheated had an awful lot of money and for my money, you know, as I step back to look at it, I was like, \"Well, yes that is kind of disgusting,\" but where is the outrage for the cost of college in general? I mean you don't have to be rich or famous to believe that your kid is doomed to fail if they don't get a four-year degree. There are millions of parents in the country right now, millions, who genuinely feel that if they don't do everything they can to get their kid into a good school, they will fail the kid. So where's the outrage for the pressure that we put on a 17-year-old to borrow $100,000.00. So much of that pressure comes from their mom and dad. It's well intended, but it's kind of tragic and where's the outrage for the guidance counselors who continually say the best path for the most people just happens to be the most expensive and the politicians and the lobbyists who exacerbate the same myth and employers who still insist on only interviewing people with a four-year degree? We set the table in a pretty self-evident way and when we scratch our heads, you're exactly right. The cost of tuition has increased faster than inflation, but also faster than healthcare, faster than real estate, faster than food, faster than energy. Never before in the history of Western civilization has anything so potentially important become so egregiously expensive. So, yes college is expensive because we freed up an unlimited pile of free money and told an entire generation they were doomed to fail if they didn't borrow it and that's happened in every single tax bracket, not just the top one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "No, that's exactly right, so we really shouldn't be surprised as you just said when people who can try and game the system that's been described to them since day one as the most important -- as the gates to success in America. Why even now are so -- when so many people know the system is a scam are so few people saying so?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROWE",
      "utterance": "I think because we're stuck in this perpetual binary box. It's this or that, right? It's blue-collar or white-collar. Good job or bad job. Higher education or alternative education. And when you only have two choices or when you think you only have two choices, then you do one thing at the expense of the other. So for instance, I know we've talked about this before, but it just seems so clear now when four-year degree universities needed a PR campaign 40 years ago, they got one, but the PR came at the expense of all other forms of education. So it wasn't just, \"Hey, Tucker go get your Liberal Arts degree because it will give you a broad-based appreciation for the humanities.\" It was, \"If you don't go get that degree, you're going to wind up over here turning a wrench or running a welding torch or doing some kind of vocational consolation prize.\" We promoted the one thing at the expense of all of the others and that one thing just happened to be the most expensive thing and so look, I don't think the skills gap is a mystery. I think it's a reflection of what we value. Seven million jobs are available now, most of them don't require a four-year degree. They require training, and yet we're obsessed not really with education, what we're obsessed with is credentialing. And so people are buying diplomas and they're buying their degrees. It's a diploma dilemma, honestly and it's expensive and it's getting worse and it's not just the kids who are holding the note. It's us. We're underwriting all the time."

He is the founder of Barstool Sports and we're grateful to have him tonight. El Presidente, does this -- I mean, you from the very beginning said this was a frame job. It's ridiculous.
