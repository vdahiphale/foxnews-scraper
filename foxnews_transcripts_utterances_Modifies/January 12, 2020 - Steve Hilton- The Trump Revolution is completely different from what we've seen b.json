      "sentences": "Breaking tonight. Big news on President Trump's Iran strategy. Within the last few hours, the president says quote, \"He couldn't care less if they negotiate,\" despite what his national security advisers suggested this morning. The president reiterating his insistence that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon and urging the regime not to kill protesters, even as protests against the regime continue to grow as thousands of people took to the streets to condemn their leaders for shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane. In a moment I'll be joined by Congressman Matt Gaetz for reaction. And we have a fantastic lineup for you tonight to break down all the latest news on Iran, impeachment and the 2020 race. Look at this: Tammy Bruce is here. Lisa Boothe, Lawrence Jones, K.T. McFarland coming up on Iran.  Good evening, everyone, and welcome to \"The Next Revolution.\" I'm Steve Hilton and this is the home of positive populism, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-community and of course, pro-America.  On Friday, Nancy Pelosi caved again, saying she will send the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate in a few days.  Iran yesterday admitted to shooting down that Ukrainian passenger plane, while confirming that its response to President Trump's strike on terror chief, Qasem Soleimani has concluded. Here's how I see things at the end of a momentous week for the Trump presidency and the start of what could be another defining seven days.  This show is called \"The Next Revolution,\" but tonight I want to talk about the Trump revolution because I don't think there's been proper recognition of the substance and significance of what this president is doing. It's completely different from what we've seen before. It doesn't fit into the establishment traditional ideological boxes, and that's why they waste our time with pointless political games like impeachment.  We saw the new approach clearly with Iran. The Democrats, never Trumpers and their media lackeys lurched wildly from calling Trump weak to branding him a warmonger.   But his strategy has been consistent from day one. He is anti-war, but he is also anti-weak. Now, he doesn't want to invade deserts of sand like the neocons, but he doesn't want to put his head in the sand, like the isolation nuts either. It was the same over Syria. Withdrawing troops from a conflict that is someone else's business, but a missile strike, if you use chemical weapons. You saw it with North Korea, fire and fury and then historic negotiations. The same with China. Tough tariffs, but look what's happening next week. They're coming here to sign a deal. This is the Trump revolution: Pragmatic, non-ideological. He approaches issues as a problem solving businessman. It's actually a revolution in ideas and it goes way beyond foreign policy. He is combining the best of traditional conservative ideas with positive populism, appointing conservative judges and criminal justice reform, cutting taxes and boosting family leave.   Cutting regulations, by the way, given a massive boost last week with new plans to reform the environmental bureaucracy that's blocking infrastructure construction, and cutting low wage immigration, the result? Well, we know the story by now, but we see new chapters every month. Another positive jobs report on Friday. Unemployment again at a 50-year low. And here's the most important part, earnings rising, not just for everyone, but fastest for the lowest paid ending nearly 50 years of stagnation. So how are the establishment Republicans reacting?",

Trump's damaged? Who backed the human and economic catastrophe of the Iraq War? Who brought in the disastrous 1986 Immigration Reform, creating the broken system that Trump is trying to fix? Who let China into the World Trade Organization, devastating American manufacturing to the point where we literally can't even print Bibles in America?  Who pushed ruling class trade globalism that spawned the disastrous NAFTA, putting so many Americans out of work in the heartland? And who assaulted the American family with policies that collapsed marriage rates and family stability?   No, not the evil Trump, it was you, the Republican establishment who did this to America. These never Trumpers are apologists for an elitist ideology that is anti-worker, anti-family and anti-community. So they can write whatever pompous, self-righteous nonsense they want in \"The New York Times.\" The establishment Republican Party is not coming back. It is dead, killed by their policy failure and Donald Trump's policy success. There is no constituency for their ideas, except a handful of opportunists who traded their principles for a contract with the Democrats' cable news networks, where they poop off about the President's tweets while ignoring his policies. Here's the level of their analysis.",

It was the establishment Republicans; in fact, two-thirds of the Republican Conference who joined with all of the Democrats on October 17th to pass a resolution condemning the President for removing us from the Syrian Civil War.  I was the only -- I stress -- the only Republican who took to the floor to defend the Trump Doctrine that we should kill the terrorists and then return home and not engage in these endless unconstitutional wars. I know that President Trump is the most anti-war President of my lifetime, and I am hopeful that the successful execution of the Trump Doctrine will get us out of the Middle East where we have spilled $7 trillion and the blood of America's bravest patriots including my dear constituents from Florida.",

Which is, it seemed to me that, you know, you can have a good constitutional discussion over their powers over war and so on. And of course, it's true that friends should be able to disagree. My goodness me, I've done that many times.

And in fact, I think that the killing of Soleimani would have been justified under the War Powers Resolution that was passed and certainly not prohibited.   And so I think that I was advancing an America first pro-Trump Doctrine by saying the President should kill the terrorists and then return home.  But this is far more important than any one president. I don't believe that any President should have the ability to commit our troops to these endless wars, and I think that that was an issue that was resolved by George Washington in 1791.",

President Trump has proven that by enhancing America's economy, we strengthen the tools in our arsenal to engage in economic war against our enemies. Right now, the Iranian regime is crumbling under the maximum pressure campaign that I completely support, but we don't enhance our ability to wage successful economic war on our adversaries and enemies when we go and spill America's blood and treasure in these endless Middle East adventures. So I think making our country stronger, and then making sure that we don't allow any President in the future to make the mistakes of the Obama-Bush Doctrine that is the true way to make sure that the Trump legacy survives and is successful in the Middle East and throughout the world.",

First they said it was this emergency that the President was a clear and present danger to the country. Then they sat on this resolution, these impeachment articles for weeks.  Initially, they told us that the F.B.I. did nothing wrong. Then the Obama- appointed Inspector General comes out and points out how time and again, the F.B.I. altered evidence and then wasn't straight with a FISA court as they were unfairly pursuing the President of the United States.  So I think framing this not just in terms of the Ukraine, but in terms of this coup attempt to go against everything and everything that our great President is trying to do. I think that's the way that we do more than just win the vote in the Senate.  We have to win the case with the American people that this is the radical left unable to win an actual argument with the President, about our economy about our standing in the world. And so they're impeaching him in lieu of an agenda. I think we have to make that political argument alongside the very justified legal argument that the President did nothing wrong and imposed no conditionality on the Ukrainians and the Ukrainians have said time and again that they felt no conditionality.",

And so what they've done is that this impeachment has been the Democratic campaign paid for by taxpayers.  This is all they have. But of course, their problem is they've misjudged the American people, including their own base -- and I'll end with this -- who should be ultimately insulted because the base, this is a presumption that the base, like with the supporting of Iran, and this weakness with Soleimani, that the Democratic base wants impeachment and that the Democratic base likes being sympathetic to terrorists in the Middle East.

      "utterance": "Breaking tonight. Big news on President Trump's Iran strategy. Within the last few hours, the president says quote, \"He couldn't care less if they negotiate,\" despite what his national security advisers suggested this morning. The president reiterating his insistence that Iran will not get a nuclear weapon and urging the regime not to kill protesters, even as protests against the regime continue to grow as thousands of people took to the streets to condemn their leaders for shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane. In a moment I'll be joined by Congressman Matt Gaetz for reaction. And we have a fantastic lineup for you tonight to break down all the latest news on Iran, impeachment and the 2020 race. Look at this: Tammy Bruce is here. Lisa Boothe, Lawrence Jones, K.T. McFarland coming up on Iran. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to \"The Next Revolution.\" I'm Steve Hilton and this is the home of positive populism, pro-worker, pro-family, pro-community and of course, pro-America. On Friday, Nancy Pelosi caved again, saying she will send the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate in a few days. Iran yesterday admitted to shooting down that Ukrainian passenger plane, while confirming that its response to President Trump's strike on terror chief, Qasem Soleimani has concluded. Here's how I see things at the end of a momentous week for the Trump presidency and the start of what could be another defining seven days. This show is called \"The Next Revolution,\" but tonight I want to talk about the Trump revolution because I don't think there's been proper recognition of the substance and significance of what this president is doing. It's completely different from what we've seen before. It doesn't fit into the establishment traditional ideological boxes, and that's why they waste our time with pointless political games like impeachment. We saw the new approach clearly with Iran. The Democrats, never Trumpers and their media lackeys lurched wildly from calling Trump weak to branding him a warmonger. But his strategy has been consistent from day one. He is anti-war, but he is also anti-weak. Now, he doesn't want to invade deserts of sand like the neocons, but he doesn't want to put his head in the sand, like the isolation nuts either. It was the same over Syria. Withdrawing troops from a conflict that is someone else's business, but a missile strike, if you use chemical weapons. You saw it with North Korea, fire and fury and then historic negotiations. The same with China. Tough tariffs, but look what's happening next week. They're coming here to sign a deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "This is the Trump revolution",
      "utterance": "Pragmatic, non-ideological. He approaches issues as a problem solving businessman. It's actually a revolution in ideas and it goes way beyond foreign policy. He is combining the best of traditional conservative ideas with positive populism, appointing conservative judges and criminal justice reform, cutting taxes and boosting family leave. Cutting regulations, by the way, given a massive boost last week with new plans to reform the environmental bureaucracy that's blocking infrastructure construction, and cutting low wage immigration, the result? Well, we know the story by now, but we see new chapters every month. Another positive jobs report on Friday. Unemployment again at a 50-year low. And here's the most important part, earnings rising, not just for everyone, but fastest for the lowest paid ending nearly 50 years of stagnation. So how are the establishment Republicans reacting?"

Trump's damaged? Who backed the human and economic catastrophe of the Iraq War? Who brought in the disastrous 1986 Immigration Reform, creating the broken system that Trump is trying to fix? Who let China into the World Trade Organization, devastating American manufacturing to the point where we literally can't even print Bibles in America? Who pushed ruling class trade globalism that spawned the disastrous NAFTA, putting so many Americans out of work in the heartland? And who assaulted the American family with policies that collapsed marriage rates and family stability? No, not the evil Trump, it was you, the Republican establishment who did this to America. These never Trumpers are apologists for an elitist ideology that is anti-worker, anti-family and anti-community. So they can write whatever pompous, self-righteous nonsense they want in \"The New York Times.\" The establishment Republican Party is not coming back. It is dead, killed by their policy failure and Donald Trump's policy success. There is no constituency for their ideas, except a handful of opportunists who traded their principles for a contract with the Democrats' cable news networks, where they poop off about the President's tweets while ignoring his policies. Here's the level of their analysis."

If you're a patriot, who is finally seeing America stand up to China and defend our borders, you'll come to the same conclusion. After Trump, it will be a different Republican Party. And for American workers, families and communities that is fantastic news. Please help us tell the never Trumpers what we think of them. Follow us @SteveHiltonX and @NextRevFNC and share this far and wide. All right. Joining us now to react, Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz, our dear friend who it seems has been in the doghouse with the White House in recent days. Tell us about that, Congressman."

      "utterance": "Well, I don't know what White House staffer thought it was a good idea to smear me to The Washington Post. But I don't think that discrediting me does any good service to the President. Remember, it was years ago, I was one of the first to say that there was an illegal coup being prosecuted against the President. You mentioned Syria in your monologue. It was the establishment Republicans; in fact, two-thirds of the Republican Conference who joined with all of the Democrats on October 17th to pass a resolution condemning the President for removing us from the Syrian Civil War. I was the only -- I stress -- the only Republican who took to the floor to defend the Trump Doctrine that we should kill the terrorists and then return home and not engage in these endless unconstitutional wars. I know that President Trump is the most anti-war President of my lifetime, and I am hopeful that the successful execution of the Trump Doctrine will get us out of the Middle East where we have spilled $7 trillion and the blood of America's bravest patriots including my dear constituents from Florida."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",

And as I said, good friend of this show, but I do want to -- I don't want to go on about it, but I do just -- there's one thing that I was confused about in terms of your vote last week, and I'd love you to explain it to our audience. Which is, it seemed to me that, you know, you can have a good constitutional discussion over their powers over war and so on. And of course, it's true that friends should be able to disagree. My goodness me, I've done that many times. But this thing that you voted for, it sounded like it was just a -- it seemed like just basically a pointless thing, a kind of press release from Nancy Pelosi. I just wasn't clear why you felt it was the right thing to do to vote for that."

      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "That resolution offered no criticism of the President. It offered no criticism of any of his policies. Matter of fact, it didn't even include General Soleimani's name. What that resolution did do was lay out the very serious threat that Iran poses. It established a robust basis for our self-defense. And in fact, I think that the killing of Soleimani would have been justified under the War Powers Resolution that was passed and certainly not prohibited. And so I think that I was advancing an America first pro-Trump Doctrine by saying the President should kill the terrorists and then return home. But this is far more important than any one president. I don't believe that any President should have the ability to commit our troops to these endless wars, and I think that that was an issue that was resolved by George Washington in 1791."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "So just final word on Iran. Overall, you're happy with what the President has done here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "I am totally supportive of the decisions the President has made, and I think that we see it working. Specifically, we see that we don't have to engage in a forever war to win in the Middle East. President Trump has proven that by enhancing America's economy, we strengthen the tools in our arsenal to engage in economic war against our enemies. Right now, the Iranian regime is crumbling under the maximum pressure campaign that I completely support, but we don't enhance our ability to wage successful economic war on our adversaries and enemies when we go and spill America's blood and treasure in these endless Middle East adventures. So I think making our country stronger, and then making sure that we don't allow any President in the future to make the mistakes of the Obama-Bush Doctrine that is the true way to make sure that the Trump legacy survives and is successful in the Middle East and throughout the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "All right, let's move to impeachment. You were pretty much the star of the impeachment hearings in the House and you have that opportunity there to show how ludicrous the process was and what a farce the whole thing was. We're not going to really see that when it gets to the Senate. They're going to be endlessly sort of pompously debating it, and there is going to be a trial rather than a hearing and so on. How do you see this unfolding in the Senate when it finally gets there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "I think that the President has very good counsel in Pat Cipollone and it's my expectation that our opening statement will lay out all of the hypocrisy of the House Democrats. First they said it was this emergency that the President was a clear and present danger to the country. Then they sat on this resolution, these impeachment articles for weeks. Initially, they told us that the F.B.I. did nothing wrong. Then the Obama- appointed Inspector General comes out and points out how time and again, the F.B.I. altered evidence and then wasn't straight with a FISA court as they were unfairly pursuing the President of the United States. So I think framing this not just in terms of the Ukraine, but in terms of this coup attempt to go against everything and everything that our great President is trying to do. I think that's the way that we do more than just win the vote in the Senate. We have to win the case with the American people that this is the radical left unable to win an actual argument with the President, about our economy about our standing in the world. And so they're impeaching him in lieu of an agenda. I think we have to make that political argument alongside the very justified legal argument that the President did nothing wrong and imposed no conditionality on the Ukrainians and the Ukrainians have said time and again that they felt no conditionality."

It feels like that you know, the Americans are going been kind of force fed leftovers that have been sort of rotting in the back of the fridge for six weeks, and it's all going to come out again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the sad part is that we all know where this leads. It's not going to affect anything. The President is not going to be convicted. It looks like Mitch McConnell is going to have an up or down vote, and there's not going to be a trial, so they just wasted American people's time. But the progressives, they had to give the base something. I mean, they said when they campaigned that they were going to get healthcare done, immigration reform, that they were going to repeal the tax plan, and none of that happened. And so they needed some red meat to give them. The only thing is, it is going to hurt the moderates, the 31 swing districts that Trump won and those Democrats campaigned on being moderates. And now these people were so ungrateful and those people are going to lose their seats."

What I love since not just the Reformation in 2016, but since then, certainly is the American people have become wised to what the establishment is. And you strike that point of course in in in your opening that this is over for the establishment. The elite dynamic and the Republican Party is dead. The way things used to operate are over. Donald Trump was not because we all got drunk one night and went and had -- you know, did something weird for one evening and it's a one-off."

And when it comes to the so-called impeachment, this is also a sign of how there is no leadership in the Democratic Party. Barack Obama destroyed it and effectively creating a cult for himself. They did not know what to do in the aftermath. They thought it would be a breeze. They were unprepared for Hillary's loss. And so what they've done is that this impeachment has been the Democratic campaign paid for by taxpayers. This is all they have. But of course, their problem is they've misjudged the American people, including their own base -- and I'll end with this -- who should be ultimately insulted because the base, this is a presumption that the base, like with the supporting of Iran, and this weakness with Soleimani, that the Democratic base wants impeachment and that the Democratic base likes being sympathetic to terrorists in the Middle East. No, they don't. And they're going to find out their own party rejects them."

We knew that the Senate wasn't going to get two-thirds votes to convict the President. Even Democrats like Brenda Lawrence, who is in a heavily Democratic district said as much, right? So everybody has known this, yet, Democrats took us along this process and Kevin McCarthy, the House Minority Leader said today with Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" that he thinks the reason Nancy Pelosi was withholding the Articles of Impeachment was to try to stick it to Bernie Sanders ahead of the Iowa caucuses."

Now, she has caved on this. Just real quick. I want to get -- just to touch on Iran. I want to put something up, which we saw this weekend from Peggy Noonan. I just thought it was really illustrative of something, which, if you look at the other coverage there, it's all about the communication and who said what and whatever. But the substance is lost. And here's the key point from Peggy Noonan, \"For the first time in 40 years since the hostages were taken in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the Iranian government took a hard jab from America right in the face.\" The basic point -- they are not even talking about it, but they are talking about, well, who said what to Laura Ingraham and stuff like that. They just won't deal with the substance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Yes, and this is -- I think that's key. Forty years, two generations of Iran in a house of cards, and they've been able to really dress it up because no one punched them back. And that becomes the assessment for the American people. Why not? Why so long? Why has no one else done anything else? Why only Trump? And that's the key to the Reformation. It's the attitude. It's about, oh, you know, it's status quo, better the devil you know, than the devil you don't know. The Iranian people deserve to be free, so do the Iraqi people, everyone in the Middle East wants freedom. And you see now the photos coming out of Iran. It's women leading those protests."

There's the strike, the counterterrorism strike, which I think was completely justified. And then the Intelligence that are coming now, should we go to war or whatever that conversation? I think Mike Lee was absolutely correct to ask the Intelligence briefers to get more information. And the fact of the matter, them telling Congress that especially people that we support, liberty-minded people that don't want to go to war that we can't disclose this information.

It's like FDR declaring war on Japan, the nature of total war versus the right of the President, which he does have constitutionally to act even with the War Powers Act, frankly, to act if we are under threat, if American interests have been struck like an embassy that is our sovereign land. So you've got the President doing the right thing.

And then the answer came back, yes, but he didn't go to a rally. Obama didn't go to rally and say, yes, the reason I didn't do it, so I don't trust Adam Schiff.

So we're paying a whole lot of attention to something that is essentially irrelevant, and what I am paying attention to, what I think is so interesting is you're seeing these protests going on in Iran right now, and the Iranian regime is incredibly weak right now. They're facing this internal pressure, as we see these people risking their lives, to go to the streets, literally risking their lives to go to the streets. And so the regime is weak internally and also they are weak externally because of their maligned behavior.

And then what did they do yesterday? They arrested the British Ambassador, and then you look at the statement from the Foreign Minister.

When things are, you know, pretty stable when it comes to foreign policy and national security? When Trump has been notching up wins on things like trade? So why go back? And what a worthless -- that's the only argument he can make is essentially like, let's go back."

So is this is the guy -- and remember when Obama ran, part of the reason why they put Joe Biden on the ticket was his foreign policy experience. And then he completely messed up on that as well. Administrative -- different people within the inner circle didn't want to listen to Biden. You've got Robert Gates there, even Secretary Clinton didn't even listen to him. So that tells you how much he valued Joe Biden."
