Hi to all of you, thanks for being here. Jonathan, there's a whole lot we don't know about these documents. We do know, though, that some of them are at least marked top-secret and SCI. The president insists he has declassified all of them. So does that hold legal weight, that argument? And then on top of that, who legally owns these documents, whether they are classified or not?",

It does go to any potential for criminal case, because it goes to the sensitivity of the material, what he understood to be the status of the material. Part of the problem with the warrant is that it lacks particularity. I mean, this thing is unbelievably broad. It says if you find a single document with any classification marking, any classification marking, you can take a whole box, and then you can take all the boxes that are there with that box. So it is basically an order to take the entire animal, including the oink and the moo. I mean, it is -- that's why they scooped up so much. So, there are some regiment questions here about the scope. But the classification status goes I think more to the viability of the case than the technical application of these laws.",

The reality though is that there is a process that has long been in place.

And I would be shocked if Donald Trump went through a very detailed process with paper and working with the DNI to get these all declassified. He seems to be saying I just ordered it be done. That's not exactly how it works. It also doesn't give him any credibility that his attorney, you know, sent in a letter to the Department of Justice saying there were no more classified documents there. They had to be subpoenaed. They were not being cooperative. So the facts on this case that we have now seen over the past week undercut the argument that Trump is trying to make. We would have just cooperated. We just declassify them. They were all fine. Well, so, it's fine, why did you keep saying that you didn't have any? And this is, you know, a long history of Donald Trump misusing classified information. He gave classified information about an ISIS source to the Russians in the Oval Office. He repeatedly went after the intelligence community. He tweeted at times things that were classified. So it's not like he's always protected classified information so tightly and now this is a aberration. It's actually the opposite.",

If these documents are so sensitive, nuclear secrets, highly sensitive material, why did the Justice Department wait so long? What's the urgency here? Why did the Justice Department wait so long to do this? And the public here is asking these big picture questions, is this a fishing expedition for January 6th?

We don't think it's fair to people to do so. So, the knowledge of the president, his expectations, what he knew was in those boxes does go to their prior positions as to the viability of a criminal case. What's disturbing to me is -- is first of all, I have to push back a little bit on the declassification aspect. Presidents always argued that they can declassify information unilaterally. This president says he has a standing order t so when he removed material from the White House. That's really uncharted territory legally. I mean, we haven't had that sort of litigated out. What concerns me is the report today that there was attorney-client material gathered up in those boxes. It's entirely believable when you read the attachment that gives the scope of the search. What concerns me is that the Trump people say that they asked for a special master to just go in and independently look at this material to remove attorney-client material and that that request was denied. Now, if that's true, it does concern me, because Merrick Garland needs to assure the public that this isn't a political issue, this isn't a pretextual search. He could have done that by saying, look, we will have a special master look at this. We don't want attorney-client material and this isn't a pretext for another investigation.

We spoke with one today who spent months in a safe house. He's worried about the lives of his family, and he is stuck here into Afghanistan. And while the Taliban puts on a good face for the international community and they release statements, their words often do not match their actions. One example, they released a decreasing that women here are free, though, the women are not allowed out at night without a male escort.

They are controlling all of the culture, dress, no music in the country. They're just shutting down all the normal cultural aspirations that a nation or people would have. And what makes it -- compounds that is the fact that -- look, we went to Afghanistan to stop the Taliban from providing sanctuary to the al Qaeda from which the attack on the United States took place. We all know that. And what did this decision get us? It got us the Taliban in charge again providing sanctuary to the Taliban -- I mean, providing sanctuary to al Qaeda. And al-Zawahiri's killing resurrected the fact that he is living in a Taliban house in a neighborhood that I've been to many times where senior Taliban leaders are in residence, and obviously, they are protecting the al Qaeda leader as well as his organization. And to date, we've done nothing against that organization and done nothing against ISIS. So, the fact is Afghanistan is a sanctuary for terrorism.

He was advised by the military, by his intelligence services, and by many of his foreign policy advisors, and all of the NATO nations, to maintain the stalemate that we had, the status quo. It wasn't a perfect situation, far from it. But it was a stalemate where the Taliban could not take over from the government, the government could not defeat the Taliban, but because of our presence, NATO and the United States, and our intelligence services, we were able to prevent the al Qaeda from establishing sanctuary and ISIS. So that was in U.S. national interests still. It was an acceptable stalemate as far as many policymakers were concerned. The president thought he knew better. And he was very defiant and rejected all of their advice. And then he presented a false narrative to the American people to which I find very disturbing. He said: My choice is get out now, or have to put thousands of American troops back in here to fight the Taliban and take casualties doing that. We have not been in direct combat with the Taliban since 2014. That's eight years ago. It was seven years when the president made that decision. That was a completely false narrative that he presented to the American people. That wasn't the choice. And the fact that all the Europeans who were in Afghanistan had 6,000 troops there, that they wanted to stay, was very telling, because they're only making a decision because it's in their national interest, it's in their interest to protect their own people. And we gave it all up and we're back to where we were in 2001.",

Among the materials seized, documents labeled top-secret and TS/SCI, the highest classification, meant to be viewed only in secured government facilities. Trump called reports that agents were seeking material related to nuclear weapons a hoax and suggested evidence was planted.

Let's begin now with our Sunday group, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, former State Department spokesperson Marie Harf, Jonathan Riley of \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"USA Today\" Washington bureau chief Susan Page. Hi to all of you, thanks for being here. Jonathan, there's a whole lot we don't know about these documents. We do know, though, that some of them are at least marked top-secret and SCI. The president insists he has declassified all of them. So does that hold legal weight, that argument? And then on top of that, who legally owns these documents, whether they are classified or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it does not negate the warrant or these underlying charges, the fact that they might be declassified, because these charges go to material that they not be classified but are still sensitive defense information. It does go to any potential for criminal case, because it goes to the sensitivity of the material, what he understood to be the status of the material. Part of the problem with the warrant is that it lacks particularity. I mean, this thing is unbelievably broad. It says if you find a single document with any classification marking, any classification marking, you can take a whole box, and then you can take all the boxes that are there with that box. So it is basically an order to take the entire animal, including the oink and the moo. I mean, it is -- that's why they scooped up so much. So, there are some regiment questions here about the scope. But the classification status goes I think more to the viability of the case than the technical application of these laws."

    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Interesting. So, Marie, there is -- put it this way, the president does have the authority to unilaterally really declassify whatever he wants. The reality though is that there is a process that has long been in place. Previous presidents work through the director of national intelligence to make sure what they want to declassify doesn't jeopardize the security or the lives of American operatives overseas, whether that be troops or intelligence officials, and also that what they want to declassified doesn't hurt U.S. relations with other countries."

      "speaker": "MARIE HARF, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. Even with original declassification authority, which the president has, the DNI has, there is still a process. And I would be shocked if Donald Trump went through a very detailed process with paper and working with the DNI to get these all declassified. He seems to be saying I just ordered it be done. That's not exactly how it works. It also doesn't give him any credibility that his attorney, you know, sent in a letter to the Department of Justice saying there were no more classified documents there. They had to be subpoenaed. They were not being cooperative. So the facts on this case that we have now seen over the past week undercut the argument that Trump is trying to make. We would have just cooperated. We just declassify them. They were all fine. Well, so, it's fine, why did you keep saying that you didn't have any? And this is, you know, a long history of Donald Trump misusing classified information. He gave classified information about an ISIS source to the Russians in the Oval Office. He repeatedly went after the intelligence community. He tweeted at times things that were classified. So it's not like he's always protected classified information so tightly and now this is a aberration. It's actually the opposite."

He had never looked at them. If that is proven to be the case, does that change any of the legal or even the political arguments surrounding this? Is that something that could have a huge impact here?"

      "utterance": "I don't think so. No, not necessarily. I think what we are seeing here is a pattern. Donald Trump was accused of violating political norms, sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly, and then his political opponents violate norms in response to that. This has never happened in U.S. history, a president's home being raided. And there's a -- you know, Donald Trump has been out of office for 18 months. If these documents are so sensitive, nuclear secrets, highly sensitive material, why did the Justice Department wait so long? What's the urgency here? Why did the Justice Department wait so long to do this? And the public here is asking these big picture questions, is this a fishing expedition for January 6th? Is this about going after one of President Biden's potential opponents in 2024? This looks like political theater I think, to the average voter and as part of a pattern here of Trump's opponents violating norms in response to the president himself violating norms."

We don't know the details of what they found. And let's find out why former President Trump had taken these documents with him after he left the White House. I think it is premature to draw conclusions about the motivation of the attorney general, the motivation -- the political impact in the midterms, timing questions about this raid, until we know more about what prompted it and what they found. And those are questions that are simply not answered at this point."

      "utterance": "Exactly, including the Espionage Act. And the Justice Department said, look, we don't prosecute cases of gross negligence under this act. We don't think it's fair to people to do so. So, the knowledge of the president, his expectations, what he knew was in those boxes does go to their prior positions as to the viability of a criminal case. What's disturbing to me is -- is first of all, I have to push back a little bit on the declassification aspect. Presidents always argued that they can declassify information unilaterally. This president says he has a standing order t so when he removed material from the White House. That's really uncharted territory legally. I mean, we haven't had that sort of litigated out. What concerns me is the report today that there was attorney-client material gathered up in those boxes. It's entirely believable when you read the attachment that gives the scope of the search. What concerns me is that the Trump people say that they asked for a special master to just go in and independently look at this material to remove attorney-client material and that that request was denied. Now, if that's true, it does concern me, because Merrick Garland needs to assure the public that this isn't a political issue, this isn't a pretextual search. He could have done that by saying, look, we will have a special master look at this. We don't want attorney-client material and this isn't a pretext for another investigation. If he -- if he denied that request, I do find it pretty troubling."

It is a separate case, but yes, he is singing a different tune now that it involves him. But I will say, you know, we saw him there with Hillary Clinton, and when it comes to this raid on Mar-a-Lago, that's going to be the comparison in the public's mine. It's Donald Trump being treated differently than Hillary Clinton was treated when it came to how she handled sensitive materials in the email server? I think Merrick Garland has to clear this hurdle. The Department Justice, the FBI has a history here of involving themselves in political campaigns and elections not all that long ago, and the public remembers that. So I really think the bar is quite high here for him."

He has continually pushed the boundaries of law and ethics, so it's not like he's this model's citizen that, oops, he took a few boxes from the White House. He has consistently done this.

American forces will ultimately able to evacuate over 100,000 of those people, but countless others, including American citizens, were left behind to face an uncertain fate.

Since then, the country's economy has collapsed, plunging millions of people below the poverty line. Women's rights have decreased and the security situation here remains tense. Though when you're walking through the streets of Kabul behind me, there's a sense of normalcy. There are street vendors outselling food. You can hear those horns honking behind me. There is traffic, and the Taliban patrols like a police force, though beyond that veneer sits fear and uncertainty for the Afghan people. Remember, when U.S. forces left this country, they left behind thousands of American allies translators, and people who worked at the U.S. embassy and those people are terrified. We spoke with one today who spent months in a safe house. He's worried about the lives of his family, and he is stuck here into Afghanistan. And while the Taliban puts on a good face for the international community and they release statements, their words often do not match their actions. One example, they released a decreasing that women here are free, though, the women are not allowed out at night without a male escort. Young women, particularly teenagers, aren't able to go to secondary school in most of the country, and any woman leaving their house has to be complete recovered.

The Taliban have returned to their draconian rule in the 1990s, denying people individual rights. Women cannot work, they can't go to school. They are controlling all of the culture, dress, no music in the country. They're just shutting down all the normal cultural aspirations that a nation or people would have. And what makes it -- compounds that is the fact that -- look, we went to Afghanistan to stop the Taliban from providing sanctuary to the al Qaeda from which the attack on the United States took place. We all know that. And what did this decision get us? It got us the Taliban in charge again providing sanctuary to the Taliban -- I mean, providing sanctuary to al Qaeda. And al-Zawahiri's killing resurrected the fact that he is living in a Taliban house in a neighborhood that I've been to many times where senior Taliban leaders are in residence, and obviously, they are protecting the al Qaeda leader as well as his organization. And to date, we've done nothing against that organization and done nothing against ISIS. So, the fact is Afghanistan is a sanctuary for terrorism. The very reason we went there, the very reason we stayed there for 20 years, to ensure that terrorists did not rise again to attack the American people, and we're right back where we started."

It wasn't a perfect situation, far from it. But it was a stalemate where the Taliban could not take over from the government, the government could not defeat the Taliban, but because of our presence, NATO and the United States, and our intelligence services, we were able to prevent the al Qaeda from establishing sanctuary and ISIS.

We have not been in direct combat with the Taliban since 2014. That's eight years ago. It was seven years when the president made that decision. That was a completely false narrative that he presented to the American people. That wasn't the choice. And the fact that all the Europeans who were in Afghanistan had 6,000 troops there, that they wanted to stay, was very telling, because they're only making a decision because it's in their national interest, it's in their interest to protect their own people.

And if we go back and trace those policy decisions, I think we should be honest with ourselves of which ones were misguided and why it put us in such a difficult situation in Afghanistan after 20 years. Certainly, a focus on the withdrawal needs to be done because we lost our troops and -- as a result of that.

But Tuesday's finishing order will be critical in terms of momentum heading to November and will tell us a lot about whether the power of a Trump endorsement can hold sway even in one of the most fiercely independent states in the nation."

So, Susan, Alaska, we just saw, Sarah Palin's been keeping a low profile, shall we say, ahead of Tuesday, only doing a couple of public events. Is she counting on her Trump endorsement and maybe her celebrity to carrier her across the finish line, or is she really kind of banking on her campaign fizzling out?"

      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think she has universal name recognition. People from Alaska and across the country know who Sarah Palin is. If Alaska had not gone to ranked choice voting, she might very well be in a position to win this special election on Tuesday. But now, unless she can get a majority of the vote, it goes into another round, and that gives the prospect that that hard core of support that she has from Alaska will not be enough to get her over the finish line. We'll see if there's a second act in American politics for Sarah Palin."

In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, they've put up Mandela Barnes and John Fetterman, both progressives, obviously, hoping to flip seats from red to blue. \"Politico\" says, quote, the rise of Barnes and Fetterman is an opportunity for the left-wing of the party, which has often struggled to flip swing states - swing seats and instead found success in ousting Democratic incumbents in deep blue areas. Now, Fetterman returned to the campaign trail Friday for the first time since having a stroke in May. So, are we seeing a leftward shift in the party here? And, if so, what does that, you know, spell for moderates and independents?"

      "utterance": "Well, I think each state had primaries. In a state like Pennsylvania, John Fetterman won for a number of reasons, including the fact that he's pretty authentic, right? Maybe more so than some of the other candidates in that primary. But what Democrats will tell you, Gillian, is that every time the Republicans nominate a far right 2020 election, you know, questioning an extreme Trump backed candidate, whether it's in Arizona or Pennsylvania or Ohio or any of the - you know, or Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, who's, of course, an incumbent, Democrats feel better and better about their chances. We now have, on the generic congressional ballot for the House, Democrats have caught up to Republicans. For months they've been down. They've now caught up to them. So, yes, there are progressives running in these states, but the Democrat - the Republican candidates are so far to the right, they're so extreme on everything from election integrity and their denial of the 2020 outcome, saying they won't certify in the future, where they are on abortion in a post-Roe overturned world. So, look, I think Democrats are feeling bullish today about their chances across the country, but particularly in the Senate."

But in some of these other states, I mean, Marie is right that - that the Trump-backed candidates may not be the best fit for that state. I mean you mentioned Ohio and Pennsylvania. We - we'll see.

But I think - so you have to look at what's going on locally. I mean you mentioned -- you were talking about Alaska earlier and Palin. I think it's an interesting case there because this sort of Republican populism that culminated with the election of Donald Trump sort of started arguably with Sarah Palin.

In 1974, it became the first temple built on the East Coast and is still one of the largest in the world.

Others from, if you will, the person that's living in the basement of their parents' house. I really don't need to worry about those folks. I remember, when I was running for governor in Massachusetts, my advisor, Mike Murphy, said to me, look, I'll help you in your campaign and you can watch TV has much as you'd like and see what's going on in the campaign, but you can't read the papers. And I said -- about yourself. I said, why is that? And he said, if you read an article about yourself, you will inevitably start in your next address addressing what was in that article. It may have been written by a 25-year-old young person, it may have been off the mark, but you're going to be influenced by it.
