The media business model, to be an eternal stirrer of [bleep]. Kids in the audience. They're like weird - they're like weird volunteer fireman who start fires so they can put them out. The media creates unrest so they can write about it later. And the angrier we feel toward our fellow Americans, the better the bottom line is for CNN and MSNBC and then get this, add one more problem. It's the Dems not Trump who are truly effing up.

That's pretty humiliating. But isn't that the point? The artist says quote, \"Here's what's complicated. We enjoy throwing the crumbs for Ivanka to vacuum. That is the icky truth at the center of the work. It's funny, it's pleasurable, it makes us feel powerful and we want to do it more.\" How edgy. How dangerous. How lame. Look, I'm not trying to censor art or anything, but artists about taking risks and that's about as risky as peanut butter.

The free speech watch group is noting the sexual harassment policy at the University of New Orleans. The very broadly worded harassment policy includes, quote, \"Sending suggestive or obscene letters, notes or invitations.\" Technically, that could mean a cheesy store bought Valentine card. Now you're going to get kicked out of school for sending someone a card? No, but if you're doing a bunch of other weird things, the school could add that love note to your pile of offenses. So choose wisely. In other words, don't send overly suggestive cards like these ones. These are not good. I just want to tell you, all right. Here is one, \"You have stolen my heart. So I stole your dog. Now, we are even, Doris.\" \"Happy Valentine's Day, My love. I have been living under your bed for three months.\" These are really terrible. Never send these out. Never send these out. \"Happy Valentine's Day. I've tried on all your underwear.\" Awful. These are the kinds of things. You should never send these things, America. \"You are so beautiful, or now anyway. Sadly, the inexorable process of aging affects all of us in a negative way.\" This one's very bad. \"You're the kind of girl I could take home to my mother. My mother's dead.\" I don't even know what that means. Maybe she's in a vase in the living room. All right, \"You brighten my day. You also make the voices stop. The voices that tell me to kill.\" These are terrible and very suggestive. \"Happy Valentine's Day. I got you flowers. Like us, they will die soon.\" Maybe that's one I should edit out. Anyway, this is my favorite. \"Roses are red, violets are blue. You will not ignore me.\" I had more. I had more, but you know what? I'll just stop there. Okay, I'll stop there. Those are suggestive cards. Dana, you should never get - - do you like Valentine's Day?"
