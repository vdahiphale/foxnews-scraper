      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” For months and months, all the little Democratic Party mouthpieces you see on television, which is pretty much all of them, lectured you about how there was absolutely no crisis on the Mexican border and you have to be some kind of white nationalist freak to think otherwise. Those caravans they told you were a racist mirage. Everything is fine, shut up and obey or we will kick you off YouTube. Now, suddenly you are not hearing many people say that. It's too obviously untrue. It's a lie too implausible even for cable news. Everyone knows our immigration system is a joke. All of Central America understands that.  Show up with a minor in tow and you are in. We can never make you leave. Thousands arrive every day to exploit our weakness now. Millions more are coming. It turns out the average Honduran migrant knows a lot more about our immigration system than the entire primetime lineup on CNN.  If there is at least one person that knows even less than your average cable news anchor, she is a new member of Congress, the loudest one. She still thinks the whole immigration question boils down to racism. If you are for borders, you are a racist, period.",

      "sentences": "Negativity. That's what the activist left now calls disagreement. They are not interested at all in what anyone outside their tiny little world has to say. Every day, you see Democratic presidential candidates endorsing some new policy that has pretty much zero public support, but it sounds like something woke baristas in Brooklyn would be excited about. Banning I.C.E., ignoring Federal immigration law, giving amnesty to millions. Decriminalizing illegal border crossings which is to say totally open borders. Anyone can come. When they get here, give them free stuff. Nobody really wants any of this even most of the people saying no, it wouldn't work.  The public would revolt if you tried it. If half of Guatemala moved here tomorrow, which is exactly what would happen, it wouldn't help anyone. This is all fantasy.   Countries have borders. That's what makes them countries. Someday, the AOC moment will pass. It's too stupid to continue. And at that point, sober Democrats will wake up and rejoin the adult conversation and progress. What do we want from our immigration system? Well, here are some of the questions they should have to answer when that happens. First and most obvious, how many immigrants should we admit every year? What's the ideal number? We currently take a little over a million every year, legally. Should we double that to over two million? How about 10 million immigrants a year? How about 20 million? Is there any number that's too high? And if so why?  While we are at it, what's the ideal population of the United States? Immigration effects population size more than any other factor. We're at about 325 million people in the United States today and that's a lot. Our highways are crumbling, many of our cities are painfully overcrowded. How big should we get? Four hundred million? Six hundred million? A billion people? And if you are pushing to increase the size of our population and they are, what's your plan for keeping our natural environment pristine?  Crowded countries are polluted. Every single one of them. Tell us why we should want that here? What sort of skills and education should we look for in immigrants? Not all immigrants are the same? Some start wildly successful companies. Many others go on food stamps. They are not interchangeable widgets, they are human beings. Who should we prefer? What's the ideal level of education an immigrant to this country should have?  Big business doesn't want you to ask this question, they like their immigrants low-skilled and cheap. Ocasio-Cortez does, too. But what happens when technology kills their jobs? And it will. All the major Democrats running for president take money from the technology barons, many of them support self-driving cars. So what do you do with hundreds of thousands of unemployment immigrant cab drivers? Do they all go on welfare? And speaking of, what sort of government services are immigrants entitled to exactly? Democrats promise universal healthcare. Do immigrants get that, too? Who pays for it? How many immigrants can our system support? Do we have enough doctors and nurses and hospitals to treat the number of immigrants we want to admit? Same question for schools?  The real answer is, of course, nobody knows. Because as of today, we have no idea how many immigrants live illegally in the United States. Shouldn't we find out before we make more plans? And once we do find out, what do we do with them? Who gets deported? Anyone? Or do all of them get to stay? What if the real number of people living here illegally is north of 25 million? And that's entirely possible. That's bigger than the population of 48 out of 50 states. It's enough to change this country completely and forever.   Do all of them get citizenship and voting rights? What about gun rights? And do they immediately start paying into the Reparations for Slavery Fund that Democrats are now promoting? How do you explain that to them? Can we watch that conversation? And finally what about America's ideals? Democrats are always talking about values when the subject of immigration comes up. They quote from the poem on the Statue of Liberty and tell you about their grandparents. Well, previous waves of immigrants were asked to buy into this country's most basic ideals -- religious pluralism, free speech, political freedom, equality under the law. Our schools made them learn English and tried to instill patriotism. We called it assimilation. We thought it was critical to our social cohesion. Are we still for that? Do we still think we have values to impart or do we imagine that huge groups of people with nothing in common can share the same country without fighting each other?  It's an important question -- maybe the most important question of all. We never hear anyone ask it. Anyone who dares ask it is banned from Twitter. Instead, you hear the endless drone of self-righteous children barking about racism. That's not enough. The decisions we make today about immigration are irreversible. It will help determine the health of the country we leave to our grandchildren. We should be a lot more serious than we are.  Enrique Acevedo is a Univision anchor and he joins us tonight. Enrique, thanks for coming on. You are relentlessly promoting immigration into the United States often on this show. Have you thought about these questions and what are the answers? What is the ideal number of immigrants you would say we should admit every year?",

      "sentences": "The 2020 Presidential Campaign is already well underway. On the Democratic side, there are dozens of candidates in the race and possibly dozens more to come. On the Republican side, there is just the incumbent President. Everyone assumes he wants to be reelected, most Presidents do. But what if Donald Trump had decided he has had enough? Too many investigations, too much nastiness, too few upsides. It wouldn't be a crazy conclusion. How would you like to spend your 70's locked in the White House?  So let's say Trump had decided he wants to lose in 2020 and get back to his old life? How would he do that? Let's see. He might start by proposing more than half a billion dollars in Medicare cuts. That's something that nobody outside the libertarian symposia circuit really wants to see, so you do that. Then he would slash funding for the e-verify program that would allow companies to keep hiring illegal alien labor in violation of a key campaign promise. After that, he would announce we're bringing in even more low- skilled workers that would push down the wages of the people who voted for him - the most vulnerable group in the country. Finally, he would release a bunch of drug dealers back on to the streets, right in the middle of the worst drug epidemic in history and he'd continue our pointless military intervention in Syria which in no way benefits the United States. If the President did all of that, the message would be very clear, he has no idea what he ran on in 2016, he just wants out. Well, let's say voters still didn't get the message. Maybe they were too distracted by the Russia hoax to notice. At that point you have to do something really extreme to get their attention, something so mindless and counterproductive that there is literally no way you could get reelected after doing it. You would raise gas taxes. And in fact, the administration is proposing just that. According to news reports, the White House is negotiating with Democrats to hike taxes on gasoline in order to fund, quote \"infrastructure.\" This is one of those ideas that everyone in Washington loves. It costs them nothing. They are too rich to care what gas costs and by the way they don't drive. But if you live outside the coastal cities and you're not rich, higher gas prices are a disaster. They hurt you immediately. That's always true. Anything that raises the price of gasoline whether it's the Green New Deal or some new tax scheme promoted by a fake conservative think tank, crushes the weakest in our society.  Normal people hate it. Many of those people voted for Donald Trump the first time. It's nuts. And it's not like there aren't other smarter less regressive options if you want to raise money, there are many of them. We could roll back some of those 2017 tax cuts which went overwhelmingly to high earners and big companies. We could tax the billions in remittance flowing from the United States to the rest of the world. Remember that idea? We could tax carried interest like the income it's so obviously is. We should do that anyway just on principle. We can even capital gains like we tax salaries. Mitt Romney might finally pay the same rate as your dentist and that would be satisfying. And then we could get creative. How about an 80 percent tax on all lobbying produced by former Members of Congress? That's a good one. How about an iPhone tax? Or how about a tough new tax on a trillion-dollar Seattle based internet retailer whose entire business model depends on using public roads to deliver their packages? Companies like that have put an awful lot of American businesses out of work. They clog our roads. Why aren't they paying for infrastructure? We could go on -- plenty of obvious ideas out there. Hiking taxes on working class rural people is not on the list. Unless you secretly want to retire early, in that case if you are really sick of the job, go with the gas tax. Democrats are united on one question. Climate change is bad, very bad. As bad as World War II. In fact, existentially bad. We will all die from it.",

Those caravans they told you were a racist mirage. Everything is fine, shut up and obey or we will kick you off YouTube. Now, suddenly you are not hearing many people say that. It's too obviously untrue. It's a lie too implausible even for cable news. Everyone knows our immigration system is a joke. All of Central America understands that. Show up with a minor in tow and you are in. We can never make you leave. Thousands arrive every day to exploit our weakness now. Millions more are coming. It turns out the average Honduran migrant knows a lot more about our immigration system than the entire primetime lineup on CNN. If there is at least one person that knows even less than your average cable news anchor, she is a new member of Congress, the loudest one. She still thinks the whole immigration question boils down to racism. If you are for borders, you are a racist, period."

If you are on the side of good, which is Ocasio-Cortez's side, of course you have endless leeway. You don't have to know what you are talking about.

      "utterance": "Negativity. That's what the activist left now calls disagreement. They are not interested at all in what anyone outside their tiny little world has to say. Every day, you see Democratic presidential candidates endorsing some new policy that has pretty much zero public support, but it sounds like something woke baristas in Brooklyn would be excited about. Banning I.C.E., ignoring Federal immigration law, giving amnesty to millions. Decriminalizing illegal border crossings which is to say totally open borders. Anyone can come. When they get here, give them free stuff. Nobody really wants any of this even most of the people saying no, it wouldn't work. The public would revolt if you tried it. If half of Guatemala moved here tomorrow, which is exactly what would happen, it wouldn't help anyone. This is all fantasy. Countries have borders. That's what makes them countries. Someday, the AOC moment will pass. It's too stupid to continue. And at that point, sober Democrats will wake up and rejoin the adult conversation and progress. What do we want from our immigration system? Well, here are some of the questions they should have to answer when that happens. First and most obvious, how many immigrants should we admit every year? What's the ideal number? We currently take a little over a million every year, legally. Should we double that to over two million? How about 10 million immigrants a year? How about 20 million? Is there any number that's too high? And if so why? While we are at it, what's the ideal population of the United States? Immigration effects population size more than any other factor. We're at about 325 million people in the United States today and that's a lot. Our highways are crumbling, many of our cities are painfully overcrowded. How big should we get? Four hundred million? Six hundred million? A billion people? And if you are pushing to increase the size of our population and they are, what's your plan for keeping our natural environment pristine? Crowded countries are polluted. Every single one of them. Tell us why we should want that here? What sort of skills and education should we look for in immigrants? Not all immigrants are the same? Some start wildly successful companies. Many others go on food stamps. They are not interchangeable widgets, they are human beings. Who should we prefer? What's the ideal level of education an immigrant to this country should have? Big business doesn't want you to ask this question, they like their immigrants low-skilled and cheap. Ocasio-Cortez does, too. But what happens when technology kills their jobs? And it will. All the major Democrats running for president take money from the technology barons, many of them support self-driving cars. So what do you do with hundreds of thousands of unemployment immigrant cab drivers? Do they all go on welfare? And speaking of, what sort of government services are immigrants entitled to exactly? Democrats promise universal healthcare. Do immigrants get that, too? Who pays for it? How many immigrants can our system support? Do we have enough doctors and nurses and hospitals to treat the number of immigrants we want to admit? Same question for schools? The real answer is, of course, nobody knows. Because as of today, we have no idea how many immigrants live illegally in the United States. Shouldn't we find out before we make more plans? And once we do find out, what do we do with them? Who gets deported? Anyone? Or do all of them get to stay? What if the real number of people living here illegally is north of 25 million? And that's entirely possible. That's bigger than the population of 48 out of 50 states. It's enough to change this country completely and forever. Do all of them get citizenship and voting rights? What about gun rights? And do they immediately start paying into the Reparations for Slavery Fund that Democrats are now promoting? How do you explain that to them? Can we watch that conversation? And finally what about America's ideals? Democrats are always talking about values when the subject of immigration comes up. They quote from the poem on the Statue of Liberty and tell you about their grandparents. Well, previous waves of immigrants were asked to buy into this country's most basic ideals -- religious pluralism, free speech, political freedom, equality under the law. Our schools made them learn English and tried to instill patriotism. We called it assimilation. We thought it was critical to our social cohesion. Are we still for that? Do we still think we have values to impart or do we imagine that huge groups of people with nothing in common can share the same country without fighting each other? It's an important question -- maybe the most important question of all. We never hear anyone ask it. Anyone who dares ask it is banned from Twitter. Instead, you hear the endless drone of self-righteous children barking about racism. That's not enough. The decisions we make today about immigration are irreversible. It will help determine the health of the country we leave to our grandchildren. We should be a lot more serious than we are. Enrique Acevedo is a Univision anchor and he joins us tonight. Enrique, thanks for coming on. You are relentlessly promoting immigration into the United States often on this show. Have you thought about these questions and what are the answers? What is the ideal number of immigrants you would say we should admit every year?"

They go to Canada. They work for six to eight months. Canada -- the government establishes how many it needs. They have, you know, full rights in terms of the benefits they have as workers, and they have an important service to the Canadian economy. Once they are done with their job after six to eight months they get to go back to Mexico and they go back to their families and so that's how immigration looks like in a country that is not completely hyperpolarized and stuck in the issue of immigration between open border and serve their economies."

And people want to talk about the number back in the 2000s -- 1.5 million. It's the demographics, Tucker. Back then, 90 percent, the overwhelming majority were Mexican males and we were deporting them. Now, it is family units and because of our -- and unaccompanied minors -- and because our laws are broke, we are allowing them in. You said it right, grab a kid and set one foot on American soil, you are in -- sixty five percent. So we are going to reach a million this year. That means we are going to allow 650,000 into this country most of which we don't know who they are and we will never hear from them again."

And with all due respect to your previous guest, first of all, we -- this country is the most generous country in the world. We let a million people in legally last year.

      "utterance": "The 2020 Presidential Campaign is already well underway. On the Democratic side, there are dozens of candidates in the race and possibly dozens more to come. On the Republican side, there is just the incumbent President. Everyone assumes he wants to be reelected, most Presidents do. But what if Donald Trump had decided he has had enough? Too many investigations, too much nastiness, too few upsides. It wouldn't be a crazy conclusion. How would you like to spend your 70's locked in the White House? So let's say Trump had decided he wants to lose in 2020 and get back to his old life? How would he do that? Let's see. He might start by proposing more than half a billion dollars in Medicare cuts. That's something that nobody outside the libertarian symposia circuit really wants to see, so you do that. Then he would slash funding for the e-verify program that would allow companies to keep hiring illegal alien labor in violation of a key campaign promise. After that, he would announce we're bringing in even more low- skilled workers that would push down the wages of the people who voted for him - the most vulnerable group in the country. Finally, he would release a bunch of drug dealers back on to the streets, right in the middle of the worst drug epidemic in history and he'd continue our pointless military intervention in Syria which in no way benefits the United States. If the President did all of that, the message would be very clear, he has no idea what he ran on in 2016, he just wants out. Well, let's say voters still didn't get the message. Maybe they were too distracted by the Russia hoax to notice. At that point you have to do something really extreme to get their attention, something so mindless and counterproductive that there is literally no way you could get reelected after doing it. You would raise gas taxes. And in fact, the administration is proposing just that. According to news reports, the White House is negotiating with Democrats to hike taxes on gasoline in order to fund, quote \"infrastructure.\" This is one of those ideas that everyone in Washington loves. It costs them nothing. They are too rich to care what gas costs and by the way they don't drive. But if you live outside the coastal cities and you're not rich, higher gas prices are a disaster. They hurt you immediately. That's always true. Anything that raises the price of gasoline whether it's the Green New Deal or some new tax scheme promoted by a fake conservative think tank, crushes the weakest in our society. Normal people hate it. Many of those people voted for Donald Trump the first time. It's nuts. And it's not like there aren't other smarter less regressive options if you want to raise money, there are many of them. We could roll back some of those 2017 tax cuts which went overwhelmingly to high earners and big companies. We could tax the billions in remittance flowing from the United States to the rest of the world. Remember that idea? We could tax carried interest like the income it's so obviously is. We should do that anyway just on principle. We can even capital gains like we tax salaries. Mitt Romney might finally pay the same rate as your dentist and that would be satisfying. And then we could get creative. How about an 80 percent tax on all lobbying produced by former Members of Congress? That's a good one. How about an iPhone tax? Or how about a tough new tax on a trillion-dollar Seattle based internet retailer whose entire business model depends on using public roads to deliver their packages? Companies like that have put an awful lot of American businesses out of work. They clog our roads. Why aren't they paying for infrastructure? We could go on -- plenty of obvious ideas out there. Hiking taxes on working class rural people is not on the list. Unless you secretly want to retire early, in that case if you are really sick of the job, go with the gas tax. Democrats are united on one question. Climate change is bad, very bad. As bad as World War II. In fact, existentially bad. We will all die from it."

It's almost impossible to tell in fact, I think this goes back to -- I think the important point here is toxic masculinity. They are saying that they did a survey here. This is the kind of hard core science behind it in which they gave someone a Walmart gift card and it was pink and had lots of flowery patents on it, so it looked a bit girly, it looked a bit sissy, it looked a bit milk toast panty waist. So the guy given this gift card went out and bought a lot of very macho masculine things that melt the polar ice caps. Whereas, if you give him something, if you give him -- he is so impressionable, this toxically masculine male that if you give him a masculine type card, he just thinks, \"Oh, that's really nice,\" and he goes out and he buys as Sierra Club tote bag and saves the planet. This is the kind of social science that the higher education institutions of America are spending a fortune investigating."

The big banks are doing a survey where, in fact, you decide that what's heating up the planet is men. A couple of weeks ago on this show, Tucker, you had a report that they were introducing vegetarian days in the New York City schools because red meat has toxically masculine overtones. And, basically, if you look at half the stories you cover every night, toxic masculinity is the sort of underlying subtext of it. So, basically, when Jerry Brown says we all have to be worried because insects will spread, I mean, these guys are literally predicting a plague of locusts now and the only good thing about the plague of locusts is that they will kill all the men if Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's flatulent Holsteins don't get us first.

They filed a FOIA request to get CNN's e- mails to the FBI on the day before the arrest, but the FBI shut them down. They covered for their allies at CNN. We mentioned this on last night's show and CNN went ballistic. They're guilty as hell and therefore highly defensive. You're liars, they screamed. Well, let's see. Why doesn't CNN push the FBI to abide by a legal Freedom of Information Act request and release the relevant e-mails, add some facts to this debate -- it's called reporting. We called CNN to see if they planned to do that. Of course they never responded to us because they're lying. For eight years, Joe Biden served dutifully as Barack Obama's Vice President. By all accounts did a good job. According to Obama, it was more than a political arrangement, it was a deep and personal friendship. Two years ago, he surprised Joe Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom and he described the Vice President as both a trusted elder statesman and one of his closest friends."

So, all told, that's a pretty remarkable legacy, an amazing career in public service, it is as Joe once said, a big deal."

The mob wants him out of the race for the sin of hugging people. If there's anybody who could halt this scandal immediately, it's President Obama, with a single statement. Nobody else on the left commands as much respect as he does. So what has President Obama done to help his old friend? Well, it's not about him, so nothing, nothing at all. Dana Perino hosts \"The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino,\" here on Fox. One of the great people in the building, we'll just say the greatest person in the building and she joins us tonight."

So, Biden served Obama in the most self-effacing possible way and took a lot of patronizing abuse from Obama staffers I happen to know in the White House and he put up with it. Now he needs Obama only to issue a two-line statement saying, \"He's not a molester, he's just hugging people,\" and Obama won't do that. Why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, one, I think that Obama -- I think Obama is doing this right. I think he has only one chance to weigh in either as the kingmaker in his primary or to step in at the last moment, if there's a real nasty primary at the end, he only has one shot to do that. Biden has to prove that he can win this on his own. Imagine if Obama had to come out and try to save him now. Besides hundreds of more women could come out and say they have similar experiences with Joe Biden. He's been hugging people his whole life, is what he says. So I think that President Obama is doing the exact right thing. Now, it's possible that Michelle Obama who is on an extended book tour, maybe she gets asked about this on the trail, and if she says something, that could help him, but you know, Stacey Abrams, the woman who will not concede that she lost in the Georgia election, she kind of threw Joe Biden a lifeline today. She said, \"We do not need our candidates to be perfect. This cannot be -- perfection cannot be a litmus test.\" This helps Joe Biden. Besides, for all those other candidates, they don't really need to commit murder when your opponent is committing political suicide."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "It would be very hard for me not say something, but I wasn't President. I honestly think that the best thing that Obama can do is stay out of this until he is needed possibly at the last moment or until there's a nominee. Besides, what if Obama comes out and says this -- it chills everybody else. And also, Joe Biden doesn't even actually have a campaign yet. So, I wouldn't do it. And that's Joe Biden's fault. I mean, his timing is his timing. But I think Obama is doing the right thing."
