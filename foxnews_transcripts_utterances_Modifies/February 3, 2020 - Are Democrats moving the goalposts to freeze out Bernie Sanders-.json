      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Good show as always, thank you. Tonight -- welcome to \"Hannity\" -- we have breaking news on multiple fronts. We've got it all covered and, yes, in fact, we could very well have the results from the Iowa caucus within this hour.  And get this -- according to a source on the ground, underreported story, the Republican caucus, remember, it is totally uncontested. It is, in fact, packed with voters showing their support tonight for the president.  And also tonight, we will have more of my exclusive interview with the president from yesterday's Super Bowl and his powerful campaign ads that did air during the game. What a game.  Also, thankfully, the Schumer-Schiff sham show is officially done, officially imploded. The president will now be acquitted, vindicated by Wednesday. But, first, I want to address some news that's very difficult for me personally and for so many others across the country. We got the news today from a very stoic radio legend, Rush Limbaugh, a friend of this broadcast. He's been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. We are all praying for the man who has literally paved the way for all of us, especially me, everybody in talk radio.  My friend Neal Boortz called him the Babe Ruth of conservative talk radio - - a pitch-perfect description. And without a doubt, he has made it possible for all of us that do what we do, give opinion. He paved the way. He cut the forest, made the path and it was hard. He did it, and we've all benefited as a result, and the country as well. He's educated us. He has entertained us. He's been fighting for us day after day.  He said he has advanced the cause of patriotism, what our Constitution is, family, faith, life, with such a powerful approach no one can or will match. Now, by the way, Rush is in the fight of his life but that's who Rush is. And like always, he's tackling it head-on -- stoic, courageous, resolve, and he's graced the airwaves for over three decades.   Take a look from today's announcement.",

Everything we all hold so dear. And we -- by the way, we expect them back on the air on Thursday, he said. We'll have more later.  Now, those values are not threatened by an increasingly radical extreme Democratic socialist party. According to many of the latest polls, a devout 70-year-old socialist, we may know this hour, surging in the polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. In a few minutes, we will learn if, in fact, Bernie Sanders is able to pull out a victory in the Iowa caucus.   Joining us now with the very latest, he's in Des Moines, our very own Bill Hemmer, who I might want to add, has been like killing it in the ratings, because -- just because we're friends.

I'll tell you, it's too early to tell to really to get a firm idea of what's happening inside these precincts all across the state. Turnout appears to be pretty good. Remember, the record was 2008 with 240,000. We'll see whether we get to that 240,000 or whether we get about it.  Sean, I want to show you something from 2016. You just mentioned Bernie Sanders a moment to go. What is Sanders thinking about tonight? This is how he lost, this is by a nose four years against Hillary Clinton.  If Bernie is going to have a good night tonight, he's got to do well in places like Johnson County. That's out here in eastern Iowa, a university town, a big winner four years ago. Twenty points by Hillary Clinton. Sanders is -- he's going to do well in Johnson County. He's going to do well in Story County, just north of Des Moines, Iowa State University. They run up some numbers there. Could it be a 20-point margin like it was four years ago? We'll see. And the field is so much bigger than it was back in 2016.  Conversely, Joe Biden is going to pop down to Des Moines -- in Polk County, where we're located right now. Hillary Clinton voters, where did they go this time around? Where did they disperse among this wide field? That's some of the drama we're waiting play out so far this evening.   I'll show you this, Sean, here, on the calendar, it's the first Monday in February, right? It's Super Bowl Monday, Iowa caucus. The state will run its way to South Carolina toward the end of the month, and then we'll move into Super Tuesday, the first Tuesday in March. But tonight, in Iowa, the delegates are 41 at stake across the 99 counties and we'll see the -- we'll see the map start to fill in momentarily. A little too early but it will give us a little bit of time, maybe the next 15, 30 minutes or so. We should have a better gauge as to where Iowa is going tonight during this long campaign season. Sean, nice to see you at the Super Bowl and I will see you real soon back in New York.  Back to you now (ph).",

One of our team members is downstairs, said there are 20 people waiting to come in. But, of course, many people who will be here tonight are still at their caucus locations.  And it's really interesting. The campaign, big national campaign with very strong poll numbers against rivals and who looked competitive against President Trump, they are finding out what is happening in Iowa tonight, just like so many of us without access to sophisticated internal polling.  I was just outside in the lobby area and I saw a campaign manager for the Biden team, Greg Schultz, and he just got in the text of a photo from one location in Altoona that was good for their campaign. And he was going around showing some of the staff because to this point, it's been just press and Biden campaign staff. So, they don't know anything yet but we understand the V.P. is watching somewhere in Des Moines with his family and he should be here on location within about an hour. So, hopefully, depending on how things shake out, we'll be able to ask him what he thinks -- Sean.",

Sanders came so close to winning this state in 2016. He only lost to Hillary Clinton in the caucuses by 0.3 of a percentage point. There's a lot of existing excitement for his campaign. They really drew on those people to carry the senator to that campaign while he was stuck in Washington.  I spoke to his wife, Dr. Jane Sanders. She said, last election, they spent a lot of time trying to tell people who the senator was and familiarize people with his ideas. But this time around, those ideas are more mainstream. It's less about trying to win people over to their side than to really energize a groundswell of populist support that, you know, we saw work with President Trump in 2016. He was the antiestablishment candidate and Sanders is really trying to pitch himself in that same way, as someone outside the box who is consistently had different ideas and wanted to overhaul the system and helping more people come out for him this cycle than happened in 2016.  Of course, we'll wait on those numbers -- Sean.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Sean. Well, this is interesting because we talked in nearly 3,000 caucusgoers about how they feel about all of these things, the issues, the candidates, and we're starting to get some more information. Here's a look from FOX News voter analysis about why this is such a close battle. So, one thing is -- one way to think about this is in terms of ideological lanes. We asked folks if you're in the moderate lane, that's what you consider yourself, these are the voters among Iowa Democratic caucusgoers. They split three ways between Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar. We got four actually here, and Warren.   But let's look at the liberal lane. It's a lot smaller in Iowa. Among those voters who say, hey, I'm a liberal caucusgoers, it's between Sanders and Warren. As you would expect, they are duking it out. We have got that -- a tight race tonight. So, consider this -- nearly six in ten of those that we talked to going into the caucuses think it would be harder to beat President Trump in November if the Democratic nominee has strongly liberal views. That's making them a little bit more wary about a Biden or Warren candidacy, or, excuse me, Sanders or Warren candidacy. So, that's the internal struggle we've been seeing with the party, is do they go with the more moderate person who they think is a better chance of the general or do they go with somebody who's going to shake up the entire system, someone like Sanders, someone like Warren who will really change things in a strong way. We'll see who wins out tonight. And, of course, it's just the first state.   But as we get numbers, Sean, we'll keep you updated.",

We'll bring them to you as they become available, which could actually happen in just a few minutes.  Whatever happens in Iowa, in 274 days, you, the American people, you will render what is the ultimate verdict. President Trump, he will be acquitted on Wednesday and the latest impeachment witch hunt which will be dead. The power to decide our future now rests squarely in your hands ultimately, the ultimate jury. You can in 274 days, as I've been saying, shock the world again. And the Democratic Party, state-run media, the mob there, they have nothing to offer except what they have given us for three years -- conspiracy theories, lies, smears, slander, hoax after hoax, what is an unhealthy obsession with Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, impeach, impeach.  And meanwhile, the Democratic primary is shaping up to get to be yet another massive dumpster fire like it was in 2016. Look at this, socialist Bernie Sanders has surged into the lead and the Democratic establishment in a state of shock and panic. You have those associated and friendly with Barack Obama, with the Clintons, the so-called mainstream Democrats everywhere seem to hate Bernie Sanders.  You have over there, Chris Matthews and others on my conspiracy theory channel, MSDNC, openly worrying now that no Democrat can beat Trump. John Kerry reportedly overheard telling someone that Bernie Sanders could take down the entire Democratic Party. He first said expletive on Twitter and then he deleted the expletive.  Tom Brokaw thinks it would be really hard for the people to vote for Bernie's brand of socialism. Tom, with all due respect, little secret here. They are all radical extreme socialist. Read the New Green Deal. And you might want to look at Medicare for All and how did that Obamacare thing work out?  2016, Democrats, well, they did their best to rig the primary against Bernie Sanders. In fact, remember, interim DNC chair Donna Brazile, discovered that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had, in fact, been working together to defeat Bernie throughout the primary. In other words, the system was rigged. According to Brazile, quote, she had exerted this control of the party long before she became its nominee, meaning Hillary Clinton. And now, history seems to be repeating itself. The DNC is changing the rules so that one of Bernie's top challengers may be Bloomberg or whoever else, can then take the debate stage without meeting requirements. Bloomberg, meanwhile, is probably one of the dullest human beings alive. Best known for being a 12-year caretaker of Mayor Giuliani's accomplishments in New York and lecturing New Yorkers on how much so they can drink and how much salt they can use. He's a strong advocate, by the way, of Giuliani's successful stop and frisk policy for 12 years but until recently. Here we are, seven years after that, now, Bloomberg, yes, identity politics in full play running for president had a sudden change of heart, and he has to play nice with the identity politics platform, so he's pretending to be devastated that for 12 years and seven years after that that he ever supported stop and frisk.  While Bloomberg is an obvious hypocrite, Bernie's long-held views are downright scary. That is true.  Now, here's what the president had to stay in our exclusive interview. Take a look.",

He now has a plan to nationalize the entire energy industry. We just became energy independent for the first time in 75 years, the lifeblood of the world's economy. He just unveiled a $16 trillion climate change plan. Now, keep in mind the total budget, we only taken about $4 trillion a year. That's every penny. We'll have nothing left over for things like oh, defense. And, by the way, like any good socialist, Bernie doesn't think any of these rules apply to him. Look at this report. Sanders now leads the 2020 field of Democratic radical socialist, environmentalist, new green dealist, in private jets spending. Now, let's just talk about one of Bernie's, well, his surge. He's probably the only Democrat running who actually excites the base.  We know that quid pro quo Joe has inspired virtually no one. He got 75 people in Iowa recently at an event. He is struggling to raise money. He's events barely draw a few dozen people. His biggest cause for concern surrounds a scandal that won't go away, the biggest loser in this latest hoax. Well, it boomeranged back on quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter and Joel leveraging our money, yes, a billion taxpayer dollars. You're not getting it must you fire the prosecutor. You got six hours so his son can - - keeps getting 83 grand a month. Most Americans, family of four, average about $54,000 a year, in case you didn't know.  Zero experience Hunter, no experience in oil, gas, energy or Ukraine. Why would any company pay somebody like that -- oh, let's see, millions and millions of dollars? It's now clear Hunter wasn't telling experience. He was selling access and it looks it's paid off, because in 2015, then Vice President Biden threatened to withhold that billion. Guess what, son of a B, they fire the prosecutor. And he bragged about it. Now, he's not breaking any more. In fact he's getting quite angry and unhinged whenever the subject even comes up, like it did with Savannah Guthrie. Take a look.",

There is a marvelous split screen going on here between democracy in action in Iowa where hundreds of thousands of people will decide who's going to lead the Democratic Party and was happening in Washington where 100 people might overturn a decision of the American people. This in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina is how it's exactly supposed to work. Let the American people decide these things. That contrast jumps out at me as I am here in Iowa.

So, we are still waiting for that before the crowds start to gather here. As you know, Elizabeth Warren has often bragged that she was the first candidate to have organizational boots on the ground in Iowa. She is really trying to go toward the same progressive base that Bernie Sanders is, and for a while there, she did see her star rise, especially at the end of summer, beginning of fall. That's when she really peaked in the polls and has really lost traction ever since, and is now in some of the larger polls, is actually trailing third and fourth.

Now, White House counsel Pat Cipollone urged senators to reject both articles. Cipollone said it was time to end what he termed the era of impeachment. Two developments tonight. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski was one Republican that some observers thought could vote to convict Mr. Trump. Murkowski said few on both sides approached impeachment, quote, with a clear and open mind. She declared that she would not vote to convict. And Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin didn't reveal how he would vote today but Manchin introduced a resolution to censure President Trump. In his resolution, Manchin says that the president, quote, abuse the trust of the American people, says his behavior was unacceptable and Mr. Trump brought dishonor to himself. It's unclear if the Senate will consider Manchin's plan. Now, it takes 67 votes to remove a president.

We've got it all covered and, yes, in fact, we could very well have the results from the Iowa caucus within this hour. And get this -- according to a source on the ground, underreported story, the Republican caucus, remember, it is totally uncontested. It is, in fact, packed with voters showing their support tonight for the president. And also tonight, we will have more of my exclusive interview with the president from yesterday's Super Bowl and his powerful campaign ads that did air during the game. What a game. Also, thankfully, the Schumer-Schiff sham show is officially done, officially imploded. The president will now be acquitted, vindicated by Wednesday. But, first, I want to address some news that's very difficult for me personally and for so many others across the country. We got the news today from a very stoic radio legend, Rush Limbaugh, a friend of this broadcast. He's been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. We are all praying for the man who has literally paved the way for all of us, especially me, everybody in talk radio. My friend Neal Boortz called him the Babe Ruth of conservative talk radio - - a pitch-perfect description. And without a doubt, he has made it possible for all of us that do what we do, give opinion. He paved the way. He cut the forest, made the path and it was hard. He did it, and we've all benefited as a result, and the country as well. He's educated us. He has entertained us. He's been fighting for us day after day. He said he has advanced the cause of patriotism, what our Constitution is, family, faith, life, with such a powerful approach no one can or will match. Now, by the way, Rush is in the fight of his life but that's who Rush is. And like always, he's tackling it head-on -- stoic, courageous, resolve, and he's graced the airwaves for over three decades. Take a look from today's announcement."

Everything we all hold so dear. And we -- by the way, we expect them back on the air on Thursday, he said. We'll have more later. Now, those values are not threatened by an increasingly radical extreme Democratic socialist party. According to many of the latest polls, a devout 70-year-old socialist, we may know this hour, surging in the polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. In a few minutes, we will learn if, in fact, Bernie Sanders is able to pull out a victory in the Iowa caucus. Joining us now with the very latest, he's in Des Moines, our very own Bill Hemmer, who I might want to add, has been like killing it in the ratings, because -- just because we're friends.

I'll tell you, it's too early to tell to really to get a firm idea of what's happening inside these precincts all across the state. Turnout appears to be pretty good. Remember, the record was 2008 with 240,000. We'll see whether we get to that 240,000 or whether we get about it. Sean, I want to show you something from 2016. You just mentioned Bernie Sanders a moment to go. What is Sanders thinking about tonight? This is how he lost, this is by a nose four years against Hillary Clinton. If Bernie is going to have a good night tonight, he's got to do well in places like Johnson County. That's out here in eastern Iowa, a university town, a big winner four years ago. Twenty points by Hillary Clinton. Sanders is -- he's going to do well in Johnson County. He's going to do well in Story County, just north of Des Moines, Iowa State University. They run up some numbers there. Could it be a 20-point margin like it was four years ago? We'll see. And the field is so much bigger than it was back in 2016. Conversely, Joe Biden is going to pop down to Des Moines -- in Polk County, where we're located right now. Hillary Clinton voters, where did they go this time around? Where did they disperse among this wide field? That's some of the drama we're waiting play out so far this evening. I'll show you this, Sean, here, on the calendar, it's the first Monday in February, right? It's Super Bowl Monday, Iowa caucus. The state will run its way to South Carolina toward the end of the month, and then we'll move into Super Tuesday, the first Tuesday in March. But tonight, in Iowa, the delegates are 41 at stake across the 99 counties and we'll see the -- we'll see the map start to fill in momentarily. A little too early but it will give us a little bit of time, maybe the next 15, 30 minutes or so. We should have a better gauge as to where Iowa is going tonight during this long campaign season. Sean, nice to see you at the Super Bowl and I will see you real soon back in New York. Back to you now (ph)."

One of our team members is downstairs, said there are 20 people waiting to come in. But, of course, many people who will be here tonight are still at their caucus locations. And it's really interesting. The campaign, big national campaign with very strong poll numbers against rivals and who looked competitive against President Trump, they are finding out what is happening in Iowa tonight, just like so many of us without access to sophisticated internal polling. I was just outside in the lobby area and I saw a campaign manager for the Biden team, Greg Schultz, and he just got in the text of a photo from one location in Altoona that was good for their campaign. And he was going around showing some of the staff because to this point, it's been just press and Biden campaign staff. So, they don't know anything yet but we understand the V.P. is watching somewhere in Des Moines with his family and he should be here on location within about an hour. So, hopefully, depending on how things shake out, we'll be able to ask him what he thinks -- Sean."

Sanders came so close to winning this state in 2016. He only lost to Hillary Clinton in the caucuses by 0.3 of a percentage point. There's a lot of existing excitement for his campaign. They really drew on those people to carry the senator to that campaign while he was stuck in Washington. I spoke to his wife, Dr. Jane Sanders. She said, last election, they spent a lot of time trying to tell people who the senator was and familiarize people with his ideas. But this time around, those ideas are more mainstream. It's less about trying to win people over to their side than to really energize a groundswell of populist support that, you know, we saw work with President Trump in 2016. He was the antiestablishment candidate and Sanders is really trying to pitch himself in that same way, as someone outside the box who is consistently had different ideas and wanted to overhaul the system and helping more people come out for him this cycle than happened in 2016. Of course, we'll wait on those numbers -- Sean."

    {
      "speaker": "SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Hey, Sean. Well, this is interesting because we talked in nearly 3,000 caucusgoers about how they feel about all of these things, the issues, the candidates, and we're starting to get some more information. Here's a look from FOX News voter analysis about why this is such a close battle. So, one thing is -- one way to think about this is in terms of ideological lanes. We asked folks if you're in the moderate lane, that's what you consider yourself, these are the voters among Iowa Democratic caucusgoers. They split three ways between Biden, Buttigieg, Klobuchar. We got four actually here, and Warren. But let's look at the liberal lane. It's a lot smaller in Iowa. Among those voters who say, hey, I'm a liberal caucusgoers, it's between Sanders and Warren. As you would expect, they are duking it out. We have got that -- a tight race tonight. So, consider this -- nearly six in ten of those that we talked to going into the caucuses think it would be harder to beat President Trump in November if the Democratic nominee has strongly liberal views. That's making them a little bit more wary about a Biden or Warren candidacy, or, excuse me, Sanders or Warren candidacy. So, that's the internal struggle we've been seeing with the party, is do they go with the more moderate person who they think is a better chance of the general or do they go with somebody who's going to shake up the entire system, someone like Sanders, someone like Warren who will really change things in a strong way. We'll see who wins out tonight. And, of course, it's just the first state. But as we get numbers, Sean, we'll keep you updated."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Shannon Bream, we'll be checking in. Also throughout the night, we'll continue to monitor all these results throughout Iowa. We'll bring them to you as they become available, which could actually happen in just a few minutes. Whatever happens in Iowa, in 274 days, you, the American people, you will render what is the ultimate verdict. President Trump, he will be acquitted on Wednesday and the latest impeachment witch hunt which will be dead. The power to decide our future now rests squarely in your hands ultimately, the ultimate jury. You can in 274 days, as I've been saying, shock the world again. And the Democratic Party, state-run media, the mob there, they have nothing to offer except what they have given us for three years -- conspiracy theories, lies, smears, slander, hoax after hoax, what is an unhealthy obsession with Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, impeach, impeach. And meanwhile, the Democratic primary is shaping up to get to be yet another massive dumpster fire like it was in 2016. Look at this, socialist Bernie Sanders has surged into the lead and the Democratic establishment in a state of shock and panic. You have those associated and friendly with Barack Obama, with the Clintons, the so-called mainstream Democrats everywhere seem to hate Bernie Sanders. You have over there, Chris Matthews and others on my conspiracy theory channel, MSDNC, openly worrying now that no Democrat can beat Trump. John Kerry reportedly overheard telling someone that Bernie Sanders could take down the entire Democratic Party. He first said expletive on Twitter and then he deleted the expletive. Tom Brokaw thinks it would be really hard for the people to vote for Bernie's brand of socialism. Tom, with all due respect, little secret here. They are all radical extreme socialist. Read the New Green Deal. And you might want to look at Medicare for All and how did that Obamacare thing work out? 2016, Democrats, well, they did their best to rig the primary against Bernie Sanders. In fact, remember, interim DNC chair Donna Brazile, discovered that the Clinton campaign and the DNC had, in fact, been working together to defeat Bernie throughout the primary. In other words, the system was rigged. According to Brazile, quote, she had exerted this control of the party long before she became its nominee, meaning Hillary Clinton. And now, history seems to be repeating itself. The DNC is changing the rules so that one of Bernie's top challengers may be Bloomberg or whoever else, can then take the debate stage without meeting requirements. Bloomberg, meanwhile, is probably one of the dullest human beings alive. Best known for being a 12-year caretaker of Mayor Giuliani's accomplishments in New York and lecturing New Yorkers on how much so they can drink and how much salt they can use. He's a strong advocate, by the way, of Giuliani's successful stop and frisk policy for 12 years but until recently. Here we are, seven years after that, now, Bloomberg, yes, identity politics in full play running for president had a sudden change of heart, and he has to play nice with the identity politics platform, so he's pretending to be devastated that for 12 years and seven years after that that he ever supported stop and frisk. While Bloomberg is an obvious hypocrite, Bernie's long-held views are downright scary. That is true. Now, here's what the president had to stay in our exclusive interview. Take a look."

He now has a plan to nationalize the entire energy industry. We just became energy independent for the first time in 75 years, the lifeblood of the world's economy. He just unveiled a $16 trillion climate change plan. Now, keep in mind the total budget, we only taken about $4 trillion a year. That's every penny. We'll have nothing left over for things like oh, defense. And, by the way, like any good socialist, Bernie doesn't think any of these rules apply to him. Look at this report. Sanders now leads the 2020 field of Democratic radical socialist, environmentalist, new green dealist, in private jets spending. Now, let's just talk about one of Bernie's, well, his surge. He's probably the only Democrat running who actually excites the base. We know that quid pro quo Joe has inspired virtually no one. He got 75 people in Iowa recently at an event. He is struggling to raise money. He's events barely draw a few dozen people. His biggest cause for concern surrounds a scandal that won't go away, the biggest loser in this latest hoax. Well, it boomeranged back on quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter and Joel leveraging our money, yes, a billion taxpayer dollars. You're not getting it must you fire the prosecutor. You got six hours so his son can - - keeps getting 83 grand a month. Most Americans, family of four, average about $54,000 a year, in case you didn't know. Zero experience Hunter, no experience in oil, gas, energy or Ukraine. Why would any company pay somebody like that -- oh, let's see, millions and millions of dollars? It's now clear Hunter wasn't telling experience. He was selling access and it looks it's paid off, because in 2015, then Vice President Biden threatened to withhold that billion. Guess what, son of a B, they fire the prosecutor. And he bragged about it. Now, he's not breaking any more. In fact he's getting quite angry and unhinged whenever the subject even comes up, like it did with Savannah Guthrie. Take a look."

Voters have every reason not to trust him and, by the way, his frontrunner status is in jeopardy tonight.

They've had to draw resources from other places and try to put it into Iowa. He may be calling his son Hunter and borrowing money from him to fund his campaign pretty soon if he doesn't have a big showing tonight.

So, that fissure is still there and it can pop up again. Sean, let me make one other broader point. There is a marvelous split screen going on here between democracy in action in Iowa where hundreds of thousands of people will decide who's going to lead the Democratic Party and was happening in Washington where 100 people might overturn a decision of the American people. This in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina is how it's exactly supposed to work. Let the American people decide these things. That contrast jumps out at me as I am here in Iowa.

The most excitement we've seen is that they brought food to feed the media and some of the staff members here, and that's because all of those supporters are still of those caucuses that been going on for the last 90 minutes, they have to go to that first-round and in that second round, see if they can do any more convincing to get people in Warren's corner if she wasn't their first choice. So, we are still waiting for that before the crowds start to gather here. As you know, Elizabeth Warren has often bragged that she was the first candidate to have organizational boots on the ground in Iowa. She is really trying to go toward the same progressive base that Bernie Sanders is, and for a while there, she did see her star rise, especially at the end of summer, beginning of fall. That's when she really peaked in the polls and has really lost traction ever since, and is now in some of the larger polls, is actually trailing third and fourth. So, Sean, we will be awaiting those results, just like you. We are hearing anecdotally that turnout is pretty high right now. So, it could be a while until we have some official results -- Sean."

His communications director Liz Smith tweeted a picture of him playing football, in what looks like a rented office space. But the Buttigieg campaign goes into tonight pretty optimistic that they will perform well. They have to perform well. They have to perform well here and in New Hampshire as well, because by all expectations when they start getting to places like South Carolina, it's going to be a little bit tougher for the Buttigieg campaign, at least if you look at the polls. Nearby at a caucus site, this is inside a university and the population at this caucus site was pretty young, but we saw that Buttigieg was doing quite well there, and he had a big crowd.

In blistering remarks, lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned that history would not be kind to President Trump. Schiff lectured Republican senators, quote, he is not who you are. Now, White House counsel Pat Cipollone urged senators to reject both articles. Cipollone said it was time to end what he termed the era of impeachment. Two developments tonight. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski was one Republican that some observers thought could vote to convict Mr. Trump. Murkowski said few on both sides approached impeachment, quote, with a clear and open mind. She declared that she would not vote to convict. And Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin didn't reveal how he would vote today but Manchin introduced a resolution to censure President Trump. In his resolution, Manchin says that the president, quote, abuse the trust of the American people, says his behavior was unacceptable and Mr. Trump brought dishonor to himself. It's unclear if the Senate will consider Manchin's plan. Now, it takes 67 votes to remove a president. In 1999, 45 senators voted to remove President Clinton on one article of impeachment, 50 yeas on the other article."

And, obviously, Kim Kardashian, you know, remember, was a big part of that and brought it to my father's attention, and he did something about it. And it's driving the Democrats nuts that something they tried to run on, that they would always promise and didn't get done, and that kind of reminds you of the Democratic Party in general. They always say they're not going to get things done and they never actually do. And the one thing I'll say about my father is he's done everything he said he would do and he has achieved so much more and I think that will be one of the hallmarks of his presidency and I'm -- I'm incredibly proud that was the Super Bowl commercial because I think a spotlight really needed to be put forth on the issue and he did so in a beautiful way.

I read your first column and I went, hmm, as you talked about the potential maybe down the road for what would be a contested convention. This is going to be very interesting. We get the first round of results in, you get below 15 percent, and I will let you pick it up from there, what you see happening tonight."

So, that's the first, that's the alignment. Then, they have a final alignment where they -- where everybody who was for somebody below the viability threshold picked somebody else. And those people then elect what are called delegate equivalents, people who in essence will go to the state convention representing their candidate. But look, this is going to be a really confusing night because it's not a primary. That is to say if you get 35 percent of the vote it doesn't mean you get 35 percent of the delegates. There are four congressional delegates, two of them have seven delegates each, one of them, the district that we're here that includes Des Moines has eight. The Republican part of the state in the Northwest corner of the state only gets five. There are 1,700 precincts. They elect 27 delegates for -- by congressional district and 14 statewide delegates could split up. So, every -- having more caucus attendees in any given precinct doesn't mean that you get more strength in picking delegates. It simply means your percentage is higher within the pool that then either elects congressional district chair of 27, or helps pick the statewide delegates, the 14th. So, it's very complicated and that the end of the night, we may know the state delegate equivalents but we may not the exact -- we'll know roughly what the delegates, the national conventions delegates look like, but we won't know precisely for some time."

They now want to change the rules so that well, maybe Mayor Bloomberg can become a backup or a safety net of some kind should Bernie emerge as the real front runner which it appears he's doing. More importantly now, the report that they may in fact change the rules about superdelegates again which could mean that they are actually preparing to do to Bernie Sanders if he's in that position, to do to him what they did to him in 2016 and kind of rig it against him."

Even if there are only two people left at that point, and establishment and Sanders, it's going to be awfully hard to get a majority of those 52 percent of the delegates that are left to be chosen and be able to walk into Milwaukee with a majority -- clear majority on the first -- on the first ballot. It could be done."

Also, our own Lawrence Jones, he's live, he's on the ground. He's in Iowa. We'll get his full report and much more, straight ahead."

If Buttigieg makes the 15 percent cut off line tonight, Lawrence, that's going to be interesting to see where the second choice goes. In other words, as people now begin to fall off, they have an opportunity to support their second choice, where they will go."

They have changed the rules so Mayor Bloomberg can now qualify to be on the stage. A lot of people are concerned that the party is yet again getting involved. There is momentum. Bernie -- Bernie is not just a fringe element. You see the people on the ground wanted to support him. We'll see later tonight who pulls it off. I mean, Biden is still ahead in the polls but there is still a surge from Bernie."

But all they're doing is just driving more support to President Trump for his reelection. I mean, they just insulted over 80 million Americans with that kind of stuff and Don lemon giggling like an 8-year-old girl at his birthday party. I've never seen anything quite as ridiculous. CNN should have called him in and said, you can't be a news anchor and fall down on your desk and giggle like that. It's just unprofessional."

But I think one of the most impressive and important messages the president has gotten out there who is that it's not that they just hate him. They hate the American people who voted for him and he's just in the way. And they repeatedly state that on the campaign trail, and it's certainly it's resonating with Democrats is 25 percent of them are attending his rallies."
