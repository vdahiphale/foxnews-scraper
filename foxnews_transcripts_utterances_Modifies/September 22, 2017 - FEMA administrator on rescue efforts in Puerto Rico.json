And we're continuing to meet his goals of search-and-rescue, pushing forward a large amount of commodities in the forms of meals, water.  We also have multiple emergency generators and different capabilities being placed in different areas to bring up critical infrastructure such as hospitals. And so right now we're still in the lifesaving rescue mode, and then hopefully we will push into the life-sustainment mode over the next 48 to 72 hours.",

But FEMA is largely only responsible for the emergency power push, to making sure that hospitals and critical facilities are back online. The greater rebuild of the power structure will be turned over to basically Puerto Rico, the Western Power Authority, as I understand it, in partnership with Department of Energy partners. So, there's going to be a lot of work to repair and hopefully when it's repaired it's done at a higher resilient manner.",

I'm often reminded it doesn't matter whether the money is there. The help is always there and the money comes later.

And so, after this event, I'm sure that there is going to be numerous after-action reporting processes that take place across the federal government. We have constant communication with our congressional partners and the Congress and update them on a regular basis about cash flow and different things and our ability to do the job. I have not once feared that we would not have the ability to push forward and dot the life safety, lifesaving response mission going forward. So, the communication is excellent and the Congress has been very supportive.",

So, we have established, for example, in Harvey recovery command, and we have been working very closely with Governor Abbott in Texas to create innovative programs to help understand what the state of Texas is entitled to, not just from FEMA, but from SBA, from HUD.   How can we innovatively implement our recovery programs and the dollars to best help the unique situation in Texas? And so we're working with Governor Abbott around the clock to do that and to help people out. And no disaster is the same. So, the way we attack Texas, you know, and apply assistant could be slightly altered in Florida because of the situation there being a lot different. Texas was a frustrating flood. Florida was basically a run-of-the-mill Category 4 hit that destroyed by storm surge and the water receded and came back. So, each recovery approach is going to have to be tailored to meet the governor's demands.  And what I'm really proud about with the state of Texas is that Governor Abbott has stepped up to the plate. He's owning recovery. We are there to support him. And we're pushing forward. But it's still going to be a long, drawn-out process. We can't just flip a switch and put routine back together in the communities that were impacted.",
