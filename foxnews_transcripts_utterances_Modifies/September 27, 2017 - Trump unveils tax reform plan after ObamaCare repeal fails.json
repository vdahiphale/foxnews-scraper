And I think his ability to sell it in plain spoken words in the way that he does is actually probably one of the best things he has going for them. I think that the text of the plan and of the speech, you read it on paper, a little bit in the weed, but you can get -- basically gets the gist. They're going to have obstacles. Already, the left is painting this as tax cuts for the rich and this only going to benefit the wealthy. That is not true, but it's hard to argue it on the other side. I think that he started to do that today. And I think based on what I've heard that the White House has a pretty good plan to get their coalition together in order to try to advance this. But I really do think the rich are going to end up paying more. So if you're in the tax code -- or the zip code where you really wanted Hillary Clinton to win, you should be glad because you thought the rich should pay more, and under this plan they're going to end up paying more.",

The problem I have with this is the order in which this administration tackle their issues. For example, it's like with Obamacare or tax reform, I would have loved it if they've done tax reform first. They chose the wrong lane at the supermarket. The Obamacare lane did not move.

I think they would like tax cuts for themselves, but I don't think they're in it to get back at the greedy billionaires. I also don't like that he's only cutting the top rate from 39 to 35. I think it's too timid. Reagan slashed the top rate in his two terms from 70 to 28. To sell it as this is a Reagan-esque tax cut I think is incorrect. Also, they should be cutting capital gains and dividend tax cuts -- taxes because I think that helps older Americans.  I do like somethings, though. I do like the income tax reductions as a general point. It's our money. It's not the government's money. The increasing of the child tax credit and the doubling of the center deduction I think that helps, kind of, lower middle income people and for Americans. Some of them will pay zero. Again, I don't understand what that means, but it sounds good. Eliminate the death tax. That's straight up communism. That should have been out a very long time ago.  The president really is selling this mostly as the corporate tax rate reduction is going to be the key driver to growth and to job creation and to wage growth. And then you're also going to bring back money from overseas as well and invest more in America. It's an America first tax cut. I think there's a lot of good things. There's some bad things, but on the whole, it's much better than what we have now.",

I think people would like a more simple, direct way to know what taxes they're paying, why they're paying them, and to feel that they're going for a good use by the government. On all those things, I say great. And in fact, President Trump during the campaign promised that this would be tax reform, they wouldn't simply be about some tax cuts that would then open the door to what's been described here as tax cuts for the very rich. And by the way, according to the polls, and NBC-Wall Street Journal it's like 55 percent of Americans oppose any kind of cut for the corporate tax rate, you know. And they also think that in fact the rich should pay more. So I don't know. But that's what the American people think. So when I'm looking at this, I'm thinking, oh, so the Republicans have given up on tax reform. Now all they want to do is tax cuts. And the driver, as Jesse was saying is corporate tax cuts. And the argument there, which is an interesting one, is, hey, this economy would be doing even better. We'd knock them out.  We would be the global titan if we could lower our tax rate to be competitive with tax rates in Europe and the rest of the world. So, but then when you look at it, you discover, hey, wait a second. Our tax rates aren't out of line. Guess what? You know, I mean, you look at the deductions and the write-offs and our corporate tax rate -- and that's what really galls me, Jesse, Mr. Populist, is that there's about half or more of American corporations that pay zero.

But thankfully, people are stepping up to help these patients, and our very own Dr. Manny Alvarez is there to provide medical assistance. Geraldo is there reporting and the American rapper known as Pitbull lent his private jet to Puerto Rico to transfer cancer patients from the island to the United States so that they can continue their chemotherapy treatment. He just said, \"Thank God we're blessed to help. I'm just doing my part.\" In addition, Mark Cuban lent the Dallas Mavericks team plane to one of his players, J.J. Barea, who's Puerto Rican, and they delivered supplies to his hometown where he and his wife raised up $140,000 to help the people of Puerto Rico recover.

I think that he had to give the speech on the teleprompter, but I hope he doesn't do a ton of them on them because I think -- tax reform hasn't been done really well in 30 years. And I think his ability to sell it in plain spoken words in the way that he does is actually probably one of the best things he has going for them. I think that the text of the plan and of the speech, you read it on paper, a little bit in the weed, but you can get -- basically gets the gist. They're going to have obstacles. Already, the left is painting this as tax cuts for the rich and this only going to benefit the wealthy. That is not true, but it's hard to argue it on the other side. I think that he started to do that today. And I think based on what I've heard that the White House has a pretty good plan to get their coalition together in order to try to advance this. But I really do think the rich are going to end up paying more. So if you're in the tax code -- or the zip code where you really wanted Hillary Clinton to win, you should be glad because you thought the rich should pay more, and under this plan they're going to end up paying more."

But taxed at a rate of zero goes way over my head. I'm not that bright on this stuff. Come on, just simplify it. Really simplified it. The problem I have with this is the order in which this administration tackle their issues. For example, it's like with Obamacare or tax reform, I would have loved it if they've done tax reform first. They chose the wrong lane at the supermarket. The Obamacare lane did not move.

I think they would like tax cuts for themselves, but I don't think they're in it to get back at the greedy billionaires. I also don't like that he's only cutting the top rate from 39 to 35. I think it's too timid. Reagan slashed the top rate in his two terms from 70 to 28. To sell it as this is a Reagan-esque tax cut I think is incorrect. Also, they should be cutting capital gains and dividend tax cuts -- taxes because I think that helps older Americans. I do like somethings, though. I do like the income tax reductions as a general point. It's our money. It's not the government's money. The increasing of the child tax credit and the doubling of the center deduction I think that helps, kind of, lower middle income people and for Americans. Some of them will pay zero. Again, I don't understand what that means, but it sounds good. Eliminate the death tax. That's straight up communism. That should have been out a very long time ago. The president really is selling this mostly as the corporate tax rate reduction is going to be the key driver to growth and to job creation and to wage growth. And then you're also going to bring back money from overseas as well and invest more in America. It's an America first tax cut. I think there's a lot of good things. There's some bad things, but on the whole, it's much better than what we have now."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I'm sort of curious because I don't know -- I think it would be great if we had tax reform in this country. I really do. I think people would like a more simple, direct way to know what taxes they're paying, why they're paying them, and to feel that they're going for a good use by the government. On all those things, I say great. And in fact, President Trump during the campaign promised that this would be tax reform, they wouldn't simply be about some tax cuts that would then open the door to what's been described here as tax cuts for the very rich. And by the way, according to the polls, and NBC-Wall Street Journal it's like 55 percent of Americans oppose any kind of cut for the corporate tax rate, you know. And they also think that in fact the rich should pay more. So I don't know. But that's what the American people think. So when I'm looking at this, I'm thinking, oh, so the Republicans have given up on tax reform. Now all they want to do is tax cuts. And the driver, as Jesse was saying is corporate tax cuts. And the argument there, which is an interesting one, is, hey, this economy would be doing even better. We'd knock them out. We would be the global titan if we could lower our tax rate to be competitive with tax rates in Europe and the rest of the world. So, but then when you look at it, you discover, hey, wait a second. Our tax rates aren't out of line. Guess what? You know, I mean, you look at the deductions and the write-offs and our corporate tax rate -- and that's what really galls me, Jesse, Mr. Populist, is that there's about half or more of American corporations that pay zero. If you're puzzled, Greg, this is your answer. Zero means you pay no tax."

He can blame the establishment and the people on Capitol Hill and the swamp. The truth is that he will have to pay the price for that. But I do think that the Democrats -- the Democrats still like play ball on tax reform. If the president continues to press in these red states that have Democratic senators that are up for election, he might be able to have enough in order to get tax reform done. It might not be what Reagan was able to do, but that's because there's not that much room to cut. The tax rates aren't at 70 percent. You can go from 70 to 30 when you were in the 80's. Right now, you just can't raise enough revenue in order to pay for the things that we want. I also think that we're having a bigger discussion about health care and tax reform but we're not really having it here, but the people are having it, and that is what kind of government do you want? What do you expect them to be able to pay for? And how much do you think Americans should contribute to their government? Those are bigger issue questions."

So, do I think it's a situation where McConnell and the rest that supported Strange like, oh, yeah, no. But never the less, they've got to be able to work together to achieve common goals. Do I think that the president is heartbroken over it? No, I don't. I think that the president is like, look, this is no problem and I think he really means it. That he's going to work with them. And, of course, he's probably going to do everything he can. More than make up with it with some amazing, you know, rally that's going to go like 45 to an hour over in time about him. When he returns to Alabama to make sure to clinch the victory. It's like there's going to be a lot of money dumped in to make sure to try to see if the Democrat can win.

So you might argue that they might have just gone with Moore from the beginning and save that money, but I do think that the agenda that Moore was talking about is pretty secure. I don't think Alabama is going to vote for a Democrat. So Juan is looking questioningly. Here is what I would say to Democrats, don't waste your money. If you think that Moore is so crazy town that he's going to be a problem for the Republicans, don't try to beat them. They're probably not going to beat him and just let him go.

And to let you know, you know, one of the major issues that we've discussed is that only 11 of the island's 69 hospitals have fuel and power in addition to a lot of those professionals leaving for the mainland during the economic, you know, crisis there. But thankfully, people are stepping up to help these patients, and our very own Dr. Manny Alvarez is there to provide medical assistance. Geraldo is there reporting and the American rapper known as Pitbull lent his private jet to Puerto Rico to transfer cancer patients from the island to the United States so that they can continue their chemotherapy treatment. He just said, \"Thank God we're blessed to help. I'm just doing my part.\" In addition, Mark Cuban lent the Dallas Mavericks team plane to one of his players, J.J. Barea, who's Puerto Rican, and they delivered supplies to his hometown where he and his wife raised up $140,000 to help the people of Puerto Rico recover. And as we reported, the president is on his way there, as well, next week. Jesse."

This comes after Pitino faced charges from the federal government of taking money, redirecting money from Adidas and agents to get two high school prospects to play for his team. In addition, the athletic director at the university also put on paid leave. And on top of that, if that's not enough, you have federal bribery and fraud charges now being brought against several coaches. Arizona, Auburn, Oklahoma State, University of South -- Southern California. Tragic day for American basketball."
