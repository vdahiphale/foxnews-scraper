But I started thinking that it's not actually about the events, which are Russia, Avenatti, Smollett, Covington, Kavanaugh.   It's the fact that it all happened in a concentrated time, all in succession. It used to be isolated, like, things, like, Borque (ph) or Richard Jewell. But in the last four years, we have seen so many of them. And I'm beginning to wonder if it's because there are more of them or because we have become so red-pilled that now we finally see them for what they are. And now, we question everything that we didn't question before, like, we question are we getting the right stuff about Coronavirus? Do we -- are we getting the real story? And I think that is super healthy that we now -- we do not trust this.

They are not interested necessarily in a certain candidate, whether it's Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. They just want us fighting with each other. And when people like Adam Schiff go through an entire impeachment process and hours on the floor talking about Russia, whether it's the Mueller investigation dragging out.  Whether its people on television making this claim and the latest claim they had to walk back with the intelligence now showing they are helping Bernie Sanders win the primary now. Russia doesn't care. They only care that we are fighting with each other and that Americans are at each other's throats. And that's exactly what they've been successful at doing for the past three years.  And the question is are people going to continue to allow them to do that.

The thing that happened today is Elizabeth Warren cut an ad that was attacking Bloomberg. So she's continuing to punch down. She's afraid to punch at Bernie.

And on the thing about Cuba, President Obama -- correct me if I'm wrong. I'm looking at Katie here. So remember, Obama didn't do the majority of his Cuba stuff until after he won a second term, because he wanted to win Florida. Already, you have Democrats in south Florida, Shalala being one of them, saying no, Bernie, like, that is not how our constituents think. So he is already causing problems for Democrats who are downstream from him. And they are saying absolutely not.

Google it and you will see some of his writings. My favorite thing, again, is when the media is shocked, just shocked. You are seeing them shocked now that the guy who calls himself a socialist does in fact endorse socialism. They're like oh, my god, on The View.  Let's get everybody from Shark Tank on and sabotage the guy you named your dog after. Why was Bernie getting a free pass this entire time? It is only one reason. The media has a very shallow talent stack, right? They have no expertise in economics, so they can't write -- they can't ask the questions that can take somebody like Bernie out.

And it helps bring animation and storytelling vehicles to New York City communities and kids who may not have the opportunity otherwise. And I was super impressed with them.

He beat eight to one odds to defeat Sonny Liston to become the World Heavyweight Champion. Take a look at this. As you can see, Ali battered listen with quick powerful jabs. Liston didn't come out for the seventh round. Ali started boxing at 12. By the time he was 18, he'd won 100 amateur bouts. In 1960, he won the gold medal at the Olympics in boxing. After he defeated Liston, Ali pointed at the media and famously said I am the greatest. Don't have a mark my face and I beat Sonny Liston. By the way, as I mentioned last week, you can watch a special HBO documentary film, Ali and Cavett. It's about Ali and the talk show host. I'm a featured commentator in that HBO documentary.",

And yes, it has -- does Russia want to put some ads out there? Do they like to meddle?

After -- I or you, we have been living decades kind of in this sealed narrative of cultivated stories that help make money for these corporatist companies. But I started thinking that it's not actually about the events, which are Russia, Avenatti, Smollett, Covington, Kavanaugh. It's the fact that it all happened in a concentrated time, all in succession. It used to be isolated, like, things, like, Borque (ph) or Richard Jewell. But in the last four years, we have seen so many of them. And I'm beginning to wonder if it's because there are more of them or because we have become so red-pilled that now we finally see them for what they are. And now, we question everything that we didn't question before, like, we question are we getting the right stuff about Coronavirus? Do we -- are we getting the real story? And I think that is super healthy that we now -- we do not trust this. And, like, the one of Trump's big achievements is that he just -- he put a scar across the face of media that will never go away. And that everybody can see that scar for the rest of their lives.

Russia loves that Americans are being pitted against each other, which is exactly what they are always trying to do and that they are talking about Russia. They are not interested necessarily in a certain candidate, whether it's Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. They just want us fighting with each other. And when people like Adam Schiff go through an entire impeachment process and hours on the floor talking about Russia, whether it's the Mueller investigation dragging out. Whether its people on television making this claim and the latest claim they had to walk back with the intelligence now showing they are helping Bernie Sanders win the primary now. Russia doesn't care. They only care that we are fighting with each other and that Americans are at each other's throats. And that's exactly what they've been successful at doing for the past three years. And the question is are people going to continue to allow them to do that. We are so concerned about Russian meddling. Why don't we stop getting them so much credit for doing something that they're not actually in control of?"

Well, he's not telling the truth about what the literacy classes were in Cuba. There are re-education camps -- gazed to concentration camps where they're worked to death. But this is actually a long history of the left. The glorification of Cuba has been a staple in the leftist platform for decades. And let's not forget that Barack Obama opened the door to normalization with this kind of Cuban tyranny when he was president by going to a baseball game with Raul Castro and doing the wave with members of the FARC were at the game with him. So this is something the left they've been promoting for years. They've always said look at the Cuban healthcare system. What they don't show you is people dying with -- it's just like the Venezuelan healthcare system where people don't actually have healthcare. They have a system that doesn't work. So Bernie Sanders is not going to walk this back. But he is also not telling the truth about what the Cuban regime actually is. And there were not good parts of it, and they're not good parts of it today either, despite more people being able to visit Cuba while the other people who actually live there starving so that tourists can have their nice resorts."

I would go straight at Bernie because he can't take a punch. You saw when Bloomberg mentioned his three homes. He started flustering, like, he was a fraud caught red-handed. But you can't go after his supporters. You have to do it in a way that say Bernie is deceiving you and he can't get anything done because he can't -- and he won't want because it is not possible.

But honestly, like, if you want debate prep, might as well watch THE FIVE because that will help you better than anyone else. The thing that happened today is Elizabeth Warren cut an ad that was attacking Bloomberg. So she's continuing to punch down. She's afraid to punch at Bernie. And I don't see how anyone is going to take Bernie out if they're not willing to go after him. And if Bloomberg isn't effective in doing so where all these millions he's spending isn't going to be effective, then no one is going to stop Bernie's roll. And on the thing about Cuba, President Obama -- correct me if I'm wrong. I'm looking at Katie here. So remember, Obama didn't do the majority of his Cuba stuff until after he won a second term, because he wanted to win Florida. Already, you have Democrats in south Florida, Shalala being one of them, saying no, Bernie, like, that is not how our constituents think. So he is already causing problems for Democrats who are downstream from him. And they are saying absolutely not. The last thing I would say is Bernie is so much more comfortable with government than with individuals and personal responsibility and freedom. That I would -- that's -- if I were like a Mayor Pete, I might go after him in that direction."

And it's kind of refreshing to hear a Democrat be honest, you know? And if you want to read more about Bernie, I would suggest the Mother Jones article from 2015. Google it and you will see some of his writings. My favorite thing, again, is when the media is shocked, just shocked. You are seeing them shocked now that the guy who calls himself a socialist does in fact endorse socialism. They're like oh, my god, on The View. Let's get everybody from Shark Tank on and sabotage the guy you named your dog after. Why was Bernie getting a free pass this entire time? It is only one reason. The media has a very shallow talent stack, right? They have no expertise in economics, so they can't write -- they can't ask the questions that can take somebody like Bernie out. So Bernie can talk about -- I mean, he's been around forever talking about never having to pay for stuff, free stuff. And now we are just getting to these questions."

I think that kind of attitude would play well when you're trying to pick off some moderate Republican voters who were upset by Trump's behavior and the like. Bloomberg is not in any far left guy. I could vote for Bloomberg. But in the primary process, it's a huge liability. He would have to get through the primary to get to the general election.

If you come in and you try to buy the nomination, and you try to tell everybody to get out of the field so I can take Bernie out one on one, that's not democratic. Bernie can easily hit him for that.

He wrote these beautiful letters as so many young people did then. There was a real art to letter writing and I've cherished these letters my whole life.

They lost their father when he was -- when he was 12 and Nancy was eight. And their mother who I was very close to, my aunt Anne, raised them. And you know, these are people who never complained about anything. They just charge forward. She didn't have any handouts. He wasn't eligible for Social Security because he'd only worked in this company for a couple of years, and she went back to work. And you know, they found a way to make it work. And Harry, when he was in the battle, he never complained.

And the students came to Fox today and they shadowed members of our team and sat for presentations about the industry and got to the doodle hands-on stuff. And it helps bring animation and storytelling vehicles to New York City communities and kids who may not have the opportunity otherwise. And I was super impressed with them.

He beat eight to one odds to defeat Sonny Liston to become the World Heavyweight Champion. Take a look at this. As you can see, Ali battered listen with quick powerful jabs. Liston didn't come out for the seventh round. Ali started boxing at 12. By the time he was 18, he'd won 100 amateur bouts. In 1960, he won the gold medal at the Olympics in boxing. After he defeated Liston, Ali pointed at the media and famously said I am the greatest. Don't have a mark my face and I beat Sonny Liston. By the way, as I mentioned last week, you can watch a special HBO documentary film, Ali and Cavett. It's about Ali and the talk show host. I'm a featured commentator in that HBO documentary."

Best way to tell your wife that you love her, not with chocolates, not with flowers, not with soft cuddly teddy bears, it is with a custom coffee mug with my face on it. That is right. Shout out to Jamie Gragg from Crisfield, Maryland who gave his wife Amy this handsome mug. Get it, Greg? This handsome mug on Valentine's Day. They're fans of THE FIVE. They never miss a show. So everybody just enjoy."

So keep that in mind especially Boston Dynamics who decided to make a rickshaw -- can you say rickshaw or is it a petty cab? Using their robot dog spotmini. Now, look at this. So they got -- the spotmini is pulling this human. So maybe 50 years from now, maybe 100 years, when spot mini reaches superintelligence, smarter 20 times, 30 times, he's going to remember this guy, he's going to bite -- he's going to rip him from limb to limb."

And he visited the Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia where many of our troops were -- have been recently stationed and deployed to combat Iran. There he is having lunch with many of them there. And they have new F-15 fighter jets as well that we saw on tour. You can't see him but he's underneath there. And then I also landed an interview with the Secretary which you can check out@townhall.com. We talked about China, the Iranian threat, Huawei and a number of issues going on with Africa that Americans probably should pay attention to. And from my last photo, the question is, is that a real lion or a fake lion? You get to decide."
