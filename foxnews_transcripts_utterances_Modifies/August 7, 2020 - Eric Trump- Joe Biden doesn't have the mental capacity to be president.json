      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" The left is getting very desperate and breaking tonight, New York's liberal attorney general trying to dissolve the National Rifle Association with a new lawsuit. Really? Just 89 days before the election. Uh-huh, sounds like weird timing to me.  So, is the state of New York using taxpayer money to interfere in the 2020 election? Why now? And we'll explain -- I think there are other priorities the state should be concerned about, like safety and the lives of its citizens. We'll investigate that.  Also, this madness along with the left's conspiracy theories. Their hysteria, their usual slander all ratcheting up because Democrats have nothing positive to run on.  And this is now a fact -- Joe Biden is a disaster. He looks frail. He looks extremely weak, even from his basement bunker, with the lightest possible schedule of any presidential candidate in history. He is struggling and struggling big time. What a whopper a day, we will call it, today. He's really not even campaigning. He's just, you know, poking his head up for an hour or two out of a comfort of his own home, and yet he cannot hold it together. So far, this week has been an unmitigated disaster.  It started yesterday when Biden had this weird, strange, embarrassing public breakdown while touting his cognitive fitness. See if you can understand this and pay very close attention to the words \"fitness\" at the end of this.",

Meaning, you know, what does he mean here?  This is just the beginning of his bad week. Why is he having such a hard time saying I look forward to the fitness. Now, if he really means that, we can have the extra debate that Donald Trump has called for before anybody votes before early voting starts. That is fair for the American people. Let the American people decide. Joe says he's looking forward to it. OK, game on, Joe. Do it before a single vote is cast. Can't say the word fitness, and by the way, just a short time ago, as a matter of fact, he said of course I had a cognitive exam. I'm tested constantly. OK.  When he's out of the basement bunker, he doesn't know sometimes what city he is in, he doesn't know what office he is running for at times. He doesn't remember or doesn't seem to remember that we are endowed by our -- oh, the thing, you know, the thing.  God. Joe, the answer is God, the creator of everything. If you forget, give me a call, I'll help you out in the middle of the debate, we can cheat, nobody will know. Now, he can't tell his wife from his sister at one time, so we'll use his words. Come on, man. I don't know what the hell he's saying. What's going on here?  Now, Democrats refuse to talk about it in public. The mob and the media, they're not talking about it in public. But I can tell you, I know for a fact, in private, they are telling me and many other people they know it is a serious problem. They can't put their head in the sand forever, like an ostrich.   Like it or not, Biden's cognitive abilities are extremely troubling and they will be on the ballot. What we are seeing, frankly, is just bizarre. It's not normal. That's all I know. I look at a frail guy who if he ever had a slow pitch seems to be gone. We witnessed today and of the disaster for Biden during after a virtual event with the national association of black journalists, National Association of Hispanic Journalists, Biden suggested that African-Americans are all the same.

Funding for the largest amount of money and the longest commitment of time, historically black colleges, that was Donald Trump. That was not Barack and it wasn't Joe. And, by the way, record after record after record-low unemployment for every demographic in this country, including African- Americans and Hispanic-Americans -- yeah, that was Donald Trump. Biden and Obama gave us 13 million more Americans on food stamps after eight years, and 8 billion more in poverty, and the lowest participation rate and 70s, lowest recovery since the '40s.  The president is right and, by the way, can you imagine the hysteria on the left if it was Trump who made those horrible remarks? Keep in mind: this is not an isolated incident for the ever forgetful and corrupt Joe. His track record on race is atrocious. His close personal mentor, as he says, the person he praised was, yeah, the former Klansman Robert KKK Byrd. The guy that filibustered the Civil Rights Act of '64, opposed the Voting Rights Act of '65. Lyndon Johnson relied on 80 percent Republicans in the House and Senate to pass that.  Not a lot of Democrats. Al Gore's father, he wasn't there when history mattered. Imagine if Donald Trump praised a former Klan leader who, in fact, filibustered the Civil Rights Act.  In the `70s, Biden actively working with the segregationist. Why? To slow school integration. Let's go to NBC News, shall we? He led the charge on an issue that kept black students away from the classrooms of white students. And according to The Washington Post, Biden spoke out repeatedly and forcefully against sending white children to majority black schools and black children to majority white schools.  1977, Biden worried that his children would grow up in a racial jungle. A few years later, Biden lied about marching in the civil rights movement. He also lied about endorsements from the NAACP in 1993. He's the guy that referred to inner-city youth as predators on our streets. 2006, he's the guy that told the crowd, you have to have a slight Indian accent to work at a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts. Quote, I'm not kidding.   2006, he bragged that his state was a state. 2007, he's the guy who said, this is -- key word here -- first, the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean. That storybook, man.  Come on, man. \"Man\" comes up a lot with this guy. Anyway, last year, he said poor kids could be just as bright as white kids. And recently, Biden said, quote, you ain't black if you support Donald Trump. And then he said, of course, they're going to put you all back in chains.   When you think about it, Biden's track record on race is nothing short of a disgrace and imagine if Donald Trump had said all these things.",

Actually, the NAACP has endorsed a zero of his campaigns. He lied and said he was arrested trying to visit Nelson Mandela and for decades he said that I have participated in desegregating restaurants and movie theaters in Wilmington, Delaware. Zero evidence. \"The New York Times\" looked at it and they said years ago, that his advisors gently reminded Joe to stop saying it because it wasn't true, and he kept saying it anyway. It just shows you the Democrats think of black people as children to whom the truth cannot be told and the truth is the problems in the black community today have virtually nothing to do with slavery and Jim Crow and everything to do with bad government policies, bad incentives that have been put in place by the left. The Democrats cannot say that because that would require them to rethink their whole ideology.

The NRA is now fighting back after frankly a bazaar 170-page oddly timed, very odd to me lawsuit filed by the far-left New York State Attorney General Letitia James, to actually have the entire organization dissolved. Now, you ask yourself, amid a global pandemic, violent crime surge where 1- year-olds are shot and strollers in parks in New York City and all these attacks in New York City against law enforcement, and innocent citizens, it's happening all over New York City, why are New York officials, where are they choosing this political attack at this time? Seems more than odd instead of addressing the most serious issues involving public safety and the plague in New York state. Now, by the way, in response to the suit, the NRA is taking their own legal action. Quote: Despite hopes that playing by the rules would procure a just outcome, the NRA has not been treated fairly by James' office. The New York Democratic Party official machine, they seek to harass, defund, so many liberals for years wanted to dismantle and get rid of the NRA because of what it believes and what it says, and the politicians they support. Like all the other liberal organizations. Don't forget, Biden has embraced this radical anti-Second Amendment agenda, tweeting yesterday: Weapons of war have no place in our community. When I was senator, I took on the NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons. As president, I'll ban these weapons again. Not only that, he proclaimed that Beto Bozo as his gun czar O'Rourke, well, he would be his go to guy on guns. Remember this?",

Obamacare, some version of Medicare for all, free housing, free higher education, free healthy food by the government guaranteed, free child care, free paid family leave, free vacation, free, free, free, everything's free. Now, all of your needs will be taken care of, cradle to grave, womb to tomb. All your worries eliminated in a magical socialist utopia. The only problem is these problems are completely unfulfillable. They are false promises. The math doesn't add up, not even on Joe's, you know, old fashion abacus. And if this radical agenda is ever implemented, your friends and your freedoms, friends, guess what, the friends that love freedom, it's going to be stripped away. Your wealth, it will be confiscated. Your businesses will be destroyed. America as we know it, that is freedom and liberty and guess what? Capitalism will be gone. They are statists, these are socialist policies, and they will fail. It's been tried. It has failed to many times to count. And that is what is on the ballot in 89 days. It's all on the ballot in 89 days. Here with reaction, civil rights attorney Leo Tirrell, Salem Radio, nationally syndicated talk show host, Larry Elder. Wow.

He thinks he knows however a black person thinks, what we -- how we walk, what we should eat. Joe Biden doesn't understand that black people are individual. Condoleezza Rice and Al Sharpton are different individuals. We have a different mindset. And what the Democrats will do is they'll roll out Jim Clyburn, and he says, it's okay. Jim Clyburn doesn't speak for me or Larry or black Americans. No one black person speaks for black America. And, CNN, MSNBC, they wouldn't cover this today. Donald Trump is absolutely right. Joe Biden insulted every black American today. And he should not be president. He is the racist. What is so amazing to me is that they are going to put this guy out in front and say he's not. The only reason why he has getting a pass because he has a D in front of his name, not a R. Republicans are the people who believe in a color-blind society. Democrats are the ones who believe in identity and race politics."

As you pointed out, Sean, in your monologue, he has been lying about the civil rights record for decades. He lied and said the NAACP endorsed him for every one of his campaigns. Actually, the NAACP has endorsed a zero of his campaigns. He lied and said he was arrested trying to visit Nelson Mandela and for decades he said that I have participated in desegregating restaurants and movie theaters in Wilmington, Delaware. Zero evidence. \"The New York Times\" looked at it and they said years ago, that his advisors gently reminded Joe to stop saying it because it wasn't true, and he kept saying it anyway. It just shows you the Democrats think of black people as children to whom the truth cannot be told and the truth is the problems in the black community today have virtually nothing to do with slavery and Jim Crow and everything to do with bad government policies, bad incentives that have been put in place by the left. The Democrats cannot say that because that would require them to rethink their whole ideology. They cannot do that, so they condescend to black people and treat them like pawns on the chessboard and it is offensive and disgusting."

My opinion is that Obama and Biden believe that they are entitled to be considered a better candidate or a better president because they are a Democrat. That is a false analogy. One final point, with all -- I'm a trial lawyer for the blast 30 years. With all the evidence you have played in front of your viewers about Joe Biden's racist past, I could try Joe Biden in a court room and convict him of being a racist."

That includes the Second Amendment, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, because tonight, you are seeing a preview perhaps of coming attractions. The NRA is now fighting back after frankly a bazaar 170-page oddly timed, very odd to me lawsuit filed by the far-left New York State Attorney General Letitia James, to actually have the entire organization dissolved. Now, you ask yourself, amid a global pandemic, violent crime surge where 1- year-olds are shot and strollers in parks in New York City and all these attacks in New York City against law enforcement, and innocent citizens, it's happening all over New York City, why are New York officials, where are they choosing this political attack at this time?

Sean, I have to tell you, I learned how strong one voice can be when I confronted Beto O'Rourke and told him, hell no, you are not taking our guns. And now, neither is this Democrat attorney general.
