And the last 24 hours, White House COVID Advisor Dr. Scott Atlas has come under attack from both Dr. Anthony Fauci and CDC Director Scott Redfield.  Now tonight, Dr. Atlas is here exclusively to respond. Also, Raymond Arroyo brings us the latest duck and cover games from the Biden camp, including a new tactic from Jill, Seen and Unseen explains. Plus, the BLM and critical race theory movements have officially become a financial scam. We knew it was going to head that way and Dinesh D'Souza provides the numbers and the names behind the racket. But first, how to debate Joe Biden. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.   When Chris Wallace welcomes the candidates to the debate stage tomorrow night, we will finally see what we've all been waiting for. A spirited back and forth between President Trump and Vice President Biden on the most important issues facing us as a country. So, let's go through them one-by- one. First, on our COVID response. Now, we all know that Joe Biden was against the president's decision to shut down travel to China which undoubtedly saved a lot of lives. And that the Obama administration's response to H1N1 was a flop. And that was according to Biden's own Chief of Staff Ron Klain.",

But the fact is this virus was a terrible tragedy and we dealt with it better than any country in the G7 because we didn't let it devastate our entire economy, which brings us to number two, the economy. Now Biden doesn't even bother trying to argue that he's going to raise your standard of living because he won't. The clear evidence shows that the Trump policies of deregulation keeping labor markets tight, tightening the screws on China and renegotiating NAFTA produced phenomenal results for working Americans. Of course, we had record low unemployment for blacks and Hispanics before the pandemic. We had record wage increases too from 2016 through 2019.   Median wages rose to a record, an increase of $6000. Now, last year alone, it was up more than $4000.  Now, even with the blue states that are slow to reopen, new home sales were near a 14 year high in August. It's amazing given what we've been through. Now. Biden will, of course, try to blur the lines on Trump's economic successes with an assist from his pals at The New York Times. Because their big scoop with pre-debate timing, of course, is that Donald Trump takes both business depreciation and business losses as tax deductions against income.  Thus, in both 2016 and 2017, he paid $750 in taxes. Now, of course, the Times did its best to put this in the worst possible light, yet it could not conclude any wrongdoing on the president's part. Nevertheless, Biden's resuscitation squad, they think you're stupid. And they had the headline they needed.",

      "sentences": "But it didn't Stetler say that or Stelter said that about Vindman wasn't that the biggest thing ever? How many times have they said that? But look, dig a little deeper into the Times hit piece and it quickly just falls apart. For starters, the Times article actually shows that Trump has, in fact, paid tens of millions of dollars in federal income taxes. Trump also coughed up 24.3 million due to the alternative minimum tax before filing for refunds. Now, Trump would have paid a lot more in taxes. I love this if it wasn't for the Left's most legendary class warrior, Barack Obama. What am I talking about? Well, buried in the Times smear job is this little detail.   Until 2009, business losses could be used to wipe away taxes going back only two years. But that November, the window was more than doubled in a bill Mr. Obama signed as part of the Great Recession recovery effort. So, are Americans to believe that Biden somehow isn't aware of his administration's position on business loss write-offs? Has Biden given the speeches advocating that individual business owners actually be taxed on their losses? I must have missed all those speeches. Now. In fact, the New York Times piece confirmed what we all had thought all along, that Trump ran for president at great financial sacrifice. So much for the alleged Emoluments Clause violation. The Trump Hotel in D.C.   lost $55.5 million through 2018 and zero evidence, of course, of any financial entanglements of the former Soviet Union. No Russian collusion for the 900th time.  So, when Biden raises the New York Times piece, he opens the door for Trump to hit his own son, who actually profited from his dad's government position, Hunter Biden received $3.5 million in a wire transfer from a Russian billionaire while daddy was handling Ukraine policy. The Times didn't go there, of course. Now, if this all feels familiar, that's because it is, because The Times has published a bombshell using parts of Trump's tax returns or financial records every single year he's been in office. And every time they do, we find out the same thing. Like millions of other American business owners, President Trump used legal tax deductions and credits to offset his overall tax burden. At least he actually employed people though, I was thinking about that today.  What did Biden actually do to earn that? What does it $16 million he made in the two years after leaving office? And on the issue of racial and ANTIFA sponsored violence that will be tackled tonight, tomorrow night. Now, Biden should be asked this. What would he do if Left-wing protesters filled Lafayette Park across from the White House, would he clear the park or would he allow them to set up a permanent camp, as they've done in Portland?  Will Biden commit to protecting federal statues? Including statues of Thomas Jefferson? How about Andrew Jackson? Would Biden protect Mt.  Rushmore? President Trump's record is clear. He opposes violent protests and the desecration of public monuments. And for the issues of race and crime, Biden support of the very crime bill that has triggered so many protests while the Trump administration worked with Congress to lessen the severity of sentences for offenders. The whole Trump campaign is about fighting for Americans of all races, while Biden has traditionally sold out Americans of all races.  Finally. Biden has insulted the country by saying that it is systematically racist. He claims to want to exercise international leadership, though. Now, why would anyone follow or help a country that's systematically racist? His own rhetoric makes it impossible for other countries to take him seriously. And finally, my favorite topic on the Supreme Court.  The Constitution is clear and what's relevant here are not the wishes of Justice Ginsburg as much as we all want to honor her memory. What's relevant here are the wishes of tens of millions of Americans who voted for President Trump and also a Republican Senate. Those voters have a right to have their wishes carried out until Trump and those senators are out of office. The reality of the situation is that Biden wants to put radicals on the court who would impose a hard-Left social agenda on the nation. But Trump's judges, they respect the rule of law and they give power back to the people. Biden claims that this is about Obamacare, but that's nonsense. If Obamacare is unconstitutional, it could be fixed by statute. But when Left wingers impose things like abortion on all 50 states, no amount of legislating can address the issue or any concerns about it. So, if you trust the people and you want Trump style judges, or you trust the hard Left and you want to give them free reign over the rest of us.  Then you've got to go with Biden. Thus, on all four major topics, Biden has major vulnerabilities, but let's face it, for 40 plus years, he's essentially been a professional debater. While Donald Trump was out building businesses, some very successful, Biden has been parked in D.C.  getting very little done that matters except raising a lot of money and running for president three times. Not a charm. Tomorrow, we're going to see how the invisible candidate fares without the assistance of his handlers or Jill whisking him off stage when the questions get a little uncomfortable. I'll be watching. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow.  Victor, I was thinking of this today, picking a president. It's kind of like picking someone to represent you in a negotiation. So, given Biden has been played for a sucker for much of his career, why the heck would anyone pick him to represent them?",

      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW",
      "sentences": "Well, we're going to find out tomorrow night, because the criticism against Biden is, he's running a 19th century. William McKinley campaigned from his front porch. He's a virtual nonexistent candidate and he has a chance to show that that's wrong. So, for 90 minutes, he's going to buy the impression that he's cognitively challenged, or he has memory lapses. And it's very important because there's a whole generation of Democrats, especially millions of young people who don't know about old Joe Biden from Scranton. Laura, they don't know - they haven't seen him. He's been nonexistent until the few times he's been on TV. It's always in the scripted context. So, if he does well and does well will be defined probably by the lowest common denominator, that if he stands there for 90 minutes and doesn't do what he's been doing and is taped and scripted interviews, and that's going to multiply his advantage.   On the other hand, if he says something like he's been in the Senate for 180 years or 200 million people have died of COVID or you ain't black, then that's going to have a full force multiplier effect. And the people are going to say, you know what, I've been had, this was a virtual con job. This guy has not been out, and this is why. So, it's up to him to dispel these impressions. The second thing is, we don't know what he stands for. The impression has been that he's been a vessel of the Left, so he's no longer a centrist, if he ever was. But he's carrying along these positions that are very radical and were refuted by the voters in the primary. I mean, Bernie didn't get the nomination and Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and Beto and Buttigieg, they all crashed and burned. But that sort of vampire like experience has resurrected itself and now it's being carried forth by Biden. And so, he's got to say, you know what? This is what I believe on fracking. And this is who I would support, whom I would support for the Supreme Court. But he won't do that, if he doesn't do that then it confirms again that impression that he's an empty vessel.",

And that's why she's not releasing them. And she knows better than anything.

They haven't said that. I don't think that will be an issue.

Yes, so that's basically the import of the tweet. And this is where they're going on this. This is where they've been going that she's about to be confirmed. I'm going to get ahead of myself on the Supreme Court. But she obviously is submissive to her husband because of her membership of a devout group. It seems obvious that her husband, Jesse, must have commanded her to become a Supreme Court justice in their household. It's really honestly, I've known this family for 15 years. And if anybody subjugated in the family, it's Jesse. It's not Amy. He is an extraordinary guy and she is an extraordinary woman.

And I advise the president to do things like which he's doing, which is to do everything I can to protect the vulnerable, to open schools and open society and to make sure hospitals are not overcrowded. And of course, this is the right policy. It may not be the policy that everyone agrees with, but it happens to be exactly the policy in concert with most of the many of the world's leading epidemiologists, infectious disease people like doctors called Lee (ph) at Harvard, Dr. Bhattacharya at Stanford, Dr. Gupta and Hanigan (ph) at Oxford University. I think that's pretty good company for the president. He clearly listens to a lot of people. He understands in a very common-sense way what the science shows and what should be done to save the American really American lives. And that's why I'm here. I'm not here to make friends, I mean, there are certain experts that say what I just said, which is vulnerable people protection and save lives by also opening society safely. And there are other experts that say things like no, you shouldn't wear masks to yes, we should wear masks to, hey, a mask is a better than a vaccine, or some other expert might say no, you shouldn't wear a mask, and then changed to yes, we should wear a mask, and then, oh, everyone should wear goggles.

And just like you said, the sick people coming to the emergency room are down to something like 1.6 percent of all E.R. visits. So yes, there's a lot of things going right. And I think yes, we will see more cases, especially if you test on college campuses. We just put in another 50,000 cases, which are really, the people at that age do not have a significant problem typically with this. But if you start looking at states that are opening, like North Dakota, South Dakota, the virus had not been there before. And so we're going to get cases. The key here is that cases are not the most important metric. That's thinking that is back in March when we didn't know what we were doing here. Now we know that most people don't have a significant problem here. The key is protect the high risk people so that people don't die, do everything you can, double down like the president just did with his announcement about these very state-of-the-art tests being sent to senior centers, not just nursing homes, but all seniors, trying to protect them from people who come in with an infection, or to stop hospitals overcrowding, which we do not have, and to open society because prolonged lockdowns are destroying families, actually killing people from skipped medical care, all kinds of things happening.",

First of all, there is a history claim, which is flat out wrong, which is that in colonial times it was customary for colonizers to somehow raid an appropriate, take over, these black and brown children and, quote, civilize them in the ways of the white men, thus cutting them off from their own culture and their own parents. So to take a particular example which I know about, India, were there a lot of British couple that took over Indian kids and made them their own and then civilized them in the ways of the white men? First of all, I don't believe there is a single such case. But even if there were, this was extremely rare. This is hardly part of the normal practice of colonialism. And then, what does this have to do with Amy Coney Barrett? Did the Barretts put on safari suits and go down to Haiti and conduct a raid on black children and then spirited them off to South Bend, Indiana, and force them into the ways of the white men? This is absurd. You have a very poor country which has been the victim of one calamity after another, from famines to earthquakes, the Clintons. And then you have all these kids who are abandoned, orphans. And then the Barretts have taken over two of these kids, given them a better home, a loving home. So instead of praising this adoption, you get this bizarre, racialized attack on Amy Coney Barrett. And it's all the product of a demented theory that is very well-funded these days in academia.",

A spirited back and forth between President Trump and Vice President Biden on the most important issues facing us as a country. So, let's go through them one-by- one. First, on our COVID response. Now, we all know that Joe Biden was against the president's decision to shut down travel to China which undoubtedly saved a lot of lives.

      "utterance": "It's unbelievable. But the fact is this virus was a terrible tragedy and we dealt with it better than any country in the G7 because we didn't let it devastate our entire economy, which brings us to number two, the economy. Now Biden doesn't even bother trying to argue that he's going to raise your standard of living because he won't. The clear evidence shows that the Trump policies of deregulation keeping labor markets tight, tightening the screws on China and renegotiating NAFTA produced phenomenal results for working Americans. Of course, we had record low unemployment for blacks and Hispanics before the pandemic. We had record wage increases too from 2016 through 2019. Median wages rose to a record, an increase of $6000. Now, last year alone, it was up more than $4000. Now, even with the blue states that are slow to reopen, new home sales were near a 14 year high in August. It's amazing given what we've been through. Now. Biden will, of course, try to blur the lines on Trump's economic successes with an assist from his pals at The New York Times. Because their big scoop with pre-debate timing, of course, is that Donald Trump takes both business depreciation and business losses as tax deductions against income. Thus, in both 2016 and 2017, he paid $750 in taxes. Now, of course, the Times did its best to put this in the worst possible light, yet it could not conclude any wrongdoing on the president's part. Nevertheless, Biden's resuscitation squad, they think you're stupid. And they had the headline they needed."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But it didn't Stetler say that or Stelter said that about Vindman wasn't that the biggest thing ever? How many times have they said that? But look, dig a little deeper into the Times hit piece and it quickly just falls apart. For starters, the Times article actually shows that Trump has, in fact, paid tens of millions of dollars in federal income taxes. Trump also coughed up 24.3 million due to the alternative minimum tax before filing for refunds. Now, Trump would have paid a lot more in taxes. I love this if it wasn't for the Left's most legendary class warrior, Barack Obama. What am I talking about? Well, buried in the Times smear job is this little detail. Until 2009, business losses could be used to wipe away taxes going back only two years. But that November, the window was more than doubled in a bill Mr. Obama signed as part of the Great Recession recovery effort. So, are Americans to believe that Biden somehow isn't aware of his administration's position on business loss write-offs? Has Biden given the speeches advocating that individual business owners actually be taxed on their losses? I must have missed all those speeches. Now. In fact, the New York Times piece confirmed what we all had thought all along, that Trump ran for president at great financial sacrifice. So much for the alleged Emoluments Clause violation. The Trump Hotel in D.C. lost $55.5 million through 2018 and zero evidence, of course, of any financial entanglements of the former Soviet Union. No Russian collusion for the 900th time. So, when Biden raises the New York Times piece, he opens the door for Trump to hit his own son, who actually profited from his dad's government position, Hunter Biden received $3.5 million in a wire transfer from a Russian billionaire while daddy was handling Ukraine policy. The Times didn't go there, of course. Now, if this all feels familiar, that's because it is, because The Times has published a bombshell using parts of Trump's tax returns or financial records every single year he's been in office. And every time they do, we find out the same thing. Like millions of other American business owners, President Trump used legal tax deductions and credits to offset his overall tax burden. At least he actually employed people though, I was thinking about that today. What did Biden actually do to earn that? What does it $16 million he made in the two years after leaving office? And on the issue of racial and ANTIFA sponsored violence that will be tackled tonight, tomorrow night. Now, Biden should be asked this. What would he do if Left-wing protesters filled Lafayette Park across from the White House, would he clear the park or would he allow them to set up a permanent camp, as they've done in Portland? Will Biden commit to protecting federal statues? Including statues of Thomas Jefferson? How about Andrew Jackson? Would Biden protect Mt. Rushmore? President Trump's record is clear. He opposes violent protests and the desecration of public monuments. And for the issues of race and crime, Biden support of the very crime bill that has triggered so many protests while the Trump administration worked with Congress to lessen the severity of sentences for offenders. The whole Trump campaign is about fighting for Americans of all races, while Biden has traditionally sold out Americans of all races. Finally. Biden has insulted the country by saying that it is systematically racist. He claims to want to exercise international leadership, though. Now, why would anyone follow or help a country that's systematically racist? His own rhetoric makes it impossible for other countries to take him seriously. And finally, my favorite topic on the Supreme Court. The Constitution is clear and what's relevant here are not the wishes of Justice Ginsburg as much as we all want to honor her memory. What's relevant here are the wishes of tens of millions of Americans who voted for President Trump and also a Republican Senate. Those voters have a right to have their wishes carried out until Trump and those senators are out of office. The reality of the situation is that Biden wants to put radicals on the court who would impose a hard-Left social agenda on the nation. But Trump's judges, they respect the rule of law and they give power back to the people. Biden claims that this is about Obamacare, but that's nonsense. If Obamacare is unconstitutional, it could be fixed by statute. But when Left wingers impose things like abortion on all 50 states, no amount of legislating can address the issue or any concerns about it. So, if you trust the people and you want Trump style judges, or you trust the hard Left and you want to give them free reign over the rest of us. Then you've got to go with Biden. Thus, on all four major topics, Biden has major vulnerabilities, but let's face it, for 40 plus years, he's essentially been a professional debater. While Donald Trump was out building businesses, some very successful, Biden has been parked in D.C. getting very little done that matters except raising a lot of money and running for president three times. Not a charm. Tomorrow, we're going to see how the invisible candidate fares without the assistance of his handlers or Jill whisking him off stage when the questions get a little uncomfortable. I'll be watching. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow. Victor, I was thinking of this today, picking a president. It's kind of like picking someone to represent you in a negotiation. So, given Biden has been played for a sucker for much of his career, why the heck would anyone pick him to represent them?"

    {
      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION SENIOR FELLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, we're going to find out tomorrow night, because the criticism against Biden is, he's running a 19th century. William McKinley campaigned from his front porch. He's a virtual nonexistent candidate and he has a chance to show that that's wrong. So, for 90 minutes, he's going to buy the impression that he's cognitively challenged, or he has memory lapses. And it's very important because there's a whole generation of Democrats, especially millions of young people who don't know about old Joe Biden from Scranton. Laura, they don't know - they haven't seen him. He's been nonexistent until the few times he's been on TV. It's always in the scripted context. So, if he does well and does well will be defined probably by the lowest common denominator, that if he stands there for 90 minutes and doesn't do what he's been doing and is taped and scripted interviews, and that's going to multiply his advantage. On the other hand, if he says something like he's been in the Senate for 180 years or 200 million people have died of COVID or you ain't black, then that's going to have a full force multiplier effect. And the people are going to say, you know what, I've been had, this was a virtual con job. This guy has not been out, and this is why. So, it's up to him to dispel these impressions. The second thing is, we don't know what he stands for. The impression has been that he's been a vessel of the Left, so he's no longer a centrist, if he ever was. But he's carrying along these positions that are very radical and were refuted by the voters in the primary. I mean, Bernie didn't get the nomination and Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and Beto and Buttigieg, they all crashed and burned. But that sort of vampire like experience has resurrected itself and now it's being carried forth by Biden. And so, he's got to say, you know what? This is what I believe on fracking. And this is who I would support, whom I would support for the Supreme Court. But he won't do that, if he doesn't do that then it confirms again that impression that he's an empty vessel."

But, yes, it's tricky to pick someone of an advanced age who's obviously lost two or three steps. It's a risky deal, but maybe he can pull a rabbit out of his hat for 90 minutes.

It's a very complex deal. And she won't release her tax returns because I think it would show the same up and downs as Donald Trump. And so, she understands that better than anybody. And that's why she's not releasing them. And she knows better than anything. There's not much of an issue here because Donald Trump apparently hasn't done anything wrong until the IRS says he owes this or he's like Gavin Newsom and he's delinquent on his property tax. They haven't said that. I don't think that will be an issue. The issue, again is going to be, will Joe Biden dispel the rumors that he's cognitively challenged, and will he have an agenda where he can answer a specific question of what he's for?

Yes, so that's basically the import of the tweet. And this is where they're going on this. This is where they've been going that she's about to be confirmed. I'm going to get ahead of myself on the Supreme Court. But she obviously is submissive to her husband because of her membership of a devout group. It seems obvious that her husband, Jesse, must have commanded her to become a Supreme Court justice in their household. It's really honestly, I've known this family for 15 years. And if anybody subjugated in the family, it's Jesse. It's not Amy. He is an extraordinary guy and she is an extraordinary woman.

Because the reality is, I've been - I was called in because I can translate the medical science and the public policy. And I advise the president to do things like which he's doing, which is to do everything I can to protect the vulnerable, to open schools and open society and to make sure hospitals are not overcrowded. And of course, this is the right policy. It may not be the policy that everyone agrees with, but it happens to be exactly the policy in concert with most of the many of the world's leading epidemiologists, infectious disease people like doctors called Lee (ph) at Harvard, Dr. Bhattacharya at Stanford, Dr. Gupta and Hanigan (ph) at Oxford University. I think that's pretty good company for the president. He clearly listens to a lot of people. He understands in a very common-sense way what the science shows and what should be done to save the American really American lives. And that's why I'm here. I'm not here to make friends, I mean, there are certain experts that say what I just said, which is vulnerable people protection and save lives by also opening society safely. And there are other experts that say things like no, you shouldn't wear masks to yes, we should wear masks to, hey, a mask is a better than a vaccine, or some other expert might say no, you shouldn't wear a mask, and then changed to yes, we should wear a mask, and then, oh, everyone should wear goggles.

E.R. visits for influenza-like illness are below baseline from a year ago. Deaths from pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, almost back to the seasonal baseline. So this is data. That's the CDC's own data. So where is the disconnect? I'm not a scientist, I'm not trying to be, but I can read a graph pretty. So what are the people missing?"

      "speaker": "ATLAS",
      "utterance": "There's more data that corroborates what you said, which is that hospitalizations are down to basically nearly the lowest level since March for COVID. Deaths per week are down something like 50 percent from the peak in July, and very low, down toward what it was in March -- before the peak in March, April. And just like you said, the sick people coming to the emergency room are down to something like 1.6 percent of all E.R. visits. So yes, there's a lot of things going right. And I think yes, we will see more cases, especially if you test on college campuses. We just put in another 50,000 cases, which are really, the people at that age do not have a significant problem typically with this. But if you start looking at states that are opening, like North Dakota, South Dakota, the virus had not been there before. And so we're going to get cases. The key here is that cases are not the most important metric. That's thinking that is back in March when we didn't know what we were doing here. Now we know that most people don't have a significant problem here. The key is protect the high risk people so that people don't die, do everything you can, double down like the president just did with his announcement about these very state-of-the-art tests being sent to senior centers, not just nursing homes, but all seniors, trying to protect them from people who come in with an infection, or to stop hospitals overcrowding, which we do not have, and to open society because prolonged lockdowns are destroying families, actually killing people from skipped medical care, all kinds of things happening."

But I think it is appropriate to use social mitigation, hand washing, we have to do everything we can to protect the vulnerable, particularly when there's a lot of cases.

First of all, there is a history claim, which is flat out wrong, which is that in colonial times it was customary for colonizers to somehow raid an appropriate, take over, these black and brown children and, quote, civilize them in the ways of the white men, thus cutting them off from their own culture and their own parents. So to take a particular example which I know about, India, were there a lot of British couple that took over Indian kids and made them their own and then civilized them in the ways of the white men? First of all, I don't believe there is a single such case. But even if there were, this was extremely rare. This is hardly part of the normal practice of colonialism. And then, what does this have to do with Amy Coney Barrett? Did the Barretts put on safari suits and go down to Haiti and conduct a raid on black children and then spirited them off to South Bend, Indiana, and force them into the ways of the white men? This is absurd. You have a very poor country which has been the victim of one calamity after another, from famines to earthquakes, the Clintons. And then you have all these kids who are abandoned, orphans. And then the Barretts have taken over two of these kids, given them a better home, a loving home.
