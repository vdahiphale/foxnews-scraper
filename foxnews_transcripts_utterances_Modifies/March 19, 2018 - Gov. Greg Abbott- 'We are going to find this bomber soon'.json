Good evening, everybody, I'm Martha MacCallum and this 'The Story.' We have followed all the breaking developments from Austin. And we now know that the 8:30 bombing that went off was activated by a trip wire the size of fishing line. They say that it shows a much higher level of sophistication the way this bomb was constructed, and a higher level of skill. Two young men, in their 20s, rode over this thing while they were riding their bikes near a trail. The wire was attached to a street sign. So, just moments from now, we're going to be joined exclusively by Texas Governor, Gregg abbot. But first, Fox News' Casey Stegall, who has been on the ground in Austin all day and brings us the brand-new developments tonight for the story. Hi, Casey.",

It gives you a sense of how urgent this really is and there was visible concern on Chief Brian Manley's face when he informed the press that last night's bomb, as you said, was more advanced than the previous three. Complete with this trip wire and the device was hidden along a fence in this normally quiet neighborhood meaning it was put there to randomly detonate on whoever reached it first.",

So, two men were seriously hurt when they were riding by on a bicycle, and they think that they inadvertently hit that line, triggering the blast.

And that's one of the reasons so many additional resources have been brought in because we understanding, literally, hundreds and hundreds of phone calls and tips are coming in.

But, instead of just gathering information on those who downloaded app, Cambridge also had access to their friends' list, and their friends' friends list. So, 270,000 users became 50 million.

Good evening, everybody, I'm Martha MacCallum and this 'The Story.' We have followed all the breaking developments from Austin. And we now know that the 8:30 bombing that went off was activated by a trip wire the size of fishing line. They say that it shows a much higher level of sophistication the way this bomb was constructed, and a higher level of skill. Two young men, in their 20s, rode over this thing while they were riding their bikes near a trail. The wire was attached to a street sign. So, just moments from now, we're going to be joined exclusively by Texas Governor, Gregg abbot.

That's just the federal level, we're not even talking about all of the local and state law enforcement resources that are being diverted to Austin to work this, especially when you have the police chief coming out at a press conference today like he did and used the words 'serial bomber.' It gives you a sense of how urgent this really is and there was visible concern on Chief Brian Manley's face when he informed the press that last night's bomb, as you said, was more advanced than the previous three. Complete with this trip wire and the device was hidden along a fence in this normally quiet neighborhood meaning it was put there to randomly detonate on whoever reached it first."

The one here in this neighborhood known as Travis Country, well, it was just placed sitting next to a fence. So, two men were seriously hurt when they were riding by on a bicycle, and they think that they inadvertently hit that line, triggering the blast. So, as this investigation ramps up, authorities are imploring the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious packages to authorities. And that's one of the reasons so many additional resources have been brought in because we understanding, literally, hundreds and hundreds of phone calls and tips are coming in. Obviously, all of those have to be looked at and researched and exhausted so it's going to take a lot of man power, but they are throwing a lot at it since a lot clearly at stake."

But understand this, and that is, in addition to the hundreds of federal officers that are here, the State of Texas Department of Public Safety has added more than 100 officers, and that is on top of what is going on at the local level with the Austin Police Department. We've also added these bomb dogs, and today, from the State of Texas, we authorized and spent $260,000 for these bomb x- ray machines to look at all these packages that Casey Stegall was talking about that people are afraid to open up. But, Martha, the clear message we want to get to people are two things: one, law enforcement at all levels are on top of this in a way bigger than what we've ever seen before.

Ironically, President Obama's campaign was lauded in 2008 and 2012 for their innovation on the data front. Remember all of that? Targeting voters, creating the modern social media campaign, and then Hillary wanted to buy all that information and there was all this stuff about whether or not they were going to sell it to her or give it to her.

But, instead of just gathering information on those who downloaded app, Cambridge also had access to their friends' list, and their friends' friends list. So, 270,000 users became 50 million.

Critics are not convinced and Congressional Democrats are calling for public hearings with testimony from whistleblower you just heard from and Mark Zuckerberg, among others. And Facebook, which is shocked and outraged is conducting a digital forensic audit to get to the bottom of this. Though Facebook did not have the same shock and outrage in 2012 when the Obama campaign reportedly did the same thing -- got a million Obama supporters to download an app and then had access to all of their friends. It is how the Obama campaign reportedly got ahold of 85 percent of young people with unlisted cell phone numbers.

It's the same thing with politics -- they're tracking you, they're trying to find microtarget voters to see who likes, you know -- if Philippe's campaign wants to know who liked the Planned Parenthood page because they want to send them Hillary Clinton is going to protect your right to choose.

Think of it this way -- and let me try to put this in nonpartisan terms: there are millions of people watching this show right now, they all have cable, maybe they have HBO, maybe they don't. Maybe their cable company tells HBO, hey, this person is not a subscriber, maybe you can. All right. Maybe, we all live that's that that's OK. Imagine for a second, though, that your cable company knew that you put the volume down when there was a piece of news about parents breaking up or parents who lost a child, or they knew you changed the channel when there was something about child abuse, and they sold that to say a drug company, and they decided to sell that for the purpose of selling you an anti- depressant. I don't think most Americans think that that's what's happening. When you think of Facebook, you are like, OK, my aunt had some pictures of my birthday and maybe a picnic I went to in the office.

Another Dem recently added. 'Does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is no collusion,' the president writes.

We've just had 2 million people go off food stamps to go to work in the last year. We've had the second lowest black unemployment in American history. I mean, the president ought to just drop this whole line of worrying about Mueller, focus on being president. Mueller is going to be taken care of. Mueller in the end is, I think, not going to have anything substantive about the president. And in some ways, he's going to end up looking pretty silly because he ends up going after Manafort, for example, for things that happened in 2014, 2013. Well, that had nothing to do with the campaign. That had nothing to do with why Mueller was given this assignment.

The fact is that Brennan has always been, I think, an outlier in the intelligence community. He's a guy who thought we could find moderates, for example, among Hezbollah, which I don't know of any real expert thinks that's possible. So, I mean, you know, Brennan can be as nasty and as mean- spirited as he wants to be. The fact is it wasn't the president who fired McCabe. It was the inspector general --"

He's an attacker. We watched him, you know, rip apart stall warts of the Republican Party, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush on that stage because he thought they were coming at him. It's clear that there is a battle royal going on to take this president down. No matter which side you're on, you have to acknowledge that that is what's happening.

I think he's done things that nobody else could have done. I think that he is, in fact, shaking up the city. My only advice as a matter of being competent is it doesn't further him to highlight a Mueller versus Trump fight. It furthers him to highlight the Trump administration, what Trump is accomplishing, and make -- and shrink Mueller to what he is. I mean, Mueller is a very small figure compared to the President of the United States."

You know you've got the Stormy Daniels investigation. You've got the FBI investigation. You've got which is -- you know, part of Russia. And then, you've got, as you pointed out in your recent piece, all of these very positive policy developments and structural improvements and a lot of what's going on.

But when you look at, for example, more regulations repealed in his first year than all the other American presidents in history combined. You look at the size of the tax cuts. You look at what he's done in terms of conservative judges. This is a president who is very consequential. He is making a big difference. And I think if he focuses on communicating that he strengthens his party for 2018. If he focuses on these other things that are junk, he weakens his party for 2018. He has a big role to play here. He is the leader of the country. And he's the leader of the Republican Party. And this election is very important that he get across the right messages to maximize us winning, because if he gets the wrong messages, frankly, he's going to lose the house and that will lead to two years of a nightmare."

In Indiana, one high school football coach has found a way to try to deal with this one player at the time by keeping them showing up in practice and keeping them on the field. His town of Madison has been especially hard hit by this crisis, and he's made it his mission to coach his players not only on the field, but off the field, worrying less about winning games and more about having an impact on these young men and helping them day by day to make better decisions.

And then, that Thursday evening, I received a phone call that said that my brother had been arrested for heroin. And, obviously, at that time, it was kind of like very life altering. But moments before I interviewed the next day, I took this opportunity to take a negative that happened in my life and turn it into a positive and use it as an opportunity and, kind of, open the door that I would be able to not only influence lives of current players that I'd be working, but influence lives of, hopefully, you know, the future generation of people who are going to be leaders throughout our community."

And over the years, you know, guys that went on and graduated, I think they're all very productive citizens of our community. Many of them went on to college. And a lot of, you know, I have a few players that are even playing in college, so making big impacts after high school. And I'm very, very proud of the kids that I get to work with and I think that, you know, they're doing a great job. As I told them when this story came out, I told the players that, you know, they are -- somebody came up to me and said, man, coach, you're a star, you're in the New York Times. Bu I told the kids that day after workout, that afternoon I told them that they're the stars because if it wasn't for the kids being there, you know, then I wouldn't have a calling to be there. I feel that, you know, I was placed there for a reason. And I'm just trying to fulfill my job each day and changing these kids' lives, but helping them to become those future leaders."
