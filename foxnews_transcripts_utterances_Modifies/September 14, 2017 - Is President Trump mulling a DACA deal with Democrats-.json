It is 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Fox News alert: North Korea just fired a ballistic missile that flew over Japan before crashing into the Pacific Ocean. The launch is yet another escalation to the crisis and comes just days after the United Nations passed a new set of strict sanctions against North Korea.  For details, let's bring in the Fox News chief national correspondent Ed Henry effectually known as the sixth.",

      "sentences": "Good to see you, Dana.  Even though Greg doesn't like me, I like all of you. The bottom-line is, it is a serious, tense situation here at the White House tonight. We've just gotten a statement from the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii, they are taking the lead on this. The U.S. military declaring tonight that there was no threat to North America or to Guam and it's important to note but also they're saying they are monitoring this closely. Because as you reported, this missile flew over Japan, our key ally in the region. President Trump also was in fact briefed on the situation by his chief-of- staff, General John Kelly also monitoring this tonight is the Defense Secretary James Mattis. Remember, he recently warned North Korea it would be annihilated if the U.S. military used its war plant. We're hearing that as his missile was launched, Mattis and the head of U.S. nuclear forces, they were talking to reporters and the interview ended abruptly with the general asking staff, did something happen?  Well, what happened is the North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un launched an intermediate range ballistic missile. He launched it eastward from North Korea, it flew over the territory of Northern Japan before landing in the Pacific Ocean. This missile's flight is key, it was about 2300 miles. Significant because that means Guam is now at in North Korea's range with a missile like this. It's also an in-your-face move because as you noted it's coming just days after the U.S. rallied the UN Security Council to pass tough new sanctions against North Korea led by Ambassador Nikki Haley there. The President warned recent days that even tougher sanctions may be coming. And next Tuesday, the President, himself, will be at the UN delivering his first ever speech to the general assembly in New York where North Korea of course will be front and center. And tonight, the U.S. Pacific Command is declaring that our defense of Japan and South Korea is, quote, \"Ironclad.\" And that the U.S. is ready to, quote, \"defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation.\" So, that is from the U.S. military tonight which is watching all of this very closely -- Dana.",

This is going to add value and then they're going to owe me. He needs to be able to reach across party lines like we have talk about to get this support because he has very like thin support to get something over the hurdle, legislatively, as we have seen by the repeated attempts, as it relates to healthcare and other things.  So immigration, you mentioned earlier on Special Report, maybe the one thing that he is really able to, you know, jump across and get to the other side but on the flipside, a lot of these hard-core supporters despite some more broad base Republicans are not happy with. And they think that this is a sidestep away in abandoning the principles that he campaigned on and they tied the wall in. But he doesn't want them to lose faith because he's saying, listen to me, I am going to take care of the wall, I still intend to do it.

So, basically traded away something that he really didn't have to trade. So, that was kind of a nice little trick that you do.   It's kind of like when a kid, for his birthday takes his dad to the store and he wants these $200 pair of shoes but he knows his dad wants to pay that so he points at the $1200 bike and his dad goes, no, you're not getting that. And he goes, how about this shoes and the dad goes, yes, it's a little, something a smart kid does. There is a couple of other things. Number one, he still has to make a deal. If he catch chain migration and he gets e-verified, he gets money, build a wall or part of a wall or something of a wall, it's a pretty good deal. But the bigger thing is and what he did, the big picture, the idea of building the wall created a shift in the conversation. I am not saying, he created the conversation, immigration. We were talking about on \"The Five\" for five years, that's what he got a lot of it.  But he forced the media to confront an entire population who are unhappy about the border. That is what he did. We didn't do that. He did that. It also helped him win, the build the wall as a meaning which is enhanced border protection, was one of the three legs of that table, which was law, you know, of the table of law and order, it was immigration, police and national security. That is what got him in. So, in the big picture, it got him a win and created a shift in the conversation. If he can do this deal, he's a winner.",

You know, she likes me. Anyway, he likes us and that you have to take a step left and a step right, otherwise you get boxed in, says Schumer. I think that right now, the reality is, I don't give much credence to the idea of the wall has funded anybody's budget and I don't think that is really going to happen, at the moment. It may down the road. I could be wrong. But I think what I give credence too, is the idea that Steve King says, this is going to blow up his President Trump's base or Ann Coulter says, well, who does not want Trump impeached at this point because she is now knows that the left wants him out. He is not living up to the promise that Jesse articulated. What interests me is, the actual legislation on the floor. Democrats proposing a vote on the Dream Act. So, that is what they're putting in- front of Trump. Republicans on the other hand has something called recognizing America's children. Now, what is the big difference? The big difference is that the Dream Act will give you a conditional residency, which is a pathway to citizenship.   What about Republican plan? You have to apply for that residency but is still a pathway to citizenship. So, you can imagine Steve Bannon at Breitbart just saying this is, you know, a free pass.",

It is about the idea that there is so many people on the left who say you do not give a platform to people who delivered these harsh, conservative messages. I don't think, by the way Ben qualifies as one of those people. But this coming weekend or next weekend will have a free speech week and will get people like milo Yiannopoulos and get Steve Bannon and will be outside and to me this is a magnet for trouble and I think they are doing it intentionally to embarrass Berkeley and say you guys are a bunch of -- what did you call them, bedwetters?",

But the wage increase does not just nailed the wallet, it goes after your butt. If you are currently in a Seattle bathroom, suffering from an acute bout of Montezuma's revenge after eating chili cheese fries at your local grease pit, you can thank that minimum wage increase for your disgusting discomfort. Follow my logic: Another news study found that for every dollar increased in the minimum wage there is a 6 percent jump in health code violations. Hence the trots, Dana -- I could tell you were puzzled. When businesses get hit with a financial burden, they not only cut workers and hours, they cut corners -- maybe hygiene. Poor cleanliness -- as you could see by my chart that I drew -- can migrate to your plate which then goes to your stomach and then down to the bathroom where you end up counting the tiles until midnight. This is science. You can thank shortsighted liberals for this and, of course, the solution will be more government as officials fine the restaurant until they close up. Further proving that the only true radicals left are small business owners who chase dreams despite obstacles foisted upon them by useless bureaucrats who have never ran a damn thing in their lives. Forget daredevils, their risks are minimal compared to the guy or gal trying to start something up and keep it going. Thanks to the punitive big government it gets flushed down the toilet. I will be auctioning this wonderful piece of artwork later. Juan, what do you think of my theory, as tenuous as it might be that the minimum wage gives you diarrhea?",

      "utterance": "Good to see you, Dana. Even though Greg doesn't like me, I like all of you. The bottom-line is, it is a serious, tense situation here at the White House tonight. We've just gotten a statement from the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii, they are taking the lead on this. The U.S. military declaring tonight that there was no threat to North America or to Guam and it's important to note but also they're saying they are monitoring this closely. Because as you reported, this missile flew over Japan, our key ally in the region. President Trump also was in fact briefed on the situation by his chief-of- staff, General John Kelly also monitoring this tonight is the Defense Secretary James Mattis. Remember, he recently warned North Korea it would be annihilated if the U.S. military used its war plant. We're hearing that as his missile was launched, Mattis and the head of U.S. nuclear forces, they were talking to reporters and the interview ended abruptly with the general asking staff, did something happen? Well, what happened is the North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un launched an intermediate range ballistic missile. He launched it eastward from North Korea, it flew over the territory of Northern Japan before landing in the Pacific Ocean. This missile's flight is key, it was about 2300 miles. Significant because that means Guam is now at in North Korea's range with a missile like this. It's also an in-your-face move because as you noted it's coming just days after the U.S. rallied the UN Security Council to pass tough new sanctions against North Korea led by Ambassador Nikki Haley there. The President warned recent days that even tougher sanctions may be coming. And next Tuesday, the President, himself, will be at the UN delivering his first ever speech to the general assembly in New York where North Korea of course will be front and center. And tonight, the U.S. Pacific Command is declaring that our defense of Japan and South Korea is, quote, \"Ironclad.\" And that the U.S. is ready to, quote, \"defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation.\" So, that is from the U.S. military tonight which is watching all of this very closely -- Dana."

This is going to add value and then they're going to owe me. He needs to be able to reach across party lines like we have talk about to get this support because he has very like thin support to get something over the hurdle, legislatively, as we have seen by the repeated attempts, as it relates to healthcare and other things. So immigration, you mentioned earlier on Special Report, maybe the one thing that he is really able to, you know, jump across and get to the other side but on the flipside, a lot of these hard-core supporters despite some more broad base Republicans are not happy with. And they think that this is a sidestep away in abandoning the principles that he campaigned on and they tied the wall in. But he doesn't want them to lose faith because he's saying, listen to me, I am going to take care of the wall, I still intend to do it. Don't get distracted by the machinations of, you know, Schumer and Pelosi. We're going to do part of a deal with them. And I have a clever way to get it in elsewhere."

So, basically traded away something that he really didn't have to trade. So, that was kind of a nice little trick that you do. It's kind of like when a kid, for his birthday takes his dad to the store and he wants these $200 pair of shoes but he knows his dad wants to pay that so he points at the $1200 bike and his dad goes, no, you're not getting that. And he goes, how about this shoes and the dad goes, yes, it's a little, something a smart kid does. There is a couple of other things. Number one, he still has to make a deal. If he catch chain migration and he gets e-verified, he gets money, build a wall or part of a wall or something of a wall, it's a pretty good deal. But the bigger thing is and what he did, the big picture, the idea of building the wall created a shift in the conversation. I am not saying, he created the conversation, immigration. We were talking about on \"The Five\" for five years, that's what he got a lot of it. But he forced the media to confront an entire population who are unhappy about the border. That is what he did. We didn't do that. He did that. It also helped him win, the build the wall as a meaning which is enhanced border protection, was one of the three legs of that table, which was law, you know, of the table of law and order, it was immigration, police and national security. That is what got him in. So, in the big picture, it got him a win and created a shift in the conversation. If he can do this deal, he's a winner."

The DACA deal, the base -- over about that. I understand that. It is not amnesty though. He is not delivering a pathway to citizenship. If there is amnesty for the Dreamers, people are going to have a hard time stomaching that. I support DACA, but if they cut in line and they're delivered amnesty, I am going to have a hard time dealing with that. I think a lot of people are too.

You know, she likes me. Anyway, he likes us and that you have to take a step left and a step right, otherwise you get boxed in, says Schumer. I think that right now, the reality is, I don't give much credence to the idea of the wall has funded anybody's budget and I don't think that is really going to happen, at the moment. It may down the road. I could be wrong. But I think what I give credence too, is the idea that Steve King says, this is going to blow up his President Trump's base or Ann Coulter says, well, who does not want Trump impeached at this point because she is now knows that the left wants him out. He is not living up to the promise that Jesse articulated. What interests me is, the actual legislation on the floor. Democrats proposing a vote on the Dream Act. So, that is what they're putting in- front of Trump. Republicans on the other hand has something called recognizing America's children. Now, what is the big difference? The big difference is that the Dream Act will give you a conditional residency, which is a pathway to citizenship. What about Republican plan? You have to apply for that residency but is still a pathway to citizenship. So, you can imagine Steve Bannon at Breitbart just saying this is, you know, a free pass."

And so far, that is just about the most egregious behavior we have seen here. School officials have spent a lot of time in more than $600,000 to make sure tonight's event is safe calling in officers from all 10 UC campuses to help secure the area where Ben Shapiro is set to speak in just about half an hour. Police say they will confront anyone wearing a mask if they refuse to take it off. That is warning to Antifa protesters who rioted and cause violence in conservative events here in the past. Several nearby business that were vandalized or taking no chances closing early and protecting their property with security gates. Thanks to the new city policy, police can also use pepper spray if the crowds get out of hand. School officials say all these measures are needed for security, but some critics say, Berkeley is hardly a beacon of free speech, if this is what it takes to host a one conservative speaker here on campus and will see if it is enough and will keep you posted."

It is about the idea that there is so many people on the left who say you do not give a platform to people who delivered these harsh, conservative messages.

To me, when I see people being close minded like people like Condoleezza Rice, people should be excited for people like her to come speak. I have turned down things were I think it is not a good idea for me to go speak, because of problems they are having on some of these campuses."
