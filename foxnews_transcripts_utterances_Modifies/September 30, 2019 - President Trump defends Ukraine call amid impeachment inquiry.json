It's not a bombshell. As you note, it has been reported for months prior to now.  And it's important that this be investigated. We had for several years a dangerous and damning conspiracy theory that was perpetrated throughout the media and by powerful Democratic politicians and power people in our own government, and it was done in conjunction with some people in other countries. It's important that if we are to have free and fair elections that we understand how this dangerous theory got spread, who was involved with it.  And it also helps explain why there's so much pushback about this investigation. This might be the type of thing where it doesn't look good. There was a lot of involvement with Democratic National Committee folks in Ukraine, and other countries that were involved in this, and they might not want that coming to light.

But they need to come up with their cast of nasties that they say are part of the deep state. I assume the whistleblower will be a key figure in their counternarrative that they're going to push forward, this person is unreliable, it's a liar, they donated to a Democrat, whatever they will be able to find about whoever is involved in this, so that they can say the president is the real victim here. That's their need."

      "utterance": "That is my understanding. This has not been completely resolved, but it seems like the Democratic leadership would like to stick to this episode. They feel it is easy to understand. If Robert Mueller's report was this extremely large tome that no one read, the complaint and the transcript of the call is light beach reading. You can read it on your lunch hour and decide for yourself if the president abused his office."

      "utterance": "It is particularly interesting when you think about what Senator Grassley and Senator Johnson did in their letters to the Department of Justice today. They asked why two years ago, more than two years ago, they notified the Department of Justice about problems with Ukraine meddling in the 2016 election and got no word back at all. That would've been clearly within the scope of what the Mueller investigation should have been looking into. That they weren't, speaks to the problems that people have with that very partisan probe."
