And a forceful statement on the growing economy on the wake of a very good jobs report that the Wall Street Journal called, \"A bad day in certain media and political precincts.\" And when it comes to the wall, it may be Democrats who disagree with Nancy Pelosi on this, who make up the most important audience for the president tomorrow night.

So, if I were the president, what I would do is use the power of commander in chief to go down to the border, not just send troops but actually erect barriers. What's the difference between a soldier being sent to secure the border, and a soldier being sent to put up barrier to secure the border? Legally none.   To my Republican colleagues, we do not need a war over the wall. The Democrats are pushing back to the president.

So, support for the wall has actually gone up. Shutting the government down was not the right way to build the wall, we learned that. But the $5.7 billion, Martha, is what it costs to take the top 10 locations where we need a barrier and build it. We just didn't make that number up.

And a forceful statement on the growing economy on the wake of a very good jobs report that the Wall Street Journal called, \"A bad day in certain media and political precincts.\" And when it comes to the wall, it may be Democrats who disagree with Nancy Pelosi on this, who make up the most important audience for the president tomorrow night.

But it doesn't look like Nancy Pelosi is going to give Democrats much space. So, if I were the president, what I would do is use the power of commander in chief to go down to the border, not just send troops but actually erect barriers. What's the difference between a soldier being sent to secure the border, and a soldier being sent to put up barrier to secure the border? Legally none.

So, what's the difference between 3,700 people going down to the border to deal with a caravan that's coming our way and while they're there, erecting barriers where it makes sense.

So, support for the wall has actually gone up. Shutting the government down was not the right way to build the wall, we learned that. But the $5.7 billion, Martha, is what it costs to take the top 10 locations where we need a barrier and build it. We just didn't make that number up. If you ask the Border Patrol, the Department of Homeland Security, where the top 10 places you need a barrier? They told us the top 10 and it comes to five-seven."

The economy is growing faster than even I envisioned. So, economically, domestically, we're doing good overseas, we're stronger than we've ever been, and this president is determined to build a wall that Chuck Schumer voted for.

So, what the Democrats are doing, they are chasing the hardest of the left in their party, abolish ICE, building a wall is immoral even though we have walls already built. 90 percent tax rates on people creating jobs. I am confident that Medicare for all means Medicare for nobody. So, if you're out there watching, and you just signed up for Medicare, the Democrats are going to invite 80 million of their closest friends to come in on a program you work for all your life.

There is no deal to be done with ISIS or al-Qaeda, you have to keep them from coming here. The reason our soldiers are there in Afghanistan is a wall between us and the terrorist in Afghanistan. Why are we in Syria? Is make sure that ISIS is pinned down over there so they can't come here. President Trump has done a lot with the future.

No missiles have been fired, no bombs have been exploded since Trump's taking a firm stand. I'm looking for a breakthrough. It only comes through negotiation. But he's got to convince Kim Jong-un that you got two options. You're better off without nuclear weapons versus having them because he's not going to let Kim Jong-un threat America with a nuclear arsenal that could actually hit us through a missile being developed as we speak.

This time, it is about the man who would replace him as lieutenant governor. It's an allegation of sexual misconduct from 14 years ago, and it landed by message on Facebook. The allegation cropped up in 2017 also. But it was dug into by the Washington Post. They declined to run the story. They felt that it was not corroborated enough for them to go with and that there was no similar history of that kind of behavior by Fairfax.

We're living in today of always believed the woman but we also need to live in the day of believing everyone until there is some true evidence that has veracity otherwise none of us can live in our culture anymore because we can easily be accused and we can't prove we didn't do something just because somebody pointed a finger at us and said you know what, I remember something from 30 years ago, ten years ago, 15 years ago.

There are writings from 1994 that are also considered to be problematic from college. She said that a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober and if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice.

The man who took this video, which police say is authentic, was also on the train but stepped out and began recording. It shows the victim struggling with his attackers, which could be two or three men, but the man on the gray jacket and colorful scarf appears to have a gun. And as the victim tries to grab it, the shots begin. Watch this. Yes. In all five or six shots were fired and the victim who was hit in the face fell. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Other bystanders who were trying to up the fight, but a witness says a transit worker refused to step in and that may have cost the victim his life. The attackers all fled from the subway. And again, police initially were looking for two men, but the video shows there may have been a third today. Today the 26-year-old alleged gunman was arrested. His name has not been released and the murder weapon not found, but police said the man is a member of the brutally violent MS-13 street gang and is known to police. Watch."

Probably also a lot of candidates, the sort of the narrative has flipped over to the Democratic side when we look ahead here. So, some of what is going on in terms of the messages, tax the rich which is enormously popular according to the polls. Medicare for all is also one of the big themes that we're seeing.

I also think Joe Biden speaks to the kind of voters Democrats know they need to get back, in the upper Midwest, in the rustbelt, in states like Pennsylvania. It's Democrats -- people who used to vote democratic, right?

I mean, for Republicans this last cycle they got a chance to debate where the party sits on immigration, where the party sits on health care.

To me, and to the average American, I think, but basically who cares how he runs his schedule as long as he gets things done. Nicolle Wallace, the Bush White House aide who hosts the show on MSNBC, says the secret is out. Trump doesn't do much of anything.

      "utterance": "But speaking to members of Congress, reacting to policy, calling people, to me it sounds like he is sitting in the residence doing similar work that he might be doing in the Oval Office. I think a lot of Americans sort of understand that the lifestyle has kind of changed in the world in terms of where people do their work."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, even if he just needs time to think. I mean, the president doesn't have to be boxed in from early morning to early night with back-to-back-to-back briefings, and that's not Trump's style anyway. But you know, this isn't a policy leak where somebody is trying to get him to move a little bit on Syria or Afghanistan or border security. It's totally personal. And of course, the president increasingly thinks that he can't trust the people around him because no matter how leakers he gets rid of these things still -- I mean, as a reporter, I love leaks. But this is so personal that it really does raise question about who can the president can trust on his own staff?"

We'll be here doing live coverage throughout the whole evening, Bret Baier and I. So, he is including Alice Johnson, who is the woman who was freed from prison after many years, mostly at the behest of Kim Kardashian."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You know, there is a reason that every president, since Ronald Reagan who pioneered the technique, has these guests to illustrate issues important to them, and that it works. It humanizes the policy. It gives people a chance to see actual human beings. Democrats will bring in their own guests to score their political points. I understand there is a young kid whose last name is Trump was bullied in school. Now, that is a nice touch."
