That was President Trump this week in Indianapolis touting the Republican's long-awaited blueprint for overhauling the U.S. tax code. Details of the plan released Wednesday include reducing individual tax brackets, from seven to three, doubling the standard deduction for individuals and married couples, and eliminating the so-called debt tax. But the lynchpin is a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, a provision the president has called nonnegotiable. Former Texas Senator Phil Gramm was chair of the Senate Banking Committee. He's now a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.  Welcome, Senator. Great to have you here.

And, of course, the government would get $2.2 trillion in new revenue. Economically, I think the plan is right. And I think, politically, it's very strong because it's exactly what Republicans promised in the campaign they would do. And voters don't like to be surprised. They don't like it when you say, I'm going to do something and then you turn around and do something else. So I'm very pleased with the outline.",

If there are legitimate issues about the relationships between the police and black people in the inner city, let Colin Kaepernick or the rest of them give speeches and talk about it at length so people understand the protest.

Details of the plan released Wednesday include reducing individual tax brackets, from seven to three, doubling the standard deduction for individuals and married couples, and eliminating the so-called debt tax. But the lynchpin is a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, a provision the president has called nonnegotiable.

And, of course, the government would get $2.2 trillion in new revenue. Economically, I think the plan is right. And I think, politically, it's very strong because it's exactly what Republicans promised in the campaign they would do. And voters don't like to be surprised. They don't like it when you say, I'm going to do something and then you turn around and do something else. So I'm very pleased with the outline."

You've got a lot of people that have small businesses, they -- they are tired of running the business, but they are afraid to sell it because they'll have to pay a big capital gains tax. And when they dye, they have to pay a death tax. So you have all these assets frozen. You will open those up if bill becomes law. And the economic growth impact of that is grossly underestimated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "That's interesting, because the rap on the death tax is, well, the only people who pay that -- 2 percent of estates pay that so it only goes to the wealthiest people. You're saying that, in fact, I guess this is true if you look at the evidence, the wealthy, Warren Buffet, they will create their own foundations and never pay the tax. It's the rancher, the small business person, the person who builds up a more modest portfolio who ends up paying for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAMM",
      "utterance": "Yes, what happens is people build up assets, they build up a successful farm, a successful business, and then they get to the age where they don't want to run it, they are not doing a terribly good job at it, but they can't afford to sell it. And so you get assets that are misused, misused. It affects economic growth. And if you let them sell it, they pay capital gain's taxes on it. So you're going to gain revenues immediately. But, more importantly, you are going to get businesses in the hands of people who want to run them. And, look, nobody except a very small group of redistributionists is in favor of the death tax. People work all their lives, build up assets and business, and then you come and tax them again when they die? I would say that 80 percent of the American people are not for that tax."

      "speaker": "GRAMM",

Secondly, the Reagan tax cut actually raised revenue by 19 percent by the time Reagan left office, even though it broke the back of inflation and indexed the tax code inflation. So I think that this can, and I believe, it will work. And secondly, we can never deal with the deficit with a weak economy. If we are going to have a European economy, we are going to have European debt and we are going to have European taxes. And also, remember, Obama raised taxes on high-income individuals. He was going to get $690 billion over 10 years. Well, what happened? What happened is we ended up with slow growth."

Even though it's going to hurt people like us temporarily, what it does is it creates a big incentive for the high-taxed, poorly run states, like we live in, to reform.

I don't see the big problem coming out of the House this time. But you go over into the Senate, what happened with the health care bill with Senators McCain and Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, there's something about the Senators who just don't feel like they can -- they want to win, that they have to express themselves more for reasons of their own egos, than actually getting a bill done. Now you've got Senator Marco Rubio and Mike Lee already proposing to double the child tax credit, which could really through a spanner in the bill, because it completely disrupts the calculations they've made to make the bill work out all right.

There's been members of the cabinets of both this administration, perhaps, and Obama's administration who have done it as well. In 2013, Charles Grassley, Senator Grassley, released a government accountability report that noted that Eric Holder, then the attorney general, and, of all people, Robert Mueller, former FBI director, now special prosecutor, himself engaged in this sort of practice, reimbursing the government at some sort of set rate.

And do remember even the past week there's been story that Trump is now trying to push Attorney General Jeff Sessions out.

Lovely horse race, I'm sure. They end up reimbursing a fraction of what it actually costs to fly everyone up there. But as you say, I think if you're in the Trump cabinet, you have to understand both that the media is at war with Donald Trump, so it's going to be a bigger deal than it is going to be with the Obama administration.

People said, Mr. President, he can help you sell to the House and the Senate, and he didn't get it done. And Trump didn't say it's my fault, sorry. No. He says, your fault, you're out."

I think that the style of politician that Roy Moore is, is something that is ascendant in this country and that, too, scares the establishment Republicans, this sort of attitude that everyone is corrupted in Washington.

I mean, President Trump, Donald Trump went to Alabama and campaigned hard for Luther Strange. But Steve Bannon, who until recently was chief political adviser in the White House, Steve Bannon went to Alabama and campaigned for Judge Moore, against Donald Trump. Sarah Palin went to Alabama and campaigned for Judge Moore. And I think what you're beginning to see is the emergence of a populist party inside the Republican Party, that's always been there but I think the Bannon activity makes it clear that this is being formalized inside the Republican Party. And they intend to challenge what they call the establishment. And if Donald Trump is standing in their way, they will campaign against him as well. Jason had a point.

And that's what we are seeing right now."

I mean, you know, there's a big debt over hang, a lot of that debt -- debtors will be hair-cutted and will lose money. There will have to be a social contract that says, look, we are going to get help but, in return, we are going to be more responsible in terms of our accountability."

The president says NFL team owners are, quote, \"Afraid of their players\" and should require them to stand. We are back with Dan Henninger and Jason Riley. He's the author of the book, \"False Black Power.\" Jason, who is winning the fight between Trump and the NFL?"

What started by protests by some players about how police are treating young black men in the country has sort of morphed into an anti-Trump protest that you're seeing. And I think more people are joining it. And when you see the owners kneeling with their players, as we have seen recently, I think that is evidence of who is winning this."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Not really. I think the NFL has shot itself in the foot with this protest. Let's understand that Donald Trump didn't start it. It began with Colin Kaepernick, the backup quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, last September, who decided to choose the national anthem, the time he would kneel down in protest, and I don't think many Americans quite understand what exactly it is he's protesting. But in the wake of that, other players started taking a knee during national anthem. If there are legitimate issues about the relationships between the police and black people in the inner city, let Colin Kaepernick or the rest of them give speeches and talk about it at length so people understand the protest. But it's been centered at the national anthem at the beginning of these games, and I think a lot of Americans were confused and upset that a symbol of unity in the United States is being divided. And Trump just surfed in on top of it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "I think they could be both be losers in this sense of sports fans want to tune in and watch football and they're not looking to the president for guidance on their viewing habits. In that sense, both can be losing. I do want to make a point about the nature of the protests themselves. What we have is an increase in coverage, media coverage of police shootings in this country."

The data shows police shootings, police using lethal force much, much less than in the past. Here in New York City, back in 1971, there were 314 police shootings, 93 fatally. By 2015, that was down to 23 shootings, eight of them fatally."

    },

      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Exactly. That's been a decline, not only on police shootings here in New York but other large cities and nationwide. Since late '60's, the rate at which blacks are shot by police is down 70 percent, Paul. This is a false narrative. And we can't confuse the fact that social media has -- has blown -"

As he arrived, he was greeted by at least 30 Georgetown law professors taking a knee in opposition and in solidarity with the NFL players who were in a battle with Donald Trump over speech and the national anthem. Paul, we sometimes wonder where students get their sophomoric ideas, and these Georgetown law professors made it pretty clear."

And yet, Target did it to compete with Walmart and other retailers in a tough environment and a tight labor market. Just more evidence that what's good for workers is competition."

But Twitter says now they are going to double that, they're having a trial run anyway, to 280. Some of us believe brevity is the soul of wit, which sort of explains why I didn't like Fidel Castro. And we wish that we would stick with the 140."
