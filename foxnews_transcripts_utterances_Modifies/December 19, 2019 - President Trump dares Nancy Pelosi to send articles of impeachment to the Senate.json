For the rest of us who don't live in their giddy world of ritual self-congratulation, we wonder, how dumb are they? Don't they know this isn't a win -? It's a win-lose-lose? A win for Trump in a lose-lose for the media and the Dems. Not only will the Senate reject this sham, Trump will turn the vote into a badge of honor and then sell replicas of it online. He should actually. Trump turns political and media hate into a burden he shares with you because the media hates you too. Meanwhile, thanks to its reckless use, impeachment becomes meaningless. Every time one party controls the House, impeachment is just another way to cry, \"resist.\" Why not start at inauguration? They did. But at least the phony press is laid bare. We see them create stories from feelings, narratives from mind-reading to smear those outside their bubble. Ask yourself this: Why is the press and the Dems happy with a losing proposition? Because it makes them feel good, thinking that you feel bad. But if the Dems and the media want to celebrate, let them. Because it's like all those other make-believe wins that they savored collusion, Covington, Kavanaugh. After the sugar rush fades, they're in the exact same place, inept and lost, while everyone with real jobs and real interest goes to work. Yo Jesse, this is the best year any president has ever had.

We're supposed to take this seriously, Jimmy. And that's what this whole thing's been. It hasn't been disciplined. It hasn't been honorable. From the very beginning, these little secret, crazy little sessions they had with Schiff going, God knows what in his weird little basement. And then you had these people they bring up to insult President Trump's children. And they didn't convince one single Republican, not one. It just shows you how partisan this whole thing was.

Third time in history, not good. Nobody wants to be impeached. I don't think the president wanted to win, but he's did. Guess what? Nancy Pelosi didn't want to do the impeachment.

      "utterance": "So, I think there's a real interesting thing about just the political savviness of somebody like a Talib versus someone like a Slotkin. So, Slotkin is also a freshman Democrat. She is in one of the districts that Trump won in 2016. She was a former CIA officer. Like she is -- a different type of person than Talib because she knew that if you -- votes for impeachment, it is very likely, she is going to lose in 2020. But she decided, this is what I'm going to do, I'm voting my conscience. I'm going to let the chips fall where they may. The difference is, if somebody like Talib, who is going to win in her district probably, well, maybe not her. But most of these Democrats are going to win no matter what. It doesn't matter. So, they're being really bad team players. And if they think that they need the majority in order to hold President Trump in check, they might have just written themselves off in 2020 and put their majority at risk for the benefit of somebody like Talib and not someone like a Slotkin who might lose."

      "utterance": "Okay. I think the media celebration and the left celebration is so sickening to me. And it's not like we didn't know already, but it just rendered everything transparent. So, after the impeachment debates, did you guys see Tom Nichols tweet where he said -- he calls it the, \"rump party.\" \"For the GOP is fast on their way to becoming the rump party of the south and the mountains.\" To which Jennifer Rubin replied, \"And the non-college educated.\" And it is so offensive to me and it is so alienating and elitist that just drips out of that, the left in the mainstream media. And that's exactly why, as we always say, that people continue to support Trump, because of that feeling from them. And the notion that it's only the college educated that are allowed to participate in these proceedings and otherwise you don't understand. And then to kind of attach yourself to that fairness idea, it's so gross. And the smugness to, you know, that Talib, \"We're going to impeach.\" I have never felt smug at a sentencing. I have never felt smug or celebrated when I'm sitting in prison, no matter what kind of monster I was sitting across from, with a few exceptions. It is always a really grave thing. And so, all of that, to me just belies the obvious. Final point, though. Remember, she's the one that that utilized her grandmother, right? As a token political issue and at the end of the day, we see right through her."

They are demanding a response by January 10th because they were lied to. That's what this report says. The Horowitz – Horowitz IG report says that they were lied to. So how can they do their job and protect all of us? Remember, Americans pay for these salaries. We pay for the intelligence. We pay for all of the technology that is used to help protect us from possible threats that are being coordinated from overseas. That's why you have a foreign intelligence surveillance court in the first place. And if that is ruined because of political bias or not so much political bias or incompetence, whatever it is, I think that FBI does have a lot to answer for.

We're used to political bias or left versus right bias. This is a confirmation bias issue, whether it's a social worker or a discrimination attorney or a hate crime investigator, finding something means work to do. And so that defines your job. So, you -- like you see what you want to see. For example, may I use an analogy, please? If you have back pain and you go to an acupuncturist, or you go to a chiropractor, or you go to a massage therapist and the back pain goes away, all of them will believe that it was because of them. When, in fact, the back pain just went away because it usually does. So, it's like people, by the job that they do, believe that they're actually doing the right thing. That's why I'm not to -- this is biased. They hated Trump. They wanted him out. They thought he was a threat, so that bias confirmed all of these mistakes. So, I think that's fair."

When I woke up in New York City this morning, it was 17 degrees. And yesterday, it felt like New York City was inside a snow globe. Watch what happened. Yes, that's a snow squall. It lasted just a minute, but it covered the city in a beautiful Christmas cloud of snow. It less it left less than half an inch of snow on the ground, but across the country nine inches of snow right now in St. Louis is eight inches in Kansas City. Frosty the Snowman definitely in the USA as the holidays approach. Merry Christmas to all."

They got together and joined human rights activists yesterday to bring attention to the criminalization of gay people by dozens of current U.N. member states and the U.S. has said we're going to put up with this anymore. Kelly Craft said individual men and women around the world have faced and continue to face punishment and even death specifically because of their sexual orientation. This is a wrong we should seek to right, and it is a wrong. I am personally committed to helping right. So yesterday was the beginning of renewed efforts to try to deal with this issue around the world and I think that you will be hearing more about this from the United States and the Trump administration in the months to come. Which is good leadership, indeed."
