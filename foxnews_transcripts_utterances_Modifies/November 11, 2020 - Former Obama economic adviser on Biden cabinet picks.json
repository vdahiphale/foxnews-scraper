Today is Veterans Day, the day we honor all those who serve and those who gave their lives for our freedom and for the country that we love. Tonight, a bit later in the program, we will honor those heroes in a very special tribute that we hope you will watch along with us tonight. Today, mid-morning in the rain, President Trump went to Arlington National Cemetery with the first lady to take part in the ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It was the first time we'd seen the president in a week as he continues his election fight. And as the Trump team hunkers down post-election, there is another very big story emerging as well. A colossal face-off for control of the United States Senate. This morning, Republican Senator Dan Sullivan secured his victory in Alaska, bringing the official count to 48 Democrats, 50 Republicans, two seats up for grabs in the Georgia race. This is what it all comes down to for the GOP, packing the court, adding states, ending the filibuster. It is now Georgia, Georgia, Georgia. A state where Joe Biden is currently ahead by about 14,000 votes in the presidential contest, a race that is so close that they plan to recount those ballots now county-by-county by hand. Moments from now, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, who says what happens in Georgia is going to determine the future of the United States for the next four years. First up, Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel breaks down what is at stake tonight. Hi, Mike.",

Well, look, Pennsylvania Republicans, the Trump campaign and 10 attorneys general from red states have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, urging them to take this case up. Now under Pennsylvania's Act 77 mail ballots must arrive by 8 PM on November 3rd to count. Now, Pennsylvania's Supreme Court bypassed the legislature and extended the deadline by three days, which meant as long as mail ballots were postmarked by November 3rd and arrived by 5 PM November 6th, they count. Now, Republicans argue the extension is unconstitutional. Pennsylvania's Department of State estimates approximately 10,000 ballots arrived within this three-day extension. Even if the U.S. Supreme Court decided that all of these votes are invalid, it's not enough to overcome Biden's lead, which is over 49,700 and the lead is growing as 45,000 mail ballots are still being counted. Republicans are also eying provisional ballots. There are some 94,000 provisional ballots, four times more than in 2016. Provisional ballots are cast by voters whose eligibility is in question. And this year, it included voters who requested a mail-in-ballot, but then decided they wanted to vote in-person. Republicans are attempting to invalidate really hundreds of thousands of votes by making sweeping constitutional claims that mail-in-voting rules were enforced unequally and unfairly by counties who were confused by last minute secretary of state guidance and by last minute court rulings. But the bottom-line is legal experts tell us, you're going to need to have hard evidence to prove that there was mass fraud. And we've looked at these lawsuits and there has been no evidence that there have been ballots that were tampered with, manipulated, thrown away, or that they were cast by a sufficient or a big number of dead voters, Martha.",

Today is Veterans Day, the day we honor all those who serve and those who gave their lives for our freedom and for the country that we love. Tonight, a bit later in the program, we will honor those heroes in a very special tribute that we hope you will watch along with us tonight. Today, mid-morning in the rain, President Trump went to Arlington National Cemetery with the first lady to take part in the ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It was the first time we'd seen the president in a week as he continues his election fight. And as the Trump team hunkers down post-election, there is another very big story emerging as well. A colossal face-off for control of the United States Senate. This morning, Republican Senator Dan Sullivan secured his victory in Alaska, bringing the official count to 48 Democrats, 50 Republicans, two seats up for grabs in the Georgia race. This is what it all comes down to for the GOP, packing the court, adding states, ending the filibuster. It is now Georgia, Georgia, Georgia. A state where Joe Biden is currently ahead by about 14,000 votes in the presidential contest, a race that is so close that they plan to recount those ballots now county-by-county by hand. Moments from now, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, who says what happens in Georgia is going to determine the future of the United States for the next four years. First up, Chief Congressional Correspondent Mike Emanuel breaks down what is at stake tonight. Hi, Mike."

If the Republicans lose the Senate majority and the Left of Lenin-wing of the Democratic Party gets in control as it will, controlling both the Senate and the House. As I said earlier today, you have nothing to worry about, unless you are a taxpayer, a business owner, a parent, a gun owner, a cop, a person of faith or an unborn baby. They will run America like they run Chicago. And they've been very upfront about that. Those are pretty high stakes. Now, we don't plan on losing, but it's all hands-on deck."

Evelyn and I are moving to Georgia to help Ossoff and Reverend Warnock win, this is our only chance to clear Mitch out of the way and help Joe and Kamala get things done in the next four years. Tom Friedman of The New York Times also chimed in, saying that everybody who can, should move to Georgia. I believe you can - if you get there by December 5th, you can get a driver's license and you can set up shop and you can vote in that election, which is pretty extraordinary."

But we've got to get this election business right. Millions and millions, Martha, of Americans are very skeptical about the vote counting process. Some of them think, as I said earlier, they think it was rigged, rigged as a carnival ring toss. And we need to let the president prosecute his claims of irregularity in a court of law and everybody else. That's why God made judges. Above all, we can put this thing to rest. If I could say one other thing. The problem is that mail voting, mail voting creates a whole host of problems than in-person voting. I mean, a lot more can go wrong. I'm not saying that people concerned about the Coronavirus shouldn't be able to mail a vote. But look, it's just how I look at it. If I won, the Powerball and I am going to mail my ticket in to collect the money or I'm not going to show up in-person. Now, I know what I'm going to do, and I know what most Americans are going to do. And let's face it, a lot of our states, we're not exactly a model of efficiency in terms of the way they administer this election."

Do you think that Republicans did a good enough job in terms of - did they discourage the president at times told people not to mail in their vote, that it was, that that wouldn't be the safe way to do it? Do you think that was a mistake maybe?"

      "utterance": "Well, I don't know, hindsight is wonderful, but my position from the very beginning was that if people want to do a mail-in-ballot, that's their prerogative just so long as it's legal. But the problem is you had both sides, Republicans and Democrats have started trying to change the election rules. There was more Democrats and Republicans, and that looked fishy."

Good to have you with us tonight, Newt. The secretary of state was just on another program and he said so far, they have not found any systemic irregularities. They said nothing that would rise to the level of even the 10000-vote range. What's your response to what's going on in your home state?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE",
      "utterance": "Well, my response is, that you've got to count the votes. When you - as Senator Kennedy pointed out, something like 70 percent of the Republicans in this country do not believe this was an honest election. The only way you can heal that is to go back through in all the key states that are in doubt and methodically count the votes and have hand counts. I think what the secretary of state in Georgia is doing is exactly right. If at the end they don't find very many votes, then Biden will carry Georgia. But everybody will know that it was a fair and an accurate election. At the present time, a vast number of Americans do not believe that and think that, frankly, they're being railroaded."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I think that's a very good reason to continue these counts, to continue these investigations. A lot of people who are very impatient about the process here. But I think that it's because we have this extraordinary situation during this virus with millions and millions of mail-in-votes. It doesn't hurt anybody to continue this process and to certify these over the next couple of weeks. What's your - what do you think the president should - obviously, you think he should see this through, but how do you see the president going forward? If it doesn't go his way, what role do you think that he should play going forward?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, first of all, if it genuinely doesn't go his way, he'll become a former president on the 20th of January and then he'll have several big options, because my hunch is, he will be the most popular person in the Republican Party. And there is one example. Grover Cleveland was elected in 1884, defeated in 1888 and then re-elected in 1892. Now, whether or not Trump has the appetite for that, who knows? But he clearly has a big enough base that he would be very formidable. And I think the Democrats are right on the verge of a pretty big civil war between the Right and Left wings. And so, the world may look a lot different a year from now in terms of how people feel about the two parties."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I feel like we haven't heard from the president that much in a week, which is an unusual state of affairs because we usually hear from him all the time. But I think because of that, you've got people sort of rushing in to fill the void and talking about what should happen now in the Republican Party. You've got John Bolton saying, here's the cold political reality. Trump is enhancing his own brand in his mind while harming the Republican brand. The party needs a long internal conversation about the post-Trump era. But first, it needs to get there honorably. I mean, he got 72 million votes a week ago, and what would you say to John Bolton?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "You know, Martha, well, I wouldn't say anything to John Bolton, it's not worth the time, but you made a really good point. Trump has been pretty quiet for one week. And in the Rasmussen poll today, he said, I think his highest approval level and his lowest disapproval level, I think, for his whole presidency. Now, if he could try the experiment of maybe two more weeks, I always tell people you can't make a comeback unless you leave. People got to get away from you for a little while. And I think the president has been very wise to let the lawyers do their work, that other people do their work and not be right in the middle of this. Now, there may come a point when he has to drive some things home and you may see him return to a rally kind of style, if that's what it takes to get in Pennsylvania, for example, to get enough action."

      "utterance": "Well, I think certainly once this is all over, he should - I don't think he should until the recount is done. I think that right now let's focus on the recount. But frankly, the choice in Georgia is going to be so enormous between two people who would make the Senate radical and two people make them conservative, that I think Trump almost inevitably will be drawn into it."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

On election night, the Fox News decision desk correctly predicted that soon after 9 Eastern that Democrats would retain that control of the House, but also estimated that Democrats would add about five seats to their majority. That did not occur. Republicans have gained six seats with multiple races yet to be decided. President Trump meeting today with campaign staff and advisers as he pushes ahead with these legal challenges to the election. The most prominent lawsuit is in Pennsylvania, where the deadline for mail-in-ballots is at the center of that dispute in a case that could land at the Supreme Court. Correspondent Bryan Llenas live once again tonight for us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Hi, Bryan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRYAN LLENAS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Well, look, Pennsylvania Republicans, the Trump campaign and 10 attorneys general from red states have petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court, urging them to take this case up. Now under Pennsylvania's Act 77 mail ballots must arrive by 8 PM on November 3rd to count. Now, Pennsylvania's Supreme Court bypassed the legislature and extended the deadline by three days, which meant as long as mail ballots were postmarked by November 3rd and arrived by 5 PM November 6th, they count. Now, Republicans argue the extension is unconstitutional. Pennsylvania's Department of State estimates approximately 10,000 ballots arrived within this three-day extension. Even if the U.S. Supreme Court decided that all of these votes are invalid, it's not enough to overcome Biden's lead, which is over 49,700 and the lead is growing as 45,000 mail ballots are still being counted. Republicans are also eying provisional ballots. There are some 94,000 provisional ballots, four times more than in 2016. Provisional ballots are cast by voters whose eligibility is in question. And this year, it included voters who requested a mail-in-ballot, but then decided they wanted to vote in-person. Republicans are attempting to invalidate really hundreds of thousands of votes by making sweeping constitutional claims that mail-in-voting rules were enforced unequally and unfairly by counties who were confused by last minute secretary of state guidance and by last minute court rulings. But the bottom-line is legal experts tell us, you're going to need to have hard evidence to prove that there was mass fraud. And we've looked at these lawsuits and there has been no evidence that there have been ballots that were tampered with, manipulated, thrown away, or that they were cast by a sufficient or a big number of dead voters, Martha."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Bryan, thank you very much. So, I'm joined now by former independent counsel, Ken Starr. Ken, good to have you with us tonight. As I said last night, one dead voter is too many. I mean, we can't have any of that going on in our system. And it's just unbelievable that we don't have a better way to count the person and the vote as it goes in, which I think is something that we've all learned here. With regard to this case that could go to the Supreme Court. Is that the one that you think has the most legs to it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEN STARR, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "It certainly has constitutional legs. I don't quarrel with the number of votes that may be affected, but you know what, the Supreme Court is not about vote counting as such. It's about maintaining fidelity to law and what the governor did and then, as was just mentioned, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did utterly lawless, totally unconstitutional. And it's one of the reasons that Justice Sam Alito entered the order that he did on Friday night. Now, that may seem like day before yesterday. It was four days ago. That order could have been overturned by the majority of the Supreme Court, there has been none. Now, today was a holiday. We shall see. But here's one other point. Allow this process, and you said it earlier, you said it very well to run. Bush v. Gore, 37 days. We now all remember that. This is the eighth day. So, everybody needs to say, let's look at these irregularities. I'm happy to call them that. But in Pennsylvania, a clear constitutional violation occurred, and that is something that the Supreme Court of the United States should remedy as a matter of principle, even if it does not affect the outcome of even the Pennsylvania vote."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I think that's a very important point to make, because we have to keep pushing on the system and we have to make sure that the system functions the way that it is supposed to. This is what the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote today. If Mr. Biden were winning by 537 votes, which was George Bush's final margin in Florida, all hell would break loose. The court's decision to invalidate the ballots are to count them might well pick the next president. But the temptation for the justices, since Mr. Biden appears to have won Pennsylvania and the White House will be to call this case moot and walk away from the controversy that they say would be a missed opportunity. What do you say?"

    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "I completely agree with that. In light of the closeness of the entire election. And let's face it, the country is not at rest. The New York Times may say whatever it wants to, but you just heard the speaker on your program say 70 percent of Republicans are really restless about this, upset about this. So, I think the Supreme Court could, in fact, do its small part in a very appropriate case. It's been pending since before the election. Take it. It's clean, it's crisp, and it should be absolutely unanimous. And I think it has the potential to be unanimous for the court to say to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, you acted unconstitutionally, Governor. So, did you. It's the legislature. We now all know this. We've returned to our Constitution. It's the legislature that counts, not the state Supreme Court."

Many hear this sort of thing. This smacks of 1950 style McCarthyism. These are basically blacklists, so the idea of developing blacklists not just to say we discredit people, they are wrong and now that Democrats are in charge if, in fact, Biden's apparent victory sticks despite all of these investigations and all that. But that these people who work for President Trump aren't going to be allowed to earn any living, pay their bills, take care of themselves and their loved ones, it is absolutely appalling and it's really more than a bit too much to hear this coming from the left, which always likes to talk about the Hollywood 10, McCarthyism blacklist.

You know, and that is what it is and if there are 75 million and Joe Biden wins this election outright when everything is certified, everybody is going to have to accept that outcome, but to say that those people shouldn't be able to have a future seems very un-liberal, very undemocratic, doesn't it?"

I think you have to listen to his words and delineate him and the Democratic Party from a few faint voices on the left. Don't get me wrong, I think there are folks who have disagreement with Trump and the Trump Cabinet and their ability to do work or the lack thereof, and we settled that in this election where 76 million Americans voted for President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. That's it. The game is over. Let these folks go live their lives and go do their jobs as long as they are not Cabinet Secretaries anymore."

If you have policy disagreement with them, then let's talk about it. If you think they were unqualified for their job, then you can talk about that and we won that. We actually won that debate in this election. I think is a number of Trump Cabinet positions that the folks who had those jobs who were unqualified, and they are no longer there. On January 20th, they won't be there anymore, and so we won this election and I think it's time for our party to focus on the matter at hand, which is leading this country and flattening this curve on COVID-19 instead of this sort of nascent conversation that we hear from a few faint voices on the left, which don't represent the entirety of the Democratic Party."

I guess, these challenges in litigation and so on will settle that sometime between now and December, I suppose, but Ron Klain, I believe is a veteran of the Obama-Biden White House. He also was someone who came out and said a couple years ago regarding the H1N1 virus that they were just very lucky that they didn't have a bigger death toll. I think he said it was just good luck that it didn't turn out to be a mass death event because that virus is nowhere as deadly as COVID-19, so that's interesting. I imagine if he is in a position, those tapes will be played and people will familiarizer themselves with those comments which are really rather disturbing."

      "utterance": "What's your response when you hear that time schedule for the vaccine?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BESSER",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I'm excited about the news, the early news from Pfizer about their vaccine, but it is early news, and we need to have the data verified by independent scientists and data further out. This was looking at how effective the vaccines were seven days after your second dose. They will next look and see how effective were they 28 days after? And then they will need another month of safety data. Assuming all of that goes well and there is a vaccine, it's exciting to think that there will be vaccine for folks in nursing homes. But for the general public, you know, for this winter, we cannot expect vaccines to have an impact. The numbers that you were just citing rising around the country really call on us to step up and do what we can to reduce transmission to ourselves, our families, and our communities. And the good news out of the C.D.C. today was that the evidence is now showing that masks not only protect other people from you spreading the virus to them if you happen to have it and don't have symptoms, but it will reduce by up to 70 percent the chances that you or anyone else wearing a mask will get COVID."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, but just -- you know, it's just sort of the premise under which a lot of people have been operating for a while, that just wear the mask and hopefully it helps, so it's good to have some confirmation from them on that. But we all know that when it kind of breaks down is when you're at gatherings with friends and family and people get that feeling that it feels safer and you've got Thanksgiving coming up and all of that and everybody would love to be able to have a little bit more freedom at those events, but you think we have to be really careful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BESSER",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's a challenging time because in the winter, the virus survives longer. It stays in the air longer and with everyone gathering for Holidays, it's a risky period. You know, my parents are both 90 and they live here in town and we will deliver them Thanksgiving Dinner, but we are not going to get together because of the risk. And you really have to think hard about whether it's safe to get together or whether you want to look for a Zoom-type of Thanksgiving this year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Do think that people who have had the virus will be vaccinated, or should be vaccinated when there's enough?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BESSER",
      "utterance": "You know, it's a really good question. We still don't know if you've had this infection, how long your protection lasts. So that's one of the things that will be studied. You know, clearly they will want to give the vaccine first to people who haven't had the infection, but then over time, that is one of the things to think about. I think it would be very unlikely that there will be harm from that, but you want to make sure that those who are at risk are getting this first and so nursing homes first and healthcare workers and then moving down the line to those who are at greatest risk of severe disease."

    {
      "speaker": "BESSER",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's so important we reflect on that today, Martha. The number of cases is quite high, as is deaths, but the toll in terms of mental health has been extremely severe for veterans. It's severe across the board, but people who have served our country in our Armed Forces are at particular risk and it's important that we do all we can to ensure that they have services. You know, there were 28 million people at the start of the pandemic without health insurance and we need to make sure that everyone in America has, you know, comprehensive health insurance for physical health, as well as mental health because many people who don't even get the infection because of the isolation and the stress are really in need of mental health services."

And I can tell you something, the longer I served, the greater were the Americans that came in. Wonderful, magnificent, remarkable young men women and what I take away from that is it built further confidence I have in this great country and built great confidence I have in the younger generation coming in.
