      "sentences": "Good evening from the White House. I'm Laura Ingraham. And this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" on a historic night here in DC. Less than an hour ago right behind me, President Trump fulfilled a campaign pledge and nominated a staunch Conservative to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court of the United States. 53 year old Brett Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals which and widely regard as the most prestigious court of the United States, outside of the Supreme Court itself of course. Judge Kavanaugh is straight out of central casting. A judge who would have been strongly considered, I think, by any Republican President. He's a graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School, I won't hold that against him and even clerks, of course, on the Supreme Court for the man he's nominated to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy.  Joining me now to analyze the president's pick is the senior Fox News political analyst Brit Hume, former White Water Independent Counsel Ken Star who was Judge Kavanaugh's boss during the investigations into Bill Clinton, Justin Walker, a law professor at the University of Louisville who clerked for both Judge Kavanaugh and Justice Kennedy and here with me at the White House is federal society's Leonard Leo, the President's top outside advisor on judicial picks.  Now Leonard we got to go to you first, I mean Congratulations. You are also kind of the man of the moment because you've been working this process behind the scenes. We were both in that room together when Brett Kavanaugh walked out. His father comes out first, his mother, Mrs. Scalia was there, Jean Scalia, two of the sons of Mrs. Scalia. And of course General Edwin Meese from the Reagan administration and former attorney general. What did you feel, I know how I felt, when all of that was going down?",

He has rendered a number of decisions, for example reigning in the administrative state here in Washington. And he will be portrayed Laura, I can tell you without any fear of contradiction, as an enemy of the environment, as a defender of the big interests against the little guy and so on down the line. It's a litany that you've heard before and we're going to hear it again. It will get very loud, it will probably be almost 100 percent humbug but it's going to be out there and all I can say he needs to be well prepared to defend himself in the hearings.

It's going to be, I guess, easy for some people to vote against him but he's going to ware well, he's the real thing. He is the goodness of kindness and spirit that we saw tonight in the statement. What we heard tonight really came from Brett's heart and I've known him since he was coming off the Justice Kennedy clerkship. And what you see with Brett is what you get. He's going to be extremely winsome.   But substantively, I think we're going to have a different conversation, we're going to have the political conversation that's unfolding as Brit just said. But I think it's going to be a deeper conversation, I hope there will be. Maybe not on Capitol Hill but there's going to be in the country and it began tonight. What do we want the Supreme Court to be? And what do we want the Supreme Court Justice to be? We can use shorthand terms and they're helpful, originalism and textualism. I would also say, do we want restore the traditions of the Holmes's and the Brandeis', the Frankfurter's? Byron White appointed by President Kennedy who believed fervently in ‘We the people' and the ability of ‘We the people' to govern ourselves as opposed to government by platonic guardians, including a five to four majority. It's the right of ‘We the people' to govern ourselves. Judge Kavanaugh has the advantage, in addition to being just so steeped in those first principles, to also understand what we have been talking about and that is the administrative state and the need for accountability and he's been a very powerful voice for that fundamental principle.",

I would say Brett go home you work too hard, but he would never go home\". He just absolutely is probably bursting with pride right now at Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.

This is an issue I think it's reasonable to argue, should have been settled by the legislative processes and let the people decide what the law and that ought to be. And the Supreme Court devised a right that no one had previously detected in the constitution for that and we've been fighting this battle ever since.  Far from settling the issue, it has animated and some might say poisoned our politics to a great extent ever since. And here we are again, and once again that issue comes to the fore, it is the enduring political and moral issue of our time and one which the courts had far more to do with than they probably should have. And that is the approach that judges like Brett Kavanaugh and others on this list would have stood against and that is why the Democrats and their allies are so opposed to such nominees.  Because they are accustomed now to winning these victories on social policies and other issues by judicial fiat. Because they are not able to win them in the legislative process. And that is why there is much at stake in the nomination like this, which tips the balance of the Supreme Court. This may be, as Judge Starr suggests, an edifying process in which a deeper debate will occur, I certainly hope so.

Why is the least dangerous branch? Because it's not going to be imposing its will on the American people, it's simply going to be exercising judgement.  So that's what I call the grand tradition in American constitutional law. The John Marshall's, the great chief justice all the way through so many justices who are revered even to a great extent by the left like Louis Brandeis and Benjamin Cardoso. They would not in fact countenance first of all the scare tactics for one thing, this is really beyond the pale. But also just the jurisprudential approach that we really just care about results. We're here to make what we believe to be the most humane and compassionate public policy, that's what we're here to do. No that's not what we're here to do, when I say we, I'm talking about the courts of the land. You're rather to be stewards of the law, and to take the text, we keep talking about the text.

But instead he's there to interpret the law. President Trump had four great candidates. I think any one of them would have made a terrific nominee and people had their favorites.

We want to educate the American people on why that document is so important. And second, conservatives are much more focused on the Supreme Court then liberals are. Conservatives are more likely to get out and vote. This is the only issue that galvanizes Republicans to participate in this midterm election. So yes, Senator Schumer, I do hope you get that extended period to have this conversation. It will elect at least two more Republican senators.

      "utterance": "Good evening from the White House. I'm Laura Ingraham. And this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" on a historic night here in DC. Less than an hour ago right behind me, President Trump fulfilled a campaign pledge and nominated a staunch Conservative to replace the retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court of the United States. 53 year old Brett Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals which and widely regard as the most prestigious court of the United States, outside of the Supreme Court itself of course. Judge Kavanaugh is straight out of central casting. A judge who would have been strongly considered, I think, by any Republican President. He's a graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School, I won't hold that against him and even clerks, of course, on the Supreme Court for the man he's nominated to succeed Justice Anthony Kennedy. Joining me now to analyze the president's pick is the senior Fox News political analyst Brit Hume, former White Water Independent Counsel Ken Star who was Judge Kavanaugh's boss during the investigations into Bill Clinton, Justin Walker, a law professor at the University of Louisville who clerked for both Judge Kavanaugh and Justice Kennedy and here with me at the White House is federal society's Leonard Leo, the President's top outside advisor on judicial picks. Now Leonard we got to go to you first, I mean Congratulations. You are also kind of the man of the moment because you've been working this process behind the scenes. We were both in that room together when Brett Kavanaugh walked out. His father comes out first, his mother, Mrs. Scalia was there, Jean Scalia, two of the sons of Mrs. Scalia. And of course General Edwin Meese from the Reagan administration and former attorney general. What did you feel, I know how I felt, when all of that was going down?"

There's a lot of administrative law cases Leonard, that are decided there, kind of a lot of geeky Orissa cases, I can't believe I just said the word Orissa, forget that just said that. But a lot of cases that come out of the administrative law process and Judge Kavanaugh dealt with a lot of those cases. Doesn't have a lot of judicial opinions on the First Amendment and that concerns some Conservatives, should they be concerned?"

He does have one really important finance case and he's got all these cases involving the administrative state where he gets into the whole issue of how government needs to be accountable and transparent and the separation of powers and the constitution needs to be respected. Its' an incredible record, almost 300 opinions."

But someone like, full disclosure I've known Brett for 27 years, he does revere the constitution. People were criticizing him over the last 72 hours because he was staff secretary, which is run the paper flow for Bush 43. Bush 43 did not really support is President, did not vote for this President so a lot of Conservatives said, \"Well he comes out of the Bush administration, how can we trust him to be a Scalia or a Thomas or an Alito or a Gorsuch?\" What do you say to those still doubting Brett Kavanaugh tonight after this incredible speech that he gave in the President's introduction?"

But I'm bound to tell you after the announcement I went and watched some of the reaction on competing channels and I must tell you that it's already starting. He has rendered a number of decisions, for example reigning in the administrative state here in Washington. And he will be portrayed Laura, I can tell you without any fear of contradiction, as an enemy of the environment, as a defender of the big interests against the little guy and so on down the line. It's a litany that you've heard before and we're going to hear it again. It will get very loud, it will probably be almost 100 percent humbug but it's going to be out there and all I can say he needs to be well prepared to defend himself in the hearings. And the White House and those supporting this nomination better be prepared to rebut the allegations because they're going to be thick and fast."

It's going to be, I guess, easy for some people to vote against him but he's going to ware well, he's the real thing. He is the goodness of kindness and spirit that we saw tonight in the statement. What we heard tonight really came from Brett's heart and I've known him since he was coming off the Justice Kennedy clerkship. And what you see with Brett is what you get. He's going to be extremely winsome. But substantively, I think we're going to have a different conversation, we're going to have the political conversation that's unfolding as Brit just said. But I think it's going to be a deeper conversation, I hope there will be. Maybe not on Capitol Hill but there's going to be in the country and it began tonight. What do we want the Supreme Court to be? And what do we want the Supreme Court Justice to be? We can use shorthand terms and they're helpful, originalism and textualism. I would also say, do we want restore the traditions of the Holmes's and the Brandeis', the Frankfurter's? Byron White appointed by President Kennedy who believed fervently in ‘We the people' and the ability of ‘We the people' to govern ourselves as opposed to government by platonic guardians, including a five to four majority. It's the right of ‘We the people' to govern ourselves. Judge Kavanaugh has the advantage, in addition to being just so steeped in those first principles, to also understand what we have been talking about and that is the administrative state and the need for accountability and he's been a very powerful voice for that fundamental principle."

You're one of the clerks of course, and again going back to the Conservative who were going nuts over the past 72 hours, \"He's another David Hackett Souter\" I kept saying, \"You guys are shooting yourselves in your own foot\" What can you tell our viewers at Fox tonight about their relationship, Anthony Kennedy and Judge Kavanaugh's relationship, and does that extend to their jurisprudential outlook on some of these more hot button cases."

      "utterance": "Thanks Laura. They both absolutely revere the constitution and I just can't imagine how proud Justice Kennedy must be that his successor will be, not just be one of his former clerks, but a former clerk who Juice Kennedy talked about in chambers all the time. He would point at the chair where Judge Kavanaugh sat when Judge Kavanaugh was a clerk and he called him Brett, ‘Brett, he was always there in the morning when I came and he was always there at night when I left. I would say Brett go home you work too hard, but he would never go home\". He just absolutely is probably bursting with pride right now at Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. And, you know, I guess I also think America is going to fall in love with Judge Kavanaugh and I think there are going to some senators who will find it very difficult to vote against such a family man, such a patriot and someone who was just spent the last twelve years in the second highest court writing 300 opinions. That's 300 times out of 300 times adhered to the constitution, adhered to text and approached every matter in a partial, fair and independent way."

This is about abortion and gay marriage, correct? That's it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "It is about those kind of issues and abortion in particular, and Laura it gives you a sense of what this issue and it's seizure by the Supreme Court back in 1973 has done to our politics and has done to our judicial system. This is an issue I think it's reasonable to argue, should have been settled by the legislative processes and let the people decide what the law and that ought to be. And the Supreme Court devised a right that no one had previously detected in the constitution for that and we've been fighting this battle ever since. Far from settling the issue, it has animated and some might say poisoned our politics to a great extent ever since. And here we are again, and once again that issue comes to the fore, it is the enduring political and moral issue of our time and one which the courts had far more to do with than they probably should have. And that is the approach that judges like Brett Kavanaugh and others on this list would have stood against and that is why the Democrats and their allies are so opposed to such nominees. Because they are accustomed now to winning these victories on social policies and other issues by judicial fiat. Because they are not able to win them in the legislative process. And that is why there is much at stake in the nomination like this, which tips the balance of the Supreme Court. This may be, as Judge Starr suggests, an edifying process in which a deeper debate will occur, I certainly hope so. But I'm just a political reporter and I'm looking at what I see out there and it looks pretty rough to me."

He was basically was up there, Brit was right, hitting the gong how this is an alarm bell for the left and for the Democrats that this do or die, you got to stop this. My question though is if Brett Kavanaugh is solidly Conservative, he's maybe not Scalia, a full on textualist but if he's solidly Conservative, replacing someone who's judicially Conservative I'm saying, is it that big of a swing as the left is saying, \"This is a swing justice\" Is it really, given especially last year's opinions of this court where Anthony Kennedy was with the five-four majority on every opinion of great consequence?"

Especially on issues like separation of powers, federalism, areas of religious freedom, free exercise in particular. We saw the last term he voted with the Conservative majority of the court 75 percent of the time. So this is hyped up, this is really hyped up. And of course we know why, because the left wants have a court that is outcome based, they want to make sure they get results from the court that they know they can't get through the political process."

Barack Obama had a profound effect, Justin you know this as well, had a profound effect on our judiciary with the nominations he got through, even with some of the delays in the last few years. He transformed the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, as you know well Judge Starr sits down in Richmond, he transformed that court with his nomination."

And he said it in about four pages and every school child in America child read it and now every grown up should, that this the judiciary is the least dangerous branch. Why is the least dangerous branch? Because it's not going to be imposing its will on the American people, it's simply going to be exercising judgement. So that's what I call the grand tradition in American constitutional law. The John Marshall's, the great chief justice all the way through so many justices who are revered even to a great extent by the left like Louis Brandeis and Benjamin Cardoso. They would not in fact countenance first of all the scare tactics for one thing, this is really beyond the pale. But also just the jurisprudential approach that we really just care about results. We're here to make what we believe to be the most humane and compassionate public policy, that's what we're here to do. No that's not what we're here to do, when I say we, I'm talking about the courts of the land. You're rather to be stewards of the law, and to take the text, we keep talking about the text.

I think that left, right and center, anybody who comes at this question with an open mind is just going to find a judge who spent 12 years adhering to the structure and the history and the meaning and the text of the constitution and doing so in such a fare minded way. You know, he mentioned in his speech that the dean who hired him was now Justice Keagan. Justice Keagan, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Breyer, three left of center justices, they'll all hired former clerks of Judge Kavanaugh.

He called Kavanaugh to tell him that he was the pick. He then called Don McGinn the White House Counsel. He called the Vice President but he told three other people that they were on the list and because the decision was so late, the White House had to prepare four background packages, even asking each one of the nominees who they would put on their guest list, if they were chosen.

I guess he's the one who he believes he can get nominated, not nominated but confirmed through the process by the first of October. And Leonard will tell you, they think that that's a really important date because if they can't get a done by then, then it might get kicked to after the election.

He met his wife Ashley in 2001 and talked about that day because I was here at the White House when we were all told to evacuate the White House because they thought there was a plane that was coming in here. It was the Flight 93 that went into the ground in Pennsylvania and people just thought that maybe he was a little too tight with the Bush administration for this President's liking.

It's great to have all of you tonight. Matt let's start with you, Justice Kennedy for whom you clerked, I'm wondering what he's thinking tonight. He's probably over the moon but that association with both Justice Kennedy and the Bush's did give a lot of Conservatives, before we get into the resistance, pause about Judge Kavanaugh, whether he'd be the right type of justice, whether he'd evolve in the role.

It will be his second judge on the court if Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed as of course Judge Gorsuch, now Justice Gorsuch also clerked for Justice Kennedy. But I think in terms of the Conservative concerns look, there's a 12 year record of 300 decisions by Judge Kavanaugh that show that he is a principled Conservative who believes in judicial restraint and believes that he's not the 101st senator, some super legislator. But instead he's there to interpret the law. President Trump had four great candidates. I think any one of them would have made a terrific nominee and people had their favorites. But now I think all Conservatives will rally around Judge Kavanaugh because he really is a principled Conservative that we can count on."

So the left wing of the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party as a whole has no choice but to resist this nominee regardless of his qualifications, regardless of his background because they feel like they're nominee was stolen by Mitch McConnell two years ago. And as a result we are in for probably the super bowl of all super bowls of battles in Congress over the next couple of weeks. And I think October 1 is a very aggressive deadline, especially given the fact that he has 300 decisions that people are going to have to wade through and understand. He's going to get a lot of questions on those. I remember I heard Mr. Leo talk about the Federalist papers. My favorite Federalist paper is Federalist 51, ambition must counteract ambition. And Congress has lacked ambition to counteract this president and check it. So the court is probably the last resort here.

I'm sure that was happening today as well in D.C. It doesn't matter who it is. It doesn't matter who it was. It could've been anyone on that list of 25 or even any conservative, and the same hysterical reaction would've been there. It's an hour later, not even an hour later, and blood is already running in the streets according to these people.

It's great to have all of you on. Leonard, we were just talking about this issue of Murkowski and Collins, two Republican senators who are pro-choice and who the left had been courting to oppose this nominee.

And the longer we have this conversation, I think the better conservatives are going to do, because in the end when you talk about freedom of speech, the press, religion, when you talk about the Bill of Rights and the 10 Amendments, I think that the longer the conversation goes, the better conservatives do. We want to educate the American people on why that document is so important. And second, conservatives are much more focused on the Supreme Court then liberals are. Conservatives are more likely to get out and vote. This is the only issue that galvanizes Republicans to participate in this midterm election. So yes, Senator Schumer, I do hope you get that extended period to have this conversation. It will elect at least two more Republican senators. It may even save the Republicans in the House because every conservative will vote to ensure that this man, a strict supporter of the constitution, becomes the next Supreme Court justice. It is that significant in the American political process."

And 62 percent according to the NBC poll said it should occur before the November elections, which I think it probably freaked out Chuck Schumer and company. But most people said before, not after. What about your pal Frank's idea here? Obviously that's from the Republican perspective. I think it's interesting but I am someone who is a bird in the hand. Get this done, get him in. I get paranoid about waiting too long on these things, although I think it's an interesting idea."

The longer this thing plays out the more actually I think the Democratic base would be energized and the more the base would turn out because then they could actually affect the choice through the election. Right now we can protest but we ain't going to do anything about this nomination in particular unless something significant is found in his record, which has not happened with Neil Gorsuch. And so I think the longer this plays out, the more it plays actually to the Democratic advantage. Two-thirds of the people in this country would not overturn Roe versus Wade even though abortion itself is a closely split issue. And second trimester and third trimester abortions most people want only under limited circumstances. They do not want to overturn and reopen social wounds in this country, and they think that any nominee that would do that will probably take the country in the wrong direction.

Looking forward to meeting with senators, being an independent jurist. I think most fair-minded people, not the agitators over at the courts tonight, Mark, but most Americans watching him tonight, they see even a snippet of that, they are going to think he's not a fire-breathing dragon. He's not going to rip up the Constitution and put women in jail. That doesn't strike most people. And so I think that image tonight at the courts hurts the Democrats morning, noon, and nights. I don't like that's attractive. I don't think those women out there tonight helped the Democrats at all. But Frank, your thoughts about what we heard tonight.

A lot of these folks are probably saying, gee, he didn't come out in the health care case the way we wanted. But the fact of the matter is he had a prior precedent he followed. I think it's just a red herring."

And when it comes to potential Supreme Court nominees, no one has the president's ear more than his adviser for judicial nominations Leonard Leo, who is now himself under fire. That's the way it goes. You step in the flames, you're going to get some heat. Leonard is back with us. Leonard, the left is so brutal. Anyone who has had with his president on pretty much any issue has become a target. You are now a target, and Chuck Schumer addressed this today on the Senate floor. Let's watch."

      "utterance": "No one has been more dedicated to the enterprise of building a Supreme Court that will overturn Roe v Wade then the Federalist Society's Leonard Leo, the very man who chose the list of 25. That's what we are up against here. And that's why America is on tenterhooks."

I have known you, Leonard, for a couple decades at least and you don't strike me as this scary dude who is going to shred the Constitution and put people, put constitutional rights in the dumpster. But you have now become part of the story, and how does that feel? You are a mild-mannered guy who cares about the rule of law. A lot of people say why doesn't Leonard go on the court? And you're like I don't want any part of that. But how did that feel today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEO",
      "utterance": "This is actually really insulting and offensive to the president. He made the Supreme Court a defining issue in this election. He took ownership of the list. The list was his idea, his idea."

This is not outsourced. This is the president. And he owns this process. Senator Schumer, he is just hysterical, and they are going to be hysterical through this process. And that's just what we are going to have to deal with. But you know what, the American people are going to see through it because they love the Constitution. They love the constitution."

He was on the golf course over the weekend on the phone half the time talking to people about this process. I have never seen anything like it. And the Democrats are complaining that it's a corrupt, secret game. Of course not. This president has been out there working hard on this for a long time."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What do you say to these never-Trumpers out there? I'm sorry to have to bring them up. But people who say the Democrats should take over in November because this president, this is not a true Republican president. They're out there, George Will, Max Boot, others who sometimes appear on our own network as well. They're a lot of good people, but they are just adamant to block him, supposed Republicans adamant to block this president."

      "speaker": "LEO",

Joining us now from New Orleans to discuss the theater of the confirmation process, bestselling author, FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo. Raymond, I know you spent the day watching old SCOTUS confirmation hearings of the past. So which do you think Kavanaugh could most benefit from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I did, indeed, Laura. And I pulled some because as I looked at the nominee, this is a man, as you've been mentioning, 13 years on the federal bench. But what many people forget, he was part of the Whitewater investigation. He wrote the Starr report which had the articles of impeachment or at least suggested impeachment of President Clinton. He then worked for the Bush administration. I expect, and as I watched these hearings, it put me in mind of Ted Kennedy who in 1987 dredged up Robert Bork's past history, his political history, working for Richard Nixon. Here's what he said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TED KENNEDY, FORMER U.S. SENATOR",
      "utterance": "The man who fired Archibald Cox does not deserve to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States. Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, and schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution. Writers and artists would be censored at the whim of government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Laura, I think we are going to hear that type of language, that dystopian nightmare will be painted again. The black alley abortions, all that dark vision, they are going to try to paint Kavanaugh with that same brush. It worked in the case of Judge Bork because he was very defensive. We can't play all of the hearing, but he was very defensive and sharp and didn't quite know how to fight back and clear his name. That's something Kavanaugh should be wary of."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I remember. I was working at the White House when that went down, and I loved Judge Bork of course. But the charm factor wasn't on display during those hearings. And he kicked puppies too. I'm surprised Ted Kennedy didn't say that. Elena Kagan, by the way, let's remember Kagan, currently associate justice on the court. She had a very interesting way of dealing with tough questions. Watch this exchange from 2010."

      "utterance": "You'll remember that hearing was like stand-up comedy. But Brett Kavanaugh should watch something. He can take that light touch which we saw some of tonight when he was announced. He has that warmth. He needs to get in touch with his inner Jerry Seinfeld and have a good time. But let me tell you the admissions we heard tonight that he was an altar boy, his Jesuit training, that may come back to haunt him because they are going to try to use the Catholic thing against Kavanaugh. Your boss, Clarence Thomas, had similar problems and that they brought -- they threw everything at Clarence Thomas including the kitchen sink. He decided to respond with righteous indignation. This is another way to go. Watch. CLARENCE THOMAS, SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. This is a circus. This is a national disgrace. And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, it is a high-tech lynching for uppity black who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas. And it is the message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you."

And I think I could take a pretty solid bet on this that Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. But this fight ahead of us is going to be something.
