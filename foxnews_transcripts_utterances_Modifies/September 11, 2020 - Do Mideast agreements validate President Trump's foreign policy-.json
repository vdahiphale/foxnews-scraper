Another major Middle East agreement brokered by the Trump administration, this time between Israel and Bahrain.  And our Whatever Happened to segment looks at the return of the guardian angels. This is SPECIAL REPORT.  Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier.  As Americans and the rest of the world fight the coronavirus pandemic, tonight, we remember another crisis. The September 11th attacks amid another historic deal in the region that spawned the Al Qaeda terrorist movement. This is the 19th anniversary of that grim event that brought global terrorism into sharp focus here and inspired major changes in society that continue to this day. Today as we are 19 years to the day from that infamous day, we are 53 days to the next election here in the U.S.  Both President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden paid their respects where one of the planes went down. Along with the grief and solemn remembrance on this day, there are also signs of hope with today's announcement of normalized relations between Israel and Bahrain. It is the second such agreement involving Israel this summer.  Chief White House correspondent John Roberts has details of all of that tonight live from the North Lawn. Good evening, John.",

I'm going to read from this complaint. In mid-May 2020, Mr. Wolf instructed Mr. Murphy, Brian Murphy is his name, to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran. Mr. Wolf stated that these instructions originated from White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. The two men met on July 20th, 2020 at which time Mr. Wolf stated to Mr. Murphy the intelligent notification should be held because it made the president look bad.

Let's start there with our panel, Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and Ben Domenech, publisher at \"The Federalist.\" Ben, there's so much happening day to day that something like this, two big peace deals between Israel and Arab countries, shouldn't be overlooked.

It's a good thing for the world and for the Middle East, for Israel and for the Arab states. And it's a huge accomplishment and vindication of the approach that the Trump administration has used. They get too little credit for this, I think, because of all the different domestic focuses that we've had.

Another major Middle East agreement brokered by the Trump administration, this time between Israel and Bahrain. And our Whatever Happened to segment looks at the return of the guardian angels. This is SPECIAL REPORT. Good evening, welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier. As Americans and the rest of the world fight the coronavirus pandemic, tonight, we remember another crisis. The September 11th attacks amid another historic deal in the region that spawned the Al Qaeda terrorist movement. This is the 19th anniversary of that grim event that brought global terrorism into sharp focus here and inspired major changes in society that continue to this day. Today as we are 19 years to the day from that infamous day, we are 53 days to the next election here in the U.S. Both President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden paid their respects where one of the planes went down. Along with the grief and solemn remembrance on this day, there are also signs of hope with today's announcement of normalized relations between Israel and Bahrain. It is the second such agreement involving Israel this summer. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts has details of all of that tonight live from the North Lawn. Good evening, John."

I had the opportunity to spend a little time in New York City this morning with the vice president, with first responders, with families and with survivors. And I think many of us really remember where we were 19 years ago today. So, I just want to acknowledge today and what it means to those of us that are in the Homeland Security business and go to work every day, trying to make this country more secure. From a threat perspective, we still see a number of our traditional threats that we -- that we battled on 9/11. Counterterrorism, some of our foreign terrorist organizations that are still certainly a threat to the homeland. But we see more of a certainly of a domestic threat here in the country as well over the last several years. So, the threat has changed, it has morphed over the years, but we continue to do all the work at the Department to confront all threats."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "It's certainly one of them. As we've had success on the battlefield overseas, we've seen your traditional Al Qaeda, ISIS, another specific threat sort of diminished in a sense. But that a lone grown or homegrown lone offender that is going to do some type of incident here in the -- in the homeland is certainly a concern for the Department. I know for the FBI and others. So, absolutely, that is certainly the threat that we are focused on today. You've seen that in the last several years. Most of the attacks on the homeland have become from lone offenders or small cells of individuals, so that's where our focus is. But again, we do all threats at the Department. So, while we may be focused on one, we are certainly -- we do the wide range of threats facing the homeland."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. I agree with the FBI director 100 percent. But we're doing a number of things that the Department to address some of the aggressive tactics by China. We see that from an economic security standpoint and immigration security standpoint, visas. So, there's a number of activities that we're partnering with DOJ and the FBI on to absolutely from a long-term perspective, China very similar from an economic perspective is a very much a real concern for us."

So, we continue to build a border wall system, but we also continue to make a number of policy changes that are bringing that integrity back to our immigration system. So, we need to make sure at the end of the day, we want to make sure that individuals coming into the country, we know who they are, that they are coming into the country at legitimate ports of entry and then they're not coming across the border illegally sneaking into the country or coming across in the middle of the night. We want to make sure we know who's coming into the country, whether that's on our southwest border or that's through airplanes and in the air environment. So, we're -- we've done a number of initiatives over the last 3-1/2, four years but we're -- there's more to do and work hard at work on it."

    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "Right, I think that's always a concern, but I think we're in a good place when it comes to funding when that -- for that border wall system. We have over 320 miles that have been built, about 450 will be built, constructed by the end of this fiscal year. So, the president has secured enough funding to continue that border wall system. I mean, there's always an issue of funding the Department of Homeland Security unfortunately. Homeland Security should really be a bipartisan issue and just hasn't been for the last several years unfortunately. So, we'll continue to keep our eye on the ball but again, the 240,000 men and women of the Department of Homeland Security are interested every day in securing this Homeland, it's what we do. We get up, we go to work to secure this homeland, so that we don't have another 9/11 type event occur."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right, Mr. Secretary, I want to deal with this controversy that you're facing and that is a whistleblower investigation. The whistleblower complaint in part says that you particularly told a person working under you to stop going forward with intelligence that pointed to Russia's interference in the election. I'm going to read from this complaint. In mid-May 2020, Mr. Wolf instructed Mr. Murphy, Brian Murphy is his name, to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the United States, and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran. Mr. Wolf stated that these instructions originated from White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. The two men met on July 20th, 2020 at which time Mr. Wolf stated to Mr. Murphy the intelligent notification should be held because it made the president look bad. Mr. Murphy objected, stating that it was improper to hold a vetted intelligence product for reasons for political embarrassment. Your response, that's from the DHS inspector general."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "Right, absolutely. That complaint is completely false, it's a fabrication. We have been very clear regarding Russia interference in our elections. Russian inference at any point. We've produced over 27 different reports over the last 12 months. I believe three alone in the month of August. We provided over 40 different briefings -- in-person briefings to members of Congress and elsewhere about Russian interference in our elections. I've talked about it; I've talk about it on media appearances such as this. Talked about in congressional testimony and I talked about it even this week in my state of the Homeland Security address. So, we've been very clear about making sure that we call out Russia and the administration's been very clear on this. So, I have no idea what he's talking about. That is not the case. It's not any direction I have ever given. We've been very clear. And again, we put out a report regarding Russia interference I believe about three days ago. So, it just -- it just doesn't make any sense."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "So, again, very disappointed in that. I had agreed to testify on two separate occasions in the month of August, both on worldwide threats and on civil unrest what was occurring in Portland. Since that time, I've been nominated and there's been longstanding practice that as you go up for nomination that you don't testify (INAUDIBLE) matters. So, what we have done, we have offered the number two at the Department of Homeland Security to testify in my place. And if not, then I'm happy to testify to the committee once my confirmation process goes through one way or another. So, we have been very accommodating to the committee and unfortunately, it's come down to this."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I think you have to keep in mind, this is an individual - - in this office, if you go back to early August, I received credible and serious complaints that the INA office, our Intelligence and Analysis Office inside DHS was collecting information on American journalist. This individual is in charge of that office. I removed him, that's a bright line for me. While an investigation -- an OIG investigation, inspector general investigation is ongoing on this individual. He didn't like that and so we see now the results of that. But I want to make clear that absolutely what's in that complaint is false."

Mueller's deputy, Andrew Weissmann, for example, quote, \"accidentally wiped clean\" his phones twice, supposedly from entering the wrong passcode too many times deleting all records of communications. Justice Department records also cite forgotten passcodes, screen damage, lost devices, intentional deletions, and phones being, quote, \"unintentionally restored to their factory settings\" as reasons given for not preserving requested electronic materials.

Let's start there with our panel, Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and Ben Domenech, publisher at \"The Federalist.\" Ben, there's so much happening day to day that something like this, two big peace deals between Israel and Arab countries, shouldn't be overlooked. They're going to have a big ceremony, but it's a really big deal. BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": This is a massive deal. It's hugely important. It's a good thing for the world and for the Middle East, for Israel and for the Arab states. And it's a huge accomplishment and vindication of the approach that the Trump administration has used. They get too little credit for this, I think, because of all the different domestic focuses that we've had. But however many lengthy open letter are signed by the displaced foreign policy establishment that didn't dream big enough to try to achieve these things in the past, I think that we have to give them credit for what they've been able to achieve and reach for the good of our country and security in the region."

And the voters there are the people that heard Donald Trump talking about the need to renegotiate trade deals. They blame NAFTA and trade deals for the decline that they have seen in their regions. And that was the margin of error that put him over the victory line. So not only do you have Joe Biden, he voted for it, but then you have the knowledge that promised to fix it and never did. And like you said, totally had the opportunity. There were many things for political reasons that the Obama administration pushed aside even though they had a filibuster proof majority in the Senate for a while, and that included another one, immigration.
