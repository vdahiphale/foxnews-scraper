A must-see TV moment set for tomorrow in Washington, Attorney General Bill Barr and the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will hold a news conference at 9:30 AM, on the dot, on the Mueller report. President Trump saying he may also do the same, having a press conference. Barr has been facing increased scrutiny from Democrats over his handling of the Russian investigation.  So this, Dan, is a moment we've all been waiting for. You're going to get it in the morning whether you like it or not.",

Just as an American and as a human, I actually want to see how Mueller deals with the Trump Tower meeting, Manafort giving polling to the Russians, all of those things. I do think the President Trump's tweets about the Mueller report have gotten increasingly -- how do I say this nicely? Aggressive? In the past few days like he -- it seems a little bit like he's trying to preempt what he knows will not be uniformly good report for him.   There will be things in this report that are embarrassing, that all of us sitting around this table would say I would never have done that if I worked on a presidential campaign.

The Mueller report to the media is like cheap tequila in high school. You try it, you get drunk, and you have a hangover forever, but then you forget about it and you do it again.

There's going to be a lot of little things going on that people can sink their teeth into.  They're going to say well, now we know that the Russians colluded, but we also know that it was a one-way street that Trumps weren't chasing it.

He did not say there was no -- that the Trump campaign said no thank you when they tried to collude. So I think one of the things that people are looking for is how Mueller explains things and events we know happened, and how he explains that they do not amount to criminal collusion. Just as an American and as a human, I actually want to see how Mueller deals with the Trump Tower meeting, Manafort giving polling to the Russians, all of those things. I do think the President Trump's tweets about the Mueller report have gotten increasingly -- how do I say this nicely? Aggressive? In the past few days like he -- it seems a little bit like he's trying to preempt what he knows will not be uniformly good report for him. There will be things in this report that are embarrassing, that all of us sitting around this table would say I would never have done that if I worked on a presidential campaign. I think Trump knows that and is trying to get ahead of it."

But overall, no obstruction, no collusion. I just don't know how CNN is going to handle it because this last week they had the lowest rated week of all of 2019. So they have a choice to make. Are they going to now report real news about Spygate or are they going to continue to push fake news?

They're like, we already know what happened but they're -- no, no, no, no, no, no, Luke, Darth Vader really isn't his father. No, it is. Sorry, guys. But you know what it is? The Mueller report to the media is like cheap tequila in high school. You try it, you get drunk, and you have a hangover forever, but then you forget about it and you do it again. So they're setting themselves up for feeling miserable on Thursday afternoon. I will agree with you, Marie. There is this prison of two ideas. He's vindicated or it's a cover up. There's going to be a lot of little things going on that people can sink their teeth into. They're going to say well, now we know that the Russians colluded, but we also know that it was a one-way street that Trumps weren't chasing it. And so it just means you have to be more aware of what the Russians are doing, but we already knew that. It's really about the Russians and how they manipulated the media, not the voters.

And a lot of the people -- I'm sorry, a lot of the arguments that people say -- used to say Bernie can't possibly win are the similar ones to what people said about President Trump not winning.

I pay my taxes. When you denigrate a system that you happily benefit from, you should do one of two things. Abandon the system and live according to your beliefs, which a lot of people do.

The overall situation cannot be really fixed without massive congressional action. And quite frankly, I don't foresee that happening at all. This Barr thing, this new executive order, I think it's one attempt to try to get a handle on it. It could have the reverse effect of hurting them when it comes to overcrowding. They're already overcrowded at these facilities. They don't have enough room for people. So these are all band aids because Congress won't get off its behind and act.

So what are you for? You can't just be against what he is proposing. The other thing is on the Barr memo or ruling, it's not an executive order, right? He has the ability as the attorney general to overrule the immigration judges if they are misreading the law. It's a serious miscalculation to say that he's changing things wholesale because he's already said, one, is contrary to the practice that the A.G. uses. It's not going to go into effect for 90 days.

Newly released text messages show she was communicating with her staff two weeks before those charges were dropped against the actor. Foxx taking a swipe at Smollett while also mentioning R. Kelly writing \"pedophile with four victims, 10 counts, washed up celeb who lied to cops 16. On a case eligible for deferred prosecution, I think it's indicative of something we should be looking at generally.\" She also wrote \"just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should.\" Foxx's responding to the text messages in a new statement and is defending her communications about the case. Greg, I feel like you have a lot of thoughts on this."

Calling him a liar, calling him a hoaxer, but calling him washed up. That's a stab right in the chest because remember in his mind he did this to - he hoaxed this hate crime to elevate him beyond the mundane level of celebrity hood that he had reached. He felt that he deserved more and that was the whole point of this was to become bigger than what he was. And I just feel like when he reads that little piece of information that washed up, it's just going to - that's worse than going to jail for a guy with an ego."
