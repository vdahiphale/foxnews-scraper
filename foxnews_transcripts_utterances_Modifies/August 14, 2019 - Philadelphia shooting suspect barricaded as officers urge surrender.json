They had already entered the premises and got towards the rear, the kitchen area, when gunfire erupted. The shooter fired multiple rounds. Officers returned fire, many of whom had to escape through windows and doors to get from a barrage of bullets.  Right now, we can tell you that there are six police officers who were struck by gunfire. Thankfully, all of them are in stable condition. Trying to talk to this male, he continues to fire rounds out of the window, so this situation is in no way resolved. We are trying to talk to this male, trying to let him that he can end this peacefully now. We have called him multiple times. He has picked up the phone a couple of times but has not answered.  So, we've been trying to work with a family member, but right now, we have not been successful.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Every minute of every day, Sean, they face that danger. And today, it was right in their faces as they tried to serve a warrant in this narcotics interdiction operation.   And as you heard, the police commissioner say, they were jumping out windows to escape the gunfire from the suspect, who armed himself, according to my sources, with an AR-15, also has, I'm told, several handguns, and has been shooting rounds at a pretty aggressive clip. We were told a couple hours ago that he had fired at least 100 shots, may be more and more gunfire heard around 8:30, so about 30 minutes ago. Just to give our viewers some perspective, we are standing in the middle of Broad Street, just a couple blocks from the North Philly Temple University campus. Erie is right behind me, and the block the commissioner was speaking of, 3600 block of North 15th Street, just to the left of the camera. Just a couple blocks away.  So, we are very close to the scene, but this is about as close as we can get. You see the massive turnout of police here, ATF is on the ground, as well. I believe FBI is here, too, and we know that the SWAT team, Sean, tried to make entry into the residence a short time ago, I'm told from a police source that they retreated. They may have used a stun grenade, and tried to gain entry, but then they were forced to retreat in the face of heavy resistance and more heavy gunfire. I think you heard commissioner mentioned they were using a bullhorn. They were also trying to call the suspect's telephone. Apparently, a girlfriend is involved in these ongoing negotiations to try and talk this guy down and get him out.  But as far as we know, at this moment, Sean, he has not given up. He has fired many rounds out the window, and apparently through the ceiling, as well because we were told a couple of Philadelphia police officers were pinned down, in the building, on the second floor -- suspect on the first floor, shooting up through ceiling.  Was that -- was that gunfire? We may have just heard more shots fired, Sean. So, an ongoing, dangerous situation for the police.  CBS Philly, Sean, by the way, is reporting that at least 30 Philadelphia police officers have fired rounds from their weapons in this ongoing, basically gun battle, that is happening in the streets of North Philadelphia.",

The officers were pinned, may have had suspects in custody, and there was another report that some suspects may have exited the building with SWAT. We can't say for sure if that has happened because we are a little far away from the scene, it's tough to tell if the noises we are hearing our gunfire. I don't want to say it is definitely happening, because again, we are a bit of a distance away, but as you can see, massive police turnout here. The good news for the Philadelphia Police Department is the wounds to those officers were not life-threatening. I heard through a source from doctor who said that they were a graze to the forehead, one person shot -- a police officer shot in the arm, another in the hand. The hand may have been the worst injury.  But three others were hurt in car crashes racing to the scene, Sean. And again, it's an ongoing situation. I don't know if you can see the bus -- the city bus back there, we just saw another city bus pull out of here with probably a dozen, maybe two dozen police officers on board, who look absolutely exhausted.  This thing has been going on for more than four hours now, and apparently, they were changing shift, they left, but they're obviously still more here.",

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Yes, just to piggyback on Rick's reporting, Sean, it's important to get a tick-tock or timeline from police on exactly what happened, 4:30 Eastern Time is when this began. Officers were inside the home in North Philly, they were in the process of serving the narcotics warrant when I got to the back of the house, the kitchen, the gunfire erupted, and police simultaneously returned fire again and again, and then they began escaping through the windows and the doors.  The gunfire clearly went on for a while, because in the initial call, police made the dispatch asking all units to respond, you can hear dozens of shots in the background -- bang, bang, bang. Then the gunfire periodically continued for the next few hours while police tried to contact the shooter, imploring him to surrender. Police say the suspect, as you heard, would answer the phone, but he would not speak, and they're still trying to convince him come along with a girlfriend, to negotiate by telling him that he can and back this peacefully. We say him, because police believe there is only one gunman, but they cannot confirm that.   And here's where the timeline gets a little muddy. At one point, police they officers -- and possibly handcuffed some suspects were on the second floor of the building, and the suspect was on the first floor, firing up into the ceiling, clearly aiming for police. But right now, the exact locations of both the officers and the suspects are unclear.  But the situation is still very much ongoing, and you ask the question earlier of Rick, Sean, and here's where it appears to be kind of even muddier. It appears the suspect was live streaming the standoff on Facebook, right, the police were in the process of shutting that feed off. And during the last news conference, police alluded to a potential hostage situation. But the police officer, the chief, had to leave, and couldn't clarify whether he meant police were being pinned down, or if somebody else entirely might also be involved in this. So, some unanswered questions, even four hours after the shots rang out.",

I know you've had multiple reports on this, so I might be reentering some information that you already know.  But even Philadelphia police tweeting out that they are still working to negotiate with the suspect. The suspect who has two Philadelphia police officers holed up inside of a building with him. As you mentioned, six Philadelphia police officers injured by gunfire with this suspect, all six are expected to be OK. Three of them are here at temple university hospital, another three are over at Einstein Medical Center.  In addition to hearing from Commissioner Ross, we heard from the mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney. And he said, obviously he is very angry right now, very angry about the situation, about all of the violence. He was sharing some personal information about some of the family members of these officers, who have shown up to Temple Hospital, including two young boys who had to come here to see their dad in the hospital. Again, thankfully, all six are expected to be OK, another variable moving into the situation, a thunderstorm. The rain actually just started to fall. We do know that it is expected to last over the next couple of hours, so it's unclear how that might impact this ongoing situation.  Back to you.",

Tonight, as you mentioned, President Trump has been briefed on the situation in Philadelphia, and federal agencies are providing limited support and backup with the Philadelphia police in the lead. Our contacts report both the ATF and FBI are on the scene in Philadelphia, with the ATF providing a tactical squad, and the FBI providing a SWAT team. Based on my years of law enforcement reporting, this is the kind of federal backup and support that gives local law enforcement more latitude and more options to secure the scene and rescue those in the area who remain at risk. By example, in the last few minutes on Twitter, the Philadelphia police reporting parents can now pick up their children from a nearby day care, and three hours into the standoff, the local CBS station reporting four women were actually brought to safety from inside that house. This remains, tonight, a very dynamic situation. Federal authorities are emphasizing to us the absolute need not to report tactical information, not to report how or where police units are operating, because that can give help to the shooter and put more lives at risk tonight, Sean.",

I believe that what happened here was these narcotics officers were trying to serve this arrest warrant, these guys are all hyped up, big cocaine area there, huge seizures of coke earlier this year in Philly. I think that the perp may have thought it was another narcotics gang trying to break into his territory. I can't believe he just started with an AR-15, trying to take on half a dozen cops in armor coming through the door.  I think they've got the place surrounded now. They've got a great SWAT team, Philadelphia PD there. That got to contain it, make sure he doesn't use the thunderstorm and the dark of night to elude the circle that surrounds him. Be patient, wait him out, use the girlfriend if that is what it takes, try to get him down. Get him to back off. Right now, he's got that finger on the hair trigger and is plugging away at anyone.

These officers had entered the residence and there were officers on the second floor of the residents apparently when the shooting started. The gunman with an AR 15 opens fire, several officers are jumping out windows to escape. Six are wounded as you've been reporting. And there were two pinned down upstairs and apparently there were other suspects with those two officers pinned down. People who they had taken into custody as part of this narcotics interdiction operation. So, according to my law enforcement source and Philadelphia police have now tweeted out, they confirm it. Those two officers who were on the second floor, who were pinned down by gunfire have gotten out of the building along with the prisoners. So, all of the people who were trapped in the house aside from the gunman have gotten out. As far as we know, the gunman is still barricaded inside on the first floor of that building. I was told he had put furniture up against the doors and when the SWAT team tried to make entrance, they had to retreat because of the heavy fire coming from the suspect who were told is armed with an AR 15 and several handguns. So, as far as we know he's not given up. The police have been trying to negotiate with him. He's not backing down, but everyone who was trapped on the second floor of that building we're told has now gotten out of the building.",

I mean it reminded me, I had this awful sick feeling in my stomach, it reminded me of the Oklahoma City bombing when we discovered that in the Mora building, you had that - yes that daycare center. Those children were killed. This is the wanton disregard, the recklessness of this person. And you know if I may just very briefly on this whole issue of gun control. There is no way that this perp bought that AR 15 legally. In other words, you can have all the background checks and red flag and believe me I endorse them heartily in the world. They wouldn't have stopped this guy, this knucklehead is a criminal, he's a drug dealer. He was being served. We think this warrant from the narcotics cops, there's no way he went to a gun store and purchased an AR 15.

Basically, no more than 30 or 40 minutes ago, making a little bit of progress. It appeared that his attorney was on a three way line, he was trying to assure him that you know we weren't here to harm him, but after that the conversation ceased. But we do know that he's still alive. I'm just trying to assure him that we weren't here to harm him, but after that conversation ceased. But we do know that he's still alive. I'm just trying to appeal to him you know that he's got a reason that he needs to come out and surrender. Right now, we've gone from a hostage situation to a barricade, because all of the hostages were taken out safely and I can't say enough about what all the responders did. But most importantly, what SWAT did and all their support, Homeland Security and everyone there that was involved as well as everyone that assisted in negotiations. But again, we still got a situation that is not completely resolved. We still want to get this male obviously unscathed. We don't know if he's injured.

We were able to get the other folks out. The prisoners that were in there are also unharmed. And I don't even know miraculously how that happened because there were multiple gunshots fired. He fired shots while I was on location. He hasn't done so in a while. So, we're optimistic that means he's starting to understand that you know there's some benefit to him coming out and surrendering. But we still don't know if that's going to be the case.

And today, it was right in their faces as they tried to serve a warrant in this narcotics interdiction operation. And as you heard, the police commissioner say, they were jumping out windows to escape the gunfire from the suspect, who armed himself, according to my sources, with an AR-15, also has, I'm told, several handguns, and has been shooting rounds at a pretty aggressive clip. We were told a couple hours ago that he had fired at least 100 shots, may be more and more gunfire heard around 8:30, so about 30 minutes ago. Just to give our viewers some perspective, we are standing in the middle of Broad Street, just a couple blocks from the North Philly Temple University campus. Erie is right behind me, and the block the commissioner was speaking of, 3600 block of North 15th Street, just to the left of the camera. Just a couple blocks away. So, we are very close to the scene, but this is about as close as we can get. You see the massive turnout of police here, ATF is on the ground, as well. I believe FBI is here, too, and we know that the SWAT team, Sean, tried to make entry into the residence a short time ago, I'm told from a police source that they retreated. They may have used a stun grenade, and tried to gain entry, but then they were forced to retreat in the face of heavy resistance and more heavy gunfire. I think you heard commissioner mentioned they were using a bullhorn. They were also trying to call the suspect's telephone. Apparently, a girlfriend is involved in these ongoing negotiations to try and talk this guy down and get him out. But as far as we know, at this moment, Sean, he has not given up. He has fired many rounds out the window, and apparently through the ceiling, as well because we were told a couple of Philadelphia police officers were pinned down, in the building, on the second floor -- suspect on the first floor, shooting up through ceiling. Was that -- was that gunfire? We may have just heard more shots fired, Sean. So, an ongoing, dangerous situation for the police. CBS Philly, Sean, by the way, is reporting that at least 30 Philadelphia police officers have fired rounds from their weapons in this ongoing, basically gun battle, that is happening in the streets of North Philadelphia."

We can't say for sure if that has happened because we are a little far away from the scene, it's tough to tell if the noises we are hearing our gunfire. I don't want to say it is definitely happening, because again, we are a bit of a distance away, but as you can see, massive police turnout here. The good news for the Philadelphia Police Department is the wounds to those officers were not life-threatening. I heard through a source from doctor who said that they were a graze to the forehead, one person shot -- a police officer shot in the arm, another in the hand. The hand may have been the worst injury. But three others were hurt in car crashes racing to the scene, Sean. And again, it's an ongoing situation. I don't know if you can see the bus -- the city bus back there, we just saw another city bus pull out of here with probably a dozen, maybe two dozen police officers on board, who look absolutely exhausted. This thing has been going on for more than four hours now, and apparently, they were changing shift, they left, but they're obviously still more here."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, just to piggyback on Rick's reporting, Sean, it's important to get a tick-tock or timeline from police on exactly what happened, 4:30 Eastern Time is when this began. Officers were inside the home in North Philly, they were in the process of serving the narcotics warrant when I got to the back of the house, the kitchen, the gunfire erupted, and police simultaneously returned fire again and again, and then they began escaping through the windows and the doors. The gunfire clearly went on for a while, because in the initial call, police made the dispatch asking all units to respond, you can hear dozens of shots in the background -- bang, bang, bang. Then the gunfire periodically continued for the next few hours while police tried to contact the shooter, imploring him to surrender. Police say the suspect, as you heard, would answer the phone, but he would not speak, and they're still trying to convince him come along with a girlfriend, to negotiate by telling him that he can and back this peacefully. We say him, because police believe there is only one gunman, but they cannot confirm that. And here's where the timeline gets a little muddy. At one point, police they officers -- and possibly handcuffed some suspects were on the second floor of the building, and the suspect was on the first floor, firing up into the ceiling, clearly aiming for police. But right now, the exact locations of both the officers and the suspects are unclear. But the situation is still very much ongoing, and you ask the question earlier of Rick, Sean, and here's where it appears to be kind of even muddier. It appears the suspect was live streaming the standoff on Facebook, right, the police were in the process of shutting that feed off. And during the last news conference, police alluded to a potential hostage situation. But the police officer, the chief, had to leave, and couldn't clarify whether he meant police were being pinned down, or if somebody else entirely might also be involved in this. So, some unanswered questions, even four hours after the shots rang out."

      "utterance": "Yes. So, we got that update from Commissioner Richard Ross about 45 minutes ago, he was very clear in saying the situation is far from over. I know you've had multiple reports on this, so I might be reentering some information that you already know. But even Philadelphia police tweeting out that they are still working to negotiate with the suspect. The suspect who has two Philadelphia police officers holed up inside of a building with him. As you mentioned, six Philadelphia police officers injured by gunfire with this suspect, all six are expected to be OK. Three of them are here at temple university hospital, another three are over at Einstein Medical Center. In addition to hearing from Commissioner Ross, we heard from the mayor of Philadelphia, Jim Kenney. And he said, obviously he is very angry right now, very angry about the situation, about all of the violence. He was sharing some personal information about some of the family members of these officers, who have shown up to Temple Hospital, including two young boys who had to come here to see their dad in the hospital. Again, thankfully, all six are expected to be OK, another variable moving into the situation, a thunderstorm. The rain actually just started to fall. We do know that it is expected to last over the next couple of hours, so it's unclear how that might impact this ongoing situation. Back to you."

Tonight, as you mentioned, President Trump has been briefed on the situation in Philadelphia, and federal agencies are providing limited support and backup with the Philadelphia police in the lead. Our contacts report both the ATF and FBI are on the scene in Philadelphia, with the ATF providing a tactical squad, and the FBI providing a SWAT team. Based on my years of law enforcement reporting, this is the kind of federal backup and support that gives local law enforcement more latitude and more options to secure the scene and rescue those in the area who remain at risk. By example, in the last few minutes on Twitter, the Philadelphia police reporting parents can now pick up their children from a nearby day care, and three hours into the standoff, the local CBS station reporting four women were actually brought to safety from inside that house. This remains, tonight, a very dynamic situation. Federal authorities are emphasizing to us the absolute need not to report tactical information, not to report how or where police units are operating, because that can give help to the shooter and put more lives at risk tonight, Sean."

So I would like to do an echo of what the chief of police said, to this guy, if he's watching. You can end this now. And if you don't end it, and I understand there are two law enforcement officers on the second floor, if you harm those officers, you will be shot, you will be killed, they will come in.

Chicago gets the rap, but statistically, Chicago and Philadelphia ranked pretty similarly at the top of the big city violent crime areas. Nicetown, I don't mean to be unkind, it's not the nicest part of Philadelphia. I believe that what happened here was these narcotics officers were trying to serve this arrest warrant, these guys are all hyped up, big cocaine area there, huge seizures of coke earlier this year in Philly. I think that the perp may have thought it was another narcotics gang trying to break into his territory. I can't believe he just started with an AR-15, trying to take on half a dozen cops in armor coming through the door. I think they've got the place surrounded now. They've got a great SWAT team, Philadelphia PD there. That got to contain it, make sure he doesn't use the thunderstorm and the dark of night to elude the circle that surrounds him. Be patient, wait him out, use the girlfriend if that is what it takes, try to get him down. Get him to back off. Right now, he's got that finger on the hair trigger and is plugging away at anyone. And now, you can have thunder, you are not going to know if it's thunder or gunfire. It's a mess in Philly, but patience. They've got the perimeter secure. Patience is what these cops need and I'm sure the chief is advising exactly that."

The miracle is the six officers that had pointed out, no life threatening injuries, thank God. The nightmare, unprecedented in brutality, unprecedented in savage attack, both in duration and complexity. In my time -- I was there in '86 when Larry Davis got shot, I was working that night in the Bronx, Larry Davis shot six officers. This is unbelievable. These two officers with their prisoners still at the crime scene. Unreal. Going into five hours. And as Geraldo pointed out, to make matters unspeakably worse and more complex, we got a thunderstorm landing on it, which will add other manners of complexity to it. So, unreal. Very, very bad. Very complicated scene. And a miracle on the other side. So, I salute Philadelphia police. I salute you guys."

If he starts to harm, as I said, those police officers, or continue to shoot up where their safety may be a concern, they are going to go in and they are going to take him out. But on the other hand, right now, all they have to do is to be patient, to continue to try to open up some forms of communication. It is always good to have a relative there, so they clearly know who he is. And so, that relative may very well help law enforcement to talk this guy out. But one of the essential words here is patience. As long as no other law enforcement officers are in direct harm, then they can be patient, Sean."

This guy has to be shot like a dog in a yard. He is a bad guy. And I think the negotiation phase is out the window.

They ran out of patience at a certain point. A police helicopter was used, explosives involved, lots of casualties. I'm sure that the institution of the Philadelphia Police Department remembers the price that they paid for running out of patience back then in that gory confrontation between the black liberation movement, the group, and the Philadelphia PD. I think that right now, they've got this situation contained. They've got the manpower -- at some point, this dude has got to sleep. He got to nod out. At some point, he's going to --"

I'm also hearing now -- this from a source, Sean -- that one presenter and officers were removed from the second floor. So, apparently, those officers who were pinned down on the second floor have been able to get out. Again, this is from one source, and I haven't been able to confirm it with the Philadelphia Police Department, but my sources telling me there are two prisoners is still on the second floor and the shooter is on the first floor. Now, we have been told that there are officers trapped inside the building who had some suspects in custody, so perhaps those officers had to leave some of those guys in the house when they got out. But they took one guy with them. The two officers pinned down got out, now the suspect is still inside on the first floor --"

They have a bullhorn. They've also been calling his cell phone. But as we reported earlier, Sean, this guy has apparently been live streaming at least some of the ongoing situation from inside that residence. That is not the act of someone who is ready to give up. It could be a very long night for these Philadelphia police officers, and also ATF on scene. We saw some heavily armed and heavily jacketed officers, also some canines are out here. And, you know, there's a command post set up at the corner of Broad and Erie.

He knows six police are shot. I don't know if he knows how badly they're shot. And what we've got to do in situations like this and I've had situations like this, it is not as bad as this but where you've got someone who's got nothing to lose who's already got an arrest warrant for drunk charges who has been shooting people and now he's got people in the building who can't get out because he's there, everything is at stake here. And I've got to comment Sean, Kamala Harris has shown just how small she is along with the Democrats to talk about gun control. She is specially a former district attorney should understand, you don't know the facts, you don't know the risk. You're only speculating. You don't know what you're talking about. And to not be concerned about police, victims, the public at large and she's concerned about gun control because she wants to be the President, they are so small, they're not worth talking about."

However, the gunman is still inside that building. I have more good news to report since we last talked with you about 30 minutes ago. Now two of the injured police officers here at Temple have been released. It was a short time ago, it happened on the other side of the hospital. One of our photographers was able to capture the moment first. One of the injured officers, he had bandages on both of his arms. He walked out of the hospital and all of his fellow officers' men and women in blue standing by to salute him. Then just minutes ago, the second officer, the one that had a graze wound to the head was also released from the hospital. We had been reporting all afternoon and evening that it was six police officers who were shot but all of them were suffering non-life threatening injuries, so perhaps we will continue to see these officers be released one-by-one. There is only one officer still here inside of Temple. There were three additional officers undergoing treatment at Einstein Medical Center all while this situation is still unfolding.

These officers had entered the residence and there were officers on the second floor of the residents apparently when the shooting started. The gunman with an AR 15 opens fire, several officers are jumping out windows to escape. Six are wounded as you've been reporting. And there were two pinned down upstairs and apparently there were other suspects with those two officers pinned down. People who they had taken into custody as part of this narcotics interdiction operation. So, according to my law enforcement source and Philadelphia police have now tweeted out, they confirm it. Those two officers who were on the second floor, who were pinned down by gunfire have gotten out of the building along with the prisoners. So, all of the people who were trapped in the house aside from the gunman have gotten out. As far as we know, the gunman is still barricaded inside on the first floor of that building. I was told he had put furniture up against the doors and when the SWAT team tried to make entrance, they had to retreat because of the heavy fire coming from the suspect who were told is armed with an AR 15 and several handguns. So, as far as we know he's not given up. The police have been trying to negotiate with him. He's not backing down, but everyone who was trapped on the second floor of that building we're told has now gotten out of the building."

And that just happened. That's great news also on top of the two officers. We know they left the hospital. Rick Leventhal standby in Philly with us tonight. First joining us more on this breaking news, Fox News Correspondent Geraldo Rivera retired NYPD Detective Pat Brosnan and Fox News Contributor, Ted Williams. He's a former D.C. Police Detective. Geraldo that had been my fear and I knew, my gut was telling me we're not getting that answer. And I just instinctively felt that there were people still in that building.

So, here's a guy with a long gun, an AR 15. He's popping, he's popping away. There are little babies at the daycare center right across the street. I mean it reminded me, I had this awful sick feeling in my stomach, it reminded me of the Oklahoma City bombing when we discovered that in the Mora building, you had that - yes that daycare center. Those children were killed. This is the wanton disregard, the recklessness of this person. And you know if I may just very briefly on this whole issue of gun control. There is no way that this perp bought that AR 15 legally. In other words, you can have all the background checks and red flag and believe me I endorse them heartily in the world. They wouldn't have stopped this guy, this knucklehead is a criminal, he's a drug dealer. He was being served. We think this warrant from the narcotics cops, there's no way he went to a gun store and purchased an AR 15. So, I don't think that gun control is relevant to the current discussion even if it was appropriate to bring up a political issue, so close with the incidents--"

Let me go back to Ted Williams Ted, my fear has been all day that there were still people in that building. It turns out my fears were warranted. Thankfully, not only the cops get out, but the people that they had taken prisoner got out with them, which is going to now open up more options as I suspected the options of the police on the outside were limited if in fact people were still in the building. Now that those people have been removed from the building assuming nobody else is in there, their options now have multiplied by a factor of a thousand."

As long as those police officers lest have been on the second floor in harm's way, there were exigent circumstances that existed here, and law enforcement officers were definitely going to protect one or two of their own. Now under the circumstances that you now only have a barricade situation with this one alleged shooter there in that home, they can do what Geraldo and Pat has said earlier and that is they can certainly wait this person out. But let me also say this very quickly, I don't get into the political minutia about guns and all of this, but law enforcement officers in this country really feel that they outgun, law enforcement officers normally will carry a Glock 9 millimeter. And when you've got somebody with an AR 15 rifle and I'm sure that Geraldo is right that this was not legally purchased that this was illegally out there. This is the kind of firepower that law enforcement officers are deeply, deeply concerned about."

That means the odds of this guy coming out alive have now greatly been reduced in my opinion and it's not that they wouldn't want to take him alive, they've given him every opportunity to put his hands up and come out, Pat.

They're going to ultimately figure out how to bum rush that apartment he's in on the first floor and crush them and take him out with the gun fire just like the rabid dog that he is. And that's what's going to happen here. It's not going to end pretty at all. I don't know if it's going to be 5 AM or 3 AM or 1 AM, but it will be merciless, and it will be executed with precision and they'll be cognizant of trip wires. But this guy has to stop. He has an extraordinary amount of ammunition. He has a highly unusual tenacity and commitment to his twisted mission, but ultimately, he's a coward and he's a punk. And he does not want to be in a wheelchair in prison and shoot it out with these cops and they take him alive. And that's why they kill themselves time and time again. So, it may end that way.

They were all taken out safely thus far. However, this male is still holed up inside here. We're talking to him for one of the first times. Basically, no more than 30 or 40 minutes ago, making a little bit of progress. It appeared that his attorney was on a three way line, he was trying to assure him that you know we weren't here to harm him, but after that the conversation ceased. But we do know that he's still alive. I'm just trying to assure him that we weren't here to harm him, but after that conversation ceased. But we do know that he's still alive. I'm just trying to appeal to him you know that he's got a reason that he needs to come out and surrender. Right now, we've gone from a hostage situation to a barricade, because all of the hostages were taken out safely and I can't say enough about what all the responders did. But most importantly, what SWAT did and all their support, Homeland Security and everyone there that was involved as well as everyone that assisted in negotiations. But again, we still got a situation that is not completely resolved. We still want to get this male obviously unscathed. We don't know if he's injured. And my conversations with him, it doesn't appear that he is, but I'm not sure. So, we will keep you apprised but didn't want to keep you in the dark about where we were and have you - just have to speculate about the status regarding the police officers and the hostages. We are very, very lucky with six police officers shot in one incident. It is remarkable that I believe a couple of them have been released already. And so, it is nothing short of astounding that in such a confined space that we didn't have more of a tragedy than we did. So, we're so thankful that they were able to get out. We were able to get the other folks out. The prisoners that were in there are also unharmed. And I don't even know miraculously how that happened because there were multiple gunshots fired. He fired shots while I was on location. He hasn't done so in a while. So, we're optimistic that means he's starting to understand that you know there's some benefit to him coming out and surrendering. But we still don't know if that's going to be the case. So, I'm in a better position to take some more questions right now than I was before because our people around there and they'll keep me updated as we go forward."

And in fact, police officers that had other suspects in custody were in that building up until 20 minutes ago.
