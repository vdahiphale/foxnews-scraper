      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. We have a big show on deck with Kellyanne Conway, Mark Levin, Michelle Malkin and Mike Huckabee coming up. But first, my open.  You know, I've had a change of heart. Unlike everyone on the right, I don't want the Mueller investigation to end so soon. I wanted to keep going on and on and on, because every day, it gets closer to proving Russia collusion. The collusion however, with Russia and team Obama, not Trump.  Whether it is Hillary's reset button, the sale of 20% of our uranium to Russia with $145 million pay back to the Clinton Foundation, or the fact that the Obama administration watched as Russia annexed Crimea and then invaded Ukraine while Barack Obama whispered in that off mic moment quote, \"Tell Vlad, I'll have more leeway or flexibility after the election.\" Or whether you even believe Barack told Putin when he became aware of Russians attempt to meddle to knock it off or when Obama weaponized the intelligence community to unmask Trump people like Michael Flynn, Carter Page ,and others.  The truth is, every day, we get to watch the evidence of the framing of Donald Trump exposed. This week the Hill's John Solomon broke yet another explosive story of anti-Trump conspiracy. Now, we will know Hillary Clinton and the DNC gave millions to an opposition research firm, Fusion GPS that then hired Christopher Steele to create dirt on Donald Trump in order to surveil his campaign. To this day, we still have not heard why a FISA court judge would even consider signing a surveillance warrant based upon this fraudulent document, but what no one seems to be talking about, is that this same dossier is the basis of the Mueller investigation itself.  Right after his election, mind you, after Donald Trump's win, the head of Fusion GPS meet with a top Justice Department official, Bruce Ohr. Two days later, Ohr, Rod Rosenstein's right hand takes the information from Fusion back to the DOJ and gives it to the FBI setting off the beginning of the Mueller investigation. Now, a Russia collusion criminal investigation. Christopher Steele of course terminated by the FBI for leaking information to the media, yet, even after the election and his dismissal, he continues to meet and speak with Bruce Ohr, who takes this information from a source he is not allowed to work with. Ohr then launders it, feeds it to Justice and the FBI and then, he amazingly tries to get the discredited Steele back into the FBI as a human source.  So why would Ohr after back channeling information with Steele, a fired FBI human source work so hard to get Steele back into the FBI? Think about the timing. There is only one reason Steele is the one person who supports the inaccurate, unverified dossier. Even Comey said it was unverified, but in order to get the Department of Justice and FBI interested in a new criminal Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it was essential that Steele be back in their good graces.   And by the way, if you think Peter Strzok and Lisa Page hated Donald Trump, folks, meet Christopher Steele -- a discredited FBI source trying desperately to get on Mueller's destroy Trump team. Peter Strzok, another Trump hater, although he admits there was no \"there there\" also seeks and gets on the Mueller team. So, team Mueller have on it. The more you investigate, procrastinate and fail to find evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, the more you become hoisted by your own petard. But Bob, my question is to you -- how could you possibly be investigating Donald Trump when there is absolutely no credible basis for your investigation? And what the hell have you and your Trump hating conflicted team of prosecutors come up with in the last 19 months other than a tax evasion case that does not involve Donald Trump, Russia or collusion of any sort and should be prosecuted by a regular US Attorney's office, and not you. But more important, Bob, is what you are hiding and protecting as you continue with your fraudulent investigation. Permit me. In 2009, a Russian oligarch named Deripaska was asked by the FBI to give millions of his own money to fund an FBI operation. The man running the FBI, Bob, you. The man courting the Russian oligarch for money was Andrew McCabe, Deputy Director of the FBI, now, since fired.   Now, Bob, in spite of the fact that Deripaska had been banished by the United States three years earlier in 2006, because of his organized crime affiliations, your FBI asks him to fund one of your operations? But more important, after Donald Trump is elected, Deripaska is asked by the FBI to help corroborate the Steele dossier? Deparaska himself stopped at the idea that Trump colluded with Russia, quote, \"You're trying to create something out of nothing.\" Fast-forward nine years later and you indict Paul Manafort, but one name is left out of that indictment. Bob, your indictment makes no mention of Deripaska even though you had evidence that Manafort wanted to invite him to a Trump campaign briefing. So my question to you, Bob Mueller would be as follows: Are you using the Christopher Steele fake dossier as a basis of your investigation? What crime are you investigating? Did you know Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele communicated directly although surreptitiously after Steele was fired? Was Bruce Ohr working with you getting information to you? And of course, you know Bruce's wife, Nelly was getting paid for and working for Fusion GPS, have you investigated that conflict?  And speaking of wives making money off of their husbands in DOJ and FBI, have you investigated Andrew McCabe 's wife for the money she took from the Clinton connected McAullife for her campaign? Which money she could keep if she did not spend them? And why did you give a special security clearance to Peter Strzok? Allowing him to declassify information. Why did it take us four months to find out why you fired Peter Strzok? Why would ask for millions of dollars from a Russian oligarch, banned from the United States, to fund and FBI operation? Should you even have asked the oligarch for tens of millions of dollars and for his services? Because that is a crime, isn't it, Bob?   I'm sure you know the Anti-deficiency Act prohibits you as a government agency from accepting voluntary services, and if it came out that you took money, Bob, from a Russian oligarch whose name you intentionally left out of Manafort's indictment, that would be an embarrassment, wouldn't it? Isn't that why you never put his name in the Manafort indictment? And by the way, isn't this a classic conflict of interest? And when Deripaska laughed at the idea of Trump collusion with Russia, was that exculpatory information conveyed to the FISA court? Aren't you worried that your prior actions with Deripaska are worthy of its own grand jury investigation?  And speaking of the FISA court, isn't your whole investigation premised on a fake dossier paid for by Hillary, created by a man who hates Donald Trump and used two con a FISA court judge? Bob, I really think it is time for you to give up your phony investigation and get yourself your own criminal defense attorney. And that is my open. If you love my opening statements, you're going to love my new book, number one New York Times bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And joining me now with reaction to my open and all the developing news this week, counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway. Kellyanne, good evening, it's nice to have you on set tonight.",

And he talks about the Department of Justice and the fact that the Department of Justice is not giving Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or the appropriate government agencies.   And the FBI he says won't even give one, I may have to get involved. What are they hiding? McCabe's wife took big campaign dollars.

Because you are still talking about 2016. We know he was democratically elected. We know nobody was colluding and it changed a single vote.

That's always been their position, so the question is now, can they subpoena the president? Well, they can subpoena whomever they want. The issue is how does the President respond to a subpoena and the president should respond to the subpoena depending on what the subpoena says.  If the subpoena seeks information from the President, either in person or otherwise, that raises questions about President's prerogatives, he must not reply. A prosecutor appointed by a Deputy Attorney General is acting Attorney General and is a subordinate of the President. He doesn't get to question the President's prerogatives and the President exercising those prerogatives. And that's why that cannot be obstruction of justice. Judge, think for a second. If the opposite were the case, then a President can be hit time and time and time and time again with threats of charges against him for obstruction because he fired somebody. So you would have an FBI Director who can theoretically politically blackmail the President of the United States if he even thinks about firing him or a CIA director, anybody of the sort.",

It's popular nowadays to say ICE is bad, but there is no better representation of American values right now than ICE and as an equal opportunity employer, we accept all levels of experience from low to very low and those diagnosed with other anger issues.

      "speaker": "JEANINE PIRRO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I am Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. We have a big show on deck with Kellyanne Conway, Mark Levin, Michelle Malkin and Mike Huckabee coming up. But first, my open. You know, I've had a change of heart. Unlike everyone on the right, I don't want the Mueller investigation to end so soon. I wanted to keep going on and on and on, because every day, it gets closer to proving Russia collusion. The collusion however, with Russia and team Obama, not Trump. Whether it is Hillary's reset button, the sale of 20% of our uranium to Russia with $145 million pay back to the Clinton Foundation, or the fact that the Obama administration watched as Russia annexed Crimea and then invaded Ukraine while Barack Obama whispered in that off mic moment quote, \"Tell Vlad, I'll have more leeway or flexibility after the election.\" Or whether you even believe Barack told Putin when he became aware of Russians attempt to meddle to knock it off or when Obama weaponized the intelligence community to unmask Trump people like Michael Flynn, Carter Page ,and others. The truth is, every day, we get to watch the evidence of the framing of Donald Trump exposed. This week the Hill's John Solomon broke yet another explosive story of anti-Trump conspiracy. Now, we will know Hillary Clinton and the DNC gave millions to an opposition research firm, Fusion GPS that then hired Christopher Steele to create dirt on Donald Trump in order to surveil his campaign. To this day, we still have not heard why a FISA court judge would even consider signing a surveillance warrant based upon this fraudulent document, but what no one seems to be talking about, is that this same dossier is the basis of the Mueller investigation itself. Right after his election, mind you, after Donald Trump's win, the head of Fusion GPS meet with a top Justice Department official, Bruce Ohr. Two days later, Ohr, Rod Rosenstein's right hand takes the information from Fusion back to the DOJ and gives it to the FBI setting off the beginning of the Mueller investigation. Now, a Russia collusion criminal investigation. Christopher Steele of course terminated by the FBI for leaking information to the media, yet, even after the election and his dismissal, he continues to meet and speak with Bruce Ohr, who takes this information from a source he is not allowed to work with. Ohr then launders it, feeds it to Justice and the FBI and then, he amazingly tries to get the discredited Steele back into the FBI as a human source. So why would Ohr after back channeling information with Steele, a fired FBI human source work so hard to get Steele back into the FBI? Think about the timing. There is only one reason Steele is the one person who supports the inaccurate, unverified dossier. Even Comey said it was unverified, but in order to get the Department of Justice and FBI interested in a new criminal Trump-Russia collusion investigation, it was essential that Steele be back in their good graces. And by the way, if you think Peter Strzok and Lisa Page hated Donald Trump, folks, meet Christopher Steele -- a discredited FBI source trying desperately to get on Mueller's destroy Trump team. Peter Strzok, another Trump hater, although he admits there was no \"there there\" also seeks and gets on the Mueller team. So, team Mueller have on it. The more you investigate, procrastinate and fail to find evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, the more you become hoisted by your own petard. But Bob, my question is to you -- how could you possibly be investigating Donald Trump when there is absolutely no credible basis for your investigation? And what the hell have you and your Trump hating conflicted team of prosecutors come up with in the last 19 months other than a tax evasion case that does not involve Donald Trump, Russia or collusion of any sort and should be prosecuted by a regular US Attorney's office, and not you. But more important, Bob, is what you are hiding and protecting as you continue with your fraudulent investigation. Permit me. In 2009, a Russian oligarch named Deripaska was asked by the FBI to give millions of his own money to fund an FBI operation. The man running the FBI, Bob, you. The man courting the Russian oligarch for money was Andrew McCabe, Deputy Director of the FBI, now, since fired. Now, Bob, in spite of the fact that Deripaska had been banished by the United States three years earlier in 2006, because of his organized crime affiliations, your FBI asks him to fund one of your operations? But more important, after Donald Trump is elected, Deripaska is asked by the FBI to help corroborate the Steele dossier? Deparaska himself stopped at the idea that Trump colluded with Russia, quote, \"You're trying to create something out of nothing.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Fast-forward nine years later and you indict Paul Manafort, but one name is left out of that indictment. Bob, your indictment makes no mention of Deripaska even though you had evidence that Manafort wanted to invite him to a Trump campaign briefing. So my question to you, Bob Mueller would be as follows",
      "utterance": "Are you using the Christopher Steele fake dossier as a basis of your investigation? What crime are you investigating? Did you know Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele communicated directly although surreptitiously after Steele was fired? Was Bruce Ohr working with you getting information to you? And of course, you know Bruce's wife, Nelly was getting paid for and working for Fusion GPS, have you investigated that conflict? And speaking of wives making money off of their husbands in DOJ and FBI, have you investigated Andrew McCabe 's wife for the money she took from the Clinton connected McAullife for her campaign? Which money she could keep if she did not spend them? And why did you give a special security clearance to Peter Strzok? Allowing him to declassify information. Why did it take us four months to find out why you fired Peter Strzok? Why would ask for millions of dollars from a Russian oligarch, banned from the United States, to fund and FBI operation? Should you even have asked the oligarch for tens of millions of dollars and for his services? Because that is a crime, isn't it, Bob? I'm sure you know the Anti-deficiency Act prohibits you as a government agency from accepting voluntary services, and if it came out that you took money, Bob, from a Russian oligarch whose name you intentionally left out of Manafort's indictment, that would be an embarrassment, wouldn't it? Isn't that why you never put his name in the Manafort indictment? And by the way, isn't this a classic conflict of interest? And when Deripaska laughed at the idea of Trump collusion with Russia, was that exculpatory information conveyed to the FISA court? Aren't you worried that your prior actions with Deripaska are worthy of its own grand jury investigation? And speaking of the FISA court, isn't your whole investigation premised on a fake dossier paid for by Hillary, created by a man who hates Donald Trump and used two con a FISA court judge? Bob, I really think it is time for you to give up your phony investigation and get yourself your own criminal defense attorney. And that is my open. If you love my opening statements, you're going to love my new book, number one New York Times bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And joining me now with reaction to my open and all the developing news this week, counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway. Kellyanne, good evening, it's nice to have you on set tonight."

The President tweeted today that the big story that the fake news media refuses to report is lowlife, Christopher Steele's many meetings with the Deputy AG Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. And he talks about the Department of Justice and the fact that the Department of Justice is not giving Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or the appropriate government agencies. And the FBI he says won't even give one, I may have to get involved. What are they hiding? McCabe's wife took big campaign dollars. Okay, what the President is saying is, why isn't the FBI giving this information to Congress and to Judicial Watch?"
    },

      "speaker": "CONWAY",

We don't want people to think that this is -- that everybody in Washington does this. Everybody in Washington doesn't do this. In fact, the only dirt as the winning campaign manager, I researched for Hillary Clinton was five foot two, eyes of blue, oh what corruptions she would say and do. It was all right there in Hillary Clinton. Never looked outside of her statements, her lies, the problem that she had with the truth, the problem the public had with her."

I was out there every day on the TV saying what our strategy was. The President most importantly, our best asset and the Vice President, our second-best asset, out there every single day, connecting with people directly and promising them to do everything they are doing now, which is fantastic."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "... why isn't the FBI giving the Andrew McCabe text messages to Judicial Watch or the appropriate government authority? Congress is trying to do its oversight. It tells me if he is doing a tweet like that, he doesn't have confidence in Christopher Wray, neither do I to be honest with you. Christopher Wray from day one, and I don't know who made these recommendations. But from day one, he danced with Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "But that isn't what he is saying. The President is not saying that. In fact, the president directed the FBI Director last week to go in front of the briefing room and tell the country along with the Secretary of Homeland Security and Ambassadors and others, what this administration is doing with respect to cybersecurity and election security, heck a lot more than the last administration did. So, I am not going to go there, but I will tell you, the president's frustration is one that is shared by many Americans, Judge Jeanine, because people just want to make sure that all sides of this are being investigated and I would note that since the Department of Justice and the FBI started to turnover with more of these e-mails and more of these unredacted documents, I suppose at a swifter pace, look at everything that has come out."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "But the President, who I spoke to this week several times, two short days ago. We discussed some of this. He is very pleased that more information is coming out that you can now connect more dots between these people who were trying all these shenanigans even after he was elected, always trying to nullify the democratically elected President, but I agree with you, too. As this investigation goes on, let's make sure the losers are investigated also because what people are saying right now is, why are they still talking about 2016? Why can't they get over it? Because you are still talking about 2016. We know he was democratically elected. We know nobody was colluding and it changed a single vote. In fact, the Deputy Attorney General announced last month, Jeanine, 12 indictment against Russians. He made very clear that there is no evidence a single vote was changed and that this affected the election outcome."

Under the Constitution, you say that the President cannot be indicted. So what is the point of all that's been going on with Mueller and his team? MARK LEVIN, HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\": First of all, it is an honor to be with you. You are a great lawyer."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "A couple of things here on the constitutional level. No, Mueller cannot on his own indict a sitting president. I've talked about this for 18 months. So now even the professors who show up on Fox comprehend what I'm talking about. That's the position of the Department of Justice and their two memos. That's always been their position, so the question is now, can they subpoena the president? Well, they can subpoena whomever they want. The issue is how does the President respond to a subpoena and the president should respond to the subpoena depending on what the subpoena says. If the subpoena seeks information from the President, either in person or otherwise, that raises questions about President's prerogatives, he must not reply. A prosecutor appointed by a Deputy Attorney General is acting Attorney General and is a subordinate of the President. He doesn't get to question the President's prerogatives and the President exercising those prerogatives. And that's why that cannot be obstruction of justice. Judge, think for a second. If the opposite were the case, then a President can be hit time and time and time and time again with threats of charges against him for obstruction because he fired somebody. So you would have an FBI Director who can theoretically politically blackmail the President of the United States if he even thinks about firing him or a CIA director, anybody of the sort."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, I believe that that is already going on because James Comey was the head of the FBI. If there was a problem, he could've started an investigation, he gets fired and then decides he needs to leak and get an investigation, get things out in the public square. But if Mueller were to subpoena, to what end is the subpoena?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "To no end. Mueller has nothing and he wants to get something. He thinks the President is Martha Stewart. He is not Martha Stewart, he's President of the United States and I want to make this clear, Mr. Mueller is nothing but a single prosecutor. We have thousands of prosecutors in this country. We have one president of the United States. He ran against 16 or 17 other Republicans in primaries. People came out in various states and voted for him. He participated in debates. He participated in the electoral process. He went through the general election. He won the general election. The American people knew who they were voting for. He won fair and square through our Constitution. You cannot have a single prosecutor accountable to no one, elected by nobody, having the power to take down a sitting president of the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay ..."
    },
    {

      "utterance": "That is the bottom line."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But it is even worse than that. With all due respect, what they are looking at are the actions that President Trump took while he was in office. Given you cannot indict a president and given that they are looking at things he did as president, that means that every time the opposing party feels like it, if they can get somebody in the Justice Department to say we need to investigate the President for doing this, I mean it is nonsense. There is no end. You subpoena, what for? So that they can create an impeachment document? This is lunacy. Should the President fire Mueller?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "I would not fire him right now. I mean, I think he has Mueller on the ropes, believe it or not."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "The President wraps himself in his constitutional prerogatives and he dukes it out. And the fact is that Mr. Mueller shouldn't be met issuing any subpoenas. If he really want questions answered by the President to fill gaps in his massive investigation of nothing, then that is one thing, but he doesn't have that. So what we have here, which is different than every other case that the president has been involved in as far as I know, we have this broad effort to ask broad questions to try and catch a president that may disagree with one of the 450,000 witnesses that Mr. Mueller has already interviewed. That's not how this works. That's not how it has ever worked in the past. They are supposed to be very, very narrow related to some conduct of the President of the United States. There has been no conduct of the President of the United States that merits any criminal investigation. Do you want to know how I know that, Judge? Because when Mr. Mueller was appointed, there was no criminal statute that was cited by Mr. Rosenstein in his appointment in the first place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, Rosenstein is another one that apparently, there were some members of Congress who wanted to impeach. Paul Ryan leadership would not let them go forward with it. I mean, it's almost as though the establishment is in line with the Democrats based on a false dossier paid for by Hillary Clinton. She is at the genesis of all of this. But let me ask you this, you and I both know the President and we know he does want to talk and it's every lawyer around him who was saying, this should not be done, not just because we want you to or we don't, but constitutionally it should not be done. What do you think the President's base wants here ?"

And will you get to the ballot box and not only oppose the radical progressives who believe in the open borders agenda and undermining our public safety, our national sovereignty and economic self-determination, but will you also oppose those big business Chamber of Commerce forces that are every bit as opposed to Donald Trump as the radical left?"

California jurors deciding the company's popular Roundup pesticide is responsible for contributing to the man's non- Hodgkin's lymphoma. Monsanto denies the link between glyphosate, the product's active ingredient and cancer saying hundreds of studies have established its safety. A spokesperson says the company will appeal the decision. And Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk sued by investors accusing them of defrauding shareholders in an attempt to manipulate the company's stock price. The complaint says, Musk's recent tweet about taking the company private were misleading and artificially inflated Tesla's stock price.

All right, guys, we were just talking about ICE and the abolition of ICE and how it pursues in joke with Michelle Wolf and then now, there's people who are actually offering money to have ICE agents killed. During the break, I just did a quick count. There are about 35 Democrats in Congress who support the abolition of ICE; 133 Democrats would not take a position on a resolution.

Unlike Obama, the President hasn't stick the FBI on individual reporter or news operations or anything of the kind. So the press is free to be bombastic and they have many drama queens in the press who really are not reporters. They are big mouths, they are trying to promote themselves. And you know what they are doing? They're making it more and more difficult for the people to get the news, to get information and they're making it more and more difficult for this administration and this Republic to function. They're not contributing to society in a positive way. I'm not saying they have to agree with the President, but day in and day out, to try and sabotage the president and make it impossible for him at times to govern, that is unacceptable. That is not a free press. These are radicals dressed up as reporters who have as their purpose to undermine the president. As for liberalism, well, it is not liberalism anymore. It is state-ism and progressivism. These are radicals, just listen to their leadership and so forth. You want to impeach a president of the United States? The day he is elected? The day he is inaugurated? That is not what the impeachment clause says. We know what that's about. The framers discussed it at the constitutional convention. You don't just get to impeach a president because you disagree with him or you put a bunch of phony arguments together. The left wants to reverse the outcome of the last election. They do not like the outcome of the last election ..."

You cannot have what I've been calling the silent coup take place where the left has tried to criminalize the election with Mueller, tried to politicize and reverse election with the phony impeachment issue, you cannot reverse the votes, disenfranchise over 60 million Americans and act like it's no big deal and pretend there was a basis for it. So, this divide that we have in the nation and we often have divides in this nation, I do not think it is something that can be fixed very quickly because you're disenfranchising the American people. You are now attempting to remove a President of the United States simply because you disagree with him, that is not America, that is some banana third world republic south of the border."

What's different here to me is the institutionalization of the status progressive agenda, which means, you cannot -- you're not allowed to elect a president from the outside who wants to change what's going on in this country even if the American people want to change it. The left felt that they were going to have the third term of Barack Obama. They were a hundred percent sure that Trump could not win. He wins and now they have spent 24/7 trying to destroy him, undermine him. And by the way, destroy and undermine his supporters. The media in the country and Democratic Party in this country are attacking a big faction of the American people, day in and day out, calling us Nazis, cultists, racists. It is almost not even aimed at Trump. It is aimed at tens of millions of Americans out there who finally have stood up and done something to their government, with their government that we think is very effective and the left cannot tolerate it."

If the people in the Trump rallies are being paid to be there, I've been to a lot of those rallies and I'm telling, they are better actors than she ever was in her entire movie career.

Why haven't we heard similar things from other people who have left the White House like Reince Priebus, H.R. McMaster, Sean Spicer? Many people have left and others have left the Cabinet, you don't hear that from them because they're not out there to sell a book. They're not out there trying to do something to harm the President. She betrayed his trust, she was either lying before, she was lying now or she is lying both times. But she has zero credibility. I cannot imagine why anybody would buy this book.
