My angle will answer that question in moments. Plus, she spent the last 24 hours being demeaned for her mere presence at Michael Cohen's hearing yesterday. Tonight, Trump family friend Lynne Patton will be here responding, to being told she's nothing more than a prop for the president. Former Governor Chris Christie is here. What are his take-aways from what happened yesterday in North Korea -- I mean in Vietnam, with the summit and at the Cohen hearing. He'll tell us. And Raymond Arroyo will highlight Hollywood's complete blind spot when it comes to Jussie Smollett. You'll not believe what they're saying tonight in Hollywood about Smollett. But first, Trump haters root against America. That's the focus of tonight's angle.  You know the phrase \"always wrong, but never in doubt\"? Well that pretty much sums up the partisan reporters, the Democrats turned socialists and the never-Trumpers who just sit around talking to themselves. Do you remember the predictions back when the president was calling Kim \"Little Rocket Man\" and setting up his first North Korean summit?",

Making progress with a communist regime, a brutal dictatorship, isn't going to happen overnight. It's extremely difficult. But it really is good news that America is talking to Kim and the North Koreans. And it's certainly better than being on the brink of war. But the amazing thing about liberals is their capacity to flame out and quickly pivot because they said Trump would destroy the economy and right? We'd have the -- and we today the healthiest economy in the G7. They said manufacturing would not come back.  Well, the U.S. economy added 284,000 manufacturing jobs in 2018, the most in 21 years. So, of course, hearing that, the media just yawns or ignores it altogether or they'll claim Obama deserves the credit. Yeah, right. Have no fear, the liberals have a new narrative.

Tonight, Trump family friend Lynne Patton will be here responding, to being told she's nothing more than a prop for the president. Former Governor Chris Christie is here. What are his take-aways from what happened yesterday in North Korea -- I mean in Vietnam, with the summit and at the Cohen hearing. He'll tell us. And Raymond Arroyo will highlight Hollywood's complete blind spot when it comes to Jussie Smollett. You'll not believe what they're saying tonight in Hollywood about Smollett. But first, Trump haters root against America. That's the focus of tonight's angle. You know the phrase \"always wrong, but never in doubt\"? Well that pretty much sums up the partisan reporters, the Democrats turned socialists and the never-Trumpers who just sit around talking to themselves.

These people are actually hoping for America's failure on the world stage, because then they can say see, we told you so. Making progress with a communist regime, a brutal dictatorship, isn't going to happen overnight. It's extremely difficult. But it really is good news that America is talking to Kim and the North Koreans. And it's certainly better than being on the brink of war. But the amazing thing about liberals is their capacity to flame out and quickly pivot because they said Trump would destroy the economy and right? We'd have the -- and we today the healthiest economy in the G7. They said manufacturing would not come back. Well, the U.S. economy added 284,000 manufacturing jobs in 2018, the most in 21 years. So, of course, hearing that, the media just yawns or ignores it altogether or they'll claim Obama deserves the credit. Yeah, right. Have no fear, the liberals have a new narrative. When the news is too good or their prognostication fail to materialize, they simply write a new narrative. So now they're putting all their hopes in the great Trump slayer, Michael Cohen."

Particularly when the president is making a positive difference, historically for America and security frankly of the globe where North Korea is concerned? They refuse to acknowledge it for a reason, because acknowledging Trump's successes would mean acknowledging their own failures. And rooting against America is always the wrong strategy. And that's the angle. All right, joining me now for reaction, syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin. We never have her in studio, great to see her, former DNC communications director Luis Miranda, and East Asia expert, Gordon Chang. Michelle, I want to start with you. You would think folks would be happy in this case, because they were predicting doom and gloom, nuclear war. Trump says no, this deal is not good and walks away, but he's blamed for that, too."

And I think it says a lot about the -- in particular the beltway press, because 24 hours ago when he was boarding the plane, they thought he was going to give away the store, and when he walks away, why didn't you give away the store? Right? You -- you -- you cannot understand and appreciate the beltway press unless you understand first that these people don't perceive themselves as American citizens, first. They're citizening of the world. So any deal that actually benefits America is something they're going to be against. We live in the bizarre-o world. If he's too soft -- if they consider him too soft, they will yell. If he acts aggressively, they will yell as well. You can never satisfy these people, and that's what, you know walking away is the best thing that he could have done here."

I think the Chinese really felt that Trump was going to make concessions, that he was under a lot of domestic pressure from the financial services industry and others to give in to China.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Because I don't know why the president felt the need to -- to react the way he did on Otto Warmbier. I do think -- this happened under Obama, remember. Warmbier was taken hostage under Obama. But he didn't -- I don't know if it's that he didn't want to -- he wanted a deal, he didn't want to insult them at the moment, I don't know, but that was kind of a -- again, they seize on that, so it's Otto Warmbier, Otto Warmbier. I mean, I understand it's important, and of course it's horrific. But what does that really have to do with the larger question here about whether we can ever get to a peaceful situation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MALKIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I can't get into his mind. But the plain fact is, that this happened under Obama and it was Trump that helped bring Otto Warmbier back. And it was the left that mocked Otto Warmbier because they had the idea that since he was some goofy jock from America, that the whole thing was a joke, and people forget that context. I think the -- the bottom line here is, though, as you were saying, that these sanctions have been cheated for so long, and that's what he walked away. Because what did North Korea want, right? They wanted to -- us to lift the sanctions before, right? And this is so much like, you know, kind of like amnesty before enforcement, right? It's the same -- it's the same rod (ph)."

Politics should stop at the water's edge, and clearly when you have the president there on a really critical mission for all Americans, you know, they should have held that hearing next week, because they could have delayed it a couple of days.

And Michael Cohen saying the story about lying to the first lady seems to back that up. And I think there's no way any responsible prosecutor would make a case on that. Secondly, him saying that the president didn't direct him to lie, that somehow he understood some type of code words or signals. No one is going to believe somebody who is a perjurer and a thief and convict someone based upon his read of code words. And I think the fact that Cohen said there was no collusion. My frustration yesterday, Laura, was that nobody on the Republican side defended on the president on the merits, on the substance. After two or three congresspeople on our side said Michael Cohen is a liar and thief. I get it. OK, he's a liar and a thief. Now let's get to the stuff you were talking about, which was there was good part of his testimony that we should be trumpeting and hitting back on to get into the record more clearly for the American people.

In the end I thought some of the better points that were made yesterday were made quietly and thoughtfully. And I think we would have been much better off if we had people on our side who are doing more of that. We had to do some of the Cohen bashing stuff, of course. He deserves it, he's earned it.

You have known the president for a long time. Chris Christie is going to stay with us over the break. Don't go away."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "No. What I said was that that's the investigation he should be most concerned about both for him and for the people around him because they have no limit to what they can look at, Laura. The SDNY is not like Bob Mueller who is restricted to just looking at Russia and Russia-related items. The SDNY can look at anything they want to look at. They have two tour guides. What I said is, they can't indict the president until he leaves office because there is a clear Justice Department ruling that says sitting presidents cannot be indicted. And I don't think there could be any way that the U.S. attorney in the southern district would try to violate that rule. And if they did, I think Bill Barr would stop them."

      "utterance": "I think Ken Delaney of NBC was trying to characterize your comments. I want to move on to a story that just broke tonight about Jared Kushner's security clearance, Governor Christie. There was a report we will put up on the screen. Again, this is \"New York Times\" Maggie Haberman, \"President Trump ordered his chief of staff to grant his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner a top secret security clearance last year, overruling concerns flagged by intel officials and the White House's top lawyer according to four people briefed on the matter. The disclose of the memo contradicts statements by the president who told the \"New York Times\" that he had no role in his son-in-law receiving clearance.\" Kushner's legal team responded, saying \"In 2018 the White House and the security clearance officials affirmed that Mr. Kushner's security clearance was handled in the regular process with no pressure from anyone. That was conveyed to the media at the time,\" et cetera. Your reaction to this?"

    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "Listen, if true, it's bad. And it's bad in this respect. This is what I write about in the book, Laura. Having family in the administration is a very tough thing to deal with because now when Jared Kushner was not getting his security clearance, it's much more difficult for a president who is also a father-in-law to be objective about his son- in-law and his daughter. And so here's the problem. The president had the absolute right to give a security clearance to whoever he wanted to. But just say that is what you did. Don't say you had nothing to do with it. And Ivanka went on television and said that her father played no role in her security clearance or her husband's. Now, if this \"Times\" report is correct --"

    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "Then just say you don't know. Just say you don't know. Don't affirmatively say he had no role. And the fact is that the problem here is that if in fact these memos exist as was reported in the story, from John Kelly and Don McGahn, this make what is the president said not true and what Ivanka said not true, when they didn't have to. Just say, listen, I decide who gets security clearance because I'm the president. I trust him. I need him. I want him. I'm giving it to them. End of discussion."

He is trying to do something extraordinary in the Middle East, very difficult obviously. And she is trying to do something extraordinary in expanding women's opportunities. Family members, not family members, I think people need to be judged on their results. But it does put people in difficult positions at different points in time."

      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "It just makes it hard, Laura, and that's why we haven't had family members in positions. Now what is going to happen -- one of the things from Cohen yesterday, now the House is going to subpoena them. And quite frankly for a House Overnight Committee, given that they have jobs in the administration, they are subject to the subpoenas, where Eric thought he would not be."

Joining us now with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor, \"New York Times\" the new and bestselling book, \"Will Wilder, The Amulet of Power.\" Raymond, what is \"The Hollywood Reporters'\" rationale for defending Smollett?"

      "utterance": "Laura, look, under the headline \"I'm about to break, Jussie Smollett and the pressure of Hollywood fame,\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" dug up a 2018 Billboard interview with Smollett where he says this. \"I admit that I'm jealous, I admit that I'm insecure and that I'm not good at certain things.\" Then in a comment that didn't get much attention at the time, Smollett suggested that these pressures might be catching up to him. Quote, \"I'm in my 30s and I'm trying my best to learn that I can't bend anymore. I'm about to break.\" The upshot here is the pressures of fames got the best of this guy and he snapped and then he faked or possibly faked this attack. Now some Hollywood heavyweights are defending Smollett, including Ellen Page."
