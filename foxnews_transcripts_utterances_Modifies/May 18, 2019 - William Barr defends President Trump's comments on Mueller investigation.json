And one of the things it's doing is it's accelerating a phenomenon that already exists, which is that the party positions -- this is a political analysis, not a right or wrong or moral thing, are at the extremes, while the mainstream of American public opinion is very much like western Europe's public opinion. Most Americans are in favor of the right to an abortion in the first trimester. And then most Americans think abortion after the first trimester is something, depending on how late it goes, close to a moral horror.  And the problem is that Roe and Doe and then Planned Parenthood v. Casey established an abortion regime in this country that says that Donald Trump was basically right, that it is possible, Constitutionally, to have laws that say you can kill the fetus seconds before birth. And that is causing some states to -- what is amazing is how the Democratic Party has embracing an extremist position where they literally want to say now that that's good, it's no longer safe, legal, and rare, and the Alabama is to say essentially no abortion whatsoever. And it will be interesting to see who wins in the battle of turning off the most voters with all of this.",

Yes, there are those, myself included, who are very uncomfortable with an abortion past a certain point, and a lot of people who call themselves pro- choice feel that way.

In the case of rape or incest, which is a very small fraction of these cases, you don't have that situation. It's a horrible thing for anyone to be raped, but killing -- a second evil doesn't make that any better.  But there's a little bit of a false argument taking place over here, because first of all Republican legislatures have been passing laws restricting abortion for over a decade now because during the Obama years, Republicans had an unprecedented takeover of state legislatures. This is more Republican governors, more Republican legislatures at any time since the 1920s. And so when you pass pro-life governor and you elect pro-life super majorities they are going to pass pro-life laws. The difference is that they were afraid to challenge -- they were doing an incrementalist approach because they Anthony Kennedy was going to strike down anything they did. Now you've got Brett Kavanaugh on the court and they're becoming emboldened and putting off this incrementalist approach. But unfortunately, I think these laws are actually not going to get to the Supreme Court anytime soon, because the courts doesn't have to take them up. If a federal judge says this is unconstitutional, they can just choose not to do it. And also there are a lot of these incremental laws that are teed up for the court. So the court doesn't want to rule on Roe v. Wade. They are not going to be forced to by a state.",

Because they look at the composite of the court and they say we have a possibility to overturn Roe v. Wade. Teen pregnancies have declined, abortions have declined.

JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Yes. In a lot of ways this is anticipatory, prepositioning with both sides thinking there is a shot that Roe v. Wade to go. And one of the things it's doing is it's accelerating a phenomenon that already exists, which is that the party positions -- this is a political analysis, not a right or wrong or moral thing, are at the extremes, while the mainstream of American public opinion is very much like western Europe's public opinion. Most Americans are in favor of the right to an abortion in the first trimester. And then most Americans think abortion after the first trimester is something, depending on how late it goes, close to a moral horror. And the problem is that Roe and Doe and then Planned Parenthood v. Casey established an abortion regime in this country that says that Donald Trump was basically right, that it is possible, Constitutionally, to have laws that say you can kill the fetus seconds before birth. And that is causing some states to -- what is amazing is how the Democratic Party has embracing an extremist position where they literally want to say now that that's good, it's no longer safe, legal, and rare, and the Alabama is to say essentially no abortion whatsoever. And it will be interesting to see who wins in the battle of turning off the most voters with all of this."

And most states do uphold the law. Yes, there are those, myself included, who are very uncomfortable with an abortion past a certain point, and a lot of people who call themselves pro- choice feel that way. But this is becoming beyond extreme, to have no exceptions for incest or rape, as in the case of Alabama, we're seeing more states do this.

In the case of rape or incest, which is a very small fraction of these cases, you don't have that situation. It's a horrible thing for anyone to be raped, but killing -- a second evil doesn't make that any better. But there's a little bit of a false argument taking place over here, because first of all Republican legislatures have been passing laws restricting abortion for over a decade now because during the Obama years, Republicans had an unprecedented takeover of state legislatures. This is more Republican governors, more Republican legislatures at any time since the 1920s. And so when you pass pro-life governor and you elect pro-life super majorities they are going to pass pro-life laws. The difference is that they were afraid to challenge -- they were doing an incrementalist approach because they Anthony Kennedy was going to strike down anything they did. Now you've got Brett Kavanaugh on the court and they're becoming emboldened and putting off this incrementalist approach. But unfortunately, I think these laws are actually not going to get to the Supreme Court anytime soon, because the courts doesn't have to take them up. If a federal judge says this is unconstitutional, they can just choose not to do it. And also there are a lot of these incremental laws that are teed up for the court. So the court doesn't want to rule on Roe v. Wade. They are not going to be forced to by a state."

And this is political. That's what bothers me even more so about this, Bret, that this is political. I'm sorry, this is not about saving babies. I don't buy that. Because they look at the composite of the court and they say we have a possibility to overturn Roe v. Wade. Teen pregnancies have declined, abortions have declined. If they want to save babies, then why not prevent the pregnancy? Why not prevent a pregnancy with education and birth control?
