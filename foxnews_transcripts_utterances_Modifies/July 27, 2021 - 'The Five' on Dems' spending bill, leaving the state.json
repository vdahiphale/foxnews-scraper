A new poll says Americans think the country is moving in the wrong direction, optimism about where we are headed as a nation over the next year dropping nearly 20 points since May, with 55 percent saying they felt pessimistic about the future. But can you blame them? Try walking down the street in any major liberal city. NYPD releasing new video of a brutal mugging showing the effects of an unpoliced city, a low life repeatedly punching and kicking a 68-year-old man, as old as Kilmeade, knocking him unconscious and then rifling through his pockets. I wonder if the press will be as attentive to these videos as they were for those in which police were involved. But progressive Democrat who push for less police aren't worried. They are too busy hiring their own private security to keep them safe. Campaign filings reveal squad member Cori Bush spent 70 grand on private security while calling to defund the police. Trey Gowdy ripping into the hypocrisy.",

A new poll says Americans think the country is moving in the wrong direction, optimism about where we are headed as a nation over the next year dropping nearly 20 points since May, with 55 percent saying they felt pessimistic about the future. But can you blame them? Try walking down the street in any major liberal city. NYPD releasing new video of a brutal mugging showing the effects of an unpoliced city, a low life repeatedly punching and kicking a 68-year-old man, as old as Kilmeade, knocking him unconscious and then rifling through his pockets. I wonder if the press will be as attentive to these videos as they were for those in which police were involved. But progressive Democrat who push for less police aren't worried. They are too busy hiring their own private security to keep them safe. Campaign filings reveal squad member Cori Bush spent 70 grand on private security while calling to defund the police.

When you talk about inflation, that's things we buy from the smallest to the biggest, everything that seems to be challenged on a regular basis. So, it's going, I do no longer feel confident. And I can actually see the 20-point drop over the last three months just from talking to people. And when it comes to crime, this really has changed. Remember six months ago it was all about the cops are the problem. And the cops just took a step back and say take my badge and I'm going to retire or I quit. And now, every single one of these major cities is depleted. It's like breaking up with a girl, and say, see how life is like without me, and then watching her life spiral down."

I think where people are and I think a Gallup poll points to this that was done last year, especially in black communities they're saying look, we want -- we like the presence of police. Oftentimes, we feel like we are not treated with respect and dignity and encounter the police officers. So, how do we create a balance here? How do we ensure that when police are in our communities were treated with respect, but how do we also deal with crime that's happening in our community whether it's solving the case of little Nyiah in Washington where I live, or it's ensuring that here in New York City 65-year-old men don't get beat up by crazy people, right, which is what's happening."

They came out and said, if you are not vaccinated you basically have to wear a mask and have all these other protocols. And if your team actually has to forfeit a game, we are not moving the game. You guys lost. So, people like Leonard Fournette who is now standing running back -- it was now the Tampa Bay Bucs came out and goes, I'm not doing it. And you have other players that have said I'm just not going to get vaccinated. So, instead of mandating and yelling at them, you should do what Chris Christie mentioned on Sunday that focus group reveals. They don't want to hear from politicians, they don't want to hear from coaches. They want to hear from experts.

The only way we are going to stop the Delta variant from spreading in many of these communities that are now seeing a high spread of it which is where a lot of these mask mandates are going back in place, is by more and more folks getting vaccinated and that's where these deaths are happening.

And why, because then there would only be one solution for all of that, and it would be their solution, right? And that would be taking trillions from taxpayers to fund their radical policies. That's how -- that's all this is about. That's why it's intentionally vague. But they probably could address it up a little bit. So, they sat -- they're more than willing -- oh, by the way, no mention of crime in that. Why couldn't they put the crime in the theory of everything, right?
