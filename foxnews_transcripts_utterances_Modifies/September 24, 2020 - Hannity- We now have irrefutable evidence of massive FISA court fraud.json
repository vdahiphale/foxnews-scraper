      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". We begin with multiple FOX News alerts.  Curfew now in effect once again in Louisville, Kentucky. Last night, two police officers shot during what -- well, some media mob outlets described as mostly peaceful protests in the city. The media mob, they just lie now with complete abandon, and at the same time violent erupted in cities all across America.  Same story, tonight, we will monitor the situation on the ground in Louisville and elsewhere around the country. We will take you there live in the event of breaking news.  Also, tonight, we're tracking two other massive major breaking stories. Russian spies, FISA court lies, corruption at the highest levels, you couldn't write this in a spy novel and it's all proven. Explosive, new, declassified material that confirms the Christopher Steele's dirty dossier in fact relied on material from that one sub-source, the sub-source we now know that the FBI knew for a decade was a Russian spy.  They knew it. They continued to use the dirty Russian disinformation dossier with the, well, sub-source Russian spy to use it to get the dossier as part of the FISA application to spy on Donald Trump. Jim Comey's FBI knew for years that this sub-source was a Russian operative and yet he still used the misinformation to acquire a series of FISA warrants. Comey himself signed three out of the four warrants. Mr. Higher Honor he calls himself. We've got a lot coming up tonight.  Also, shocking new evidence as it relates to Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. We've got them all right here, all of them, in shocking detail.   Sidney Powell's new filing that she put out today -- yeah, new text messages and handwritten notes. General Flynn was railroaded and they knew it by the Obama administration, and they knew exactly what they were doing and we have the evidence. Also, tonight, we'll begin with -- well, reviewing the events of last night. Now, on this program we support and we applaud free open exchange of ideas, peaceful protesting, no problem whatsoever. That is as American as it can get. But much of what happened last night was despicable. You had two police officers in Louisville now were shot by a suspect named Lorenzo Johnson who allegedly fired several police -- at several police officers during last night's riot.   We now have police body cam footage actually captured at the moment that the shooting began. Let's run it.",

Make no mistake: this does not honor the life of Breonna Taylor. She was an EMT. She was working to become a nurse and she dedicated her life to saving other people. This senseless violence has got to stop. There's ways to do it. The shootings, the riots, the arson, the looting is not acceptable. It only serves to further suffering of innocent people.  And for months, prominent Democrats have pretty much all but encouraged the violence and they stoked the flames of rage and they bowed down to an angry mob.

Biden says police become the enemy he said he supports redirecting funds away from the police and Biden refused to mention the violence all over the country during the DNC convention. And now, for months on end, violent, organized demonstrations festering in America's Democratic-run cities they've been running them for decades. Last night, Julio Rosas, he's with 'Townhall,' he captured this footage in Louisville.  Now, take a look, this is the daytime. This is a U-Haul truck. It pulled up and started delivering, let's see, shields and riot gear and anarchist materials to dozens of so-called peaceful protesters now they had this all ready to go during the day yesterday only a very short time after the grand jury decision well that might make you wonder was this all planned because it appears so.  Look at the scene from St. Petersburg, Florida, yesterday. Elderly couple, they live in peace they get accosted by and threatened by several violent rioters while just trying to just have a peaceful dinner at a restaurant outside, supporting local business that needs a support.

They're not beating the snot out of anyone. They -- maybe they have a sign, maybe they don't, but they're there to protest something.   And, Sean, for the liberals watching who have a tough time, the key demarcation point you know it's a peaceful protest is when they tell you what they're protesting about, because they want to protest something. I've been in the middle of one of these so-called peaceful protests at night where as I've said many times on the network walking out of the White House during President Trump's acceptance speech afterwards, it was a so-called BLM peaceful protest where -- what else what happened that night?  Well, they threatened to rape my wife a couple of times. And one -- one was very creative, he said he's going to make me watch, which was pretty hilarious considering he's about 110 pounds, wasn't going to make me do anything. They followed us for about three miles threats, threats, ethnic insults to my wife who's Hispanic. Please tell me to the liberals listening at any point, this was a BLM group, by the way. What were they protesting? I'm serious, what were they protesting? Again between the rape threats and the violence and the ethnic slurs directed at my wife, what exactly were you protesting? These are not protesters. They're not trying to convince you of anything are Democrat shock troops on the front line trying to scare the hell out of you. That's what they are.",

He was shot just under his bulletproof vest he was shot in the gut by this sniper.  I also want to say something about the relativity of things. I understand that arson and looting and, you know, rioting and all the big stuff, we respond to that in a -- in a visceral way. We're horrified by it, anarchy is spreading everywhere, the rule of law is eroding, people don't have confidence in the system anymore. But you know what really tells it I think most eloquently, Sean, is the scene in the restaurant. Here's a couple just innocent Joe and Jane Doe, they're having a dinner. They're outdoors because the restaurants indoors are restricted.  And so, they're outdoors restaurants, the industry's so troubled and the employees hanging on to the jaws by their fingertips and now comes these punks and they sit down and they take your drink and they break a glass and they take a skateboard and they put it on your table and you're there with your wife, what's your response going to be? What's the reaction going to be?  I know from my history how I would respond. You know I understand that it's trespassing, it's harassment, it's -- it's probably assault also, but they're -- they're pushing me and pushing me I'm forced to respond and once I respond I know that I'm going to be caught up in the in the complication the molasses of the criminal justice system and it's going to -- it's going to wreck my life and lawsuits and all the rest of it.  But this punkness, this absolute punkness is something that is as good a reason to vote for Donald Trump as anything I can think of. They are campaigning. They don't realize it. Maybe they don't realize that they're campaigning for the Republican, they're campaigning for the president because they people will be so repulsed by these punks that they're going to be driven to Donald Trump even if they don't want to vote for for whatever other reason. This is the most ill-conceived, the way this at this movement so-called is acting out is counterproductive to everyone. Cops are being shot, even black hops are being shot. Everyone's nerves are on edge, the races are divided black and white, and people don't know -- you know, the grounding is eroding, Sean.  This is -- this is something that and if you look at the other cable channels, they barely cover it. A cop shot in the belly, a black cop shot in the belly, how many of them have said what I just said? A black cop was shot last night in Louisville, Kentucky, in the gut under his bulletproof vest.

      "sentences": "All right. Geraldo, Dan Bongino, thank you both.  We turn out of breaking news from the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history. We were right and more so than we knew. Thanks to a federal court filing from Flynn attorney, Sidney Powell, we now have access to a treasure trove of documents that should shock you to your core. Look at these text messages and notes released today. August 11th, 2016, FBI agents openly worrying about Comey's Crossfire Hurricane investigation into the Trump campaign. One agent remarking, doing all this election research I think some guys -- some of these guys want a Clinton presidency. Another worried the investigation being steered down a rabbit hole and engaging in conspiracy theories. Another writing, quote, I'm telling you, man, if this thing ever gets -- well, Freedom of Information Act requested, guess what, they're going to be some tough questions asked. Didn't stop them after the election, agents were so worried about the partisan, conspiratorial nature of what they had done with Crossfire Hurricane, they purchased professional liability insurance. So it turns out they actually obtained an insurance policy because of their implementation of the insurance policy that Strzok and Page talked about.  And get this, several agents were also highly concerned about the now infamous January 5th meeting at the Oval Office between Obama, Biden, Yates, Clapper, Comey and others. That's the memo to self Susan Rice moment, 14, 15 days later. Remember that that was the meeting where Obama-Biden looked for ways to set General Flynn up. And, by the way, get their best people on the matter. And the one agent feared the worst that this was a political hit job writing, quote: Trump was right. Why do we do this to ourselves? What is wrong with these people? Even disgraced former FBI Director McCabe details how odd the circumstances surrounding the Flynn case are in a handwritten note, writing: Open nothing, closed everything, blackmail theoretically possible, not the strongest theory.   Meanwhile, other agents texted about the rampant leaking surrounding the case. One agent -- well, it's gone to be -- it's going to be somewhat on staff. Another jokes, I'll resume my duties as chief moral officer and rectify that. As you can see, there was no wrongdoing by General Flynn, they knew it, they were using him. Turning the screws on him in a desperate effort to get something on President Trump, first candidate Trump. If they're willing to do this to an American war hero, imagine what they would do to you. But that's just part one of our breaking news tonight. Thanks to Senator Graham who will join us in a moment, we now have irrefutable evidence of massive FISA court fraud, it's worse than what we thought. As we all know by now, Comey and others used Steele's dirty dossier that Hillary paid for as the bulk of evidence that even McCabe and Yates said without which they get no FISA warrant against the Trump campaign to spy on them and Steele's dirty Russian misinformation dossier -- well, it had a sub-source, an intelligence primary sub-source. Well, now, we know that the sub-source was not only unreliable, the FBI knew this person without any doubt from day one to be a Russian agent. In fact, between May of 2009 and March of 2011, the FBI was investigating the person. They knew for 10 years he was a Russian spy.  That means the source of Steele's dossier was a Russian spy and Hillary paid for it all and our FBI under James Comey, Mr. Higher Honor, knew it the entire time. This individual was in contact with well-known Russian intel officers reportedly very close. At least one of his co-workers at an American think tank told the FBI that they suspected such. A lot more details to come. Senator Lindsey Graham has been all over this. We'll continue to put more of it on the screen so you can do it. Senator, so they knew that the sub-source was a Russian spy?",

So in December 2016, they figured out who the primary sub-source was, then they checked their database and they found out that this individual was suspected by the FBI all the way back to 2009 of being a Russian agent. They had information that he tried to offer money for classified information to Obama officials, that he was inquiring about military vessels, that he was seen at the Russian embassy back in 2006 trying to drop information off to the Russian embassy to put in a diplomatic pouch. So, here's the -- here's the point. The FISA court was never told this. They were never informed that the dossier primary sub-source was a suspected Russian agent. This is the biggest fraud yet on the FISA court and in January the 12th, 2017, they applied for a warrant against Carter Page using the dossier, knowing that the sub-source was a suspected Russian agent that never told the court. They eventually interviewed the Russian sub-source, that he tells him the dossier is unreliable and they use it yet again.",

They used that person's work product to get a warrant against an American citizen on four different occasions. They never informed the court of this exculpatory evidence. I want to thank Durham for allowing this to come forward. I want to thank Barr and Wray for providing the committee this information. Christopher Wray and Bill Barr trying to clean this mess up.  And here's what's important: Durham knew about this. Durham has already investigated this matter. So there's some people tonight have to be very worried because now we know the FBI in December 2016 knew that the dossier was being prepared by a Russian agent. They never told the court. This is a massive effort by Russia to do a disinformation campaign against the Trump campaign and it worked. Bottom line is, the FBI used the document prepared by a Russian agent paid for by the Democratic Party to get a warrant against the Trump campaign, and the only place you're going to hear about that is probably on this show.

For example, fake news CNN all three nightly news programs completely avoided the subject, while MSDNC briefly mentioned the story only to downplay the story. Now, the report lays out in detail how Hunter Biden received millions from foreign nationals with corrupt backgrounds, including a $3.5 million deal from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow, called herself the first lady of Russia and a hundred thousand dollar shopping spree funded by a Chinese communist party linked financier. And that's not all. The report even found evidence linking zero experienced Hunter to allege human trafficking and, of course, the findings also reveal how zero experience hunter work for Burisma Holdings. Well, that prompted serious concerns in time inside the Obama State Department, with one senior official even briefing both Joe and Hunter about the conflicts of interest concerns. Now, remember, even Joe claims he never spoke to his son about Ukraine dealings. Well, Joe, you still stand by that lie? And don't forget -- well, Biden is also on tape bragging. You're not getting a billion dollars until you fire Ukrainian prosecutors who's investigating my son being paid millions for no experience. So, let's play the little game, replace the name Hunter Biden -- would say, oh, Donald Trump Jr. How would the mob and the media be covering that? They'd be proclaiming it the biggest bombshell story in history, and it would be 24/7, around the clock hysteria?  But there were two sets of rules, one for the Democratic swamp in Washington, one for the rest of us. Now, the good news is, Republicans are at least exposing it, taking action, it's taking forever. Senator Rand Paul says the homeland security panel will refer the report to the Department of Justice for a criminal probe. Congressman Jim Jordan is pressing FBI Director Christopher Wray for information about whether or not the bureau is even investigating this. More importantly, Joe Biden needs to be asked the tough questions. But, of course, he ends his day at 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. every day. So what did he know, when did he know it? Did you ever really never speak to your son about any of this? And why did you allow your son to use that position as vice president to do all these sketchy deals with oligarchs in Russia and Ukraine and elsewhere? Of course, the communist Chinese, $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China and getting rich while -- well, daddy's vice president. Do you make any money, Joe, from these deals? And, by the way, is that why you were more critical of Donald Trump and the travel ban? Why, so Hunter can get another billion dollar deal with China, and more deals with Russia?  We live in dangerous times and in 40 short days, this will be the tipping point election. Powerful institutional forces in the media, the Democratic Party, the deep state and operatives all hands on deck. And even worse than 2016, they're there to protect the swamp, the bureaucracy, and do any and all things possible to destroy President Trump, even if it means electing a frail, weak, corrupt figure like Joe Biden. God help this country. Here with reaction, author of the \"Profile in Corruption\", Peter Schweizer, along with FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. You know, \"Secret Empires\" was your book, Peter. You, you know, and well hang on a second I guess we don't have them up now. Guys, are we going to get the right people up because that's for the next segment? Anyway, we'll get -- there we go. Peter Schweizer, you wrote the book \"Secret Empire\" and in \"Secret Empires\", you exposed this first and foremost it's even worse than you described and almost everything you reported has now been vindicated. PETER SCHWEIZER, \"SECRET EMPIRES\" AUTHOR: Yeah, that's right, Sean. Thank you. And, by the way, the reason we're at the point where the Senate has looked into this is because you interviewed me two years ago and amplified our findings.  And what the Senate has done is they've used tools that I didn't have access to not only confirmed what we found but taken it a step further. And what they've shown is that Hunter Biden was involved in a series of foreign corrupt schemes that triggered suspicious activity reports or so-called SRASAR transactions by the Treasury Department. These are triggered when money is flowing from either sketchy individuals or the amount of money in question is raising alarm bells. So this is not a question of anonymous sources or speculation. We now know that money changed hands. We know who it came from. We know it came from countries that are our rivals. And we knew it know it came from very corrupt entities around the world. And the question, Sean, continues to be, why did they give Hunter Biden this money? He didn't have a skill set. He didn't have qualifications. They were paying for something these are not charities and that's the question that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden need to answer.",

Now we know, thanks to this report, that was a lie. He was briefed about it. He was warned about it. He spoke to his son about it. Look, it's a crime to confer a benefit to a foreign government in exchange for something of value for yourself or your relative, including your son. It's public corruption. It's -- you know, extortion embezzlement, all of those words get thrown around a lot, but they're all part of the public corruption. Think about this -- Burisma is paying $400 million to Hunter Biden. At the same time, his father is pressuring Ukraine to drop an investigation into his son's company. You know, Rand Paul is right. Let's send this to the Department of Justice. Have the lawyers take a look at it and decide whether a criminal prosecution is merited.

Usually, the Democrats, they never learn, they go too far and all of these comments indicate -- look, this is why Democrat cities are in flames because the Democrats, their knee-jerk reaction now is to go to literally and figuratively burn things down.

Last night, two police officers shot during what -- well, some media mob outlets described as mostly peaceful protests in the city. The media mob, they just lie now with complete abandon, and at the same time violent erupted in cities all across America. Same story, tonight, we will monitor the situation on the ground in Louisville and elsewhere around the country. We will take you there live in the event of breaking news. Also, tonight, we're tracking two other massive major breaking stories. Russian spies, FISA court lies, corruption at the highest levels, you couldn't write this in a spy novel and it's all proven. Explosive, new, declassified material that confirms the Christopher Steele's dirty dossier in fact relied on material from that one sub-source, the sub-source we now know that the FBI knew for a decade was a Russian spy. They knew it. They continued to use the dirty Russian disinformation dossier with the, well, sub-source Russian spy to use it to get the dossier as part of the FISA application to spy on Donald Trump. Jim Comey's FBI knew for years that this sub-source was a Russian operative and yet he still used the misinformation to acquire a series of FISA warrants. Comey himself signed three out of the four warrants. Mr. Higher Honor he calls himself. We've got a lot coming up tonight. Also, shocking new evidence as it relates to Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. We've got them all right here, all of them, in shocking detail. Sidney Powell's new filing that she put out today -- yeah, new text messages and handwritten notes. General Flynn was railroaded and they knew it by the Obama administration, and they knew exactly what they were doing and we have the evidence. Also, tonight, we'll begin with -- well, reviewing the events of last night. Now, on this program we support and we applaud free open exchange of ideas, peaceful protesting, no problem whatsoever. That is as American as it can get. But much of what happened last night was despicable. You had two police officers in Louisville now were shot by a suspect named Lorenzo Johnson who allegedly fired several police -- at several police officers during last night's riot.

You have the Biden Bolshevik Bernie manifesto calling for the end of cash bail, all that's been an unmitigated disaster in the state of New York. Biden says police become the enemy he said he supports redirecting funds away from the police and Biden refused to mention the violence all over the country during the DNC convention. And now, for months on end, violent, organized demonstrations festering in America's Democratic-run cities they've been running them for decades. Last night, Julio Rosas, he's with 'Townhall,' he captured this footage in Louisville. Now, take a look, this is the daytime. This is a U-Haul truck. It pulled up and started delivering, let's see, shields and riot gear and anarchist materials to dozens of so-called peaceful protesters now they had this all ready to go during the day yesterday only a very short time after the grand jury decision well that might make you wonder was this all planned because it appears so. Look at the scene from St. Petersburg, Florida, yesterday. Elderly couple, they live in peace they get accosted by and threatened by several violent rioters while just trying to just have a peaceful dinner at a restaurant outside, supporting local business that needs a support.

They're not beating the snot out of anyone. They -- maybe they have a sign, maybe they don't, but they're there to protest something. And, Sean, for the liberals watching who have a tough time, the key demarcation point you know it's a peaceful protest is when they tell you what they're protesting about, because they want to protest something. I've been in the middle of one of these so-called peaceful protests at night where as I've said many times on the network walking out of the White House during President Trump's acceptance speech afterwards, it was a so-called BLM peaceful protest where -- what else what happened that night? Well, they threatened to rape my wife a couple of times. And one -- one was very creative, he said he's going to make me watch, which was pretty hilarious considering he's about 110 pounds, wasn't going to make me do anything. They followed us for about three miles threats, threats, ethnic insults to my wife who's Hispanic. Please tell me to the liberals listening at any point, this was a BLM group, by the way. What were they protesting? I'm serious, what were they protesting? Again between the rape threats and the violence and the ethnic slurs directed at my wife, what exactly were you protesting? These are not protesters. They're not trying to convince you of anything are Democrat shock troops on the front line trying to scare the hell out of you. That's what they are."

He was shot just under his bulletproof vest he was shot in the gut by this sniper. I also want to say something about the relativity of things. I understand that arson and looting and, you know, rioting and all the big stuff, we respond to that in a -- in a visceral way. We're horrified by it, anarchy is spreading everywhere, the rule of law is eroding, people don't have confidence in the system anymore. But you know what really tells it I think most eloquently, Sean, is the scene in the restaurant. Here's a couple just innocent Joe and Jane Doe, they're having a dinner. They're outdoors because the restaurants indoors are restricted. And so, they're outdoors restaurants, the industry's so troubled and the employees hanging on to the jaws by their fingertips and now comes these punks and they sit down and they take your drink and they break a glass and they take a skateboard and they put it on your table and you're there with your wife, what's your response going to be? What's the reaction going to be? I know from my history how I would respond. You know I understand that it's trespassing, it's harassment, it's -- it's probably assault also, but they're -- they're pushing me and pushing me I'm forced to respond and once I respond I know that I'm going to be caught up in the in the complication the molasses of the criminal justice system and it's going to -- it's going to wreck my life and lawsuits and all the rest of it. But this punkness, this absolute punkness is something that is as good a reason to vote for Donald Trump as anything I can think of. They are campaigning. They don't realize it. Maybe they don't realize that they're campaigning for the Republican, they're campaigning for the president because they people will be so repulsed by these punks that they're going to be driven to Donald Trump even if they don't want to vote for for whatever other reason. This is the most ill-conceived, the way this at this movement so-called is acting out is counterproductive to everyone. Cops are being shot, even black hops are being shot. Everyone's nerves are on edge, the races are divided black and white, and people don't know -- you know, the grounding is eroding, Sean. This is -- this is something that and if you look at the other cable channels, they barely cover it. A cop shot in the belly, a black cop shot in the belly, how many of them have said what I just said? A black cop was shot last night in Louisville, Kentucky, in the gut under his bulletproof vest.

Thanks to a federal court filing from Flynn attorney, Sidney Powell, we now have access to a treasure trove of documents that should shock you to your core. Look at these text messages and notes released today. August 11th, 2016, FBI agents openly worrying about Comey's Crossfire Hurricane investigation into the Trump campaign. One agent remarking, doing all this election research I think some guys -- some of these guys want a Clinton presidency. Another worried the investigation being steered down a rabbit hole and engaging in conspiracy theories. Another writing, quote, I'm telling you, man, if this thing ever gets -- well, Freedom of Information Act requested, guess what, they're going to be some tough questions asked. Didn't stop them after the election, agents were so worried about the partisan, conspiratorial nature of what they had done with Crossfire Hurricane, they purchased professional liability insurance. So it turns out they actually obtained an insurance policy because of their implementation of the insurance policy that Strzok and Page talked about. And get this, several agents were also highly concerned about the now infamous January 5th meeting at the Oval Office between Obama, Biden, Yates, Clapper, Comey and others. That's the memo to self Susan Rice moment, 14, 15 days later. Remember that that was the meeting where Obama-Biden looked for ways to set General Flynn up.

One agent -- well, it's gone to be -- it's going to be somewhat on staff. Another jokes, I'll resume my duties as chief moral officer and rectify that. As you can see, there was no wrongdoing by General Flynn, they knew it, they were using him. Turning the screws on him in a desperate effort to get something on President Trump, first candidate Trump. If they're willing to do this to an American war hero, imagine what they would do to you. But that's just part one of our breaking news tonight. Thanks to Senator Graham who will join us in a moment, we now have irrefutable evidence of massive FISA court fraud, it's worse than what we thought. As we all know by now, Comey and others used Steele's dirty dossier that Hillary paid for as the bulk of evidence that even McCabe and Yates said without which they get no FISA warrant against the Trump campaign to spy on them and Steele's dirty Russian misinformation dossier -- well, it had a sub-source, an intelligence primary sub-source. Well, now, we know that the sub-source was not only unreliable, the FBI knew this person without any doubt from day one to be a Russian agent. In fact, between May of 2009 and March of 2011, the FBI was investigating the person. They knew for 10 years he was a Russian spy. That means the source of Steele's dossier was a Russian spy and Hillary paid for it all and our FBI under James Comey, Mr. Higher Honor, knew it the entire time. This individual was in contact with well-known Russian intel officers reportedly very close. At least one of his co-workers at an American think tank told the FBI that they suspected such. A lot more details to come. Senator Lindsey Graham has been all over this. We'll continue to put more of it on the screen so you can do it. Senator, so they knew that the sub-source was a Russian spy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC)",
      "utterance": "Yeah. So in December 2016, they figured out who the primary sub-source was, then they checked their database and they found out that this individual was suspected by the FBI all the way back to 2009 of being a Russian agent. They had information that he tried to offer money for classified information to Obama officials, that he was inquiring about military vessels, that he was seen at the Russian embassy back in 2006 trying to drop information off to the Russian embassy to put in a diplomatic pouch. So, here's the -- here's the point. The FISA court was never told this. They were never informed that the dossier primary sub-source was a suspected Russian agent. This is the biggest fraud yet on the FISA court and in January the 12th, 2017, they applied for a warrant against Carter Page using the dossier, knowing that the sub-source was a suspected Russian agent that never told the court. They eventually interviewed the Russian sub-source, that he tells him the dossier is unreliable and they use it yet again."

This is a massive effort by Russia to do a disinformation campaign against the Trump campaign and it worked. Bottom line is, the FBI used the document prepared by a Russian agent paid for by the Democratic Party to get a warrant against the Trump campaign, and the only place you're going to hear about that is probably on this show.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now the mob of the media is showing their blatant hypocrisy more than ever tonight, completely ignoring the explosive Senate report on Hunter Biden's shady, nefarious, illicit dealings overseas. For example, fake news CNN all three nightly news programs completely avoided the subject, while MSDNC briefly mentioned the story only to downplay the story. Now, the report lays out in detail how Hunter Biden received millions from foreign nationals with corrupt backgrounds, including a $3.5 million deal from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow, called herself the first lady of Russia and a hundred thousand dollar shopping spree funded by a Chinese communist party linked financier. And that's not all. The report even found evidence linking zero experienced Hunter to allege human trafficking and, of course, the findings also reveal how zero experience hunter work for Burisma Holdings. Well, that prompted serious concerns in time inside the Obama State Department, with one senior official even briefing both Joe and Hunter about the conflicts of interest concerns. Now, remember, even Joe claims he never spoke to his son about Ukraine dealings. Well, Joe, you still stand by that lie? And don't forget -- well, Biden is also on tape bragging. You're not getting a billion dollars until you fire Ukrainian prosecutors who's investigating my son being paid millions for no experience. So, let's play the little game, replace the name Hunter Biden -- would say, oh, Donald Trump Jr. How would the mob and the media be covering that? They'd be proclaiming it the biggest bombshell story in history, and it would be 24/7, around the clock hysteria? But there were two sets of rules, one for the Democratic swamp in Washington, one for the rest of us. Now, the good news is, Republicans are at least exposing it, taking action, it's taking forever. Senator Rand Paul says the homeland security panel will refer the report to the Department of Justice for a criminal probe. Congressman Jim Jordan is pressing FBI Director Christopher Wray for information about whether or not the bureau is even investigating this. More importantly, Joe Biden needs to be asked the tough questions. But, of course, he ends his day at 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. every day. So what did he know, when did he know it? Did you ever really never speak to your son about any of this? And why did you allow your son to use that position as vice president to do all these sketchy deals with oligarchs in Russia and Ukraine and elsewhere? Of course, the communist Chinese, $1.5 billion deal with the Bank of China and getting rich while -- well, daddy's vice president. Do you make any money, Joe, from these deals? And, by the way, is that why you were more critical of Donald Trump and the travel ban? Why, so Hunter can get another billion dollar deal with China, and more deals with Russia? We live in dangerous times and in 40 short days, this will be the tipping point election. Powerful institutional forces in the media, the Democratic Party, the deep state and operatives all hands on deck. And even worse than 2016, they're there to protect the swamp, the bureaucracy, and do any and all things possible to destroy President Trump, even if it means electing a frail, weak, corrupt figure like Joe Biden. God help this country. Here with reaction, author of the \"Profile in Corruption\", Peter Schweizer, along with FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. You know, \"Secret Empires\" was your book, Peter. You, you know, and well hang on a second I guess we don't have them up now. Guys, are we going to get the right people up because that's for the next segment? Anyway, we'll get -- there we go. Peter Schweizer, you wrote the book \"Secret Empire\" and in \"Secret Empires\", you exposed this first and foremost it's even worse than you described and almost everything you reported has now been vindicated. PETER SCHWEIZER, \"SECRET EMPIRES\" AUTHOR: Yeah, that's right, Sean. Thank you. And, by the way, the reason we're at the point where the Senate has looked into this is because you interviewed me two years ago and amplified our findings. And what the Senate has done is they've used tools that I didn't have access to not only confirmed what we found but taken it a step further. And what they've shown is that Hunter Biden was involved in a series of foreign corrupt schemes that triggered suspicious activity reports or so-called SRASAR transactions by the Treasury Department. These are triggered when money is flowing from either sketchy individuals or the amount of money in question is raising alarm bells. So this is not a question of anonymous sources or speculation. We now know that money changed hands. We know who it came from. We know it came from countries that are our rivals. And we knew it know it came from very corrupt entities around the world. And the question, Sean, continues to be, why did they give Hunter Biden this money? He didn't have a skill set. He didn't have qualifications. They were paying for something these are not charities and that's the question that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden need to answer."

This is a damning report that accuses Hunter Biden of influence peddling, profiteering and directly connected to his father who said, gee, I knew nothing about it. Now we know, thanks to this report, that was a lie. He was briefed about it. He was warned about it. He spoke to his son about it. Look, it's a crime to confer a benefit to a foreign government in exchange for something of value for yourself or your relative, including your son. It's public corruption. It's -- you know, extortion embezzlement, all of those words get thrown around a lot, but they're all part of the public corruption. Think about this -- Burisma is paying $400 million to Hunter Biden. At the same time, his father is pressuring Ukraine to drop an investigation into his son's company. You know, Rand Paul is right. Let's send this to the Department of Justice. Have the lawyers take a look at it and decide whether a criminal prosecution is merited. But I'm not surprised that the mainstream media, you identified them, were crickets about that. They're not neutral news organizations.

In the eight years he was president and Joe Biden was vice president, almost 20,000 people were shot in that eight-year period, nobody ever mentioned the names of people. I know I did on this show I scrolled the names, I don't know about what other people did, and yet, now, all of a sudden, why do we hear about one or two cases?"

You know, he went by what he had, he's going by what the law is. You know, everyone is out there marching. There was going to do this no matter what the verdict was going to be. They was going to do it, because they already prepared for it. The thing is, and I -- and I say this once, they ask for justice -- well, can you tell us what they are looking for within justice? What are you looking for in justice? What do you mean by justice? Are you talking about that guilty? Are you talking about a trial tell us exactly what you're asking for? And I think it's wrong to call names and it is okay for African-America to get on the television and talk about other African-Americans? That is so great and that just tells you -- just who they are, because you know everyone has a right to their opinion, but there's two sides to every story and I've said that many times. And I think people got to understand that."

It's the same -- those two commentators, those two black commentators, again, they play the race card. They challenge our blackness if we're not voting as a bloc, maybe one ethnic religious group that votes as a bloc. They're challenging my ethnicity, they're challenging Herschel's ethnicity, because they took a beating in 2016. Blacks didn't come out for Hillary. So they are trying to intimidate and trying to scare blacks to vote Democrat. That's a Joe Biden play card. But what I'm telling you is that Democrats like me much happier, I'm smiling, because I left that plantation, and a lot of blacks are going to vote for Donald Trump. And that's the fear that they have because those low numbers in 2016 and the rising number of black voters and Hispanic voters voting for Trump in 2020. That is their biggest fear. No group on the planet votes as a bloc. That's the Joe Biden playbook for all blacks. We reject that."

You know, you want to speak for this here and that's what I tell the people -- you got to recognize that.

Yesterday, Joe Biden claimed the president exercising his authority to replace Justice Ginsburg is, quote, an abuse of power. Hillary Clinton also decided to weigh in on the matter, calling the fight to replace Justice Ginsburg diabolical, before insisting that the goal is to repeal Obamacare. And meanwhile, the ever crazier Nancy Pelosi is now flipping and flopping on a possible impeachment to block a vote on President Trump's nominee, using the excuse that she doesn't think he is worth the trouble. And as the left-wing media mob begins its all-out assault on the front- runner, Amy Coney Barrett, there is reportedly growing concern among Democrats. Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dianne Feinstein could be a liability in fighting Trump's nominee and also people saying she's not up to the job and her saying there's nothing she can do to stop it anyway in spite of what Nancy Pelosi says. Here with more, Florida congressman, author of the new book out this week \"Firebrand\", Matt Gaetz is with us, and FOX News contributor Tammy Bruce. OK, there's nothing Nancy can do to stop it, but, Matt, what they're saying is they'll stack the courts, they'll end the Electoral College, they'll get rid of the legislative filibuster, they'll impeach the president, they'll impeach the attorney general. Those are all stated comments and they're saying -- well, maybe we can't say it publicly so we'll pull back from them."

      "utterance": "The American people know that for Nancy Pelosi, this isn't about justice. It's about power. And we all know that if she could, Nancy Pelosi would be willing to skinny dip across the Potomac River if she thought she could block President Trump's nominee to the court, but she can't. We have the power and we should use that power to ensure that we allow a court to interpret our First Amendment rights correctly, our Second Amendment rights correctly. See, Hillary Clinton knows that you can't get people to just vote for Joe Biden or stand in the way of this nomination, so she's trying to change the subject and make it only about Obamacare, a Supreme Court that is reshaped is about so much more. This is going to be one of the enduring legacies of the Trump administration, and I think if Democrats continue with this slash-and-burn approach, the voters will reject them. It will backfire just like it did with Judge Kavanaugh."

      "utterance": "Well, I think, of course, Matt is absolutely right, but never suggests the skinny dipping, that that way that's a sight that I don't think any of us would have wanted to have imagined. At the same time here, what we've got is a dynamic where like with Joe Biden saying this is a power grab -- look, Donald Trump has reshaped how these things work. I think that this is the first time under Trump's presidency where the GOP is now expected to get something done. So, this is about perhaps for the first time, the Democrats realizing that the GOP is not as easy to control or to have them go along to get along, that he is going to move forward with this nominee and that it is going to work. So there's been a significant change here. When it comes to Dianne Feinstein, if I can say, I think she may realize after the debacle of Kavanaugh and certainly the debacle of the impeachment, both of which help the Dem -- help the Republicans and help Donald Trump. She understands that, look, you can't do the shock-and-awe here, because that backfires on us. Usually, the Democrats, they never learn, they go too far and all of these comments indicate -- look, this is why Democrat cities are in flames because the Democrats, their knee-jerk reaction now is to go to literally and figuratively burn things down. Americans don't like it. We rejected it in 2016. Throughout Trump's presidency, we've been rejecting their approach, and now, it's -- they're really going to have to pony up to show that they can actually be states people and do things in a normal persuasive way. But I don't think we're going to see it."
