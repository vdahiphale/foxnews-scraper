And I think that -- he sees time as on his side and he is not planning I don't think to declare until he feels good and ready to do so based on what he sees going on in the landscape in the Democratic Party for sure.  But I did ask him that question in an earlier conversation about, you know, are you going to just bypass all the debate process? And he says, you know, that remains to be seen. So, you know, I don't know how you can get yourself on the map if you don't participate in some of these stages along the way. I also think it's interesting to remember that essentially President Trump was sort of an independent candidate in the early going. He had been a Democrat. He decided to run as a Republican, decided to run within the system. And you asked him in that first debate, you know, will you backed the Republican candidate if it isn't you? And he said, you know, I really can't promise that.  So I just think it's fascinating to have a gathering tonight of Republicans and Democrats and independents who are looking at someone who believes that there's a way to cut a path which has traditionally been incredibly difficult to cut.

We know that the president brought that up this past weekend that the Republicans need to be the party of health care, though that might be after 2020 when they finally do a bill.   But Howard Schultz has a different approach and one of the things he did in his business was to say, have to convince his investors and the board that we're going to get health care to all these employees. Is that something you expect to tackle tonight to try to figure out a way for Americans to come together to solve these problems, because the anxiety people feel and the concern they have about possibly having to go bankrupt because of an unexpected illness or health emergency is really quite stark.",

But, you know, he firmly believes that there's so much disenchantment on both sides of the political aisle that there is a way to broker a consensus, you know, which -- you know, looking at politics right now it's just really difficult to imagine how you do that.

On the other hand he believes that the country is so divided that there is a lane for someone in the middle who's dissatisfied with the president and also dissatisfied with what he sees as the two socialists bent to the Democrat Party right now."

      "utterance": "Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the first sound bite we heard there in that montage with Bernie Sanders. And he says, you know, with all due respect he doesn't know anything about politics. But isn't part of the appeal or the pitch I guess from Howard Schultz is that he's not a typical politician, as we've heard before. He's a businessman and he's the biggest job creator of his generation. And how do you think he'll draw that contrast tonight between an amazing economy under President Trump and what would he possibly do to make it better?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think that he sees himself as somebody who came up from nothing. He says he was raised in the projects in New York City and built his business. So he sees himself as a self-starter. I think he bristles at any comparison to President Trump because he sees them as two very different people. But I think that the model of a businessman who believes that he can make a success as president and also with the economy, it's a model that has been established in this country now. Whether or not somebody can repeat it coming from a different angle remains to be seen."

      "utterance": "Welcome to Watters' World, ladies and gentlemen. I wanted to know if -- you've been practicing, Bret. I like the hand motion. You -- I'm wondering if the Democrats in your opinion risk demonizing a guy like Howard Schultz because he wasn't given millions of dollars. He came up in the projects. He worked his way up to become CEO and earn this money the right way in America. And to go after him like he just has a silver spoon in his mouth, don't you think goes against everything that the Democrats say they believe? You know, hard work, pulling yourself up from your bootstraps?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Jesse, I think when he started talking about this independent run, and we should point out he's not officially in yet, but he's bouncing around the country like he is. And the biggest, loudest response was from the Democratic Party because I think a lot of them look at the numbers and they say, potentially, this is Ralph Nader for Al Gore. This is Ross Perot the other way, you know. So it would hurt Democrats. A lot of Democrats believe. But Howard Schultz argues that he would take votes from both parties. And the question is what's his path to victory for the White House?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Kennedy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNEDY, HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm really curious about third parties and their influence on the presidential debate. Obviously, someone who has billions of dollars has very different resources for getting on the presidential debate stage. And it also seems like voters have a larger appetite for different and independent voices. How does Howard Schultz get on that stage?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, that's one of the biggest questions for him, Kennedy. And I think that -- he sees time as on his side and he is not planning I don't think to declare until he feels good and ready to do so based on what he sees going on in the landscape in the Democratic Party for sure. But I did ask him that question in an earlier conversation about, you know, are you going to just bypass all the debate process? And he says, you know, that remains to be seen. So, you know, I don't know how you can get yourself on the map if you don't participate in some of these stages along the way. I also think it's interesting to remember that essentially President Trump was sort of an independent candidate in the early going. He had been a Democrat. He decided to run as a Republican, decided to run within the system. And you asked him in that first debate, you know, will you backed the Republican candidate if it isn't you? And he said, you know, I really can't promise that. So I just think it's fascinating to have a gathering tonight of Republicans and Democrats and independents who are looking at someone who believes that there's a way to cut a path which has traditionally been incredibly difficult to cut. But one thing we've learned in recent politics is that there are a lot of surprises out there."

You know, if he starts running, my question is, would he run as a second Democrat, get a following and then throw his support to the eventual Democrat? I wonder if he'll be willing to say I'm taking it all the way to the election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think we'll get down a little bit of that road. I don't want to say too much about our questioning. But I think they'll definitely be those questions about where he's going to be. Remember, a lot depends on who gets in this race. Joe Biden, does he really get in in? Does Mike Bloomberg if Joe Biden doesn't get in, does he get in? You know, this hall here is very beautiful and we have great people from Kansas City. But we wanted to maybe throw him off his game. We were thinking about maybe Dunkin Donuts coffee for everybody, but we decided against that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I just had one other question which is we know from the 2018 midterm elections, and even you could go back further than that, in recent Fox News polling that the number one issue for people of concern is health care. We know that the president brought that up this past weekend that the Republicans need to be the party of health care, though that might be after 2020 when they finally do a bill. But Howard Schultz has a different approach and one of the things he did in his business was to say, have to convince his investors and the board that we're going to get health care to all these employees. Is that something you expect to tackle tonight to try to figure out a way for Americans to come together to solve these problems, because the anxiety people feel and the concern they have about possibly having to go bankrupt because of an unexpected illness or health emergency is really quite stark."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I mean, I know you interviewed Howard, Dana, and we look back at that, you know, in preparation for this as well. He has given a lot of very broad benefits to employees at Starbucks. And, you know, we're going to look at how that translates, the possibility of how that translates to governing in the United States. But, you know, he firmly believes that there's so much disenchantment on both sides of the political aisle that there is a way to broker a consensus, you know, which -- you know, looking at politics right now it's just really difficult to imagine how you do that. But that's the vision that he has right now. And if he thinks that he can make it happen, he's likely to run for president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "The other thing is, is that, you know, this is a potential candidate, one of the only in the fields so far, the president is not, and Democrats so far are not, spending a lot of time talking about the national debt and deficits. You know, you balance that concern with providing health care for everyone and somehow the dollars don't add up. So that is a line of questioning that I think is important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, we're looking forward to watching tonight, 6:30 here on the Fox News Channel. Bret Baier, Martha MacCallum interviewing Howard Schultz of Starbucks. Up next, President Trump issuing a new threat about the southern border, what he wants Mexico to do. That's next right here on The Five."

      "utterance": "If we don't see people apprehended and brought back to their countries, if we see these massive caravans coming up to our country right through Mexico. You know I will do it. I don't play games. I'll do it. So we're doing it to stop people. We're going to give them a one year warning, and if the drugs don't stop or largely stopped, were going to put tariffs on Mexico and products, in particular cars. The whole ball game is cars. And if that doesn't stop the drugs, we close the border."

Meanwhile, you're looking at Yuma, Arizona, where Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is. Nielsen made the emergency trip to deal with what she's calling a category 5 immigration crisis. She's also already authorized emergency surge operations to deal with the influx of migrants. Now despite these dire warnings, Democrats are refusing to acknowledge this crisis and instead want to decriminalize illegal crossings."

And I think that is true now that -- it just happens to be the Democrats are in charge of the House and the president is saying -- you don't get higher than a category 5 situation. That is how bad it is. Kirstjen Nielsen has basically done everything but get on her knees and begged Congress to do something. And I don't even think that this whole idea of waiting a year from now and maybe put tariffs on car parts coming from Mexico, I don't see how that's actually going to help. What I would like to ask Castro is how do you solve --what would he say about solving the problem at its source. If these people feel like they are under persecution from gangs and crime and their government cannot protect them, what is the United States' responsibility to do something? Is there a responsibility? Should we be -- not to just send money, I understand the president wants to cut off the money. But then, do we have to do something more drastic? I feel like nobody's thinking outside the box."

You know, we've waited too long to administer Tamiflu and now you've got a situation that is pretty critical. And, you know, you want some out-of-the-box thinking. One of the big issues is economics and it has to do with drugs. And the desire and demand for drugs, especially in the United States, creates and exacerbates the situation because there are people who sell drugs who have bought their way into very powerful and prominent positions in government in these countries, and their only concern -- it's not about people. It's about getting their drugs to the United States. And we know because we've spent billions and billions of dollars, and hundreds of thousands of lives on the failed war on drugs and it hasn't worked. And we haven't addressed the demand in this country. But simply building a wall does nothing about that demand. So we have to really rethink how we are feeding that war instead of taking care of the situation where it starts. And to me, that is --"

She later killed herself in a hotel room and left a note saying her son was safe with people who would take care of him, but that he would never be found.
