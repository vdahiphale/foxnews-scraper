Americans are losing faith fast in the president who promised America freedom from the virus. Joe Biden's flailing in the face of a new strain of COVID and not taking the possibility of new lockdowns off the table. His solution is more of the same, doubling down on vaccines and masks to stop the spread and here's what he said just a few moments ago.",

In the meantime --  In the meantime, the best protection is getting fully vaccinated. Getting the booster shot.  I urge all Americans who haven't yet to get that done. Get it done today.

He spread lies when he was running for president about the vaccine. He allowed violence to unfold because he knew that it would hurt the Republicans.  He never really cared about the American people. He cared about his party. So, he had an issue with labeling half of America as racist or deplorables or whatever he called them. The fact is, you can't trust him. He is disconnected from reality. He is exempting federal workers from the restrictions that he's applying to everyone else. Again, that's an un-level playing field. He is not a unifier. My point is if we thought he was operating in good faith and that he was cognitively capable, we probably would be okay with him, but there is too many mistakes that he has made. And this is -- this is a huge -- the pandemic is probably one of the biggest recent problems in history. And crises make the leader, but what if the leader is so disconnected that he can't be trusted to make sound decisions?   I don't believe he's capable of making sound decisions because I've been watching. This guy makes Mr. Magoo look like Winston Churchill.

Americans are losing faith fast in the president who promised America freedom from the virus. Joe Biden's flailing in the face of a new strain of COVID and not taking the possibility of new lockdowns off the table. His solution is more of the same, doubling down on vaccines and masks to stop the spread and here's what he said just a few moments ago."

On Thursday, I'll put forward a detailed strategy outlining how we've gone -- we're going to fight this COVID this winter and not with shutdowns and lockdowns but with more widespread vaccination, boosters, testing and much more. In the meantime -- In the meantime, the best protection is getting fully vaccinated. Getting the booster shot. I urge all Americans who haven't yet to get that done. Get it done today. We are going to keep fighting through this with every tool we have."

A plan to not spend is still a plan. Just because you're not adding more money to the deficit or to the budget doesn't mean that you don't have a plan that you do.

He spread lies when he was running for president about the vaccine. He allowed violence to unfold because he knew that it would hurt the Republicans. He never really cared about the American people. He cared about his party. So, he had an issue with labeling half of America as racist or deplorables or whatever he called them. The fact is, you can't trust him. He is disconnected from reality. He is exempting federal workers from the restrictions that he's applying to everyone else. Again, that's an un-level playing field. He is not a unifier. My point is if we thought he was operating in good faith and that he was cognitively capable, we probably would be okay with him, but there is too many mistakes that he has made. And this is -- this is a huge -- the pandemic is probably one of the biggest recent problems in history. And crises make the leader, but what if the leader is so disconnected that he can't be trusted to make sound decisions? I don't believe he's capable of making sound decisions because I've been watching. This guy makes Mr. Magoo look like Winston Churchill. So forgive me if I'm just like, I'm not there for this, and I think to your point, which is everybody is saying now. Do you notice that? To your point --"

And just today, they were going back and forth with the press secretary of the Pentagon saying they are not going to get paid, they're not going to do operations, and that's a real threat to those families who are trying to earn their livelihoods and put food on the table. And that's just one more disconnect that his credit card has been sort of overused by and that we see right through him. And he couldn't even get the name right, by the way.

It hasn't worked to calm the markets. We had another awful day today, but it's two out of three so we're down well over a thousand points since Friday.

You notice that -- you notice Stelter is not defending him because Stelter thinks he's going to get the 9:00, fat chance, literally. My theory is as long -- my theory is as long as Joy Reid is employed, no one should ever be fired. Cuomo is a pompous, self-involved ass, that's why we love him. You get rid of him, I lose at least three to five segments a week of fun on my show. I am so pro-Cuomo, I'm going out there to protest for him. I want him to keep his job, but -- so watching MSNBC talk about him being fired, that's rich. That's too much. Because Cuomo isn't a racist. Reid is a bona fide out of the closet bigot who repeatedly uses the word white as a derogatory adjective which she talks about white tears or white people. It's as though they are inferior. This is 2021 and there is a major network -- MSNBC is kind of a major network -- where they employ a racist in primetime who literally is derogatory towards an entire race.

What we have our e-mails and text messages because the attorney general is doing this. What you don't have is what was set on any phone call because that, you know, everybody knows the phone call is where you figure out exactly what you're going to say. You give the advice.

They are disinformation outlet for DNC. That's what they really are. So they're pretending and you got to look at the resume. The guy is the highest rated guy on CNN. You just re-signed him to a deal. He's still getting slaughtered at 9:00 by Hannity and by Maddow. So, you'd have to cut him loose. Is he damaged goods? Is he worth all the trouble that you're getting right now or could you kind of weather the storm and instead maybe just suspend him for two weeks, take stock afterwards and then give the guy another shot and hope no one really notices? Is he going to be contrite if you suspend him? It doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would be contrite, so I don't know. But Zucker is in a jam because you're looking at the ratings, CNN. I mean, they got three more years of Biden's poison. They are in deep, deep trouble. And so who do you replace Cuomo with at 9:00? Have you groomed anybody? I mean, do you have a strategy? It doesn't seem like they have a big strategy here."

So, when you said the biggest role of government plays is keeping it citizens safe. Exactly. That's what our taxes pay for. But there in San Francisco where taxes are sky-high, their residents pay to be safe, and yet the city lets them down in that regard.

You know, at the airport, like, so excited for his job. So, he's earnest. He means it. Like, I'm like, OK. But the problem is, instead of the 55,000 average cost of an electric car, people just want to be able to afford the gas for the car they have now. They want to afford the products at the store that the trucking losses in the supply chain are contributing to there being a dearth in the shelves and everything. So, he gets an A for effort."
