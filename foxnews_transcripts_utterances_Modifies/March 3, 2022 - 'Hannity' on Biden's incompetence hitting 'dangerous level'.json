A very dangerous situation unfolding, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe is now under attack by Russian forces in Ukraine. Moments ago we witnessed explosions going off all along the nuclear facility, which appears to now be on fire. Now, according to the \"AP\", elevated levels of radiation are now being detected near this power plant as fears that a nuclear meltdown is a real possibility tonight, and as you can imagine, this is a very scary and very dangerous situation. Joining us now at the very latest on the ground in Kyiv is Trey Yingst with us. Trey, this is an extraordinarily scary, dangerous development.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Sean, as we speak, there is a battle ongoing at a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. It's around a town of Enerhodar. This is just north of an area of land called Kherson, a region that is now controlled by Russian forces as they continue their advance into Ukrainian territory. It's significant because as you noted, it is largest nuclear power plant in Europe. It supplies Ukraine with 25 percent of its energy, and it has six reactors. Now, according to officials, this morning, three of those reactors were connected to the power grid. The other three were not in use, but still have nuclear fuel inside. Now, a spokesperson for the plant said one of the reactors was hit with a Russian shell and that it was on fire. There are mixed reports at this hour about the location of the fire within the facility, but it is still significant because even if a reactor is not currently online and connected to the grid, it still has that nuclear fuel inside and it needs to be cooled. While the cooling is external, if it totally stops, this could lead to a nuclear meltdown. Now, it's not the most likely scenario, but certainly a concerning scenario with such a large facility in Ukraine and an active battle ongoing at this hour. We understand that firefighters are trying to get to the scene and at this time, we have not independently confirmed those reports by the \"AP\" that radiation levels are increased. But honestly very concerning as an active battle is taking place at a nuclear power plant of this size in Ukraine, country with a history of Chernobyl and other things that are currently on the ground that are just significant and concerning to the population here as this battle and invasion continues -- Sean.",

But we have also received a chilling readout from the phone call initiated by President Putin, who called the French president, Emmanuel Macron, today, and told him the, quote, \"special military operation\" in Ukraine is going according to plan. The Kremlin later gave no indication that he intends to back down, the call lasted 90 minutes. French officials said they now expect the worst, and the worst is yet to come. Putin indicated, according to the French readout, that he would not stop until he controls all of Ukraine. The Biden administration again today said there is no talk of NATO setting up a no-fly zone despite the horrific images of civilians being killed. The reason Russia has nuclear weapons, the Department of Defense recently established a deconfliction line, we've learned, with the Russian ministry of defense on March 1st for the purpose of preventing miscalculation, military incidents, and escalations.",

We also learned today, a top Russian general, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian Seventh Airborne Division, was killed in Ukraine earlier this week. That's according to the \"AP\" and Russia's \"Pravda\". He was reportedly killed by Ukrainian sniper. General Sukhovetsky was a decorated paratrooper known for his role in annexation of Crimea.

So this is a very worrisome development. There are 15 nuclear power plants in Ukraine, it is their main source of energy, and so clearly, President Biden very concerned tonight.

Now, if there was any doubt, clearly, Russia's invasion is about to get way, way worse than even many anticipated, with more indiscriminate bombing raids against innocent civilians. And today, FOX News learned that Russia has drafted plans to conduct public executions and Ukrainian cities once they've been captured. Now, Russia's murdering thug Vladimir Putin, he's got to be stopped by somebody and I have said repeatedly, no, not one American boot on the ground. I've called for both America and Europe, if you want the sanctions that will work, the first sanction, the top sanction, the most immediate damage you could do to Putin's economy is to stop importing energy from Russia and for America to immediately return to energy independence as soon as possible like we achieved under President Trump. Now, I support America supplying Ukraine with the javelin missiles like President Trump did. I had my doubts at the time. And America supplying stinger missiles to Ukraine like President Reagan provided the mujahidin in Afghanistan in the '80s. I also add that anyone invades a sovereign country, even one with a history of corruption like Ukraine -- we've been very outspoken about it -- quid pro quo Joe, and if they kill innocent men, women, and children like Vladimir Putin has here, they forfeit their right to lead a country. They deserve to be taken out by any means necessary. And our hope is maybe someone in Vladimir Putin's inner circle has a conscience and a soul and would be able to refuse to be a part of a regime that is guilty of murdering women and children. Meanwhile, every dollar that we spend on Russian oil is a dollar that goes right into Vladimir Putin's fund for his war crimes in Ukraine, and right now, we are spending billions of dollars buying over 600,000 barrels of oil from Russia every single day. And as Democrat Joe Manchin said, we either expand our fossil fuel industry here, or we end up compromised just like countries like Germany. Take a listen.",

It's a choice they've made. As a matter of fact, in a fake political effort to go green, European government literally stopped tapping their own supply of natural gas and then imported it from Russia. As a matter of fact, Europe gets 40 percent of their natural gas from Russia. Now, Putin has them, literally, no pun intended, over a barrel. Now, the dependence on oil has got to end. In fact, today, even Nancy Pelosi came out in support of banning all Russian oil imports into the U.S., likely an election-year conversion, but she still has yet to speak out about America once again reclaiming energy independence.

Now, that was before Joe Biden blocked exploration on lands, blocked new drilling efforts in Alaska, killed the Keystone XL pipeline, enacted a variety of regulations on the oil and gas industry, and he needs to lift them all now. Joe Biden is not willing, of course, to reverse course on any of these restrictions no matter how high the price of a gallon of gasoline goes. It doesn't matter how much you pay for groceries and every store and every product that you buy in any store. You the American people will pay the price. It's one of the big reasons we have a 40-year high with inflation. Joe Biden is too cowardly, too gutless to stand up to the radical climate alarmist cult that is the Democratic Party base. He'd rather just import the oil from Putin. Last year, 232 million barrels of oil from Putin, 600 million barrels of oil from OPEC, a million from Iran. We haven't done that since 1991. Putin, by the way, was still importing oil as he was waging assault on humanity in Ukraine. That's right, he's killing even women and children. But according to Biden, now, Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine has nothing to do with Joe's weakness on the world stage or the humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan. And, by the way, it's day 201 since he abandoned our fellow Americans that are trapped behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. Instead, according to Joe, Putin invaded Ukraine because of January 6th?

      "sentences": "Sean, good evening to you. I will break down the last 12 hours of this war to kind of give you a sense of where we are and I think there's really three stories at the moment, two of them happening here in the south, one in the north. Let's go to the story of the moment, and that is that nuclear power plant. It's in a town in Enerhodar, okay? It's in the southern part of the country. This is a giant, massive Dnieper River that really cuts the country in two, Sean. This is -- again, this is a flat country. It's largely farmland. It must be beautiful during harvest time, but not this time of year. This is Enerhodar, the sits right on the Dnieper River. That nuclear plant that now is in question, apparently battles happening around it. That is story number one. Now, why is this taking place? In part because the Russian military came out of Crimea relatively untouched, I would argue. And so, they made a beeline to the east, but they also went west earlier today. Now, we have some video that we rolled earlier this morning, I think we've got it queued up now, Sean. There is a road that leads into this nuclear power plant and there are -- you can see it here. We watched it this morning on \"America's Newsroom.\" This is hundreds, is it thousands of people? These are civilians from the nearby town that are intending to block the Russian military from moving towards the power plant. It was an extraordinary site. These are people who live there. So that is story number one. Here's story number two, and that is what is the Russian army doing, where are they successful? And largely they have been successful in the south. So, they come out of Crimea. They make a beeline here. This is Mariupol. Now, what's the significance of this town? About a half a million people, Ukrainian controlled. The Russians were not able to take it in the war eight years ago, and there was a fierce battle that's been going on for the last three days where the Russian military firing from the sea of Azov, and also from the land above it, but we don't believe that town has fallen to the Russian military yet. That battle continues. Over here to the west, remember Dnieper River comes down, this is Kherson. Trey was talking about this a moment ago. We believe that is the one town in the country that has fallen to the Russian military thus far. The mayor confirms that a bit earlier today. So, now you start to see the swath of land that Putin is going after. Southern Ukraine trying to get the land bridge from the territory he took in 2014 and cut off all the access from the black sea to the rest of the country. What would be the target next? In all likelihood it would be the town of Odessa in the west. A million people, one of the top five population centers in the entire country. That could be the target next. Reporting earlier today suggested that the Russian military is moving on. That might be the case -- you know, 9:00, 4:00 in the morning there in Ukraine, and maybe by daylight tomorrow we have more information on this. So that is happening story one and story number two. Story number three is also significant. Talk about listening to our defense officials talk today and trying to get some reporting on the ground. We believe this is as far as the Russian army has been able to advance from the north and the northeast. And we believe based on the reporting we are getting that this effort has been largely stalled out. Jack Keane was talking bit earlier today about the mix-and-match of soldiers that have come in from the north. Units that have been taken from different parts of the country that never fought before together, have poor communication with each other and as a result that's being reflected in their lack of ability to proceed on the capital city of Kyiv, which is different from the south, because you have units down there that have been established now for eight years going back to 2014. So we will watch that story here and see whether or not Putin's army can get its -- well, can get something together in the north, and if they can we are going to see some more news probably on this convoy that hasn't moved either, and here's the center part of Kyiv and this is the airport. We shall do this a night or two ago. There's a road that runs up this way about 40 miles in the convoy basically has not moved. What's the intent? Well, Putin told Emmanuel Macron earlier today that he wants to take over the entire country but to do it he's going to have to take the capital city and it is still believed by leading defense officials that he would circle this town and probably just bomb the daylights out of it like we've seen in other parts of Ukraine and try to get the people to concede. One of the towns that's really just taken some heat is the town of Kharkiv. Sean, I've talked about this, in the Northeast, 1.5 million people, Russian-speaking city just about 20 miles from the border with Russia here, and they pretty much have this town surrounded. It has not fallen, they have not surrendered, they have not capitulated to Russia, the Russian army, but Kharkiv is really -- they've had a couple of really, really tough days there. The other stories are going to develop over time and these numbers will only go higher by the day, and that's the number of refugees that are flooding the rest of Europe. We are now about a million -- half a million in Poland, 133,000 in Hungary. Romania is 51,000, others about 88,000 there. So this number is a million and climbing by the day, Sean. So, that's where we believe we are as of this hour.",

Seth, my understanding, it's the largest reactor in Europe, largest nuclear facility in Europe, nuclear power plant in Europe. It's got six reactors. There are some conflicting reports whether three are connected or four are connected to the power grid. Let's go with 3, which FOX is reporting, and you still have the other three there. The problem I see is the fire is still raging and it's still under fire, meaning under attack. What are the dangers we're looking at here? SETH GRAE, PRESIDENT & CEO, LIGHTBRIDGE CORP: Yeah, Sean, my information from the International Atomic Energy Agency while you were speaking with Senator Graham is the difference between three and four is that the plant operator shut down one of the plants, which is closest to where the fire is, and I believe that's accurate. The fire is in buildings with windows. Nuclear reactor buildings don't have windows. These seem to be administrative or training buildings. The IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency is saying there's no increase of radiation on the site, there's no release of radiation. These are not Chernobyl-type reactors. They have very strong, concrete, and steel containment domes designed to hold in any radiation release from the reactors. That said, these plants are not designed to be attacked by military. That is an outrageous act and as far as I can tell, there are heroic acts going on by the plant operators to keep this safe and so far that is the situation.",

Whether or not it's lethal immediately, you have to be pretty much right on the site and probably very close to it for it to be lethal in a matter of hours or days, so that's very unlikely, probably very limited implications for people, but you're going to have -- if there is a significant release of radioactivity, and I get that, unless there's an intentional attack to do this, if it's accidental -- and again, there are people there to respond right away, the likelihood is you're probably not going to have that significant of a release.",

We had energy independence for the first time in 75 years, we achieved it. When Donald Trump left office, we, as a country, we were a net exporter of energy. Okay, new green deal socialism says that I guess it's better to import oil from Russia, Iran, and OPEC than it is to be energy independent. As a result, we have record high inflation, average Americans paying a fortune more to fill up their tent, we are paying more for every product we buy in every store, it's impacted our national security, and here, this crisis unfolds and we see our European and NATO allies dependent on Russia and the one sanction -- and we're dependent on Russia. So, right now, today, we are importing, you know, all of this oil from Russia, what, 167,000 barrels a day, whatever the number is. And I'm wondering, the one sanction that would have an effect they won't implement because they want the oil more. Now, Donald Trump says we're being really stupid. That, to me, is stupid.

I think in this moment, we got to look at what are the impacts of the situation on the American people. Even prior to Russia's invasion and attacks on Ukraine, people were already struggling and suffering because of inflation in these increasing costs of gas at the fuel pumps, wondering how much higher is this going to go. So as we face this critical moment, we got to ask important questions like how long would it take, how quickly could we start to ramp up domestic production of oil. We got to make sure that it's done safely, we have to make sure that there are no unintended negative consequences potentially long-term affecting our water aquifers, our water tables, contaminating those water sources for people. So, we've got to look and make sure we're doing this and moving forward responsibly, recognizing all of the factors as we make these decisions in this critical moment. Sean, I do want to -- I do want to go back to, if you don't mind, I don't to talk a little bit about Chernobyl. You've had these experts on talking about the potential ramifications of this. Obviously, we've got to look at all the facts. I think the information, the facts are still rolling in, but I went to Chernobyl after my second deployment to the Middle East. I was traveling to Eastern Europe, traveled around Ukraine and went to Chernobyl myself to see for myself the aftermath of what this kind of disaster looks like. And to hear them talking about this nuclear power plant in Ukraine being many times larger and therefore the applications of this potentially -- potential explosion being many times greater, chills me to my very core. I will never forget as I walked down the halls of those classrooms where they are still deflated basketballs on the basketball court, empty children's shoes lying in the streets, books strewn about, people who literally fled with no time, recognizing this disaster that was on their doorstep.

I've been -- obviously my top concern is the ongoing attacks on this power plant, possible radiation release, the fire that exists that they haven't put out. But we had this 40-mile convoy just sitting there and it's not that far from Kyiv. And if that 40-mile convoy with tanks, ammunitions and troops and fuel makes it Kyiv, my theory is this going to be a massacre there.

You would slap a no fire zone around that. You would not allow American soldiers in there or any good military would go in there because of the cost benefit. And the cost -- you know, the costs are clearly quite critical and it doesn't accrue good benefits. So, any good military wouldn't have gone in there because it shows a lack of organization and the good tactical skills that the Russians are showing. Secondly, what you're saying is correct about that convoy and about Kyiv. I think we are at the end of the beginning of the first phase of this operation and the beginning of the second phase, which is the assault on the cities, which will be horrific, because when you get into city fighting, you go block by block, house by house, building by building, it is brutal, it is hand-to-hand and it will be a tough fight for any army let alone the Russian army and Ukrainians are going to fight. They're going to fight back hard. So I think we are in the second phase and that will be the phase I think that is going to be the critical for the world to watch, because I don't think the world is going to accept all these Russian soldiers coming into the cities and creating mayhem. I just don't think they're going to do it. And this thing about public executions wouldn't surprise me at all if they're going to do this. Now, I really wish on that 40-mile convoy, I wish we could have had a land lease program and given the Ukrainians some A-10 warthogs, found some pretty good pilots so we could train a few months ago when this bill started and they have laid waste to that 40-mile column. They would be smoking holes. You know it and I know it because the A-10 warthog would have done it. We had them available.

That is they know where they are shooting. They were preparing for this. I appeal to all Ukrainians, to all Europeans, to all people who know the word Chernobyl, who know how much grief and victims the explosion at the nuclear power plant brought, it was a global catastrophe, hundreds of thousands of people struggled with its consequences, tens of thousands were evacuated. Russia wants to repeat this end is already repeating it. But six times more. Europeans, please wake up, tell your politicians, Russian troops are shelling a nuclear plant in Ukraine. There are six power units, only one exploded in Chernobyl. He went on to say, he spoke with Biden, he spoke with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he spoke with the IAEA head, and he said this is the -- you know, this is the everything, not a single state except Russia has ever fired at a nuclear power unit. This is the first time in history of mankind that a terrorist state has also resorted to nuclear terror. Russia has never fired at nuclear power units. It's the first time in history that this happen. Russia propaganda has threatened, we remember to cover the world with nuclear actions, now it's not a threat, now it is a reality. We do not know how the fire at the station will end, when will an explosion occurred. God forbid it won't happen but no one will ever figure this out, but our guys always kept the nuclear plants safe, so there were no provocations, so no one could go there, so no one could seize it so no one could mine it into mine, and to mine that would be to blackmail the entire world with a nuclear catastrophe.

Just yesterday he shut down Echo Moscow (ph) and TV Rain, the last two semi-independent, semiautonomous, honest news stations in Russia. He wants to on the narrative, and that's just not possible because we got media on the ground. Second point that I want to make is the reason why President Zelenskyy is a marked man is because he is calling out all that Russia is doing to Ukraine, this bloody invasion, and he's mobilizing international support.

So, my question is, you have even Google satellite images, we know where this convoy is, we know they've been there now for, what, two days. They haven't moved. Why has there been no effort at all to take out that convoy? And I'm not saying by the U.S., but I'm saying by Ukraine. I know we have armed them with javelins.

But here's the facts, Sean, they're running out of weapons. This administration -- and I signed off on a lot of the stuff -- held onto a lot of the stuff since last November and they finally got it into Ukraine just days before the invasion started. And now, we're told by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, now, it's too dangerous to get these weapons in. That's precisely why want to go to the border to see, are we getting these weapons in to these people? They are saying we don't want American troops, but we need the weapons, and that's what's more important right now.",

And third, America and Europe have got to, tomorrow, stop buying Russian oil and Russian gas and Russian energy. That would be the one sanction that actually works. All of this talk about tough sanctions, to me, I feel like we've been lied to. You know, we were told we stopped Vladimir Putin's ability to access banking, but I doubt he's continued to send all of those hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil and all that natural gas to Europe if he wasn't getting paid.

But this should all be a wake-up call to Europe, which is been my coattails of America with the NATO alliance. For decades, Donald Trump tried to wake them up to that reality. It's on their doorstep. We should -- we ought be limited in the contributions that we make, especially militarily in light of the fact -- in light of the fact that Vladimir Putin believes he wants to provoke and there's an inevitable clash between Russia and the United States. So, supporting Zelenskyy is critical, but it ought be the Europeans were he is on their doorstep. And this moment, this is their moments to step up and say, we will stand next to them. Vladimir Putin otherwise has an encirclement of Ukraine, almost unlimited resources. He's calling more reinforcements from across Russia all the way on the Pacific coast, reports we are getting tonight. And because we're switching for more targeted munitions to area munitions, he's willing to sacrifice something like you are seeing on the screen right now, the possibility for nuclear fallout, but not to mention targeting civilians in infrastructure and heat and water.

Donald Trump had energy independence for America. Donald Trump made sure that America did not rely on Russian oil, that the rest of the world was less reliant on Russian oil, and now we see the position that Joe Biden and the Democrats have put us in. It is horrific and it's bad obviously for Americans. We're paying more for gas. We're paying more for everything.

I also argue it is unconscionable to me that Europe and the United States is importing energy at this very hour from Vladimir Putin and Russia, the one sanction that would have worked, as I've been saying. And the fact that we imported 232 million barrels of oil from Russia last year, the fact that we imported a million barrels of oil from Iran, first time we did that since 1991, over 600 million barrels of oil from OPEC, a lot of those countries don't particularly like us, Leo, I know it's hard to believe but it's true.

A very dangerous situation unfolding, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe is now under attack by Russian forces in Ukraine. Moments ago we witnessed explosions going off all along the nuclear facility, which appears to now be on fire. Now, according to the \"AP\", elevated levels of radiation are now being detected near this power plant as fears that a nuclear meltdown is a real possibility tonight, and as you can imagine, this is a very scary and very dangerous situation. Joining us now at the very latest on the ground in Kyiv is Trey Yingst with us. Trey, this is an extraordinarily scary, dangerous development."

      "utterance": "Yeah, Sean, as we speak, there is a battle ongoing at a nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. It's around a town of Enerhodar. This is just north of an area of land called Kherson, a region that is now controlled by Russian forces as they continue their advance into Ukrainian territory. It's significant because as you noted, it is largest nuclear power plant in Europe. It supplies Ukraine with 25 percent of its energy, and it has six reactors. Now, according to officials, this morning, three of those reactors were connected to the power grid. The other three were not in use, but still have nuclear fuel inside. Now, a spokesperson for the plant said one of the reactors was hit with a Russian shell and that it was on fire. There are mixed reports at this hour about the location of the fire within the facility, but it is still significant because even if a reactor is not currently online and connected to the grid, it still has that nuclear fuel inside and it needs to be cooled. While the cooling is external, if it totally stops, this could lead to a nuclear meltdown. Now, it's not the most likely scenario, but certainly a concerning scenario with such a large facility in Ukraine and an active battle ongoing at this hour. We understand that firefighters are trying to get to the scene and at this time, we have not independently confirmed those reports by the \"AP\" that radiation levels are increased. But honestly very concerning as an active battle is taking place at a nuclear power plant of this size in Ukraine, country with a history of Chernobyl and other things that are currently on the ground that are just significant and concerning to the population here as this battle and invasion continues -- Sean."

But we have also received a chilling readout from the phone call initiated by President Putin, who called the French president, Emmanuel Macron, today, and told him the, quote, \"special military operation\" in Ukraine is going according to plan. The Kremlin later gave no indication that he intends to back down, the call lasted 90 minutes. French officials said they now expect the worst, and the worst is yet to come. Putin indicated, according to the French readout, that he would not stop until he controls all of Ukraine. The Biden administration again today said there is no talk of NATO setting up a no-fly zone despite the horrific images of civilians being killed.

We also learned today, a top Russian general, Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky, the commanding general of the Russian Seventh Airborne Division, was killed in Ukraine earlier this week. That's according to the \"AP\" and Russia's \"Pravda\". He was reportedly killed by Ukrainian sniper. General Sukhovetsky was a decorated paratrooper known for his role in annexation of Crimea.

So this is a very worrisome development. There are 15 nuclear power plants in Ukraine, it is their main source of energy, and so clearly, President Biden very concerned tonight. The report I was mentioning was that Ukrainian regulator had called the IAEA in Vienna and said that they had not, as of yet, seen any raised radiation levels. That being said, it is still a very, very dire situation."

Now, if there was any doubt, clearly, Russia's invasion is about to get way, way worse than even many anticipated, with more indiscriminate bombing raids against innocent civilians. And today, FOX News learned that Russia has drafted plans to conduct public executions and Ukrainian cities once they've been captured. Now, Russia's murdering thug Vladimir Putin, he's got to be stopped by somebody and I have said repeatedly, no, not one American boot on the ground. I've called for both America and Europe, if you want the sanctions that will work, the first sanction, the top sanction, the most immediate damage you could do to Putin's economy is to stop importing energy from Russia and for America to immediately return to energy independence as soon as possible like we achieved under President Trump. Now, I support America supplying Ukraine with the javelin missiles like President Trump did. I had my doubts at the time. And America supplying stinger missiles to Ukraine like President Reagan provided the mujahidin in Afghanistan in the '80s. I also add that anyone invades a sovereign country, even one with a history of corruption like Ukraine -- we've been very outspoken about it -- quid pro quo Joe, and if they kill innocent men, women, and children like Vladimir Putin has here, they forfeit their right to lead a country. They deserve to be taken out by any means necessary. And our hope is maybe someone in Vladimir Putin's inner circle has a conscience and a soul and would be able to refuse to be a part of a regime that is guilty of murdering women and children. Meanwhile, every dollar that we spend on Russian oil is a dollar that goes right into Vladimir Putin's fund for his war crimes in Ukraine, and right now, we are spending billions of dollars buying over 600,000 barrels of oil from Russia every single day.

In fact, the European Union also has tremendous amounts of national energy. They are not using it. Take a look at your screen. Europe's dependence on Russian gas is not out of necessity. It's a choice they've made. As a matter of fact, in a fake political effort to go green, European government literally stopped tapping their own supply of natural gas and then imported it from Russia. As a matter of fact, Europe gets 40 percent of their natural gas from Russia. Now, Putin has them, literally, no pun intended, over a barrel. Now, the dependence on oil has got to end. In fact, today, even Nancy Pelosi came out in support of banning all Russian oil imports into the U.S., likely an election-year conversion, but she still has yet to speak out about America once again reclaiming energy independence.

Under the last administration, the U.S. was a net exporter of energy. Joe Biden gave that up because he caved to the radical new green deal socialists that run his party. Now, that was before Joe Biden blocked exploration on lands, blocked new drilling efforts in Alaska, killed the Keystone XL pipeline, enacted a variety of regulations on the oil and gas industry, and he needs to lift them all now. Joe Biden is not willing, of course, to reverse course on any of these restrictions no matter how high the price of a gallon of gasoline goes. It doesn't matter how much you pay for groceries and every store and every product that you buy in any store. You the American people will pay the price. It's one of the big reasons we have a 40-year high with inflation. Joe Biden is too cowardly, too gutless to stand up to the radical climate alarmist cult that is the Democratic Party base. He'd rather just import the oil from Putin. Last year, 232 million barrels of oil from Putin, 600 million barrels of oil from OPEC, a million from Iran. We haven't done that since 1991. Putin, by the way, was still importing oil as he was waging assault on humanity in Ukraine. That's right, he's killing even women and children. But according to Biden, now, Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine has nothing to do with Joe's weakness on the world stage or the humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan. And, by the way, it's day 201 since he abandoned our fellow Americans that are trapped behind enemy lines in Afghanistan. Instead, according to Joe, Putin invaded Ukraine because of January 6th?

Let's turn back to the scary situation at Europe's biggest nuclear power plant that was targeted by Russian forces and now appears to be on fire this hour. Here with more from our big board is our very own Bill Hemmer. Bill, the problem is the bombing has not stop and the other problem is the fire is ongoing. Three of the six reactors are active and we don't know the status of the other three. What can you tell us?"

      "utterance": "Sean, good evening to you. I will break down the last 12 hours of this war to kind of give you a sense of where we are and I think there's really three stories at the moment, two of them happening here in the south, one in the north. Let's go to the story of the moment, and that is that nuclear power plant. It's in a town in Enerhodar, okay? It's in the southern part of the country. This is a giant, massive Dnieper River that really cuts the country in two, Sean. This is -- again, this is a flat country. It's largely farmland. It must be beautiful during harvest time, but not this time of year. This is Enerhodar, the sits right on the Dnieper River. That nuclear plant that now is in question, apparently battles happening around it. That is story number one. Now, why is this taking place? In part because the Russian military came out of Crimea relatively untouched, I would argue. And so, they made a beeline to the east, but they also went west earlier today. Now, we have some video that we rolled earlier this morning, I think we've got it queued up now, Sean. There is a road that leads into this nuclear power plant and there are -- you can see it here. We watched it this morning on \"America's Newsroom.\" This is hundreds, is it thousands of people? These are civilians from the nearby town that are intending to block the Russian military from moving towards the power plant. It was an extraordinary site. These are people who live there. So that is story number one. Here's story number two, and that is what is the Russian army doing, where are they successful? And largely they have been successful in the south. So, they come out of Crimea. They make a beeline here. This is Mariupol. Now, what's the significance of this town? About a half a million people, Ukrainian controlled. The Russians were not able to take it in the war eight years ago, and there was a fierce battle that's been going on for the last three days where the Russian military firing from the sea of Azov, and also from the land above it, but we don't believe that town has fallen to the Russian military yet. That battle continues. Over here to the west, remember Dnieper River comes down, this is Kherson. Trey was talking about this a moment ago. We believe that is the one town in the country that has fallen to the Russian military thus far. The mayor confirms that a bit earlier today. So, now you start to see the swath of land that Putin is going after. Southern Ukraine trying to get the land bridge from the territory he took in 2014 and cut off all the access from the black sea to the rest of the country. What would be the target next? In all likelihood it would be the town of Odessa in the west. A million people, one of the top five population centers in the entire country. That could be the target next. Reporting earlier today suggested that the Russian military is moving on. That might be the case -- you know, 9:00, 4:00 in the morning there in Ukraine, and maybe by daylight tomorrow we have more information on this. So that is happening story one and story number two. Story number three is also significant. Talk about listening to our defense officials talk today and trying to get some reporting on the ground. We believe this is as far as the Russian army has been able to advance from the north and the northeast. And we believe based on the reporting we are getting that this effort has been largely stalled out. Jack Keane was talking bit earlier today about the mix-and-match of soldiers that have come in from the north. Units that have been taken from different parts of the country that never fought before together, have poor communication with each other and as a result that's being reflected in their lack of ability to proceed on the capital city of Kyiv, which is different from the south, because you have units down there that have been established now for eight years going back to 2014. So we will watch that story here and see whether or not Putin's army can get its -- well, can get something together in the north, and if they can we are going to see some more news probably on this convoy that hasn't moved either, and here's the center part of Kyiv and this is the airport. We shall do this a night or two ago. There's a road that runs up this way about 40 miles in the convoy basically has not moved. What's the intent? Well, Putin told Emmanuel Macron earlier today that he wants to take over the entire country but to do it he's going to have to take the capital city and it is still believed by leading defense officials that he would circle this town and probably just bomb the daylights out of it like we've seen in other parts of Ukraine and try to get the people to concede. One of the towns that's really just taken some heat is the town of Kharkiv. Sean, I've talked about this, in the Northeast, 1.5 million people, Russian-speaking city just about 20 miles from the border with Russia here, and they pretty much have this town surrounded. It has not fallen, they have not surrendered, they have not capitulated to Russia, the Russian army, but Kharkiv is really -- they've had a couple of really, really tough days there. The other stories are going to develop over time and these numbers will only go higher by the day, and that's the number of refugees that are flooding the rest of Europe. We are now about a million -- half a million in Poland, 133,000 in Hungary. Romania is 51,000, others about 88,000 there. So this number is a million and climbing by the day, Sean. So, that's where we believe we are as of this hour."

Those are two things that I think the West needs to do now, but the most important thing the West needs to do immediately, including Joe Biden and America, is immediately stop importing any oil from Russia, and that means our European allies, they have to stop importing any energy from Russia as well, and that will -- that is the one thing that will take down the economy of Putin."

Joining us now with analysis on what is happening live on your screen, a raging fire at the Ukrainian nuclear power plant, the largest power plant in Europe, and it's Nuclear Energy Institute Board member and Lightbridge Corporation CEO Seth Grae is with us. Seth, my understanding, it's the largest reactor in Europe, largest nuclear facility in Europe, nuclear power plant in Europe. It's got six reactors. There are some conflicting reports whether three are connected or four are connected to the power grid. Let's go with 3, which FOX is reporting, and you still have the other three there. The problem I see is the fire is still raging and it's still under fire, meaning under attack. What are the dangers we're looking at here? SETH GRAE, PRESIDENT & CEO, LIGHTBRIDGE CORP: Yeah, Sean, my information from the International Atomic Energy Agency while you were speaking with Senator Graham is the difference between three and four is that the plant operator shut down one of the plants, which is closest to where the fire is, and I believe that's accurate. The fire is in buildings with windows. Nuclear reactor buildings don't have windows. These seem to be administrative or training buildings. The IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency is saying there's no increase of radiation on the site, there's no release of radiation. These are not Chernobyl-type reactors. They have very strong, concrete, and steel containment domes designed to hold in any radiation release from the reactors. That said, these plants are not designed to be attacked by military. That is an outrageous act and as far as I can tell, there are heroic acts going on by the plant operators to keep this safe and so far that is the situation."

I'm a nuclear trained submarine officer, so not a civilian nuclear power, not as familiar with that, but I do understand and we do study some of the histories of these designs and the consequences if you have a nuclear release. So the fact that you have military ordinance and you have a military conflict that's on -- on this facility, there is a potential that you could breach the containment, and if you did that, then you have radioactive activity that could be spelled out into the immediate area around, and if there's wind and if it's actually -- you know, the plant has not been shut down long enough, you might actually have more release of higher radioactive material spread out into the environment around. Just think of like Fukushima."

But when it's under missile fire and when a fire breaks out at such a facility, we know what happened with Chernobyl. Because of the volatility of what's happening this hour, one has got to imagine the worst- case scenario. What is the worst-case scenario? I'm not saying this to scare people, I just want to know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SADLER",
      "utterance": "So, probably the worst case but still, you know, rationally thinking about the dynamics that are going around this nuclear power plant is one that the plant hasn't been shut down, it is still fairly operational, so it has lot of latent heat inside of it and pressure built up inside its core. And then you have an armor piercing round that actually hits and breaches the containment, the plant is no longer able to cool itself and you start to have a meltdown. And that would probably be the worst kind of scenario, there would be some time for the operators and people around the area that try to fill in the breach and try to prevent the spread of radioactivity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SADLER",
      "utterance": "I think there's a lot of unknowns that go into that. The first one is the direction of the prevailing winds. If there's a strong wind, it will actually carry the radioactivity -- think of like dust and if it picks it up and blows that it go downwind. The other is how close is water, is water flowing nearby and our rivers nearby their used for cooling. So if it gets into that, it starts being carried down into the population centers where people can get into the drinking water. Whether or not it's lethal immediately, you have to be pretty much right on the site and probably very close to it for it to be lethal in a matter of hours or days, so that's very unlikely, probably very limited implications for people, but you're going to have -- if there is a significant release of radioactivity, and I get that, unless there's an intentional attack to do this, if it's accidental -- and again, there are people there to respond right away, the likelihood is you're probably not going to have that significant of a release."

Here with more reaction, former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard. Tulsi, thank you for being with us. Let me ask you this because this frustrates me. We had energy independence for the first time in 75 years, we achieved it. When Donald Trump left office, we, as a country, we were a net exporter of energy. Okay, new green deal socialism says that I guess it's better to import oil from Russia, Iran, and OPEC than it is to be energy independent. As a result, we have record high inflation, average Americans paying a fortune more to fill up their tent, we are paying more for every product we buy in every store, it's impacted our national security, and here, this crisis unfolds and we see our European and NATO allies dependent on Russia and the one sanction -- and we're dependent on Russia. So, right now, today, we are importing, you know, all of this oil from Russia, what, 167,000 barrels a day, whatever the number is. And I'm wondering, the one sanction that would have an effect they won't implement because they want the oil more. Now, Donald Trump says we're being really stupid. That, to me, is stupid. That is insane to me and I would return to the policies that were working that Joe Biden inherited. You're a Democrat. Your thoughts?"

I think in this moment, we got to look at what are the impacts of the situation on the American people. Even prior to Russia's invasion and attacks on Ukraine, people were already struggling and suffering because of inflation in these increasing costs of gas at the fuel pumps, wondering how much higher is this going to go. So as we face this critical moment, we got to ask important questions like how long would it take, how quickly could we start to ramp up domestic production of oil. We got to make sure that it's done safely, we have to make sure that there are no unintended negative consequences potentially long-term affecting our water aquifers, our water tables, contaminating those water sources for people. So, we've got to look and make sure we're doing this and moving forward responsibly, recognizing all of the factors as we make these decisions in this critical moment. Sean, I do want to -- I do want to go back to, if you don't mind, I don't to talk a little bit about Chernobyl. You've had these experts on talking about the potential ramifications of this. Obviously, we've got to look at all the facts. I think the information, the facts are still rolling in, but I went to Chernobyl after my second deployment to the Middle East. I was traveling to Eastern Europe, traveled around Ukraine and went to Chernobyl myself to see for myself the aftermath of what this kind of disaster looks like. And to hear them talking about this nuclear power plant in Ukraine being many times larger and therefore the applications of this potentially -- potential explosion being many times greater, chills me to my very core. I will never forget as I walked down the halls of those classrooms where they are still deflated basketballs on the basketball court, empty children's shoes lying in the streets, books strewn about, people who literally fled with no time, recognizing this disaster that was on their doorstep. This place is frozen in time and is a living reminder to us all about the heavy consequences of what we are facing here and God forbid that this nuclear power plant also goes towards that path of destruction.

I've been -- obviously my top concern is the ongoing attacks on this power plant, possible radiation release, the fire that exists that they haven't put out. But we had this 40-mile convoy just sitting there and it's not that far from Kyiv. And if that 40-mile convoy with tanks, ammunitions and troops and fuel makes it Kyiv, my theory is this going to be a massacre there.

You would slap a no fire zone around that. You would not allow American soldiers in there or any good military would go in there because of the cost benefit. And the cost -- you know, the costs are clearly quite critical and it doesn't accrue good benefits. So, any good military wouldn't have gone in there because it shows a lack of organization and the good tactical skills that the Russians are showing. Secondly, what you're saying is correct about that convoy and about Kyiv. I think we are at the end of the beginning of the first phase of this operation and the beginning of the second phase, which is the assault on the cities, which will be horrific, because when you get into city fighting, you go block by block, house by house, building by building, it is brutal, it is hand-to-hand and it will be a tough fight for any army let alone the Russian army and Ukrainians are going to fight. They're going to fight back hard. So I think we are in the second phase and that will be the phase I think that is going to be the critical for the world to watch, because I don't think the world is going to accept all these Russian soldiers coming into the cities and creating mayhem. I just don't think they're going to do it. And this thing about public executions wouldn't surprise me at all if they're going to do this. Now, I really wish on that 40-mile convoy, I wish we could have had a land lease program and given the Ukrainians some A-10 warthogs, found some pretty good pilots so we could train a few months ago when this bill started and they have laid waste to that 40-mile column. They would be smoking holes. You know it and I know it because the A-10 warthog would have done it. We had them available. It's too bad we didn't use them, too bad we didn't plan for it, too bad we didn't think about this months ago that President Zelenskyy asked about. So, we are living with it but it's really unfortunate."

      "utterance": "Europe must wake up now, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe is on fire. Right now, Russian tanks are firing at atomic blocks. These tanks are equipped with thermal imagers. That is they know where they are shooting. They were preparing for this. I appeal to all Ukrainians, to all Europeans, to all people who know the word Chernobyl, who know how much grief and victims the explosion at the nuclear power plant brought, it was a global catastrophe, hundreds of thousands of people struggled with its consequences, tens of thousands were evacuated. Russia wants to repeat this end is already repeating it. But six times more. Europeans, please wake up, tell your politicians, Russian troops are shelling a nuclear plant in Ukraine. There are six power units, only one exploded in Chernobyl. He went on to say, he spoke with Biden, he spoke with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, he spoke with the IAEA head, and he said this is the -- you know, this is the everything, not a single state except Russia has ever fired at a nuclear power unit. This is the first time in history of mankind that a terrorist state has also resorted to nuclear terror. Russia has never fired at nuclear power units. It's the first time in history that this happen. Russia propaganda has threatened, we remember to cover the world with nuclear actions, now it's not a threat, now it is a reality. We do not know how the fire at the station will end, when will an explosion occurred. God forbid it won't happen but no one will ever figure this out, but our guys always kept the nuclear plants safe, so there were no provocations, so no one could go there, so no one could seize it so no one could mine it into mine, and to mine that would be to blackmail the entire world with a nuclear catastrophe. The Russian military has got to be stopped immediately, and he goes on to say don't let Europe die from a disaster at a nuclear power plant. President Zelenskyy moments ago. Your reaction, Dan Hoffman?"

      "speaker": "DAN HOFFMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah, so this is -- this is why it's so important, vitally important that we have press on the ground in Ukraine to cover all of these war crimes, these atrocities, these attacks on civilian infrastructure and the civilians themselves. It's also why Vladimir Putin had shut down the media in his own country. Just yesterday he shut down Echo Moscow (ph) and TV Rain, the last two semi-independent, semiautonomous, honest news stations in Russia. He wants to on the narrative, and that's just not possible because we got media on the ground. Second point that I want to make is the reason why President Zelenskyy is a marked man is because he is calling out all that Russia is doing to Ukraine, this bloody invasion, and he's mobilizing international support. He's done that from the very beginning. Remember the United States offered him a ride up he said no thanks, the fight is here, I need ammunition. He is leading. He is leading in a time of crisis when his country is facing more apparel than arguably they ever have."

Thank you both. General, thank you. Dan Hoffman, thank you. We are continuing to follow this attack on Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Ukraine tonight and we are now a week into this bloody invasion by Russia. The Ukrainian people are fighting for their sovereignty, their lives. Here with more reaction, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican congressman from Texas, Mike McCaul, who, by the way, is headed tomorrow to Europe, to the Ukraine border. Congressman, as I look at what's unfolding at this nuclear power plant, as I look at this 40-mile convoy that seems poised to invade and take over Kyiv, it's not looking good for Ukraine tonight in my -- from my vantage point. Yours? What do you think?"

      "utterance": "No, I completely agree, Sean. I think Putin has made the decision. I think the initial invasion, he underestimated the strength of the resistance, the Ukrainians. He's now made the decision to bring the hammer down. And so what I think you're going to see -- I mean, to attack a nuclear power plant is one of the most reckless, dangerous things I've ever seen, and this is six times the size of Chernobyl and could have six times as much damage. You have this convoy that, for God's sakes, Keith Kellogg is right, why weren't we arming Ukraine with better weapons? If they had the A-10 warthogs, these should be sitting ducks taken out that would not be able to go to Kyiv. But you know what's going to happen, they're going to create a ring of steel with these tanks surrounding Kyiv and then they're just going to blast it. And they don't care about civilian casualties anymore."

I hope and pray I'm wrong, but that's what I believe will happen. So, my question is, you have even Google satellite images, we know where this convoy is, we know they've been there now for, what, two days. They haven't moved. Why has there been no effort at all to take out that convoy? And I'm not saying by the U.S., but I'm saying by Ukraine. I know we have armed them with javelins. Apparently, Europe is also sending javelins and stinger missiles, why aren't they using them?"

But they do have MiGs that they could fly. They do have these Turkish drones that could fly in and cause a lot of disruption. I'm not sure why they haven't launched some of this. But here's the facts, Sean, they're running out of weapons. This administration -- and I signed off on a lot of the stuff -- held onto a lot of the stuff since last November and they finally got it into Ukraine just days before the invasion started. And now, we're told by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, now, it's too dangerous to get these weapons in. That's precisely why want to go to the border to see, are we getting these weapons in to these people? They are saying we don't want American troops, but we need the weapons, and that's what's more important right now."

B, continue to provide the javelin, antitank missiles, and stinger missiles which I think other European countries are also providing. And third, America and Europe have got to, tomorrow, stop buying Russian oil and Russian gas and Russian energy. That would be the one sanction that actually works. All of this talk about tough sanctions, to me, I feel like we've been lied to. You know, we were told we stopped Vladimir Putin's ability to access banking, but I doubt he's continued to send all of those hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil and all that natural gas to Europe if he wasn't getting paid. So there's got to be a loophole in there somewhere, and which means probably Joe Biden and other allies lied to us. Do you think he's going to give it to us for free? Because I don't believe that. That means there's a loophole in that banking sanction. Your thoughts?"

He's killing innocent men, women and children. And, you know, if you have a conscience and a soul, you know, you want to provide them the ability to fight back and not fund the guy that is -- that is wreaking havoc on the entire world. But, Congressman, I have to run. Appreciate you being with us. Thank you. Here with more is \"FOX & Friends\" weekend co-host Pete Hegseth is with us. Maybe you can make heads a tale of that, Pete, because it doesn't make any sense to me. PETE HEGSETH, FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND CO-HOST: No, it shouldn't be. At this point, energy independence is our path out of types of entanglements and a pathway out of enriching the enemy we're fighting. But this should all be a wake-up call to Europe, which is been my coattails of America with the NATO alliance. For decades, Donald Trump tried to wake them up to that reality. It's on their doorstep. We should -- we ought be limited in the contributions that we make, especially militarily in light of the fact -- in light of the fact that Vladimir Putin believes he wants to provoke and there's an inevitable clash between Russia and the United States. So, supporting Zelenskyy is critical, but it ought be the Europeans were he is on their doorstep. And this moment, this is their moments to step up and say, we will stand next to them. Vladimir Putin otherwise has an encirclement of Ukraine, almost unlimited resources. He's calling more reinforcements from across Russia all the way on the Pacific coast, reports we are getting tonight. And because we're switching for more targeted munitions to area munitions, he's willing to sacrifice something like you are seeing on the screen right now, the possibility for nuclear fallout, but not to mention targeting civilians in infrastructure and heat and water. This is -- this is an inevitable development of a dictator bogged down who is not going to stop. He said that to Emmanuel Macron."

      "utterance": "Arming the Ukrainians with and javelins. I think we can be -- and our desire to be helpful, which we ought be, we can also play into Putin's hands with a provocation, which he wants. He wants to draw America into this conflict to justify his own false propaganda that this is an offensive operation by NATO, and that's a very, very delicate balance. If we're looking at America First foreign policy, we ought not fault into his trap of forcing that provocation. And that's the delicate balance. I don't necessarily trust this administration will handle that balance well, and that's what's unfortunate. But even reports today show that we are providing real-time intelligence to Ukraine, which we ought, and that's a good thing. But -- and we should note also that Russia does not yet completely control the skies over Ukraine and that means that Ukrainian pilots should be supported in every way possible to be hitting those targets on that convoy, but it's -- the south is the vulnerable spot right now as well, as we saw. Crimea has been a staging ground for eight years, Sean. In the north they had military exercises so they don't have the logistical train."

Joining us now with more, FOX News contributors Lara Trump and Leo 2.0 Terrell. A lot we are paying attention to. We're looking at the 40-mile convoy wondering if it's going to make its final push towards Kyiv. We're looking at the ongoing battle and fire that's happening at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Lara Trump, it's interesting, because nearly 65 percent of Americans say that if your father-in-law were president, this day wouldn't have happened. This war wouldn't have happened. Thoughts?"

First of all, people knew that Donald Trump was a strong leader. Vladimir Putin was not trying to test Donald Trump in anyway. But of course the Trump energy policies as you've talked about the entire show, many would argue would have kept this entire situation from happening, from Russia having the ability, the money, and the leverage, to invade Ukraine and cause the situation, that is going on right now. Donald Trump had energy independence for America. Donald Trump made sure that America did not rely on Russian oil, that the rest of the world was less reliant on Russian oil, and now we see the position that Joe Biden and the Democrats have put us in. It is horrific and it's bad obviously for Americans. We're paying more for gas. We're paying more for everything. But then you have a situation like this going on and, gosh, if COVID taught us anything, Sean, didn't it teach us that we need to be able to manufacture things ourselves here in America? Whether it's PPE, whether it's microchips, whether it's machine parts, or whether it's oil and gas, it is vital to the future of America that we are self-sufficient, that we are self-reliant, and obviously we now see how unfortunately it has impacted the world. Ukraine is paying the price right now."

I also argue it is unconscionable to me that Europe and the United States is importing energy at this very hour from Vladimir Putin and Russia, the one sanction that would have worked, as I've been saying. And the fact that we imported 232 million barrels of oil from Russia last year, the fact that we imported a million barrels of oil from Iran, first time we did that since 1991, over 600 million barrels of oil from OPEC, a lot of those countries don't particularly like us, Leo, I know it's hard to believe but it's true. I believe we created a vulnerability here, a national security vulnerability and an economic vulnerability because I believe this also has contributed to the 40-year high inflation.

They have basically sold our soul, this country, into a green new deal and made us dependent on foreign oil and made Europe dependent on foreign oil. That sad part about it is, throughout your entire show, children being killed, women, men, the nuclear plant, you have a refusal, outright refusal by the Biden administration because of the commitment to the extreme left to not cut off Russian oil, not to cut off foreign oil."
