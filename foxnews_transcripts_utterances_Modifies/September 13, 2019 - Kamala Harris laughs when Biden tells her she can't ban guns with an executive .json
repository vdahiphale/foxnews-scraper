It's the question of, \"Okay, let's fabricate the crisis and then sell a solution.\" So the solution they want, or some people want is to limit Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon, and maybe have access to the riches that we have there, to the mineral resources that we have there.

Kamala Harris giving it a go with the old comedy act last night during the debate. I guess she's trying to kind of rescue this floundering presidential campaign. She threw out a bunch of poorly timed awful jokes. One about Trump being the little dude in the Wizard of Oz and then when asked about an executive order, she wants to impose to take your guns away. And someone asked her about the Constitution, but she kind of laughed it off. She thought that was a joke, too. It wasn't really funny. Dave Chappelle and Sebastian Maniscalco, your careers are just fine. Don't worry about Kamala Harris. So story number two, Elizabeth Warren. You know, Brian, one of these things that's super frustrating about these candidates. I did this last week with Bill de Blasio.

The media narrative for a long time and amongst others, competitors of Biden's have believed for a while that he is going to crater, that he is going to stumble, and that that will be the end of his gimmick. That did not happen. And in fact, I think he acquitted himself very well. Warren, I think she set herself apart from Bernie Sanders, who I thought was a nonentity.

I don't think that the Obama's will endorse before the convention. This could go all the way to a contested convention next summer, which should be really fun.

So a debater's promise, Texas House Member Briscoe Cain tweeted this. \"My AR is ready for you, Robert Francis,\" close quote. Beta is so very brave when promising to take away constitutional rights. Immediately. Beto whined back, \"This is a death threat, Representative. Clearly you shouldn't own an AR-15 and neither should anyone else.\" Game On.

He has threatened to trespass on my property and the property of others in order to kick down our door and take from us. You know, what I wrote really is just another way of saying, \"Come and take it.\" Many are familiar with that flag with the cannon, it's called the Gonzales flag. It's from 1835 here in Texas when we stood up to a radical Federal government who demanded we give up our arms. And again, all that was, was saying, \"Come and take it.\" You had mentioned that he made T-shirts and of course, he is trying to fund raise off this, maybe he wants to -- maybe send a remark to that, they can actually go to my website, briscoecain.com and maybe pitch in 15 bucks for AR-15 to let Beto know that, he may have been in D.C. a little long."

Maybe we could say, from our cold dead hands. And you do recall his flip flop, right? And people keep pointing it out that in his failed Senate race, he was saying, \"No one wants to take your guns.\" You know, they were trying to say that Americans are just panicking and freaking out, and now here we have a presidential candidate wanting to rob us and steal our rights. It's disgusting."

It's safer and I know you know that and your listeners know it as well that of course, it's the guy -- and you know what, it's the driver.

The T-shirt, I am absolutely amazed that a lawmaker, someone running for the highest office in the land would actually try to raise money off of threat to the public. And I want to be really clear about this, when you tell law abiding Americans that you are going to forcibly steal their lawfully owned and responsibly used property, that's a threat and saying that \"No, you're not. I want to be able to defend myself in return.\" That is not a threat. I mean, saying -- telling someone like Beto O'Rourke has been doing, that's a threat of promised action. And I mean, do -- I want to take everyone back to one of the earliest attempts at mass confiscation of firearms in the United States, and that was Wounded Knee. So I don't know if that's what Democrats and Beto O'Rourke are trying to move us towards? I sincerely hope not. I hope they respect the law of the land. I hope they respect the Constitution. But I just find this talk reprehensible, and I think that the party needs to show where they are with Americans and condemn it."

It's a trigger for Republicans and pro-Second Amendment, which everyone should be if you endorse the Bill of Rights. They say it's a slippery slope. When you want to contain, when you want to curtail, when you want to dance around the edges. It's the beginning of taking the guns away. But when he comes out and actually says it, what does that do to the debate?"

I mean, these are individuals who are purposefully conflating terms. Brian, when they use phrases like \"weapons of war,\" they're talking about all semi-automatics. Let me ask this question, and I hope that Mr. O'Rourke can answer. When he is talking about going out and confiscating all AR-15? .223? .556, well what about a Tavors? What about, you know, SKS? What about all of the other platforms? Or is it just specifically the AR-15 platform? Or is it specifically the lower .223 and .556 caliber, but yet, he is totally fine with 30 OT 6 and 3OA. I think if you're going to talk about these issues, you need to demonstrate a working knowledge of these issues. Otherwise, it would be like me, Brian regulating the NFL. I know nothing about football. I would say something to the effect, \"Well, let's ban all pastel colors on the field because I don't like pastel colors.\" It would be that stupid. So I think our lawmakers when they're talking about restricting our rights, they need to show the respect of understanding the issue about which they are legislating."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, and that's what Vice President Biden is doing. Right? So he runs an ad in Iowa, basically touting being tied to the Obama administration, Vice President. He ran a pre-debate ad yesterday also doing that with him and Obama hugging. And so -- but then, he divorces himself on the deportations thing, and this is what Castro had to say about that."

      "speaker": "CASTRO",

I was there. That's me, too.\" And then every time somebody questions, part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \"Well, that was the President.\" I mean, he wants to take credit for Obama's work, but not have to answer to any questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "And he is right. So when asked about mass deportations, \"No, I was just the lowly Vice President. Nothing to do with that.\" However, he also says this, so listen to this."

      "speaker": "BIDEN",
      "utterance": "By the way, Barack and I as President and Vice President, we provide money for voluntary busing. He pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord that Barack and I helped put together. That's why Barack and I fought so hard to continue to see you're funded. Barack and I agreed we were going to give them the chance. He is always actively working to undo every bit of the progress President Obama and I and our administration did."

I'm essentially an extension of that.\" But then when it comes to bad things like mass deportations that are now immensely unpopular among the left, he's like, \"I didn't have anything to do with that.\" So you can't have it both ways. Castro seems to be the only one calling him out on it. But Biden also made another comment last night, that's getting a lot of attention as well. He was asked about reparations, and some comments he made previously about segregation, and so he talked about the need for more money for schools and teachers.

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",

I'm paraphrasing here, they need help. And so some people on the left are saying that's a tone deaf comment, and are not happy with Joe Biden's response when talking about reparations."

And then he went on to say, poor kids don't hear enough words. And let's put on the record player. If I'm a voter, or if I'm a democratic strategist, and you do this stuff for a living, or did, I'm worried about the way he loses himself. I'm worried that he gets so confused. He can read a prompter, but every single event ends up in a problem. This is a pattern."

You look at his support among African-Americans, it is so strong. You look at states like South Carolina, where he is doing so well, particularly because African-Americans make up about 60 percent of the electorate there.

We're not turning people away who have legitimate asylum claims, and if they want to talk about what's going on right now, because of our broken asylum laws, the only people who are benefiting from those loopholes are the cartels. They are a multibillion dollar industry and because of our laws, because Congress fails to do what they need to do to change those laws and protect this country, it's the cartels who are getting rich.

Don't give thousands of dollars to cartels and be taken advantage of to make this journey.\" If you're truly seeking asylum, if you're truly being persecuted, what we want you to do is seek relief from the first country you get to, that's what they should be doing.

We know the majority of these individuals are economic migrants. What we want to tell them is, do this in the right way. Do this in a safe way."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "All right, Thursday's debate had four different moderators, but the standout to a degree so to speak, was Univision anchor, Jorge Ramos. Ramos made it obvious how he feels about the current U.S. President and U.S. politics and prompted Pete Buttigieg to call half the country racist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RAMOS",
      "utterance": "Pete, eight out of 10 Latinos in Texas for another mass shooting targeting them. This is according to a new Univision poll. President Trump has called Mexican immigrants rapists and killers. He tried to ban Muslims from entering the country and separating children from their parents. His supporters kept chanting, \"Build a wall\" and \"Send her back.\" Do you think that people who support President Trump and his immigration policies are racist?"

Joe, what's your reaction to that? I was shocked at the point of view that we're getting from the guy asking questions."

    {
      "speaker": "JOE CONCHA, MEDIA WRITER, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "I wasn't so much shocked because we've known, Brian Kilmeade, that this is Jorge Ramos. This is who he is. He is not a journalist. He is an activist. He is a partisan. Here's what he had to say in 2016 before the presidential election. He said, \"Donald Trump is the most divisive, polarizing, and disrupting figure in American politics in decades. And neutrality is not an option for journalists when covering him.\" So if you're ABC News, and you see and hear the things that Jorge Ramos has said in the past, and then you say, \"You know what? Let's make him a moderator.\" Just like MSNBC put Rachel Maddow in the moderator seat, just like CNN put Don Lemon in the moderator seat. This is why the American public isn't learning too much from these debates because they're being asked questions that are really speeches being given by activists and partisans, and we're not getting to the core issues. Even Ramos last night, asked Senator Warren, \"Should American foreign policy be based around the principle of climate change\"? This isn't journalism. This is a joke, Brian."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "It is. A couple of other things, Joe, I'm very curious. When Rahm Emanuel opens up on the Sunday show this week with George Stephanopoulos and says, \"What are the Democrats doing insulting President Obama and decriminalizing people crossing the border and offering free healthcare?\" He goes, \"That's what Democrats believe.\" And it just so happens that ABC never asked any of those questions. They never said, \"Do you believe the decriminalization at the border? Do you believe that all immigrants, illegal should get healthcare?\" They would have answered, yes and it would have went right back to insulting the previous President. But they avoided all of that."

      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "It's amazing the questions that weren't asked last night, Brian, and you look at any poll, whether it be from Reuters and Ipsos, whether it be from Gallup, when you ask American voters, \"What issue is most important to you when going into presidential elections?\" And we didn't get, \"It's the economy, stupid,\" for nothing back in 1992. It's the same election cycle. Every time the economy is number one, yet none of those four moderators last night, Brian said this word \"jobs.\" In other words, how are you going to create jobs if we do go into the recession that Biden, Warren and Sanders say, and the media for that matter, say that we're going into? Also the word \"deficit\" never brought up once, or \"Federal spending\" or anything really resembling taxes or the economy. And that's what matters to people most. And instead, now we've had five debates, and all of them have been about social issues for the most part, and not about the things that matter to people in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and the rest of the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. The other thing to keep in mind, too, is deficit. It could be a weakness for President Trump. We've got about a trillion dollars in deficit already this year. They might have welcomed that question. Meanwhile, Joe, another thing Federal prosecutors recommended charges this week against former Acting Director of the F.B.I., Andy McCabe. CNN had a pretty interesting reaction to that news. What do you make of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "Well, they didn't have much of a reaction when you looked at their prime time last night, for instance. Remember prime time on CNN, unlike say, Fox. Fox -- that's the opinion side of the newspaper, so to speak. Tucker, or Sean Hannity or Laura Ingraham -- those are opinion hosts. And that's fine because the newspaper has the news side and the opinion side. On CNN, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, and Don Lemon are all listed as anchors. Therefore, those are news programs. And last night, none of those programs broached even for a second, the news around Andy McCabe. And then if you even go on to their website or on their Twitter feed, they have a headline that says that McCabe is going -- maybe under indictment, yet they don't mention until seven paragraphs down to the story that, \"Oh, yes, by the way, he happens to be an employee at this network.\" So it's the bias of omission. And that's the most insidious bias you could have, Brian."

Today, she learns her punishment and handling that story, Trace Gallagher because he handles all breaking news. Trace, what happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, appearing before a Judge, Huffman was nervous and tearful, Brian, apologizing to the students, parents and colleges impacted by her actions, saying she was deeply ashamed and did more damage than she ever imagined. Huffman attributed her actions in part to the bewilderment of being a mother, but the prosecutor shot right back saying, \"Motherhood does not make you a cheat and a felon.\" The judge agreed that trying to be a good mom was no excuse, saying, \"The college system is already distorted by money and privilege.\" And yet for Huffman that wasn't enough, so she took one more advantage for her child. But the judge also noted that Huffman immediately accepted responsibility, is not a threat to her community and has apparently regained her moral compass. So she will now serve two weeks in Federal prison, pay a $30,000.00 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. The judge noted that without this sentence, the community around Huffman would ask why she got away with it. The actress is hoping to serve her time at an all-women's low-security prison in Northern California. After leaving the courthouse today, Huffman said there are no excuses or justifications for her actions. Period. And she hopes her family, friends and community will forgive her. Remember, Huffman is the first parent to be sentenced in this scandal. \"Full House\" Lorie Loughlin and her fashion designer husband are charged with paying a half million dollars to bribe their daughters into USC. They have pled not guilty and are fighting the allegations, but could face up to 40 years in prison."

They tweeted photographs of rain forest fires attributed to Brazil, many of which were actually years old. All of this, of course, is political. It's a coordinated attack on the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, newly elected. He is a populist. His government is frequently compared to that of Donald Trump and he is about as popular with rich people around the world. Ernesto Araujo is the Foreign Minister of Brazil. He says the fires are no different from fires that have been going on in the rain forest for decades, and only now being used as an excuse to attack Brazil and undermine the new government. He joins us tonight. Mr. Araujo, thank you very much for coming on tonight. So as a factual matter, put these fires in context for us. In the United States, we're being told that this is a new phenomenon, and it's a result of the Bolsonaro government's unwillingness to acknowledge climate change."

There are fires, they are partly natural occurrences and partly farmers clearing land that had already been cleared before. And in some way, it's also illegal deforestation that we want to combat. But basically, in terms of the amount of fires, we are -- this year, on average, compared to the average of the last 10 years, it's more than last year, but is half of what we had in the years of 2004-2005 when we had the leftist government in Brazil, and back then, no one said anything, no one cared about it. It was normal. This year. Different government, suddenly -- yes."

      "speaker": "ARAUJO",
      "utterance": "Oh, yeah, that's true, and it's amazing because information is out there. The European Commission themselves, they commissioned a study that was just out one week ago, showing exactly what I said. We are, on average, more than last year, half of what we had some years ago. So it's not only us saying that or the Space Institute saying that, it is also international data, NASA data, European Union data. So it's totally fabricated. It's the question of, \"Okay, let's fabricate the crisis and then sell a solution.\" So the solution they want, or some people want is to limit Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon, and maybe have access to the riches that we have there, to the mineral resources that we have there. So they fabricate a crisis that doesn't exist in order to sell the solution that they were thinking about in the first place."

But it's interesting because Bolivia had maybe more occurrences this year, it was more serious, the situation. And no one said anything about Bolivia because, basically because Bolivia has a left-wing government. So you see by now the political aspect at play and not the facts. All we want is to show the facts. But apparently that's not what people want, because it doesn't combined with their narrative."

And listen, it started like a kind of a slow news week, but it ended kind of hot. So here are my three best stories of the week. Let's start with story number three first. Kamala Harris giving it a go with the old comedy act last night during the debate. I guess she's trying to kind of rescue this floundering presidential campaign. She threw out a bunch of poorly timed awful jokes. One about Trump being the little dude in the Wizard of Oz and then when asked about an executive order, she wants to impose to take your guns away. And someone asked her about the Constitution, but she kind of laughed it off. She thought that was a joke, too. It wasn't really funny. Dave Chappelle and Sebastian Maniscalco, your careers are just fine. Don't worry about Kamala Harris. So story number two, Elizabeth Warren. You know, Brian, one of these things that's super frustrating about these candidates. I did this last week with Bill de Blasio. They're like professional boxers the way they can duck a jab and duck a question --"

Elizabeth Warren was asked directly if her Healthcare-for-All -- which is really going to be healthcare for none -- plan would raise middle class taxes. She went on this five minute diatribe and never answered the question. Let me just say answer it for you all, whatever she told you until today is a lie. Okay. Your taxes will go up. There's no money fairy, America. Newsflash, the viewers in this network probably know this. There is no money fairy. Nothing is free. Doctors don't work for free. The janitor in the hospitals don't work for free. Somebody's got to pay for this stuff. And they just continue -- at least you know, good Republicans, at least, you know, we have our problems, too. But good Republicans are honest. They just will not tell you the truth, these Democrats, \"Your taxes won't go up.\" It was infuriating watching that last night."

You can look that up, folks. This network -- listen, it's over guys. I get it. You're pandering to 10 people in an airport in East Tuna Fish, but it's over. It's a reality network. It's not a news network anymore. I can't believe they blew it again. Unbelievable."
