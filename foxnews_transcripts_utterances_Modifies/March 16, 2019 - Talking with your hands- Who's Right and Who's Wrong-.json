This guy says - and this is a quote, \"The nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China.\" He says he's not a conservative, not a Nazi. He is inspired by all of these other whack jobs, not Donald Trump. He calls himself an eco-nationalist obsessed with fertility rates.

You can actually shut up and pray for people and wait for the authorities to make their judgments. And in fact, you can also get the facts from the United States authorities, New Zealand. Look at what the President said right away, condemning violence, condemning hate, standing with the people of New Zealand. People believe that we should all be safe everywhere, but in our places of worship, certainly. And don't do things that will inspire a copycat.   So actually, this manifesto provided information that we haven't had in other mass shootings, which is clear evidence of who this person is and what motivates him, but don't let that get in the way of having a conclusion in search of evidence. And there's something else going on, you played a couple of clips. I've been noticing in the last two, three, four weeks as it is increasingly obvious, they have no idea how to defeat Donald Trump in 2020, they keep talking about the 2016 campaign. It's kind of a little weird. They're playing all of these clips constantly and I think it's because they don't want to cover the economy, they don't want to cover the strides he's making around the world, they don't want to cover how he is rebalancing trade. They don't want to cover the fact that he says we have a humanitarian and national security crisis at our own border. And this past Friday, provided the first veto of his Presidency because he believes that, but the media don't let any of that get in the way. They never let the facts get in the way of their opinions, and by the way, they are speaking to each other. They are not informing the public. They are giving opinions. That's not news.  Give us news and if you are waiting on the news, we can be patient and wait on the news.",

I understand they have their own reasons for doing this. Congress passed the national emergency declaration. Are they saying that Congress passed an unconstitutional act?

That's what I would call 76,000 migrant aliens being apprehended in February of this year alone.  That's what I would call nine and ten-year-old girls being pumped with birth control by their families before they come here and then being administered pregnancy tests when they get into our border because we know how perilous the journey can come. We know how many women are being sexually assaulted on the journey. I would call it a crisis that we have tons and tons of drugs pouring over our borders into our communities. I would call it a crisis that people are being smuggled and MS-13 gangs and other criminal cartels are coming over the border. That's not everyone. But it shouldn't be one.  If it's one, it's ten too many. And so this President has been consistent for four years now, Jesse. We have a crisis at the border. He tried to let Congress do its job. The Congress and the courts have fallen down on the job. They failed to do it and he is invoking a Congressional Act from 1976. It is 43 years old.   If you don't like that act, then go ahead, Congress and undo that act. But they don't have the guts to do that. So we don't have a constitutional crisis here, we have a humanitarian security crisis. Also, there is a surprise that some of the senators who voted with the President against the disapproval resolution, which he vetoed anyway, that they are running in 2020. You know why? Because they hear in North Carolina and in Nebraska and a couple of other places, they hear their voters and their people say, \"Excuse me, you better get back to Washington and do your job and secure that border.\"",

They ignored the I.C.E. detainer nine times and then finally, after he killed someone, that tenth time they decided to say, \"Well, I guess, we're going to cooperate with I.C.E. this time.\" He was convicted in 2016 of battery on an officer, convicted in 2015 of narcotics. Apparently, he had loads of meth, perhaps with the intent to distribute. I think was one of the charges. He had been deported repeatedly. His rap sheet was so long, but apparently the State of California wants to prioritize the comfort and indulge those who enter the country illegally and put that as a priority over the law-abiding citizens like Bambi Larson. I mean, this echoes so much of what we heard with -- remember Jamiel Shaw, Sr. and his son Jamiel Shaw, Jr. which is one of the most heartbreaking stories I've ever heard. How many innocent people have to pay with their blood for the cost of these sanctuary state policies? And I think that that is what Democrats need to answer.

I read an article last night, Jesse that was discussing how Aunt Becky, Lori Loughlin, which I am still just rocked by this, her daughter -- her youngest daughter that was going to USC, apparently, her grade point average was below their lowest level of acceptance. Like, she didn't even academically qualify to get into USC, but yet, they were making these exceptions for her and she was saying, \"Well, I don't really care about school. I just want to go party and go to the games.\" And I am thinking, how many hard working students out there have sacrificed so much so that they could get into this school? And you are not skating in and you are not even academically qualified to go there. These are our moral bettors, Jesse, remember? These are the people that went out there with the \"Vote for Hillary\" stickers and they were deriding all of us as being racist and bigots because we were considering something different than Hillary Clinton back in 2016.  And now look where it has gotten them? They are as entitled or more entitled than the people that they always accuse of entitlement. So I am just kind of sitting back and watching this happen. My only concern though, and this is sort of selfish is how this is going to affect \"Full House\" and Hallmark. Like who is going to save the snow globe factory if Lori Loughlin isn't in a particular role in Hallmark because they've dropped her. Netflix has dropped her. Sephora has now dropped her daughter.

He is inspired by all of these other whack jobs, not Donald Trump. He calls himself an eco-nationalist obsessed with fertility rates.

You can actually shut up and pray for people and wait for the authorities to make their judgments. And in fact, you can also get the facts from the United States authorities, New Zealand. Look at what the President said right away, condemning violence, condemning hate, standing with the people of New Zealand. People believe that we should all be safe everywhere, but in our places of worship, certainly. And don't do things that will inspire a copycat. So actually, this manifesto provided information that we haven't had in other mass shootings, which is clear evidence of who this person is and what motivates him, but don't let that get in the way of having a conclusion in search of evidence. And there's something else going on, you played a couple of clips. I've been noticing in the last two, three, four weeks as it is increasingly obvious, they have no idea how to defeat Donald Trump in 2020, they keep talking about the 2016 campaign. It's kind of a little weird. They're playing all of these clips constantly and I think it's because they don't want to cover the economy, they don't want to cover the strides he's making around the world, they don't want to cover how he is rebalancing trade. They don't want to cover the fact that he says we have a humanitarian and national security crisis at our own border. And this past Friday, provided the first veto of his Presidency because he believes that, but the media don't let any of that get in the way. They never let the facts get in the way of their opinions, and by the way, they are speaking to each other. They are not informing the public. They are giving opinions. That's not news.

It's Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Lamar Alexander, Mitt Romney, Jerry Moran, Pat Toomey, Rob Portman, Roger Wicker, Marco Rubio, and Roy Blunt. I understand they have their own reasons for doing this. Congress passed the national emergency declaration. Are they saying that Congress passed an unconstitutional act? What is the act there if it's not to be used? I understand their point, but at the same time there is an emergency and you've got to do something because the Democrats do not want to protect the country."

That's what I would call nine and ten-year-old girls being pumped with birth control by their families before they come here and then being administered pregnancy tests when they get into our border because we know how perilous the journey can come. We know how many women are being sexually assaulted on the journey. I would call it a crisis that we have tons and tons of drugs pouring over our borders into our communities. I would call it a crisis that people are being smuggled and MS-13 gangs and other criminal cartels are coming over the border. That's not everyone. But it shouldn't be one. If it's one, it's ten too many. And so this President has been consistent for four years now, Jesse. We have a crisis at the border. He tried to let Congress do its job. The Congress and the courts have fallen down on the job. They failed to do it and he is invoking a Congressional Act from 1976. It is 43 years old. If you don't like that act, then go ahead, Congress and undo that act. But they don't have the guts to do that. So we don't have a constitutional crisis here, we have a humanitarian security crisis. Also, there is a surprise that some of the senators who voted with the President against the disapproval resolution, which he vetoed anyway, that they are running in 2020. You know why? Because they hear in North Carolina and in Nebraska and a couple of other places, they hear their voters and their people say, \"Excuse me, you better get back to Washington and do your job and secure that border.\""

Every time I hear one of these stories, I think it can't get any worse and then I hear about Bambi Larson for instance. I mean, this woman stalked by this guy. They ignored the I.C.E. detainer nine times and then finally, after he killed someone, that tenth time they decided to say, \"Well, I guess, we're going to cooperate with I.C.E. this time.\" He was convicted in 2016 of battery on an officer, convicted in 2015 of narcotics. Apparently, he had loads of meth, perhaps with the intent to distribute. I think was one of the charges. He had been deported repeatedly. His rap sheet was so long, but apparently the State of California wants to prioritize the comfort and indulge those who enter the country illegally and put that as a priority over the law-abiding citizens like Bambi Larson. I mean, this echoes so much of what we heard with -- remember Jamiel Shaw, Sr. and his son Jamiel Shaw, Jr. which is one of the most heartbreaking stories I've ever heard. How many innocent people have to pay with their blood for the cost of these sanctuary state policies? And I think that that is what Democrats need to answer.

California has blood on its hands, and whenever you try to sue a state or a city for something like this, some judge tosses the thing for God knows why, so you can never have any accountability.

I read an article last night, Jesse that was discussing how Aunt Becky, Lori Loughlin, which I am still just rocked by this, her daughter -- her youngest daughter that was going to USC, apparently, her grade point average was below their lowest level of acceptance. Like, she didn't even academically qualify to get into USC, but yet, they were making these exceptions for her and she was saying, \"Well, I don't really care about school. I just want to go party and go to the games.\" And I am thinking, how many hard working students out there have sacrificed so much so that they could get into this school? And you are not skating in and you are not even academically qualified to go there. These are our moral bettors, Jesse, remember? These are the people that went out there with the \"Vote for Hillary\" stickers and they were deriding all of us as being racist and bigots because we were considering something different than Hillary Clinton back in 2016. And now look where it has gotten them? They are as entitled or more entitled than the people that they always accuse of entitlement. So I am just kind of sitting back and watching this happen. My only concern though, and this is sort of selfish is how this is going to affect \"Full House\" and Hallmark. Like who is going to save the snow globe factory if Lori Loughlin isn't in a particular role in Hallmark because they've dropped her. Netflix has dropped her. Sephora has now dropped her daughter.

YouTube page Adam Central released a clip from the Trinity Test which took place on July 26th, 1945 in a remote part of the New Mexico desert. It was the world's first nuclear weapons test. It was developed by staffers of the Manhattan Project. The explosion created by the plutonium bomb, so powerful it shattered glass more than 125 miles away. Wow. That's all for us tonight.
