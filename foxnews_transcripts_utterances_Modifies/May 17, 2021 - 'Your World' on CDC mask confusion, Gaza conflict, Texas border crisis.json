But you mentioned some other stores, like Trader Joe's, Publix, Costco, and Walmart. At those locations, if you're vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask. We are at Gene & Georgetti, an iconic Italian steakhouse here in Chicago, and they're trying to decide what to do as well, because the Illinois governor has not rescinded the state's mask mandate.  So, Michelle Durpetti, the owner here, you're kind of in a tough spot. What do we do? Do we go against the state or do we follow the CDC's new guidance?  MICHELLE DURPETTI, OWNER, GENE & GEORGETTI: Right, so, for right now, we're following the state. We're just waiting on word. We heard that something might be shared soon.

I have so many questions for you. And just talking to people in the building, at home in the neighborhood, other parents, everybody is confused.

Number one, they did a complete about-face from what they did one week earlier, even Dr. Fauci on the morning, when they changed the guidance. Secondly, it's obvious they didn't let any state or local officials know it. It's astounding to me that, when you have new school guidance, you can consult with the teachers unions, and actually let them edit your final documents, but you don't even talk to the state and local officials. And the third and most important thing, the CDC should be telling us what is safe or relatively safe or not safe to do. But their guidance was what you can and cannot do. They have neither the authority nor the expertise to do that. In fact, the guidance says you can do this unless somebody tells you can't. So that's why everyone is confused. But let me tell the American people, if you are vaccinated, fully vaccinated, it is safe for you to go maskless. If you are not vaccinated, and you're in public, it is still important for you to wear a mask until you get vaccinated.   That's basically the bottom line.",

Many have chosen to do that. Are they not willing to take on the potential risk? Are they protecting their employees? They could have several reasons for doing that. But I think, big picture, we all just wonder, when is it going to be respectful to lower the mask and do so -- I know you're saying that we can today.  But I think there's still sort of this stigma now with dropping the mask when you go into a public place, even though the CDC guidance says the science says that we can. Do you think this is just going to take some time to navigate, to come out of this, and to find that new normal?",

But that's not what the CDC can do for you. They can only tell you what's relatively safe or not. That's why this has been passed down, again, complete lack of leadership at the federal level.  That's why they're passing the buck to the state officials and local officials and to the businesses. And that's what you're seeing right now. And it's going to take some time to evolve.  But, given the lack of warning by the CDC that they were going to -- changing, the lack of leadership from the White House, I think the American businesses have done a great job. You're seeing many states even today, Massachusetts, New York, you're seeing many businesses already rolling back with no prior warning. So I think it's going to evolve very, very quickly.",

Those Americans with at least one shot of any of the vaccines, that's now up to 60 percent. So it's no wonder that they're changing guidance, but listening to that, the White House was definitely taking a victory lap.

When I said last October or November that the end was in sight, you can't test your way out of this, you can't mask your way, you have to vaccinate your way out of it, and this is going on Warp Speed schedule.  The Biden team has done a good job taking the baton and getting it closer to the finish line. I want to give them credit.

You can probably assume there's not going to be guidance change for school- aged kids K-12 in this school year, considering there's only, in most cases, weeks left of school. But should kids as young as 5, 6 years old be required to mask up outdoors, at summer camp, at their sporting events? Because that's still happening most places.",

The WHO, with the whole global consensus, and the United Nations children's organization, UNICEF, say, definitively, do not put a mask on kids under 5 years of ages.   This may cause developmental issues, communication issues, et cetera. So, the CDC is way out of bounds for that. You're seeing mask guidance has changed. The U.K. just announced no more masks in children under 11 starting in another week. So, this will evolve. I think it's fine that they're keeping it right now.

Now, what's happened here with the shortage is that these gas prices have spiked here, especially up and down the East Coast. In fact, AAA says the regular gallon average is $3.05 a gallon. That's about 63 percent increase from last year, where you were paying $1.87 a gallon. So it's simple supply and demand here. The demand causes supply to dry up; 69 percent of the stations in Washington, D.C., are without gas now, according to GasBuddy. It's about a third of the gas stations in Virginia and about half of the gas stations in North Carolina and about half in South Carolina. So, you throw in the rhetoric, the anti-pipeline rhetoric and stance of the administration, and some Republicans are saying, hey, wait a minute, this is what happens when you constrain supply. And, as you said, Colonial pipeline is up and running at normal operations. But it takes some time to get that gas to go from Texas 5,500 miles from beginning to end of this pipeline. So you have some of those feeling pain at the pump here, and those prices expected to rise a little bit when it comes towards the Memorial Day weekend. However, some experts believe the prices will settle down a little bit from where they are today -- back to you.",

Few people wanted to actually buy that book. It's called \"American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic.\" It sold about 50,000 copies. And you can go on Amazon right now and buy one for just over two bucks. Cuomo and his aides are reportedly being investigated now if they used state resources on the book. He denies any wrongdoing. But prominent Cuomo critic Democratic Assembly Member Ron Kim, whose uncle died of COVID in a nursing home, says that Cuomo officials should go to jail, in part saying -- quote -- \"Today's news is further confirmation of the insidious and ugly truth that Andrew Cuomo took millions of dollars from Crown Publishing to write a book in the middle of the pandemic, while families buried their loved ones.\" The governor's office says that just over $1 million of the book money is going in trust to Cuomo's three daughters and that he is also donating half-a-million to United Way for COVID relief.

We have supply chain problems, because the entire country was shut down because of a global health pandemic that's taken millions of lives and 570,000 American lives, I think is the latest count. That's obviously going to have an effect on the economy. In terms of the spending and how reckless it is, Joe Biden has only gotten one of his plans through so far. So, people are trying -- this is what the American Jobs plan caused, et cetera, et cetera. So far, we have had a COVID relief package that was approved of by more than 70 percent of Americans.

Something has to change, Sandra. And what it has to -- I think the Fed has to get away from this quantitative easing. And I think the federal government needs to stop spending so much money.

So I understand we can all have this conversation. I think the Biden administration is going to do what they want to do.

But you mentioned some other stores, like Trader Joe's, Publix, Costco, and Walmart. At those locations, if you're vaccinated, you don't have to wear a mask. We are at Gene & Georgetti, an iconic Italian steakhouse here in Chicago, and they're trying to decide what to do as well, because the Illinois governor has not rescinded the state's mask mandate. So, Michelle Durpetti, the owner here, you're kind of in a tough spot. What do we do? Do we go against the state or do we follow the CDC's new guidance? MICHELLE DURPETTI, OWNER, GENE & GEORGETTI: Right, so, for right now, we're following the state. We're just waiting on word. We heard that something might be shared soon.

And you know it's bad when even \"Saturday Night Live\" is now spoofing all of this confusion over the new mask guidance from the CDC. Coming up, we will speak to a former \"SNL\"er, Joe Piscopo. Can't wait to talk to him. He's coming up. But, first, to former Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Brett Giroir on the consequences of all this. Admiral, it's great to see you. I have so many questions for you. And just talking to people in the building, at home in the neighborhood, other parents, everybody is confused. So, was it the messaging coming from the White House, the CDC? Who's getting this wrong, so that we can all get back to normal?"

      "speaker": "ADM. BRETT GIROIR, FORMER U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, let me say it has been very, very confusing. Three different points. Number one, they did a complete about-face from what they did one week earlier, even Dr. Fauci on the morning, when they changed the guidance. Secondly, it's obvious they didn't let any state or local officials know it. It's astounding to me that, when you have new school guidance, you can consult with the teachers unions, and actually let them edit your final documents, but you don't even talk to the state and local officials. And the third and most important thing, the CDC should be telling us what is safe or relatively safe or not safe to do. But their guidance was what you can and cannot do. They have neither the authority nor the expertise to do that. In fact, the guidance says you can do this unless somebody tells you can't. So that's why everyone is confused. But let me tell the American people, if you are vaccinated, fully vaccinated, it is safe for you to go maskless. If you are not vaccinated, and you're in public, it is still important for you to wear a mask until you get vaccinated. That's basically the bottom line."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Admiral, you know that this is tough to navigate because private businesses can do as they please. They can put a sign on their door and say, you have to have a mask on to enter. Many have chosen to do that. Are they not willing to take on the potential risk? Are they protecting their employees? They could have several reasons for doing that. But I think, big picture, we all just wonder, when is it going to be respectful to lower the mask and do so -- I know you're saying that we can today. But I think there's still sort of this stigma now with dropping the mask when you go into a public place, even though the CDC guidance says the science says that we can. Do you think this is just going to take some time to navigate, to come out of this, and to find that new normal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIROIR",
      "utterance": "You're exactly right. It's going to take some time. But, again, the words that the CDC use matters. When they say you can, I hear that. That means I can. But that's not what the CDC can do for you. They can only tell you what's relatively safe or not. That's why this has been passed down, again, complete lack of leadership at the federal level. That's why they're passing the buck to the state officials and local officials and to the businesses. And that's what you're seeing right now. And it's going to take some time to evolve. But, given the lack of warning by the CDC that they were going to -- changing, the lack of leadership from the White House, I think the American businesses have done a great job. You're seeing many states even today, Massachusetts, New York, you're seeing many businesses already rolling back with no prior warning. So I think it's going to evolve very, very quickly."

There is a laundry list of good numbers, good statistics coming from this pandemic. Deaths are down 81 percent, Admiral. Those Americans with at least one shot of any of the vaccines, that's now up to 60 percent. So it's no wonder that they're changing guidance, but listening to that, the White House was definitely taking a victory lap. Admiral, coming from the last White House medical team, were you surprised not to hear more credit given to Operation Warp Speed and all the work of the previous administration to get here?"

When I said last October or November that the end was in sight, you can't test your way out of this, you can't mask your way, you have to vaccinate your way out of it, and this is going on Warp Speed schedule. The Biden team has done a good job taking the baton and getting it closer to the finish line. I want to give them credit. But this is according to the Trump administration playbook, only enabled by that. And it's a great American story. Why try to cancel the Trump culture of what did so many great things in a historic time to get these vaccines up into Americans' arms?"

You can probably assume there's not going to be guidance change for school- aged kids K-12 in this school year, considering there's only, in most cases, weeks left of school. But should kids as young as 5, 6 years old be required to mask up outdoors, at summer camp, at their sporting events? Because that's still happening most places."

      "speaker": "GIROIR",
      "utterance": "Well, 5 and under, you said outdoors, of course not, not outdoors. And, look, I think the issues of children 5 and under is really an important one. The WHO, with the whole global consensus, and the United Nations children's organization, UNICEF, say, definitively, do not put a mask on kids under 5 years of ages. This may cause developmental issues, communication issues, et cetera. So, the CDC is way out of bounds for that. You're seeing mask guidance has changed. The U.K. just announced no more masks in children under 11 starting in another week. So, this will evolve. I think it's fine that they're keeping it right now. But it needs to evolve by the fall, no question."

And I think that what has been lost here is the fact that these people that are firing those rockets out of Gaza, as well as out of the parts of Southern Lebanon, Syria and other places, they don't recognize the right of Israel to even exist. So, for members of Congress to get up and criticize the president at a time like this, I think, is ill-advised, because he is up against the greatest test of his leadership right now. I hope that he makes some tough decisions here soon. But these people are not helping the situation.

He should be leaning on our allies and the United Nations to stand with Israel in this -- what I believe is an unprovoked attack on Israel, not by the Palestinians, by Iran.

But if you're lucky enough to walk around or drive around D.C. a little bit, that gas station right there does have gas that people are getting. Now, what's happened here with the shortage is that these gas prices have spiked here, especially up and down the East Coast. In fact, AAA says the regular gallon average is $3.05 a gallon. That's about 63 percent increase from last year, where you were paying $1.87 a gallon. So it's simple supply and demand here. The demand causes supply to dry up; 69 percent of the stations in Washington, D.C., are without gas now, according to GasBuddy. It's about a third of the gas stations in Virginia and about half of the gas stations in North Carolina and about half in South Carolina. So, you throw in the rhetoric, the anti-pipeline rhetoric and stance of the administration, and some Republicans are saying, hey, wait a minute, this is what happens when you constrain supply. And, as you said, Colonial pipeline is up and running at normal operations. But it takes some time to get that gas to go from Texas 5,500 miles from beginning to end of this pipeline. So you have some of those feeling pain at the pump here, and those prices expected to rise a little bit when it comes towards the Memorial Day weekend.

It hurts the poorest family, hurts those on fixed income when gas prices are up, food prices are up, household good prices are up, used car prices are up. Everything's up. Everything is going up. And it's going to hurt the poorest families the most. And so I have asked the Biden administration to focus on this. And they won't. I mean, they just act like, oh, this is -- oh, it's all going to go away. It's not going to go away if we don't stop this ridiculous spending. They want to, what, spend another $4 trillion or $5 trillion after they wasted the last $1.9 trillion? So, we have got to stop this wasteful spending. We're at $28 trillion worth of debt, soon to go to $30 trillion worth of debt. Who's going to pay for this? This is -- there's no free money here. It is your money that they're giving to you. And they're trying to make everybody a dependent. I mean, it's like, we -- let's have a -- let's make every -- let's give everybody some money, so everybody's equally dependent on government.

We're going to have to write -- somebody is going to pay for this. And as taxes go up, what happens? We receive less money. You can't make everybody dependent on government, and this works. It's never worked. It's socialism. I mean, we beat the Soviet Union, because that's what they tried to do. It's never worked anywhere. So, think about what they're doing right now. The Biden administration and Democrats, they want a redistribution of wealth. They want everybody -- raise everybody's taxes. We're seeing unbelievable inflation already happening, Green New Deal, you name it. It goes on and on. Take away our personal freedoms. This is socialism. That's systemic socialism.

The reason, they say, his big jackpot. It turns out that Cuomo is set to receive more than $5.1 million for his coronavirus book. That's a lot more than first thought. Few people wanted to actually buy that book. It's called \"American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the COVID-19 Pandemic.\" It sold about 50,000 copies. And you can go on Amazon right now and buy one for just over two bucks. Cuomo and his aides are reportedly being investigated now if they used state resources on the book. He denies any wrongdoing. But prominent Cuomo critic Democratic Assembly Member Ron Kim, whose uncle died of COVID in a nursing home, says that Cuomo officials should go to jail, in part saying -- quote -- \"Today's news is further confirmation of the insidious and ugly truth that Andrew Cuomo took millions of dollars from Crown Publishing to write a book in the middle of the pandemic, while families buried their loved ones.\" The governor's office says that just over $1 million of the book money is going in trust to Cuomo's three daughters and that he is also donating half-a-million to United Way for COVID relief.

Imagine how the trauma that they're experiencing, having to be on lockdown for illegal immigrants coming in and trying to get into their fence line? That's ridiculous."

Welcome to all of you, and good to see all of you. A nice healthy debate we have set up here."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROB SMITH, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's clear evidence of this. And we're seeing right now, look, independents are more negative about the future. We're seeing flat spending, a jobs report that was nearly 750,000 under expectations, and inflation that is here. The cost of living has jumped over 4 percent from last year, which is the biggest increase in 13 years. So, we are seeing all of the evidence right now that what the left is doing, in terms of all of this radical spending, is not working. And you have some governors even saying that we're going to turn down this extra $300 in weekly extended unemployment benefits, because it's so hard for us to get people back to work. So we're seeing all of the results of this reckless spending happening all around us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, you can see on the screen many of your food prices are going up. But, Jessica, something we talk about almost every day is the price of gasoline going up. And that affects everyday hardworking Americans. So why is this administration not acknowledging inflation is a real problem?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Well, there definitely acknowledging it. And, obviously, we have heard kind of both sides of the coin from Janet Yellen, saying it was going to be a little bit of a problem, might raise interest rates, now backtracking on that. But I think the important element of this to discuss is what's gone on for the last year-plus. We have supply chain problems, because the entire country was shut down because of a global health pandemic that's taken millions of lives and 570,000 American lives, I think is the latest count. That's obviously going to have an effect on the economy. In terms of the spending and how reckless it is, Joe Biden has only gotten one of his plans through so far. So, people are trying -- this is what the American Jobs plan caused, et cetera, et cetera. So far, we have had a COVID relief package that was approved of by more than 70 percent of Americans. You had no Republicans vote for that kind of relief, which they so desperately need."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "And I'm not saying to not pay attention to these indicators, that there is an issue. We need to continue to do that. But Americans did need that infusion. And I don't think we have seen the long-term inflation problems for a while or enough to say we have got to change course at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Let me get Liz in there. Liz?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's wrong. I think, as we entered this year, we'd already spent or were in the process of spending $3 trillion on relief. Consumer incomes went up 10 percent in the first quarter. It's not just spending. It's also the Fed, which continues to pump $120 billion into the economy every month. Something has to change, Sandra. And what it has to -- I think the Fed has to get away from this quantitative easing. And I think the federal government needs to stop spending so much money. What we absolutely know is, we don't need an extra $4 trillion that Biden wants to push through. That would be reckless. And I think that would just contribute to the problems we have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Rob, free money has been out there for a long time. And if you continue that, along with this spending spree, how can the price of everything not continue to go up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "R. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, no, it will continue to go up. And, also, a lot of these businesses and restaurants and stuff like that are going to have problems attracting employees, because, if there's so much free money out there, why would people go out to work, when they can actually get more to stay home? So I understand we can all have this conversation. I think the Biden administration is going to do what they want to do. Mind you, in the words of Chuck Schumer and a lot of people on the left, they have taken this COVID pandemic, and they have taken the reins of the presidency, and they want to radically transform America. This is what they have said, and they will spend untold amounts of money to do this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "In fact, I wasn't even referencing the stimulus checks, and now the child tax credit checks that are about to start going out in July."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "R. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "I was referencing the free money environment as far as the low interest rate environment that we have been in..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "R. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Oh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "... while all this is happening, Jessica. Isn't that a recipe for higher prices across the board, whether it's food, energy or housing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "It looks that way, certainly, in the short term. And I do believe that the Biden administration, in conjunction with the Fed, is going to work very hard to address this. We certainly don't want to lose economic gains that we have had. And, as Rob referenced when he originally spoke, we want consumer optimism to go back up. We certainly need retail spending to go up. That was something that we saw a downturn on last quarter. We shouldn't have. And, obviously, the jobs report was extremely disappointing. And it wasn't because Easter was in the wrong month this year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "So we have got to be paying attention to this."

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "But I don't think you can ignore supply chain problems after a year of shutdown, that being a build motivating cause."

    {
      "speaker": "S. SMITH",
      "utterance": "Anybody who is trying to remodel their house or build a house right now, you know the price of construction is skyrocketing. Lumber prices have tripled during the pandemic. Liz, final shot at it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PEEK",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the biggest problem is, the Biden administration could make this inflation surge permanent by creating a surge in wage increases."
