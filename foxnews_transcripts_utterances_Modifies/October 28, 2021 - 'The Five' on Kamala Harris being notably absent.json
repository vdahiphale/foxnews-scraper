Liberal woke education policies facing a huge referendum with the dead heat Virginia governor's race becoming the epicenter of what is a massive national plight. President Biden campaigning in Virginia tonight after being accused of using the DOJ to silence parents as the controversies in that state pile up. Students in Loudoun County staging a walk out today. It's over an alleged sexual assault at the school board is being accused of covering up. After a judge found a boy who was reportedly wearing a skirt guilty on Monday of sexually assaulting a girl in the girl's bathroom. Parents in that same county reportedly being forced to sign NDA style forms in order to view the district's critical race theory inspired curriculum. Former President Obama is dismissing the concerns of parents as \"fake outrage.\" And then there is the Democrat in this Virginia race, Terry McAuliffe, who has said parents should not be telling schools what they should teach. And this clip from 2019 is getting a lot of attention.",

So, then now they have to actually defend an issue on the merits. When you have an education issue, it can also be very bipartisan or more importantly, you can swing independents. And if you look at President Biden's numbers with independents, that cratering. And they're not going to get the Republicans, I get that. They've lost some Democrats, but independents help them get elected especially in those northern Virginia suburbs. The other things is, tonight in Loudoun County, there is a school board meeting, set on the agenda, they set aside time to discuss pickle ball implementation.",

I do think that people have already voted in some ways because that most important county, Fairfax County, you have all these people that want to live there because it has the best schools -- 10,000 students fewer than they had before 2019. So it's not just about critical race theory. It is about the fact that these schools shut down in 2019 or 2020 during the pandemic. And even when given all the money and all the information and all the science, the teachers union refused to open back up. And I think that's why a lot of people left. And so that's one of the reasons this issue, I think, surprised the Democrats. But what I think might surprise them unless they wise up, is that this is not just a Virginia issue.",

A young girl is raped by a boy, Forget even the part about the skirt, right? This is after the boy had assaulted somebody else. Adults knew about this. When you think about how horrible this is, it should be a national story because it's bloody insane. This kid rapes somebody in the school, then raped another person wearing a skirt. But, it's not a story. In fact, you couldn't find it anywhere. It made me doubt whether this story was real. So, I was reluctant to even touch this thing because it was like it was the third rail. You don't want a Jussie Smollett, right? You don't want a Covington kid. Why is nobody talking about this crime? Now, we know that it's true. The rapist has pled guilty. And no one would have known about this if it wasn't for the dad's -- the dad of the victim being arrested and humiliated and called a domestic terrorist by the school board. This is an indictment of the corporate press. If it was not for the \"Daily Wire,\" if for what happened to that man, no one would know about this. They covered this thing up for the sake of an election. I'm trying to think about why you would cover up a sensational story like this. A story of a double rapist. A young girl raped in her school by a guy who might have been using a skirt as a ruse. That is a huge, huge story! So it had to be covered up for the sake of the election or because there was some sympathy towards the suspect and some antipathy towards the victims. That's a possibility. But if you vote for Terry McAuliffe, you are voting for the same corrupt system that condoned a rape because the suspect may have worn a skirt? Who knows?

And there's a bunch of parents just watching the game, just minding their own business -- taxpayers, I remind you. And all of a sudden, I hear this commotion in the parking lot which is only like 15 yards away. A woman says, he's writing us tickets. He's writing this all tickets. It turns out some guy on the sly working for the Huntington Department of Public Safety just secretly started ticketing dozens of parents as they were watching this game. He didn't say, hey guys, you might want to move your cars, some voters might want to come through the parking lot. No, no, no, just on the sly, slapping $100 tickets on people. I go up to the guy, confronted him. I got his name. I'm not going to say his name on the air but I got his name and his badge number. I know his boss. I know his boss' boss. So, the question we posed to the audience. Go to our Instagram page and vote. Is it OK to give parking tickets en mass without a warning? Who does he really work for? He works for us, right?

Students in Loudoun County staging a walk out today. It's over an alleged sexual assault at the school board is being accused of covering up. After a judge found a boy who was reportedly wearing a skirt guilty on Monday of sexually assaulting a girl in the girl's bathroom. Parents in that same county reportedly being forced to sign NDA style forms in order to view the district's critical race theory inspired curriculum. Former President Obama is dismissing the concerns of parents as \"fake outrage.\" And then there is the Democrat in this Virginia race, Terry McAuliffe, who has said parents should not be telling schools what they should teach.

I do think that people have already voted in some ways because that most important county, Fairfax County, you have all these people that want to live there because it has the best schools -- 10,000 students fewer than they had before 2019. So it's not just about critical race theory. It is about the fact that these schools shut down in 2019 or 2020 during the pandemic. And even when given all the money and all the information and all the science, the teachers union refused to open back up. And I think that's why a lot of people left.

A young girl is raped by a boy, Forget even the part about the skirt, right? This is after the boy had assaulted somebody else. Adults knew about this. When you think about how horrible this is, it should be a national story because it's bloody insane. This kid rapes somebody in the school, then raped another person wearing a skirt. But, it's not a story. In fact, you couldn't find it anywhere. It made me doubt whether this story was real. So, I was reluctant to even touch this thing because it was like it was the third rail. You don't want a Jussie Smollett, right? You don't want a Covington kid. Why is nobody talking about this crime? Now, we know that it's true. The rapist has pled guilty. And no one would have known about this if it wasn't for the dad's -- the dad of the victim being arrested and humiliated and called a domestic terrorist by the school board. This is an indictment of the corporate press. If it was not for the \"Daily Wire,\" if for what happened to that man, no one would know about this. They covered this thing up for the sake of an election. I'm trying to think about why you would cover up a sensational story like this. A story of a double rapist. A young girl raped in her school by a guy who might have been using a skirt as a ruse. That is a huge, huge story! So it had to be covered up for the sake of the election or because there was some sympathy towards the suspect and some antipathy towards the victims. That's a possibility. But if you vote for Terry McAuliffe, you are voting for the same corrupt system that condoned a rape because the suspect may have worn a skirt? Who knows? But if you vote for Terry McAuliffe, you are voting for rape."

If this is going to be the issue that you guys want to run on in 2022, I think Republicans would absolutely love that.

So, I'm -- over the weekend, I'm in Huntington, Long Island, and I'm watching my daughter's flag football game. And there's a bunch of parents just watching the game, just minding their own business -- taxpayers, I remind you. And all of a sudden, I hear this commotion in the parking lot which is only like 15 yards away. A woman says, he's writing us tickets. He's writing this all tickets. It turns out some guy on the sly working for the Huntington Department of Public Safety just secretly started ticketing dozens of parents as they were watching this game. He didn't say, hey guys, you might want to move your cars, some voters might want to come through the parking lot. No, no, no, just on the sly, slapping $100 tickets on people. I go up to the guy, confronted him. I got his name. I'm not going to say his name on the air but I got his name and his badge number. I know his boss. I know his boss' boss. So, the question we posed to the audience. Go to our Instagram page and vote. Is it OK to give parking tickets en mass without a warning? Who does he really work for? He works for us, right? He could have just said, hey guys, can you move your cars? There were no lines there, there was nothing to show that you can't park there."
