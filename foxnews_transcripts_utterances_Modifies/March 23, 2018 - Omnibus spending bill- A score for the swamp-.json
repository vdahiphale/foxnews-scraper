Lots of breaking news including just a few moments ago the president issues an order banning most transgender troops from serving in the military. We're going to explain why the president is taking this stand coming up. Also, a new study claiming that the border patrol agents don't really want a wall. What? Well, you can understand once we tell how is behind this report.  Plus, the profanity laced interview from one of the organizers of tomorrow's gun control march. You won't believe that.  And Roseanne floors Jimmy Kimmel with a stinging rebuke over Trump on Kimmel's own show and Rosie O'Donnell has painted herself into a corner that will be fun on a Friday follies.  But, first, we begin with the monstrosity that is the omnibus bill now signed into law score one big one for the swamp. President Trump said he was very disappointed with the bloated $1.3 trillion spending package. He even threatened this morning, getting our hopes up that he was going to veto it because it failed to fund the border wall. It did nothing to address DACA. Still, in the end, he signed the bill.",

It pains me to say this, the president did have a choice.

You know you need nine votes in the senate. That's the huge obstacle. We did a budget. The Senate wouldn't do a budget. The Democrats want increased spending on everything. That's a given, right? So, the president and leadership need to go to the American people at the beginning of the cycle and say, OK, we are going to give the Democrats this, this, and this, but we are going to hold strong on this.  If you shut down, it's on the Democrats. So, we didn't go through that and then I'm on the budget committee. A month ago, when we did the budget, this was the spending bill. Back in the budget the Senate actually wrote in the budget that they will not do a budget for the year coming up in 19.  They don't even want to do a budget because they don't want to have a tough vote. So today that made news. Rush Limbaugh covered it and Sean Hannity covered it and so President Trump can go to the Senate tomorrow and we can still get it right in this year's budget. If you don't do a budget, you don't get to do reconciliation. That's a big fancy word, but that's how we were going to get rid of Obamacare until the Senate yanked that one and they owe us.

So, it's like ground hog's day. Whenever you are running up to the date, you know it's going to be a disaster. That's your big hint, right? Why can't you rationally plan to budget ahead of time? You know you need nine votes in the senate. That's the huge obstacle. We did a budget. The Senate wouldn't do a budget. The Democrats want increased spending on everything. That's a given, right? So, the president and leadership need to go to the American people at the beginning of the cycle and say, OK, we are going to give the Democrats this, this, and this, but we are going to hold strong on this. If you shut down, it's on the Democrats. So, we didn't go through that and then I'm on the budget committee. A month ago, when we did the budget, this was the spending bill. Back in the budget the Senate actually wrote in the budget that they will not do a budget for the year coming up in 19. They don't even want to do a budget because they don't want to have a tough vote. So today that made news. Rush Limbaugh covered it and Sean Hannity covered it and so President Trump can go to the Senate tomorrow and we can still get it right in this year's budget. If you don't do a budget, you don't get to do reconciliation. That's a big fancy word, but that's how we were going to get rid of Obamacare until the Senate yanked that one and they owe us. That's how we got passed through."

Yes, you are right. This may not happen again because the Senate said we are not going to do a budget this year. God help us if we lose the House then it really won't happen again.

So, I thought that got passed and nobody saw that I thought that was probably a very good thing. But I think Republican voters have to ask themselves why they voted for a Republican House and Republican Senate and Republican president and they are still not getting what they want. So, in this 2018 election for the midterm, they should ask themselves should they be voting for Republicans or should they be voting for libertarians or should they be sending a message to Republicans and not voting at all or voting for even Democrats? That's what the Republicans should be asking themselves."

That's a false equivalency. That's what we hear every time. The Republicans rolled this president. There is no border wall. There is 33 miles of like fixing the fence and some sensors.

I think the great irony here is, you know, there are four leaders, two in the Republican and two on the Democratic side who sat in the room and did 2,000-page bill and didn't tell anybody about it and Republicans actually think they can win elections. I heard practitioners talk today that the Republicans can win elections. I agree with Democrat and Mustafa and what he said in terms of this. If you want to vote Republicans into the House or the Senate vote the right kind of Republicans, the Rand Paul kind of Republicans.

We actually have ridiculous projects that enforce other country's borders while our border will still remain porous. He could have done that. It would have been really bold, and it would have been, I guess, you know, sensational but Congressman Brat, that's how he won the election by defying the establishment, the conventional wisdom of the media. He looked right at them and said I'm calling you on your you know what and he could have done that today.

This was taken after some concerted study on the issue. The statement of the White House today is among other things the policies set forth by the secretary of defense state that transgender persons with a history of diagnosis of gender dysphoria, individuals who the policy state may require substantial medical treatment including medications and surgery are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances according to the presidential memorandum.

The primary thesis in the military is national defense. And all these we're just distracted. The Democrats aren't so hot on policy, so they do this identity stuff throughout every institution we have. FBI is blown apart top 10 people being either fired or stepping down or leaving.

The Times cited a survey put out by Senate Democrats that claimed border agents really just want more technology. The Department of Homeland Security says Democrats got it all wrong let's get to the bottom of this with the president of the national Border Patrol Counsel Brandon Judd and Laredo, Texas representative of that council, Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza. Gentlemen, great to see both of you. Brandon, let start with you on this. I saw this and I have known you guys for so long. I have been friends with so many on the border patrol in 1996 when I first started in the media. When I saw this, I thought this doesn't each pass the straight face test in any way, shape or form.

And we have got to investigate this and get to the bottom. Because I can tell you I just finished my shift a couple hours ago patrolling the border.

So, now we've called for wall in the Laredo sector because just in the sector across the border we have the dangerous drug cartel. They are very dangerous. They bring a lot of drugs into our country and also smuggle a lot of people into the United States. We definitely need a physical barrier that will save American lives."

There is like 640 million for a variety of things and maybe 33 miles or -- different reports. I think it's 33 miles for reinforced double fencing and some levee walls that are already there, but this is no new construction. Brandon, I'm hearing you guys. You guys are on the front line, the cartels are coming. We have the human trafficking. People just trying to cross because they want to work here.

It's all repairing the fencing that exists and the levee walls that are already there and some of them crumbling. But, can you -- can you shed any light on that for me?

It's no secret our border patrol agents have actually reached out to president Trump through the national border patrol counsel and we told them we wanted a wall. The president has done the same thing. He has spoken to our agents directly. The agents have told him President Trump we need a wall to secure the border.

We can't let politics get in the way of our efforts to strengthen border security and protect our country.\" She said that also Paul Ryan has been very chipper about the idea of all these sensors and the drones and the other things necessary to enforce the border.

Obviously you don't want a wall because if you get the wall you aren't going to be selling drones. If people aren't crossing the border illegally no need to buy drones.

Let's discuss what's really going on here with the editor-in-chief of Campus Reform Lawrence Jones and Jitu Brown, national director of the Journey for Justice Alliance. And Jitu will be out there encouraging the students. People are very stoked and very excited about what's going to happen tomorrow all across the country. So that's a good thing.

Now, it's fishing nets and all this junk. It's one of the many massive floating islands of all this junk that is floating all around the earth, right? This one contains 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic according to the new expert estimates. They did an aerial survey. Well, 1.8 trillion, that's a number that's crazy big. It's too big for us to wrap our minds around. It does all this damage to the environment. We know that, sucking all the oxygen up, doing damage to wildlife, water supply, food supply. And 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic. Well, going back to how we started the show tonight with a $1.3 trillion GOP spending bill, the Democrats are positively giddy over, $1.3 trillion. The figure that's so unfathomably large that many of us -- many people, not me, they throw their hands up and they just look the other way because it's just -- it's a problem. It's such a big problem, we can't deal with it. Just like these massive floating piles of garbage. I know it seems like a weird analogy, but I'm telling you it's so big you don't want to deal with it. But I'm here tonight to tell you there is no problem too big for Americans not to fix, or at least to try to fix. That is not the attitude, this giving up attitude about any problem that we have. That's not the attitude that made us the most prosperous and most powerful nation on earth. We can fix it, we can be honest about it. We can deal with it and get all of our innovation and our ingenuity focused on it. We don't have to become a disposable society and throw everything away in the meantime. No, not our kids' future with this ridiculous budget, and not with the waste and mess that we see all over the environment. We don't have to do that anymore. It's not what made us great. When we come back, we'll close it out. Stay there."
