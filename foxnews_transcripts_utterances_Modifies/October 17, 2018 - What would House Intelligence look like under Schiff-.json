Herman Cain is to here to react, you don't want to miss it. He's in studio. It's going to be fantastic. Plus, why is this man still being given a platform? Well, Dan Bongino will react to the latest anti-Semitic slur from the Nation of Isalm founder Louis Farrakhan, and why Twitter is allowing him to still use its platform.  Plus, Raymond Arroyo for \"Seen and Unseen\", he breaks down the tape from Trump's \"60 Minutes\" interview and will tell us specifically why the GOP should be paying close attention. But first, meet the chairman, that's the focus of tonight's Angle.",

But they would certainly serve the Democrats' goal of paralyzing the President and his administration in a blizzard of probes and inquiries. And my friends it won't end there.  If Peter Defazio becomes a transportation committee chairman, he's planning to do oversight of the Trump International Hotel and the government services administration, which is the agency that gave Trump a lease for the old post office building in D.C. where the hotel is.  And if money is power, Congresswoman Nita Lowey of New York is about to become the queen of the house. She could head the powerful appropriations committee in charge of spending your money. Lowey has never met a liberal social program she didn't like. And the 81-year-old Democrat would have the power to shift our spending priorities from things like defense and border security to welfare and arts programs. That will keep the economy humming.

We have banking, housing, insurance, the Federal Reserve, so, we affect your bank rates, your insurance rates. Everything we do, your 401-K, your retirement, this committee touches. And Maxine Waters, the leader of, you know, the impeach Trump movement, will chair this committee.  And I think what you will see is rates will rise for banks on insurance side and across the space. So, that's number one, but number two, I would look at Adam Schiff. I think it is so important we find out what was going on inside the FBI and the DOJ. Devin Nunes has been a dog on a bone trying to figure out who the bad actors were. Devin will lose that seat. Adam Schiff will scrap that investigation and we'll never know the partisanship and politics in the lead up to 2016 and how that transitioned into the Mueller investigation that is still going after Trump today.",

The idea of her in charge of financial services when she is someone who even came under criticism by liberal Barney Frank for her cronyism of color with the One United Bank and stimulus funny business. You talk about a culture of corruption, which of course is the name of a book I wrote in 2009.

Their court documents also noted at the time, quote, \"The government took responsible steps to investigate these serious criminal allegations, which were not so easily disprovable as the defendant suggests.\" They went on to cite Menendez's inconsistencies regarding his extensive relationship with the Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, and Melgen's proclivity for young women, which brings us to the next part of the mess. As Michelle Malkin reminds us in National Review, regardless of the prostitution charges, Menendez and Melgen have quite a history. Among the examples, Menendez flew on multiple luxury flights to the Caribbean with his wealthy donor pal Melgen on the taxpayers dime. He used his Senate influence to push a lucrative port security deal directly benefiting Melgen. And for his part Melgen was convicted of bilking sick old people on 67 counts of massive Medicare fraud totaling $90 million. The company you keep, right?

So for me, the one that I'm the most afraid of is Maxine Waters on financial services -- that's my committee. And listen, it's not a C committee, this is an A committee in the house. We have banking, housing, insurance, the Federal Reserve, so, we affect your bank rates, your insurance rates. Everything we do, your 401-K, your retirement, this committee touches. And Maxine Waters, the leader of, you know, the impeach Trump movement, will chair this committee. And I think what you will see is rates will rise for banks on insurance side and across the space. So, that's number one, but number two, I would look at Adam Schiff. I think it is so important we find out what was going on inside the FBI and the DOJ. Devin Nunes has been a dog on a bone trying to figure out who the bad actors were. Devin will lose that seat. Adam Schiff will scrap that investigation and we'll never know the partisanship and politics in the lead up to 2016 and how that transitioned into the Mueller investigation that is still going after Trump today."

And as Congressman Duffy pointed out, the idea of Maxine Waters, one of the worst and most unethical, corrupt-o-crats (ph), a Belt Way barnacle, who has squeezed so much out of her position of power for her own professional and personal benefit. The idea of her in charge of financial services when she is someone who even came under criticism by liberal Barney Frank for her cronyism of color with the One United Bank and stimulus funny business. You talk about a culture of corruption, which of course is the name of a book I wrote in 2009. And I think, it really behooves Republicans to turn that phrase and do political jujitsu so people know exactly how the swamp is going to affect them if we let this blue wave rise.

And these comments, you look back at the history here the comments have gotten a lot more outrageous. He's called Hitler a very good man. He's blamed Jews for 9/11. He has made comments about putting Jews in ovens, and he also makes broader comments just about black people, making comments like how good it is to put a brilliant mind on anything other a black body, or words to that effect."

The policy on dehumanizing language has not yet been implemented.\" That's a Buzzfeed reporter Joe Bernstein put that out.  So I guess you can compare Jews to rats and insects, and you can get it while you can, I guess. That's his point, that's what he says. Congressman, I've got to say, for everyone from Obama to the woman's march organizer, other prominent Democrats, Bill Clinton at the Aretha Franklin funeral, liberals just let them get away with this.

Bob Menendez has served -- and that is a generous description -- the people of New Jersey and Congress since 1993, For the past 12 years as one of their U.S. senators. Now he was expected to breeze to another reelection, and at one point he was beating his Republican competitor Bob Hugin by a 21-point spread in the polls. But now this race is down to 6.2 percent in the Real Clear Politics average. Sensing an opening, Hugin is out with a new ad raising questions about Menendez's unsavory past. Here is just a snippet."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Bob, remember the finger is always pointed back at you. The Washington Post fact checker quickly sprang to the Menendez's defense, giving Hugin's ad four Pinocchios. But is it completely wrong?  It's true the Obama DOJ did not bring charges against Menendez regarding underaged prostitution. Their court documents also noted at the time, quote, \"The government took responsible steps to investigate these serious criminal allegations, which were not so easily disprovable as the defendant suggests.\" They went on to cite Menendez's inconsistencies regarding his extensive relationship with the Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, and Melgen's proclivity for young women, which brings us to the next part of the mess. As Michelle Malkin reminds us in National Review, regardless of the prostitution charges, Menendez and Melgen have quite a history. Among the examples, Menendez flew on multiple luxury flights to the Caribbean with his wealthy donor pal Melgen on the taxpayers dime. He used his Senate influence to push a lucrative port security deal directly benefiting Melgen. And for his part Melgen was convicted of bilking sick old people on 67 counts of massive Medicare fraud totaling $90 million. The company you keep, right? It is important for all voters around the country to know the full story of all of these candidates. Stories media would prefer to gloss over. But we will continue to expose them in the lead up to November 6th. Up next, a big congratulations are in order. That when we come back."
