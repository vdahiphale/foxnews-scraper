The trade deficit has grown significantly despite assurances from China that we would -- we would improve this.

But there are some concerns -- and I want to ask you about those. Growth of business investment dropped from 9 percent last year to 1.4 percent now, and the manufacturing sector has contracted for the first time since 2009. Secretary Mnuchin, many financial experts say that one of the biggest headwinds that they now face as companies deciding whether to invest or investors deciding whether to put more money in the stock market, is uncertainty about administration policies and that that uncertainty is a much bigger problem than whether or not the Fed should drop interest rates 100 basis points or 1 percent.",

People are now talking about doing tax cuts and cutting regulations in Europe. So, people are looking at the Trump economic policies and wanting to replicate them, because that's the reason we have all this growth. Second issue, I'd say, is the consumer is very, very strong. We're seeing that across the board. And the third issue, I'd say, is on these other statistics, I think you've got to look at them quarterly. There's a bunch of volatility. At the end of last year, people worry about the economy slowing down based upon some numbers, and then the numbers came out in the beginning of this year, and it was clear the economy was roaring back.  And as it relates to uncertainty, there's only one area, and that's trade. We are close to having a major announcement with Japan. We expect to have USMCA passed in the next month or two. That's going to add a significant amount to U.S. growth and growth in Mexico and in Canada. We had the Korea deal done. There's three or four other major agreements that Ambassador Lighthizer is working on.

I think the yield curve reflects the fact that it anticipates the Fed is going to lower short-term rates, and the long end has already reflected that. That's the first thing. The second thing on tariffs, the reason why the president decided to delay $150 billion of tariffs was because U.S. companies had already purchased those goods for holiday in U.S. dollars, so it was a very specific situation that had nothing to do with passing on or not passing on -- those had been committed prior to the tariffs going into effect, and that's something we wanted to do as it relates to holiday.  As it relates to prices going up, going forward, we have seen China depreciate their currency. That's going to mean that a significant amount of the tariffs are paid for by China. We haven't any inflation yet. We haven't seen prices go up. We will have some exceptions for the rare circumstances where we have problems and the Ambassador Lighthizer is running that.

And I think what would be more important and what perhaps the president understands is that the achievement of a substantive trade deal with China, with the two most primary components being them buying more products from us and us enlarging our market share over there, including I.P., that is the largest indicator and that would be the largest staving off for a recession, and especially with the European and Asian markets, you know, we are not an island.

    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, he would have the authority to do that under -- if he declared an emergency. He has not done that. I think what he was saying is he's ordering companies to start looking because he wants to make sure - - to the extent we are in an extended trade war -- that companies don't have these issues and move out of China.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But there are a couple of problems here, Mr. Secretary. First of all, as you pointed out, the president has to declare a national emergency, which he hasn't. Secondly, the act only blocks American countries sending the transfer of future funds, not past investments. And also, in the past, of the last 42 years, it's only been used to stop businesses with outlaw nations or with drug dealers, not with trading partners. So, is this really a realistic option for the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, the president has lots of options. And again, our first choice is to have fair and reciprocal trade. The reason why we put on tariffs is for the last two and a half years, we've been working with China to rebalance the trading relationship and it hasn't rebalanced. The trade deficit has grown significantly despite assurances from China that we would -- we would improve this. And as you know, when we were close to a deal, the president was happy, and they backed off of that. So, the president does have lots of authorities. You know, we use these authorities successfully with Mexico on certain issues there. We now are close to hopefully having the USMCA passed. We had a terrific meeting with Canada today on this, and we're looking forward to getting that agreement passed."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Question",
      "utterance": "does the president really regard the chairman of the Federal Reserve, whom he appointed, to be an enemy of the country? And I guess a larger question, which is -- with all of these statements from the president, all of these tweets, how seriously, how literally should we take what the president says?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, let me first comment on the President Xi side of this, because I was with President Trump today and he was very clear that President Xi is still his friend, he has a very good relationship with President Xi. We worked on lots of different things together. But as it relates to financial issues and trade, you know, we have become enemies. We're not -- we're not making progress. But this was not intended to send a message that President Xi is his enemy in the sense of all these different areas. And the other thing I would say is, we are very hopeful that there will be a humane solution in Hong Kong. We are obviously watching what's going on there. The president again reiterated he thinks that President Xi sat down with the protesters. He could get this over with in a few hours. So, we're hopeful that there will be calm in Hong Kong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, let me pick up on that. If there isn't, if the Chinese were to crackdown as they did in Tiananmen Square in 1989, what impact will that have on U.S. relations with China?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Chris, I'm not going to speculate because that's not the outcome we're hoping for. The outcome we're hoping for is a peaceful outcome. I think you know there was a deal with the U.K. when Hong Kong was transferred over. We'd expect China to meet that deal. It's the -- and it's something we hope we respect -- they respect the laws and they respect what's going on there. But President Trump is hoping there will be a humane solution there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "So, you were at pains to say, well, Chairman Xi is not an enemy of the country, but you didn't say the same about Fed Chairman Powell."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I really wanted to first comment on President Xi. On Powell, I think -- I don't think it was a literal comment that he is an enemy. But, again, you know my position on the Fed is that I don't make specific comments about the Fed. I meet with Chairman Powell weekly. And as my role as treasury secretary, I don't comment specifically on the Fed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But this does bring up the bigger question, which I do want you to address, which is, you know, for Americans, whether just people, people investing, CEOs, when the president says something, how seriously, how literally should we take it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "I think, most of the time, you should take it very literally. I think sometimes he says things that are meant to be a joke. Obviously, the comment, you know, recently on the \"chosen one\", that was -- that was said tongue-in-cheek. That wasn't meant to be a serious comment. I think most people know the president is serious about China and trade. So, people should understand that. He is very determined. He's trying to correct something that's gone on for the last 20 years, but we have a very unfair trading relationship that's been a tremendous disadvantage to U.S. companies and U.S. workers. And he's working hard to rebalance that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Now, when Chairman Powell spoke at that Fed conference out in Wyoming on Friday, he said one of the greatest headwinds that he and the economy are facing are the president's trade policies. In fact, there are a number, and I think we could all agree, there are a number of signs of strength in the economy, especially jobs, especially GDP growth, at least solid signs of strength. But there are some concerns -- and I want to ask you about those. Growth of business investment dropped from 9 percent last year to 1.4 percent now, and the manufacturing sector has contracted for the first time since 2009. Secretary Mnuchin, many financial experts say that one of the biggest headwinds that they now face as companies deciding whether to invest or investors deciding whether to put more money in the stock market, is uncertainty about administration policies and that that uncertainty is a much bigger problem than whether or not the Fed should drop interest rates 100 basis points or 1 percent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Chris, let me first comment that the single biggest thing that everybody is talking about here in France is the U.S. economy. It's the bright spot of the world. We have growth. People are now talking about doing tax cuts and cutting regulations in Europe. So, people are looking at the Trump economic policies and wanting to replicate them, because that's the reason we have all this growth. Second issue, I'd say, is the consumer is very, very strong. We're seeing that across the board. And the third issue, I'd say, is on these other statistics, I think you've got to look at them quarterly. There's a bunch of volatility. At the end of last year, people worry about the economy slowing down based upon some numbers, and then the numbers came out in the beginning of this year, and it was clear the economy was roaring back. And as it relates to uncertainty, there's only one area, and that's trade. We are close to having a major announcement with Japan. We expect to have USMCA passed in the next month or two. That's going to add a significant amount to U.S. growth and growth in Mexico and in Canada. We had the Korea deal done. There's three or four other major agreements that Ambassador Lighthizer is working on. So, these trading relationships are going to add significantly to growth and we're still somewhat hopeful that China will come around and enter into a fair, good deal with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let me just push back a little bit on the idea that the only concern is trade, because the president has flipped on a few issues. For instance, tariffs and taxes in recent days. And I want to play some of his contradictory statements."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "The tariffs are not being paid for by our people. It's being paid for by China. We're doing this for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs would have an impact on U.S. customers. Payroll tax is something that we think about and a lot of people would like to see that. I'm not looking at a tax cut now. We don't need it. We have a strong economy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

I think the yield curve reflects the fact that it anticipates the Fed is going to lower short-term rates, and the long end has already reflected that. That's the first thing. The second thing on tariffs, the reason why the president decided to delay $150 billion of tariffs was because U.S. companies had already purchased those goods for holiday in U.S. dollars, so it was a very specific situation that had nothing to do with passing on or not passing on -- those had been committed prior to the tariffs going into effect, and that's something we wanted to do as it relates to holiday. As it relates to prices going up, going forward, we have seen China depreciate their currency. That's going to mean that a significant amount of the tariffs are paid for by China. We haven't any inflation yet. We haven't seen prices go up. We will have some exceptions for the rare circumstances where we have problems and the Ambassador Lighthizer is running that. So, I don't think there's any mischaracterization on the tariff issue. And I'd be happy to comment on the tax issue if you want as well."

And not an hour later is when the president tweeted that out, essentially escalating the trade war and potentially spurring the drop in interest rates. I want to point out that, you know, the market response to stability and to certainty, and that interest rates are not the only predictor of a recession, nor is it the only tool to stave it off. And I think what would be more important and what perhaps the president understands is that the achievement of a substantive trade deal with China, with the two most primary components being them buying more products from us and us enlarging our market share over there, including I.P., that is the largest indicator and that would be the largest staving off for a recession, and especially with the European and Asian markets, you know, we are not an island. We are not isolated. So, yes, our economy is robust, but there are others that are on recessions -- in recessions or on the brink of recessions, Germany included, with negative interest rates. And going back to the larger picture, the most important thing is the messaging with our trade deal. One of us cannot win. We need to save face, us and China, for there to be a global positive response."

You know, Germany is contracting. You have a lot of these countries in slow down. He wants them to spur their economies on. They see the principal problem here, globally, as the trade war and that the trade war is having negative consequences not just for China, but for people who trade with China, people who do business with China.

Then on August 20th he says he's going to lower taxes because he's concerned about what's happening, which would, of course, add even more to our debt. And then the next day he dials that back. China's watching. And I think when you look at trade negotiations with the world, and I saw this in my role as the Democratic chair in the Senate of the Joint Economic Committee, you've got to keep your promises and you've got to keep your threat.

But what a great leader does, and, you know, there's this old Ojibwe saying that, you make decisions not just for this generation but for seven generations from now. In this case, we have a president that can't even keep his decisions seven minutes from now. And so what a great leader does is rises to the challenges of our time. We know what they are.

And I think kind of to your point, Karl, the electability argument is fast becoming stale. Voters, especially Democrats, need to be inspired, and we see when they vote with her head that they essentially become catastrophic, right? We've seen that with Gore and Dukakis and Kerry. And here I think, as this campaign falters, there are others clearly waiting in the wings that can inspire. And I think that, you know, the -- the head of the Monmouth Polling Institute, which just released a poll, which still proves that he's leading in the polls in Iowa, said I have not yet met one Biden voter that in any way, shape, or form is excited about voting for him."

This trope has been used for a long time to isolate Jews is the other, people who are really self-interested or interested in Israel more so than they're interested in being American patriots.

      "utterance": "Julie, Karl talked in the first segment, when we were talking about what the president needs to get re-elected. And one of the things he talked about his Republican suburbs, college-educated women in Republican suburbs. When the president seems to stoke these divisions, whether talking about \"the squad\" or about Jews being disloyal for Baltimore Congressman Elijah Cummings, how does that play in the Republican suburbs among college- educated women? JULIE PACE, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Well, I think there are some differences in some of those things that he -- that he's saying there. And I would also throw in some -- some policy issues when you're talking about suburban voters, particularly suburban women. So when you talk about \"the squad,\" the strategy from the Trump campaign is very clear here, they want to paint the entire Democratic Party a socialist, as outside the mainstream of what we think about Democrats as. And that's in part because they want some of these Republicans, independents in the suburbs, who maybe don't like Donald Trump very much to say, all right, I don't like him, but I'm not very comfortable with is either, so I guess I'll stick with what I -- with what I know. But then underneath all of this, there are some policy issues that are really starting to worry Republicans when it comes to suburban voters. And top of the list right now is guns. I've talked to a lot of Republicans over the last couple of weeks, after these shootings who say, we have to be careful to not look as though we're doing nothing, because particularly with mother's in some of these suburban districts, they want to see some type of action. So there are a lot of different forces at play when it comes to this group of voters."

      "speaker": "PACE",

He -- he is constantly fearful of losing that group of voters. And that's the tension for him in his reelection. Is he going to -- is he going to play more to the base and risk losing those suburban voters or would his base stay with him if he -- if he actually moved in the direction of bringing some of these a lot more moderates --"
