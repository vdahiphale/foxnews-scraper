What did she do in 2019, Juan? She got bullied by AOC, she shut down the government, and then she failed to impeach the president. We're going to look back at 2019 like \"what? You did nothing.\" No NAFTA renegotiation, no drug prices, no infrastructure. What happened today? Someone overheard a phone call? So what? He eavesdropped? The president said, \"I don't give a blank about Ukraine.\" Well, neither does the country. The other one had a great accent. Why was she even there? I mean, this is the reason Trump is dual tracking diplomacy in Ukraine in the first place because of people like Fiona, because Fiona doesn't even know there was Ukraine collusion. I mean, she actually met Christopher Steele and saw the dossier before the dossier went public. I mean, the whole thing comes down to this.

They have to take time out of their work. They have to come there and be humiliated by Republicans and Democrats who just want to make speeches and be rude about them. The thing about Fiona Hill is that in her deposition, she testified that the Steele dossier was ridiculous. That might not be the word, but she said that it was discredited. The Republicans don't ask her to talk about that today in the hearing. I think on some of the cross-examination, they went after her for things that were a little bit strange. She was actually defending the president on several things. She said, for example, that too could be understood that the president would be frustrated.",

No, because they have too much emotional investment in the past. And the emotional investment here is the hatred of Trump.

She's like the real estate agent pretending to be objective when she gives you a tour of an unmitigated dump and saying, oh, it's a charming fixer upper. No, this is a dump. All right. I think that this is going to be a huge boon to Trump. We're already seeing it in the swing states, and I think they might be setting him up for a landslide.

The results so far that have come back from the public opinion surveys about how they're feeling about impeachment, both nationally and in some of the battleground states have shown that the Democrats are basically not persuading America that the president should be impeached. And I don't think that means that there's not going to be a close election, or it could mean that the president ultimately wins in a landslide. It's too early to tell.

What did she do in 2019, Juan? She got bullied by AOC, she shut down the government, and then she failed to impeach the president. We're going to look back at 2019 like \"what? You did nothing.\" No NAFTA renegotiation, no drug prices, no infrastructure. What happened today? Someone overheard a phone call? So what? He eavesdropped? The president said, \"I don't give a blank about Ukraine.\" Well, neither does the country. The other one had a great accent. Why was she even there? I mean, this is the reason Trump is dual tracking diplomacy in Ukraine in the first place because of people like Fiona, because Fiona doesn't even know there was Ukraine collusion. I mean, she actually met Christopher Steele and saw the dossier before the dossier went public. I mean, the whole thing comes down to this. Trump's vision aligns with populism, skeptical of foreign aid, and doesn't like these swampy Joe Biden type deals. So, we're looking at this. This is the best you got? Try again."

You can't say that John Bolton's a never-Trumper. You can't say that he's a Democrat. And yet he was very leery of this effect. You know, he said at one point, this is their drug deal, talking about Rudy and the gang."

He didn't want to get them into a situation where they ultimately ended up, which is testifying in front of Congress about something that they didn't really have anything to do with that they were just [unintelligible] witnesses, too, but that they have to hire lawyers. They have to take time out of their work. They have to come there and be humiliated by Republicans and Democrats who just want to make speeches and be rude about them. The thing about Fiona Hill is that in her deposition, she testified that the Steele dossier was ridiculous. That might not be the word, but she said that it was discredited. The Republicans don't ask her to talk about that today in the hearing. I think on some of the cross-examination, they went after her for things that were a little bit strange. She was actually defending the president on several things. She said, for example, that too could be understood that the president would be frustrated."

She said also that it could be understood -- she absolutely understood that the president would be very hurt and frustrated by the fact that there were all these heads of state and people in the government in Europe who were dissing him in 2015 and 2016, but that that did not affect the way that he dealt with those countries.

You can't take them seriously because this has been their narrative. It's like dating somebody new. Would you take advice from the person you just dumped? No, because they have too much emotional investment in the past. And the emotional investment here is the hatred of Trump. You think of Pelosi saying something about just recently and we showed about being nonpartisan. She's like the real estate agent pretending to be objective when she gives you a tour of an unmitigated dump and saying, oh, it's a charming fixer upper. No, this is a dump. All right. I think that this is going to be a huge boon to Trump. We're already seeing it in the swing states, and I think they might be setting him up for a landslide. It's like when you watch a running back, like Franco Harris or Earl Campbell going towards the end zone carrying seven or eight people. The resistance becomes the momentum.

But what I was doing was inheriting an existing structure and an existing process and trying to kind of put a new guard in. And it is a struggle that it's really difficult to convey, I think, the weight of that old guard and the weight of the process and how strongly, as we saw today, for example, and most especially from Dr. Hill, who says, look, this is the way that we are used to and the reason we are is because it works.

The results so far that have come back from the public opinion surveys about how they're feeling about impeachment, both nationally and in some of the battleground states have shown that the Democrats are basically not persuading America that the president should be impeached. And I don't think that means that there's not going to be a close election, or it could mean that the president ultimately wins in a landslide. It's too early to tell.

Now, I will say yes, at the debate, I thought the whole Medicare For All thing really was a moment, because you have President Obama saying we can't have revolution. We've got to have sort of incremental change. Bernie Sanders comes back and says, yeah, we've got to fix a broken, dysfunctional political system for the American people.
