But he did get in negotiations over the last 24 hours from the Democrats a pledge to negotiate on border security. But it strikes me that Nancy Pelosi had been offering that for a number of weeks. I don't know if the president got any more of a commitment from the Democrats to include funding for a border wall. But White House officials told me that there are a number of Democrats who do seem inclined to give the president some money for a border barrier, much of which would be built off of the Rio Grande, out of the floodplain, in the state of Texas.   But the president also threatening that, if the Democrats don't give him what he wants, he has got some options that he will definitely use. Listen here.",

The president also was kind of changing the sales pitch that he's got for this. He was talking about a concrete wall across the southern border. Then he was talking about a steel barrier.

He wants to try to get as much agreement as he can, because he really wants a border barrier, because if he doesn't get it, the base is going to say, well, wait a minute. You promised this all during the campaign and now you're not delivering on it.  So he's going to use now whatever sales pitch he can to try to get agreement on a border barrier.

When there is agreement here on Capitol Hill, things tend to move very quickly. So we expect the Senate to send it to the House, the House to send it to the president to sign, so that this government shutdown will end at five weeks' long, 35 days.  Then the hard work begins, three weeks to sit down and try to hammer on an agreement on border security. I have talked to numerous people on both sides of the aisle who say they are open to updating, upgrading our security at our southern border. Some will not go there for a physical barrier. Some would prefer drones and technology or manpower on the border.  It'll be interesting to see if then the president could sell that to his base as a 21st century wall. We will watch and see. Bottom line, both sides are saying all the right things at the moment, that they're willing to sit down and talk, to negotiate on going forward on border security. But three weeks is not a lot of time, when you consider weekends and lawmakers going out of town back to go visit with their constituents. So it'll be a challenge ahead in the coming three weeks.

And on that, he's -- it's not, I think, a question of intention or misunderstandings. He was asked directly by Congress, did you contact WikiLeaks? did you work through one or two other people? Did you text them? Did you e-mail them? And Mr. Stone said no, flatly no. And then Mueller has e-mails and texts that Stone was continuously sending, trying to get in touch with WikiLeaks. The second point, though, that's important to observe here is, there's there's still no evidence that Mueller has uncovered of any kind of conspiracy between Trump or the Trump campaign and with the Russians and with WikiLeaks directly. If you look at the indictment closely, it looks like Stone is just trying to get his nose in the middle of things. He's trying -- he's bothering WikiLeaks all the time, saying, please give me some information. Tell me what you have. Tell me you're going to drop something out in the public. But WikiLeaks doesn't really respond. It seems like they're keeping an arm's length. I don't think actually Stone did anything illegal, if he just told the truth to Congress.",

Under President Reagan, he served as assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs and assistant secretary for Inter-American affairs as well. Under President George W.

Elliott's passion for the rights and liberties of all peoples makes him a perfect fit and a valuable and timely addition. This week, the Venezuelan people have rejected former president Maduro's illegitimate rule. Consistent with Venezuela's constitution and with the support of the Venezuelan people and the National Assembly, Juan Guaido has declared himself the interim president of Venezuela. These are -- just the first step on Venezuela's road to liberty. Elliott will be a true asset to our mission to help the Venezuelan people fully restore democracy and prosperity to their country.

But White House officials told me that there are a number of Democrats who do seem inclined to give the president some money for a border barrier, much of which would be built off of the Rio Grande, out of the floodplain, in the state of Texas.

The president also was kind of changing the sales pitch that he's got for this. He was talking about a concrete wall across the southern border. Then he was talking about a steel barrier. Now he's changed that to a greater degree to say, well, this isn't just steel and wire. This is -- this is also electronics. This is technology. Call it a smart wall. Listen here."

He wants to try to get as much agreement as he can, because he really wants a border barrier, because if he doesn't get it, the base is going to say, well, wait a minute. You promised this all during the campaign and now you're not delivering on it. So he's going to use now whatever sales pitch he can to try to get agreement on a border barrier.

When there is agreement here on Capitol Hill, things tend to move very quickly. So we expect the Senate to send it to the House, the House to send it to the president to sign, so that this government shutdown will end at five weeks' long, 35 days. Then the hard work begins, three weeks to sit down and try to hammer on an agreement on border security. I have talked to numerous people on both sides of the aisle who say they are open to updating, upgrading our security at our southern border. Some will not go there for a physical barrier. Some would prefer drones and technology or manpower on the border. It'll be interesting to see if then the president could sell that to his base as a 21st century wall. We will watch and see. Bottom line, both sides are saying all the right things at the moment, that they're willing to sit down and talk, to negotiate on going forward on border security. But three weeks is not a lot of time, when you consider weekends and lawmakers going out of town back to go visit with their constituents. So it'll be a challenge ahead in the coming three weeks.

There are other airports also affected by the events today, including specifically Newark, Philadelphia and Boston, the impact essentially rippling through the air transport system. We are told, according to FlightAware, that the number of delays today reaching more than 14,000, also now, the number of cancellations 861 nationwide, the FAA blaming an increase in sick leave at two facilities for what took place today, those facilities located in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Washington, D.C. The FAA says those facilities are responsible for monitoring aircraft at high altitudes.

In fact, through that period, since this all started, the Dow's up north of 11 percent, same with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, all advancing on the belief that this was not the kind of noise, as painful as it was to those directly affected, including federal government workers, disruptions in air travel and all that, but that the fundamentals were sound, that this would be short-lived, and life would go on.

But, two, it's not guilty of actually conspiring with the Russians or with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks. What he's guilty of is lying to Congress. And on that, he's -- it's not, I think, a question of intention or misunderstandings. He was asked directly by Congress, did you contact WikiLeaks? did you work through one or two other people? Did you text them? Did you e-mail them? And Mr. Stone said no, flatly no. And then Mueller has e-mails and texts that Stone was continuously sending, trying to get in touch with WikiLeaks. The second point, though, that's important to observe here is, there's there's still no evidence that Mueller has uncovered of any kind of conspiracy between Trump or the Trump campaign and with the Russians and with WikiLeaks directly. If you look at the indictment closely, it looks like Stone is just trying to get his nose in the middle of things. He's trying -- he's bothering WikiLeaks all the time, saying, please give me some information. Tell me what you have. Tell me you're going to drop something out in the public. But WikiLeaks doesn't really respond. It seems like they're keeping an arm's length. I don't think actually Stone did anything illegal, if he just told the truth to Congress."

Under President Reagan, he served as assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs and assistant secretary for Inter-American affairs as well. Under President George W.

Elliott's passion for the rights and liberties of all peoples makes him a perfect fit and a valuable and timely addition. This week, the Venezuelan people have rejected former president Maduro's illegitimate rule. Consistent with Venezuela's constitution and with the support of the Venezuelan people and the National Assembly, Juan Guaido has declared himself the interim president of Venezuela. These are -- just the first step on Venezuela's road to liberty. Elliott will be a true asset to our mission to help the Venezuelan people fully restore democracy and prosperity to their country.

We have an enormous team here that's done truly remarkable work to date to get us to the point we are at today, and they've done this over certainly my eight months, but long preceding that as well. I'm incredibly proud of the work that our State Department team has done to date. Elliott will now lead our effort that relates directly to our efforts on behalf of the Venezuelan people.

He's sort of a populist opposition party leader who had declared himself the leader of the people and calling for elections in the near term. Our government recognizes him, as does Canada and most of the Western Hemisphere countries, save Mexico. But the military is remaining, at least the military generals, are remaining loyal to Nicolas Maduro. He's got the backing of Russia, China, Turkey, and Cuba as well. Our administration has said that's not going to fly. He's a dictator. He's brutal. The country is suffering. Three million have left, 10 million-plus percent inflation. It's got to go. He's got to go. Maduro himself has said all American diplomats are going to be thrown out of the country. President Trump shot back, no, they're not going anywhere.

But wages aren't going up for most people, when you add in the cost of living around them. So we want to make sure opportunity is not just on the top floor, but on the bottom floor.

So you can have a lower corporate tax rate if the employees who are -- just through their grit and hard work are delivering for the company, are guaranteed that they're going to see some of those benefits, because the last tax cut didn't make its way -- there was no guarantee it would make its way to the majority of the work force."

And what were some of the factors behind today's move? Could it have been these delays and airport problems at La Guardia and elsewhere, where a lot of people were just seeing flights grounded as they were waiting through this and just a lot of people who were showing up in fewer numbers? And that's why we had to have the delays. RealClearPolitics' A.B. Stoddard, Trump 2020 Advisory Board member Madison Gesiotto, the Democratic strategist Kristen Hawn. Kristen, ending with you.

Anything can happen in the next three weeks if he doesn't get some wall funding.

And I think that he was told by then Speaker Paul Ryan, then Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in December, you cannot shut the government down. If you do, there will be no way out. And he did it anyway. He declared on national television he was doing it and he wouldn't blame the Democrats. This was his shutdown.

Of course, this isn't, as you talked about in a previous segment, not going to be a sea-to-shining-sea wall, as many people want people to believe in the media.

The Senate has moved, and now the House will move in about the next hour-and-a-half to synch up. Then the House and Senate will be in alignment, and they can send the bill to the president for his signature. At that point, the government shutdown will in fact be over, at least until the middle of February. We asked Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader -- or the minority leader, I should say -- earlier if he thought there would be any objections. He said no. Now, here's something that's going to be key. The sidecar to this agreement deals with going to conference, a conference committee. This is where you get members from the House and the Senate together in a room. And what they're going to do is work out a -- try to work out a separate deal on border security, maybe immigration, all those types of things that have been so toxic in this discussion. One of the keys is, who do they appoint to the conference committee? Now, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, she will be key to that. And who sits on that conference committee is going to be A number one. And, two, can they get something done by the middle of February? Congress works best on deadlines.

We have also got the former Whitewater prosecutor Robert Ray, and also the attorney, the attorney who is suing the NFL over that blown call in the Rams-Saints game. Do you think he has a prayer? See what I just did there? Does he have a prayer? Two hours of that, 10:00 a.m. to noon tomorrow, all basic cable, all for you. We will see you tomorrow.
