To face charges that she paid exorbitant bribes to get her two daughters into college. This as Fox News is learning tonight the school she allegedly faked their way into could be throwing them out. Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story.”  The college admission scandal Loughlin and dozens of others were embroiled in now, serving as an indictment really on the country's entire higher ed. system. Supposing how far some may go to illegally and in many cases, legally give their kids an unfair advantage.  But some have also managed to make this an indictment of, believe it or not, President Trump. One writer for The Atlantic, essentially making the case this all happened because we have \"alleged grifter that sits in the Oval Office.\" Well, that sounds like a new form of Trump derangement syndrome.  Speaking of the president, one of his biggest critics, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's been under heavy fire for fraudulent claiming she's of Native American descent, ironically had this to say about people who commit fraud to get ahead.",

Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum and this is “The Story.” The college admission scandal Loughlin and dozens of others were embroiled in now, serving as an indictment really on the country's entire higher ed. system. Supposing how far some may go to illegally and in many cases, legally give their kids an unfair advantage. But some have also managed to make this an indictment of, believe it or not, President Trump. One writer for The Atlantic, essentially making the case this all happened because we have \"alleged grifter that sits in the Oval Office.\" Well, that sounds like a new form of Trump derangement syndrome. Speaking of the president, one of his biggest critics, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's been under heavy fire for fraudulent claiming she's of Native American descent, ironically had this to say about people who commit fraud to get ahead."

And though Boeing says they are on board with the move expressing their continued confidence in the plane's safety, noting \"we are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance, they say, of caution.\" It is seen as a rebuke to one of Washington's most powerful lobbying arms. And here now exclusively tonight is Ray LaHood. He is a longtime member -- a Republican member of Congress whom we remember who crossed the aisle to serve as transportation secretary under then-President Obama. Mr. Secretary, I appreciate you being here."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "You said you were concerned about flying one of these planes a couple of days ago and yet the FAA was still saying 24 hours ago, all was well. Why were you concerned?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAHOOD",
      "utterance": "Because while I was secretary, Ed, we had a similar situation with the Dreamliner where there are some lithium batteries in the hull of the planes and they were catching fire, and we grounded those planes. Boeing didn't like it. we put our FAA safety folks on it and the Boeing safety. They figured out what was wrong and everything turned out fine. And when you have two air crashes like this and have so many people perish, there's something wrong, Ed, and these planes need to be looked at. And I really want to congratulate President Trump. I believe this was his decision. I believe he decided that for the safety of the flying public, these planes needed to be grounded and then let the FAA safety officials and the Boeing safety officials work together to find out what's wrong. Is that technological problems, is that pilot error, is it something else, to give the flying public 100 percent assurance the planes are safe. And so congratulations President Trump and thank you for doing this."

      "speaker": "HENRY",

As you know, look, they create a lot of jobs around the country, employed a lot of people, a major manufacturer in America. We certainly applaud that. But as you know, they give out a lot of campaign money to Democrats and Republicans. They've got a big lobbying team. Were they -- is this what you think was going on? They were working behind the scenes because their stock was dropping and they didn't want to see these planes grounded."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAHOOD",
      "utterance": "You know, I don't blame it on politics, Ed. I really -- I know the people at the FAA. These are career people. They care a lot about safety. They've spent their whole lives working on safety. They care about safe aviation. And I also know the people at Boeing. Many of the people at born are people who care about safety and the last thing they want or unsafe plane."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "But sir, what changed in 24 hours is you know, 24 hours ago you were on CNBC and elsewhere saying I'm concerned. These planes should be grounded. But the FAA, the career people that you say do care about safety -- I'm not I'm not second-guessing them but I'm raising the question of why yesterday were they saying there's no basis to ground them and then suddenly today OK, there's a basis."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAHOOD",
      "utterance": "I want to give the credit to President Trump. Look, he owns -- he owns an airplane. He knows the importance of safety. If something like this were to happen with his plane -- at one time he tried to buy a bunch of planes ins and start a fleet of planes and I give him the credit on this, Ed, for recognizing that the safety of the flying public could be in jeopardy. And he didn't want that on his watch. So he make --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "And credit for that decision, you were absolutely right. But as you know, there's an Acting Administrator at the FAA tonight and he has not nominated a full-time administrator. Is that a mistake by this White House?"

      "speaker": "LAHOOD",
      "utterance": "You know, they have nominated somebody now. And actually the Acting Administrator is a career professional person --"

      "speaker": "HENRY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAHOOD",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, look, I'm glad they made the decision they did. I think people are feeling like the administration now takes safety as their highest priority and this investigation and grounding will go forward and we'll end up with the safest planes we can."

      "utterance": "We're having tremendous amounts of meth, cocaine, heroin, and ultra-lethal fentanyl. That's literally ultra-lethal, gets stronger. Illegal immigration provides a lucrative cash flow to put it mildly, to some of the most dangerous and ruthless criminal organizations on planet Earth."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "President Trump working right there to take on drug traffickers and the horrific opioid crisis on a very busy news day in Washington ahead of that crucial vote in the Senate tomorrow on his national emergency declaration. Earlier I spoke to Mercedes Schlapp, she of course is Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor for Strategic Communications."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Talk about how critical this is. When the president says it's powerful fentanyl, is 30 to 50 times more powerful than heroin."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERCEDES SCHLAPP, ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP",
      "utterance": "there's no question that watching these numbers of overdoses in our communities continue to grow, is troubling especially when you have that a small bit of fentanyl can kill so many large numbers of people. And so that is one of the reasons why the president today met with law enforcement with our Border Patrol agents, with local sheriff's and also with the Department of Defense to talk about this issue of illicit drugs and how it's starting off in Mexico coming through the border. And that not only includes at the point ports of entry but also between the ports of entry and ending up in communities like Illinois, like Alabama, all across the country, and it's at a point that we are at an emergency and as why the president continues to talk about this national emergency."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So Mercedes that sounds like a strong case. Why is it not getting through to some of your fellow Republicans? Because the way we're hearing it, it sounds like there will be enough Republican senators tomorrow to vote to disapprove of the President's declaration of a national emergency despite all of the problems you're talking about at the border and he may have to issue his first-ever veto."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Right. And I have to tell you, Ed, and the President talked about this earlier, it's about unity. I mean, the Democrats stand very united on the issue of open borders and crime while the Republicans seem to splinter off in these votes making these arguments that many legal scholars have come out and said wait a second here, the president has the authority to do this. Congress, you gave the president the authority to do this and in essence, is allowed to declare a national emergency. I mean, we saw --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So on that point though -- pardon me, but our viewers get frustrated because they hear all these cases you're making, the President makes almost every day on Twitter in his public remarks and yet you had the White House, the House, and the Senate for two years not as much of the wall as the president has wanted got built. Now he declares this national emergency and it appears that despite the arguments you're making, enough Republicans are going to buck him on this that he's going to have to veto."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, the president will veto it. I mean, it is clear that the president has made his case to declare this national emergency. It's been done 60 times before by former presidents unless important issues. Because what we're seeing right now is this emergency happening where in essence our Border Patrol agents are spending more time processing illegal aliens than they are focused on border security, on monitoring what's happening on the border."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Real quick, I want to ask you about what went into the President's decision in that conversation with the head of Boeing today, the telephone call to ground all these planes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, the President's consultation with Secretary Elaine Chao and our acting FAA Administrator made these decisions to ground the planes. This is based on new evidence, this is based on new information that we received. And so the president said let's ground them. This is pending further investigation. And again, our focus is obviously this new data has come in. This data has been shared with other nations also we've been in contact with in these discussions. And we also have an FAA team down in Ethiopia to help with the investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "very last question. Paul Manafort today faced his second sentencing in just a matter of days. It appeared to be the second straight time that it's a pretty light sentence. And for the second time a federal judge said basically there has not been proof of collusion. In this case, it was not -- charges of collusion we're not even brought. It wasn't tested in the courtroom. But does the White House see that as a victory?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "You know, I think at this point it's what the President has said all along. There has been no wrongdoing. There has been no collusion. The original intent of the special counsel was that of focusing on collusion. What they ended up doing is you know, going after the member of the campaign and obviously, now he's going to jail for his actions on tax fraud and bank fraud etcetera, but it has nothing to do with the President."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "But is there embarrassment at the White House? Is there embarrassment? The President said he's a good man last week and all of that. This is somebody who's going away to jail for all of this fraud. I know it's not directly related to campaign but he was the President's chair. He was a campaign chair."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Well, again, I think the President feels bad for Paul Manafort. He said that earlier today. You know, at the end of the day, it's not connected with the president. And again, it further proves there's no wrongdoing and no collusion."

He has been leading the effort on impeachment, Maxine Waters, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. They grab the headlines they get the attention on cable news. But this majority for Democrats was one in some of these Trump districts where they got to be a lot more careful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN SWAN, POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's exactly the point. And so, we -- while it's a really interesting Democratic Party, you have the people who run leadership getting far less media attention than three or four very, very progressive numbers including a set of three freshmen, AOC, Omar, and Tlaib. But you have almost two dozen new freshmen House Democrats who won in districts that President trump won in 2016. You don't see so much of them, because frankly, for the last few weeks, a lot of them are feeling very uneasy about the early days of this new House majority. It's been a very distracted majority. Last week they are supposed to be spending the week talking about this big sweeping anticorruption bill, instead the week was sort of anti-Semitism week discussing Representative Omar --"

If one or two, especially if any of the Jewish Democrats had pulled away, we would have gone ballistic here. I mean, we would have talked about the division in the Democratic ranks. Right now, you have Pelosi, her number two Steny Hoyer, number three Jim Clyburn all saying the same thing, singing from the same hymnal."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

So, the Democratic leadership is in touch not only with those moderate Democrats from districts that Trump won, but in touch with the American people this juncture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Exactly. That is where the problem is. And obviously, Juan is exactly right. The leadership is in lockstep with one another about seeing what a disaster it would be to pursue impeachment. But what Nancy Pelosi says Trump is not just worth it. Are you kidding me? After two years of everything that we've been told. It is not that Trump isn't worth it. It's that they've been lying all this time, and all of the stuff that they've been ginning up they've been lying to their own supporters about Trump and Russia and Putin and somebody being somebody's puppets and all this nonsense. We spent $25 million in this political investigation trying to get to the bottom of this and we're basically finding out what most normal people sort of assumed at the beginning which is that this is nonsense. And, yes, the leadership is in step with one another."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWAN",
      "utterance": "Well, where we are, is Paul Manafort was convicted of a number of crimes including money laundering, bank fraud, now not disclosing his foreign lobbying. And yes, you're right, the sentence is fairly light. But it's not an aberrant sentence. I mean, white-collar criminals get light sentences in this country. And actually, one of the failures of the Obama Justice Department and they admit this, was not going after, not prosecuting white-collar criminals, no one went to jail after the financial crisis. And this is a continuation of a trend. So, actually, Manafort is doing worse than a lot of white-collar criminals in this country have done. They have gotten off with far lighter sentences than Paul Manafort."

But look, the bottom line is, you know, and I think it's great to go after these white-collar criminals and throw them in jail for tax evasion or whatever.

I know what it's like to have to follow a law that you find personally repellent because you're took an oath to uphold the law. You know, this is an area, I'm smiling because you probably don't know what I'm about to say, where progressives and libertarians agree. I condemn the death penalty. So, I rejoice. Probably the only time I've only agreed with Gavin Newson on anything. I rejoice in this as well. I know the president - - the president is fuming --"

I want to be clear that Fox News has not been able to independently confirm that report. But while we await the news, let's bring on our old friend, Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff to President George W. Bush and Fox News contributor down there in Texas. Good to see you, Karl."

That \"Man, I'm just born to be in it\" said by Robert Francis O'Rourke. I mean, talk about a guy, the guy served a couple terms on the city council of El Paso and three unmemorable terms in the U.S. Congress, but man, I've just been born to be in it. It's pretty extraordinary article. I thought a very revealing, some of it good, some of it not so good. But I thought it was an interesting article. Starting with a fact that he said, you know, \"I don't ever prepare a speech,\" which is probably why he went out and said things I can't think of anything more American than taking a knee, and law enforcement is the new Jim Crow-ism. And in June of 1929 -- 2018, he endorsed impeaching President Trump. I mean, this is a guy who just sort of says what he's got in his brain at that moment --"

And look, you know, go interview people in El Paso and see if they want to have the fence taken down so that people can walk out of a neighborhood in Mexico, walk -- weighed across a 2-foot deep Rio Grande river and walk into a U.S. neighborhood and not have to go through a border crossing. You know, that is just absolutely nutty. But that's the way the guy he is. Is he just sort of whatever he's thinking? Look, he went around in 2017 in 2018 and visited every one of the state, 254 counties. Now he's not the first candidate to do that but he's the first candidate to go to those counties and dropped the f-bomb routinely in speeches in front of people who generally not only are active Democrats but go to the first church of Jacksonville on Sunday or the first Baptist church of Friona on Sunday. I mean, it just, it was really remarkable."

You see him there on the cover of Time man of the year. Now maybe Beto O'Rourke is trying to play to millennials and have this rugged look but on the cover of a magazine that is you say, Karl, has a Vanity in the title, I guess it sort jumps out of me, nothing screams middle America, forgotten man than the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, a New York magazine."

And then Columbia, and then sort of went out and did a grunge band while he was trying to find himself. So, you know, and again, a lackluster career. Having said that, the article has four or five points that I think indicate that he is a smart operator. For example, he said you can hide who you are.

We've laid out some of the problems he faced, you also mentioned in fairness some of the good things, the charisma, maybe the connection, the money raising. But what about Joe Biden? Because I find it striking that Beto after saying I'm not running appears to be getting in before the former vice president and, by the way, some Obama veterans like David Plouffe and Paul (Inaudible) and others operatives seem to be on board with Beto and not waiting for the former vice president. What does that tell us?"

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not certain it says anything about Biden per se. Biden doesn't need to get in early but he gets to when he gets in and I suspect he will get in, he needs to get in strong with no early mistakes. Because look, everybody knows who he is. In the 30 polls that have been run since January, in both national polls and state polls, he's been behind in one, New Hampshire. And tied one in New Hampshire --"
