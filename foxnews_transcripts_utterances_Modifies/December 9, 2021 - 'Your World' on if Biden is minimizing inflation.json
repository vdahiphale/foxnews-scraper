District attorneys accused of going easy on crime are coming under increasing fire, including in Los Angeles.  But in the case of L.A. DA George Gascon, he is not running from. He's celebrating it.

And Chicago is working this with the state alone. Zero new fed help.\" Now, the White House says that is not true. The FBI is assisting a multijurisdictional task force to go after criminal groups in Los Angeles that are behind many of the incidents there.   But they also said: \"President Biden agrees that we need to crack down on the surge in crime we have seen over the last two years, which is exactly why he's fighting for more federal support for community policing, and why the Department of Justice is working closely with state and local partners to address the disturbing state of retail thefts we have seen in recent weeks. That's also why the president delivered historic levels of funding for anti-crime measures through his Rescue Plan.\"  The White House outlined a number of instances, localities where cities have used those COVID relief funds to hire more police officers, for instance, Walnut Creek in California, Louisville, Kentucky, in Kansas City, Missouri.

It the most homicides we have had in the last 25 years.  And I heard George Gascon yesterday at his press conference talking about the suspect that killed Jacqueline Avant. And what he said was that the criminal justice system failed him, the suspect, that he should have been involved in more programs each time he got arrested. That's insane. I mean, I don't think any program is going to help anybody like Jeffrey Dahmer or a Richard Ramirez. There's just evil that exists in the world. And people need to realize that. And that evil needs to be locked up.  We had a 12-year-old boy that was shot down just the other day. His mother was also shot. And a 9-year-old girl was shot in the back in the playground. One minute this poor kid is excited about Christmas, and his mom's planning on what to buy him, and now she's planning his funeral.  That's what's going on, you know?  And when I see that this soft-on-crime approach that George Gascon and also another soft-on-crime district attorney up north in San Francisco, crime in both cities are just crazy. It's like living in the movie \"Purge.\" Every day is -- crime is just running rampant. Nobody cares. The officers are doing their job. We constantly arrest people, we put them in jail.

And that encouraged people to seal up to $2,000 and then some of goods. And it's accelerated beyond just simple burglaries to homicides and the like that are now again at multiyear records.

Bob Dole was a partisan Republican, a conservative Republican, but he had the capability because of, in my view, two things, his experience in the U.S. Army and his recovery from the grievous injuries that he received, and that small-town roots.

And what he said was that the criminal justice system failed him, the suspect, that he should have been involved in more programs each time he got arrested. That's insane. I mean, I don't think any program is going to help anybody like Jeffrey Dahmer or a Richard Ramirez. There's just evil that exists in the world. And people need to realize that. And that evil needs to be locked up. We had a 12-year-old boy that was shot down just the other day. His mother was also shot. And a 9-year-old girl was shot in the back in the playground. One minute this poor kid is excited about Christmas, and his mom's planning on what to buy him, and now she's planning his funeral. That's what's going on, you know? And when I see that this soft-on-crime approach that George Gascon and also another soft-on-crime district attorney up north in San Francisco, crime in both cities are just crazy. It's like living in the movie \"Purge.\" Every day is -- crime is just running rampant. Nobody cares. The officers are doing their job. We constantly arrest people, we put them in jail.

And that encouraged people to seal up to $2,000 and then some of goods. And it's accelerated beyond just simple burglaries to homicides and the like that are now again at multiyear records. So when I heard Mr. Gascon talk about some crimes are going down, what is he talking about?

So, crimes -- you can't say that robberies are down, yet murders are up. It doesn't happen. If there's violence when there's murders, there's going to be violence when there's robberies.

I put him at fault as the same person that committed some of these murders, because he's letting these people out. And if I could, I would arrest him for accessory to murder, because I think he's responsible for some of these murders. Something needs to be dealt with him. He needs to be recalled.

A big report is due out tomorrow and it just could show inflation running at the highest clip in 40 years.

One of the big things contributing to this is inflation. We're waiting for the official numbers tomorrow. But it's projected that inflation could hit 6.8 percent. That would be the highest we have seen in around 40 years since Ronald Reagan days. All of that is leading to consumers changing their behaviors, including looking at stores like this one right here in Manhattan. I'm with over owner, Deb Koenigsberger. Deb, you have ran this store since 2010."

I think what's happening is that people are realizing value, that they can get better value for less money by less fast fashion, support a charity that supports a cause they believe in, and also just, like, save money. Like, buy -- you can you can buy something that's really good quality and will last you a long time without spending a lot of money. And you know it's going to last you, because it's all about money, and people having less of it. And since COVID happened in 2019, we have just seen -- I mean, it's huge. The shift is -- it's remarkable. It's remarkable, ."

People are choosing to re-donate their luxury goods here as well, because it makes them feel good, right? So everybody wants to do something that makes them feel good. But donating to us, buying from us, supporting a small business in Manhattan, a woman-owned business, a black-owned business, it's all about - - all of those things are just converging. And all of a sudden, it's like, boom, the world is taking off. And, for us, I have to say the most important things that people say to me all the time when they come in here is, they say, you have the best vibe and we love this mission. And so they go home and they clean out their closets and bring me more stuff. It's just -- it's an amazing thing. It's an amazing thing."

People have been home for a long time cleaning out their closet. That has made so much inventory available for shops like this one, inventory that I have been wearing all day long. This is my third hit of the day and my third outfit, Neil I had a different one on your business show earlier. And I think this is the final look of the day. And I think it's my favorite one also."

I know you're probably wondering, what does a guy from the prairies of South Dakota care about maritime law? But the reality is, our country exports a tremendous number of manufactured and agricultural goods. And we have had these foreign-flagged ocean carriers, many of them Chinese- owned. They have not been playing fair with American exports. And, as a result -- get this -- 60 percent of the containers they have been hauling back to Asia this year, they have been hauling back empty. That's terrible."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. No, sure. Well, it does a few things. First off, it tells these foreign-flagged ocean carriers they are not allowed to unfairly discriminate against American ag exports, or really any American cargo, and also makes it clear to these ocean carriers that they are not going to be allowed to hit American businesses with big fines and fees if those American businesses haven't done anything wrong with regard to the supply chain crunch."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, clearly, this is a bigger issue for American exports. It's about getting American exports to the rest of the world, but it would help with imports too in this way. Our bill aligns the ocean carriers' interests with the interests of American shippers, so it makes for a more efficient system. Right now, these guys are able to use these backlogs as big revenue streams for themselves. Our bill brings some sanity to this environment. It tells than that they own a lot of the responsibility to make sure that these ports run efficiently as well. When they get their act in gear, when they're hauling these containers with American goods, rather than as empties, it's going to relieve the backlog in American ports. That's going to be good for stuff coming in too."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Congressman Dusty Johnson, thank you very, very much. Fair and balanced now, the view from the Democratic side with Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, who joins us right now on whether this is going to be a perennial issue. Right now, this inflation situation has not been transitory, as you were very early to capture, Congressman, but the administration does seem to be minimizing it. Does that worry you?"

    {
      "speaker": "REP. EMANUEL CLEAVER (D-MO)",
      "utterance": "It would, but I'm not sure, Neil, that they are minimizing it. I think what is coming across for the minimization of the inflation are the statements coming out as they try to figure out what to do. And I think some of it is already working out. Gasoline prices are now falling. And where they are now, it was predicted that it wouldn't -- it would be almost another year before they would reach this level. But -- and Congressman Johnson, as for his legislation, I think a lot of things that are taking place in the aftermath of the real heavy COVID season that we had are going to -- are going to work. For example, a part of the problem is that many of the women who were in the work force are not working. And that slows down production. It slows down getting products to market, because, as you know, almost all of the employers around the country are begging for employees. We're now passing the largest expenditure of federal dollars for kindergarten that we -- and pre-K -- that's been spent in the history of the country."

      "speaker": "CLEAVER",
      "utterance": "Well, I agree with a part of what you just said. But I think it's important to note that, when these women are not going back to work now, it's because many of them stayed at home during the heavy COVID time moments that we had last year. And then, when they got ready to go back to work, many of them thought, look, I'm making $8 an hour. I'm making $11 an hour. I can't pay for child care and work at the same time. They can't -- they couldn't do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But will it really address anything about inflation, sir? I mean, I -- when I heard the administration say that this is going to really address all these issues, as you know, and you're a good student of congressional and economic history, it would be the first time ever a giant piece of legislation has actually dented inflation, quite the opposite. Most times, it increases it. So what's in this that makes that suddenly less of a problem? It seems to me to just compound it."

      "speaker": "CLEAVER",

But I also think that we may -- I was one, I said earlier, and probably on your show, that it's transitory. And that was the wrong additive. It's not transitory. I think we are trying to address it. It was brought on by COVID. And I think, when you stop COVID, you stop a lot of our problems. If we hold COVID..."

You're quite right about that, Congressman. But I guess what is noticeable here is that the administration appeared to dismiss this early on, and then say it was essentially a problem with the well-to-do whining. I'm paraphrasing here. Do you think they get it now?"

In fact, in Norway, they're limiting how many people can gather in their homes for Christmas to no more than 10 people. Now, I don't know how they count that, but it's something that we're watching very, very closely. Let's go to Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security senior scholar.

I mean, vaccines don't typically prevent the virus from entering your cells, but they train your body to respond pretty quickly, in the hopes that you don't even notice that you have been infected. And I think it's reasonable to think that a third dose offers some additional protection, but I don't want people who haven't yet gotten vaccinated, because they're like, well, it's never going to end, to take away that -- vaccines that work."

Doctor, a lot of people will look at this, though, and say, mild cases though they may be, in a weird way, this might actually help you get to that point at so-called herd immunity, where we have solved the problem without the rush to vaccines. What do you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUZZO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, it's a really hard thing to do that math. First of all, like I said, we haven't seen it really circulate in the populations that we worry most about, and our understanding of how mild it really is could change once it does circulate more broadly. The other challenge is that, the more people who get it, the simple math is such that some portion of people will wind up in the hospital. And many hospital systems can't even handle additional cases right now. So that's obviously not a great thing to count on either."

I occupy the seat that Bob Dole held in United States Senate. I sat at a desk that he sat at with his name etched in the bottom of the desk drawer. And I grew up within 15, 20, 30 miles of Bob Dole, and followed him, in a sense, to the House of Representatives in that congressional district and now to the United States Senate. And I think it was said well by Chad that -- and what Bob Dole said. The favorite title was veteran. And it was an honor to -- but pleasing, in fact, to see Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, come together and pay tribute to a legislator, to somebody who worked hard and among us. I checked before I spoke on the Senate floor earlier this week. Only eight senators who now are in the United States Senate served during Bob Dole's tenure in the United States Senate.

Bob Dole was a partisan Republican, a conservative Republican, but he had the capability because of, in my view, two things, his experience in the U.S. Army and his recovery from the grievous injuries that he received, and that small-town roots.

And your -- the challenges your community faces, you don't have the luxury, if that's what it could be called, of arguing about politics. Everything you do determines whether or not your future of the community and the people who live there is going to be in existence. And so there -- I'm a -- I'm certainly a fan of, highly respect Senator Dole. And I would attribute his military service, his injuries and his recovery and his small-town roots to the reason that he was capable of bringing people together, despite being a Republican, and a partisan Republican."

We will continue following that. Speaking of Washington and other developments, we want to pass along that an appeals court has ruled against Donald Trump's effort to shield documents from the January 6 Committee. President Trump expected to appeal that to the Supreme Court. We will keep you posted."

But what really interested us when you start going through the particulars is what's happening among Hispanic voters, who are dead even now looking at Republicans and Democrats pretty equally. And this has been a trend that's been picking up steam. Eliza Collins of The Wall Street Journal. Eliza, always great to have you. I'm thinking about, back in 2016, what was happening. It was just taking hold. More Hispanic voters were considering Republicans, picked up even more steam in 2020, now a dead-even type of a sentiment. That could change, but it's certainly a trend worth watching. What do you make of it?"

    {
      "speaker": "ELIZA COLLINS, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "It's absolutely a trend worth watching. And it's an important one in some really key races, including in the Senate. Arizona, Nevada, Florida all have competitive Senate races with large Latino populations. Hispanics were the fastest growing part of the population over the last decade, which means that they are a growing voter bloc. And Democrats for a long time have been able to sort of take them for granted. Republicans have been competing, exactly like you said, over the last half- decade. And it's really showing they're becoming swing voters. I mean, this poll shows them basically evenly split, which is not how they were just a couple of years ago."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "It absolutely could. And we're talking about some of these House races. We saw it happen in 2020 in Florida in the Miami area. There were some competitive seats, some Republicans who had held on basically in pretty blue seats, seats Hillary Clinton had won. Those, either Republicans held on or flipped Democratic seats in Miami. Two seats flipped because of Hispanic voters choosing Republicans. And our poll shows that they're talking about the economy being their most important issue. That's something right now Republicans have the edge on."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It's interesting too, Eliza -- you follow this far more closely than I -- that the border issue was thought to benefit Democrats with Hispanics and not the tough approach of Republicans. It's a bit of an oversimplification on my part. But that is not panning out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "That's absolutely not panning out. And I think Democrats are trying to figure out what to do about that. I mean, talking about the border, talking about President Trump's policies, certainly, oversimplification, but that tough approach, some of his rhetoric, Democrats felt like they had the upper hand. But what polling shows, our poll shows, and then also past polls have showed this, that immigration, the border isn't necessarily the number one issue for Hispanic voters, for some, but, for many others, it is the economy and other issues, health care, that sort of thing. So Democrats are now trying to figure out what to talk to voters about, because it's not necessarily what they have been doing."

Republicans have an edge on the generic ballot, which is basically like, if you were going to vote for a Republican or a Democrat for Congress right now, which one would you vote for? And then, on top of that, there are just a whole bunch of other things going for Republicans, redistricting, which is basically where they redraw the maps once in a decade."

      "utterance": "Neil, it's not exactly the \"Miracle on 48th Street,\" but, boy, oh, boy, it is close. It is amazing. Just hours after the original tree was set on fire, there was a massive cleanup, and now a new tree stands in its place. The homeless man who allegedly sent the blaze has been released from custody, and he has a court date next month. None of the multiple misdemeanor charges that he faces required bail. Now, this is a fire that made headlines around the world. The original tree had 10,000 ornaments and 100,000 lights. Replacing it so fast was no easy task. And, this afternoon, the focus here is on celebration. Despite temperatures just above freezing, folks here have been anxiously waiting for the tree lighting ceremony to get under way. And you can expect to see a lot of familiar faces. Abby Hornacek and Lawrence Jones, who led the original tree lighting, will return. Steve Doocy, Janice Dean, Pete Hegseth, and other FOX hosts are going to take part, also on hand, Timothy Cardinal Dolan, FOX contributor Reverend Jacques DeGraff, Rabbi Joseph Potasnik. And joining the festivities are members of the FDNY and the NYPD. And a big thanks is owed to both the cops and the firefighters who put out the blaze and kept people safe. FOX News Media and FOX Corporation are now making a $100,000 donation to the organization Answer the Call, which provides financial assistance to families of first responders killed in the line of duty. Hopefully, folks will stick around for the next few minutes, the tree lighting expected to get under way a little after 5:00. The holiday season is associated with peace, love and joy. And now, Neil, you can add to that resilience -- Neil."

It's going to take months. This just happened; 24 hours after all of it, it's a new tree, a new spirit. So, if anyone was thinking, by burning down a Christmas tree, that you would burn down our resolve to just try to get back to what the season is about and make some good out of it, then you have no idea.
