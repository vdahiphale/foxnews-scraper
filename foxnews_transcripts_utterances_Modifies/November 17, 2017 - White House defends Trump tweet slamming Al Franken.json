The answer is -- what it is, she basically saying -- I think they're sticking to their guns. They're not going to comment on it. And they don't police his twitter. He does it himself. But I don't blame the reporters for asking. What do you think?  KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: They've got to ask the question, of course. And I think the answer is kind of consistent with how they handle things. I mean, she's got to do her job, and it's got to be under the direction of the president. He really kind of speaks his own mind. His tweets speak for themselves. He tells you how feel. And yes, you can say, well, he comment on one but not on the other. So, of course, the other side is going to say this appears to be an inconsistency. But I will say this, the distinction I think with the Al Franken case, just from speaking like a prosecutor, when you look at the fact and the evidence in front of you, there is an actual photographic picture that shows what transpired. You can argue the statement. He admitted it. Apologized, essentially. So it's less of a due process issue as to exactly what happened and so many years ago, etcetera, etcetera. So I think it's more persuasive compelling evidence perhaps. Little further along in the process.",

But I don't blame the reporters for asking. What do you think? KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: They've got to ask the question, of course. And I think the answer is kind of consistent with how they handle things. I mean, she's got to do her job, and it's got to be under the direction of the president. He really kind of speaks his own mind. His tweets speak for themselves. He tells you how feel. And yes, you can say, well, he comment on one but not on the other. So, of course, the other side is going to say this appears to be an inconsistency. But I will say this, the distinction I think with the Al Franken case, just from speaking like a prosecutor, when you look at the fact and the evidence in front of you, there is an actual photographic picture that shows what transpired. You can argue the statement. He admitted it. Apologized, essentially. So it's less of a due process issue as to exactly what happened and so many years ago, etcetera, etcetera.

I remember being so upset that you couldn't see any of the Democrats, women's groups coming out to defend Monica Lewinsky. And even now, with these current allegations, like if it's a Democrat that is accused then the Republicans -- automatically believe all of those accusers. If it's a Republican that's getting accused, immediately the Democrats believe all of their accusers. But now you get to a point where Senator Gillibrand said, well, we're in a different time now.

Will other Democrats say the same thing? And as you point in the previous segment they're the party of women, then they should be taking a hard line as they believe should be taken in every circumstance, including with Al Franken, but they're not. They're saying go to the Senate Ethics Committee where our buddies and our pals will exonerate you. That's not a consequence. And so, I don't think they've truly learned the lesson.

That is the kind of burden he's going to live with for the rest of his life. Everybody say, oh, you were the president that was impeached, and why were you impeached? And it was because of a relationship in which he had power over an intern and allowed the relationship she said was consensual, but in my book I don't see how you can be consensual. Talk about a power differential. The president of the United States and an intern, it's not good. But I will say this, it seems to me that having been impeached and having taken on the bearings of the party that wants to represent the best interest of women, there is no getting away from the charge now of hypocrisy. So what you get is people like some of these Democrats saying, oh, Clinton should have resigned. Or you get writers and box in the New York Times even saying, I'm going back to look at this. I think again, in terms of the team sport aspect, they're protecting themselves against the charge of hypocrisy from Republicans.

And also because there are things like automation that are changing things. And so -- but a lower -- regardless a lower corporate tax is better for the country. The question will be who can win in the messaging war? Because Democrats are going to try to do to the Republicans' tax reform plan what Republicans did to ObamaCare. Which is to drive up the negatives of that so much, regardless of what the actual merits were. And then vice versa. So it sort of depends. But if the economy continues to do well, as it has been, and to get a boost to people and their paychecks; and the corporations see that they can plan to come back to America, I think it will be hard to say that it wasn't a success."

I mean, that's one of the platforms that he ran on. That's also supposed to be one of the big platforms for the Republican Party to be able to do this. So they're trying to do it effectively. And I think the president has an excellent point when he says that Democrats are being obstructionist. Because there's things in this that they would like. This is far -- a total, like, hand-out to the rich. It's not just trying to pull the rich up higher. This is actually trying to do comprehensive reform to be able to move forward.

New data now shows that dining among politically-divided families, those dinners were actually cut short by an average of 20 to 30 minutes just two weeks after the election.

He has been the chief of staff for George W. Bush in the post-presidency for 10 years. He is going to move on and start a new chapter with his wife and two lovely daughters and their doggie. So congratulations to you Mike, and for all you've done. Also, yesterday I was in San Antonio. And I didn't have a chance to talk to these kids, but I love this. There is a national Bible bee competition. This is a place where 360 children around the nation gather to proclaim Bible verses in an inspiring and heart-grabbing competition, sponsored by Shelby Kennedy Foundation. Shelby Kennedy died at the age of 23 from cancer. But spent her life studying the Bible. There are over $100,000 in prize money to be awarded. And it's just really cool. It's also related to a game show hosted by Kirk Cameron, who we all know. OK. So that was pretty cool. Congratulations to the kids. Kimberly."

And they made an agreement that if they survived the attack, they would contact each other every year on New Year's. They kept that promise for five decades until, sadly, James passed away. God bless him. William, who served for 20 years in the Marines, gave the eulogy at James's funeral and stood at his casket, standing guard for his fellow Marine brother. Although it was a rough assignment, the now 83-year-old was honored to fulfill his promise to James."

But now we've got a great fun story about a kid and his First Amendment rights. Jaxon Jester is a 7th grade kid who asked his parents if he could wear a shirt mocking the CNN logo as \"Fake News Network\" on a school field trip to CNN's Atlanta headquarters. His parents said yes, but the school said no. His teacher asked him to remove the T-shirt before taking the tour. The school has since apologized, and his parents say they were just allowing their son to exercise his First Amendment right. Good parents or not? Good question."
