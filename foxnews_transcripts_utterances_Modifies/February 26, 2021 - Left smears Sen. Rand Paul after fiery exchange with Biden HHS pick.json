Have critics smearing Senator Rand Paul as transphobic. Well tonight, he is here, and he'll respond. And as he struggles with English language, Joe Biden tries out French. Raymond Arroyo tells us how that went in Friday Follies, but first, locking down the next election. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.   Now under increasing pressure to justify the obscene and ongoing lockdown of the U.S. Capitol grounds, Democrats tried to paper over this week with vague warnings about terrible things that could happen at the hands of terrible people. Well, people who support Trump, of course. The acting Capitol Police Chief, in a pathetic attempt to shift blame from their inadequate preparation, claimed yesterday to have been briefed about troubling intelligence reports.",

Now, you can bet right, this is going to include systems and surveillance to monitor, track and harass law abiding Americans. Now as for their threat assessments, there is no reason those should not be made public. Now, we want to see them threats against the Capitol against members of Congress, Cabinet Secretaries. They are nothing new. They've been around since I worked in government. But by their amorphous reasoning, all of Washington, should - from now on just be a military encampment where no citizen is allowed to go without special papers, special vetting, special permission. But we all know this is a charade.   While democrats insist on serious fencing and barricades around their place of work, they are throwing open our southern border. So, any migrant, any criminal, or frankly, any terrorist who wants to illegally cross the southern border, can essentially waltz right in now. But any American who just wants to bring, you know their family to visit the Capitol or speak with his representative, is treated like a terrorist. I was thinking today that the continued lockdown of Capitol Hill is kind of like the COVID lockdowns, with the moving goalposts, lack of any real metrics and vague warnings about potential danger down the road.  Last spring, doctor's Birx and Fauci tedious refrain was 15 days to slow the curve. But now it's basically, we can't open until the virus is vanquished everywhere in the world. See the change? Now Pelosi and Schumer are doing the same thing here by keeping the fear of January 6, alive to solidify their grip on power. They are getting a big boost as well from the bootlickers in the media.",

And you know, what they are doing is, they are arresting them all over the states where they live. And then, in some cases, transporting them on mass or preparing to transport them on mass to D.C. Was very disturbing about this, just like you said in your Angle, Laura, is that there seems to be no sense of proportionality here and almost a deliberate attempt to. In fact criminalize a political act.  And in fact, some of these people who I believe engaged in non-violent protest at the Capitol are effectively being treated like political prisoners in our country. And this is the type of thing you see in other countries that our country criticizes. And you know, back in 20 years ago, I was one of the few conservatives who pointed out that the Patriot Act, could one day be weaponized against United States citizens. 20 years later, that's exactly what's happening.

And so, any tactic that is used against those who engaged in violence, not protest, but engaged in violence at the Capitol, are those same tactics also being used against those who engaged in violence in the summer riots and the Portland riots, and the nightly Seattle riots. The people who tried to take over a federal courthouse in Portland, are we going in as the FBI season, their social media using facial identification? I hope so. If you commit violence against the United States, you should be subject to the law. If you are a peaceful protester, you should not be, but the aggressiveness used against the Capitol protesters, which I salute and in for - I'm sorry, the prop Capitol rioters needs to also be used against rioters on the other side.

That means a homeless child who's either had a rotten childhood or no parents or has a mental illness themselves. She is willing to do the sex change even quicker. They did a survey of these sex change surgeons, over half of them have operated on people under 18. So, this is not a wild question. This is a real question. And they are giving these hormones that change the sex, testosterone to girls and estrogen to boys between the ages of 14 and 16. That's a really - it's a crime against nature.

Raymond Arroyo tells us how that went in Friday Follies, but first, locking down the next election. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Now under increasing pressure to justify the obscene and ongoing lockdown of the U.S. Capitol grounds, Democrats tried to paper over this week with vague warnings about terrible things that could happen at the hands of terrible people. Well, people who support Trump, of course. The acting Capitol Police Chief, in a pathetic attempt to shift blame from their inadequate preparation, claimed yesterday to have been briefed about troubling intelligence reports."

Now as for their threat assessments, there is no reason those should not be made public. Now, we want to see them threats against the Capitol against members of Congress, Cabinet Secretaries. They are nothing new. They've been around since I worked in government. But by their amorphous reasoning, all of Washington, should - from now on just be a military encampment where no citizen is allowed to go without special papers, special vetting, special permission. But we all know this is a charade. While democrats insist on serious fencing and barricades around their place of work, they are throwing open our southern border. So, any migrant, any criminal, or frankly, any terrorist who wants to illegally cross the southern border, can essentially waltz right in now. But any American who just wants to bring, you know their family to visit the Capitol or speak with his representative, is treated like a terrorist. I was thinking today that the continued lockdown of Capitol Hill is kind of like the COVID lockdowns, with the moving goalposts, lack of any real metrics and vague warnings about potential danger down the road. Last spring, doctor's Birx and Fauci tedious refrain was 15 days to slow the curve. But now it's basically, we can't open until the virus is vanquished everywhere in the world. See the change? Now Pelosi and Schumer are doing the same thing here by keeping the fear of January 6, alive to solidify their grip on power. They are getting a big boost as well from the bootlickers in the media."

In the run up to Biden's inauguration, for example, the FBI privately warned law enforcement agencies that far-right extremists had discuss posing as National Guard members in Washington. Officials took aggressive measures to secure the Capitol, and ultimately the day passed without incident.\" All right. Occasionally, the truth comes out of the post. Now again, if the Democrats really cared about our security, really cared about it, they would not be trying to dismantle ice and pause deportations for months on end.

Harmeet, I know you've spoken to conservatives from all across the country who attended the Trump rally on January 6, they didn't storm the Capitol. But those people who are peacefully assembling in Washington, is it true that they're now dealing with FBI raids being, in some cases being blocked from talking to counsel, if they're detained? What's going on here?"

I've probably spoken to dozens of people who have reached out or their family members who have reached out about FBI questioning, FBI dawn raids as if they are a terrorist, FBI seizing their digital records, and even holding people incommunicado and not honoring requests for counsel. And you know, what they are doing is, they are arresting them all over the states where they live. And then, in some cases, transporting them on mass or preparing to transport them on mass to D.C. Was very disturbing about this, just like you said in your Angle, Laura, is that there seems to be no sense of proportionality here and almost a deliberate attempt to. In fact criminalize a political act. And in fact, some of these people who I believe engaged in non-violent protest at the Capitol are effectively being treated like political prisoners in our country. And this is the type of thing you see in other countries that our country criticizes. And you know, back in 20 years ago, I was one of the few conservatives who pointed out that the Patriot Act, could one day be weaponized against United States citizens. 20 years later, that's exactly what's happening. And we are now going to see Patriot Act to being used to sort of control our thought in advance and criminalize even any type of dissent with the government. This is truly shocking and a big diversity of our history."

If you go to one of these rallies in the future, you might be, surveiled on a drone or a self-take -- a selfie posted online, you may be dealing with letters from the FBI or being detained or being questioned.

But the only justice I know Laura, and that you know, we all are supposed to know is that justice must be blind. And so, any tactic that is used against those who engaged in violence, not protest, but engaged in violence at the Capitol, are those same tactics also being used against those who engaged in violence in the summer riots and the Portland riots, and the nightly Seattle riots. The people who tried to take over a federal courthouse in Portland, are we going in as the FBI season, their social media using facial identification? I hope so. If you commit violence against the United States, you should be subject to the law. If you are a peaceful protester, you should not be, but the aggressiveness used against the Capitol protesters, which I salute and in for - I'm sorry, the prop Capitol rioters needs to also be used against rioters on the other side. That's how, you know, justice is blind."

If she did anything, I have no idea. But I don't recall Harmeet, that same type of flurry of FBI. Have you seen this person? Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall seeing that last summer.

And not only that our Attorney General nominee actually equivocated, and said that, attacks on these courthouses at night are not the same thing, as attacks on the Capitol during the daytime. First of all, the vast majority of the people who are being detained are not attackers, are not violent, and most of them did not even go into the building. So, we are talking about night and day, nobody - there is no FBI manhunt for absolute terror RICO criminals in many American cities, just in this past year. And so, the double standard is striking even for the violence. But you know, as to arresting non-violent protesters who are protesting outside state capitals, it has never happened. And we are seeing it happen in the United States today with very (inaudible), imagine the chilling effect of your family member or anybody who knows these people - it's absolutely chilling, people are not afraid.

Now, we are using the powers of the police state, the powers of the government to say to people, you are no longer entitled to your opinion, and the heavy hand of justice starts to interfere. And it's - this is all part of the cancelled culture. I'm going to tell you, you know, the bravest reporter out there, I see who is blowing the whistle on this is Glenn Greenwald. Glenn Greenwald, a principled liberal in the old-fashioned sense of liberal has drawn a line between liberalism who used to believe and still does, and the ACLU power of free speech against the progressives. The progressives who want to drum people out of society and off the air. And this progressive silencing movement is one of the scariest you can imagine in America.

I think all of that militarization of the U.S. Capitol. That's part of this whole dynamic that they got pushed out there before 2022. Harmeet and Ari, phenomenal analysis as always. And threats to our freedom, not just coming from D.C., but also from the woke indoctrination efforts poisoning our education system. As produced a telling critic, in fact, the oldest Chinese American Association in the country is warning that the infiltration of critical race theory into our schools is reminiscent of Mao's Cultural Revolution. They are calling on parents to fight back and take the initiative to earn indoctrinate their kids.

The idea of an economic revolution, based on the lower classes, rising up and overthrowing the bourgeoisie is something that didn't work in the 20 Century. So, modern day progressives and leftists that said, we need to infiltrate the institutions of culture. And if we can change the culture, if we can destroy the history of the United States, then we can bring about this utopia.

So they are actually talking about the axis of white supremacy, in calling out the Five Eyes countries or English speaking countries for actually holding them accountable, saying, China has accused Australia of being an part of an axis of white supremacy because of our intelligence alliance with Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and the United States.

My guess is, none of them realized that he was going to appoint someone so extreme as to believe that a minor can make a life altering decision to change their sex, even overriding the parental consent. I think they would do it with no parental consent, but I think she would also do it, if the parents said no, and the kid said yes. She is also on record as saying, well yes, and if they're street kids will do it even sooner. Think of what that really means. That means a homeless child who's either had a rotten childhood or no parents or has a mental illness themselves. She is willing to do the sex change even quicker. They did a survey of these sex change surgeons, over half of them have operated on people under 18. So, this is not a wild question. This is a real question. And they are giving these hormones that change the sex, testosterone to girls and estrogen to boys between the ages of 14 and 16. That's a really - it's a crime against nature. And it's also something that should require parental consent."

Now Generation Z, apparently 15.9 percent identify as LGBT among millennials, it's 9.1 percent Generation X, 3.8 percent.

She thought, well, maybe this is what I am. She went to a clinic and they encouraged her that that's what she was. I don't know that anybody discouraged her from that. They encouraged her from that. She had a chemical transformation. And then she had a double mastectomy. And she's now 23. She fears she is infertile. She is very unhappy. And she feels as if she was misled, and sort of by social pressure made to think this was the right answer for her, and she is very unhappy. And in England, they've actually changed it now. They're actually requiring more parental consent than they used to. Whereas in our country, we are going the opposite way. So, I think it's an important question. And the media leaks the left-wing, media completely missed the question here. The questions about a minor and a consent. Look, I am a physician, I worked in emergency rooms.

I know that sounds optimistic, and nobody can predict for certain, but he is saying, you need to wear a mask for another two years. They're saying you might get it if you have the vaccine and give it to the other people. The thing is, they don't prove that that happens. They just say unless he can prove the opposite, you can't be free and you have to be huddled in your basement wearing a mask. And I'm the opposite. If you get your vaccine, you've had your second dose, your two weeks out, throw away your mask. If you had the disease and you are young person, go to restaurants, go out and visit your friends. Do not hunker down in a basement by yourself. Go to school. By all means, let's get back to normal. And let's treat this with circumspection, the idea that the risks should be according to the individual. In a free society each individual determines a risk. They are a lot less for younger people.

But the GOP argues the bill should be narrow and more tailored to immediate needs. The bill includes a $15 an hour national wage standard. But the Senate will strip that out. Dropping that provision could should show Democrats are limited in passing other liberal policy priorities like immigration reform.
