You think it looks like that because we were worried what would happen if Trump lost? No, so yes, for Dems calling Trump or anyone a sore loser right now that might be the worst case of historical blindness ever.   Remember, we endured these hypocrites spending four years pushing a Russian collusion hoax passing around a bogus dossier like a bong made of porn.  They believed crappy memes by Russian bots helped Trump get 300 plus electoral votes. They pushed the fine people hoax and deemed Trump orange Hitler.   So you think they wouldn't cheat against Hitler? I mean they should, unless they like Hitler.  They were wrong on so many things from Covington to Smollett. They even said Biden had a landslide coming, so it's okay to be skeptical. But still, the news says he won and you don't question the news.   But the great news about being you is that politics won't affect your health, your love life, your family, and your relationships with true friends or with your God.  Ask yourself, would you give up any of those things to change the race? No. You're not a liberal. Politics isn't your life. Life is your life, unlike this creep.",

So far, the Republicans may keep the Senate placing Joe under adult supervision, we hope. Sure the left will pick at him like roadkill, but a Republican Senate means there might be some meat left on that bone.

      "sentences": "The feeling is likewise. It's sad it took 12 of his writers to write Americans are stupid so the big question, what's Trump going to do now, he has two months left.   Remember how much he packed into four years? Two months of Trump equals 12 terms of Joe. He could declare the next four years tax-free, open the doors to Area 51. We let the aliens in. Let's let them out. And weren't we supposed to buy Greenland? Make it a going-away gift for Melania. Also let's bring back \"Melrose Place.\" I missed Daphne Zuniga.  And isn't it time to invade Portland? They're asking for it. Since Trump didn't start a single war, he kind of deserves this. And how about one last stimulus just for cops? So chin up, America. The fact is Trump as President was fun, but Trump as ex-Pres. Holy crap.   Seriously? Who is more interesting? Godzilla or Godzilla on vacation? He is going to be more fun than magic mushrooms in a bouncy castle. He is corn on the cob to Joe's strained peas. You can't get him out of your teeth and the media won't be able to get enough of him after claiming they had enough of him -- given that they won't be doing any real journalism anyway. They have got to keep busy somehow. And trump will keep them busy. He wasn't just a leader, he was us. He took aim at everything from a place of power that none of us had. Even in the establishment he wasn't the establishment. He was real.  Look at his first term and it's only his first term, kids. First, he showed you that the media hates you. The phrase \"fake news\" defined the illusion of authority. It is our \"tear down this wall.\"  Same with pollsters, those vote suppressing hucksters who asked loaded questions creating fake opinions that fit their narratives, predicting nothing. They got paid, we got screwed. But not anymore. From now on, when a pollster calls, remember the two words that would get you grounded as a child, it ain't \"thank you.\" It's close. We've also learned a crap load about government. Trump shared it all because he was an outsider on your side, not theirs. He would tell you about the conversations, the petty grievances, the silliness of it all and like a new boss, he asked questions no one else would. Why do we do that? Why don't we ask for more? Why is he still here? These were great questions which had great outcomes. He taught the difference between words and deeds.  He could send out a mean tweet at 4:00 a.m., but he didn't send our boys to death in faraway lands. His words started fights, his deeds stopped wars. He was fun as hell, he captivated holding your attention hostage. He is the first politician to turn politics into a friar's roast where no one was safe including us. He was the love child of Don Rickles and Phyllis Diller. The late night comics lacked what he had, not just comic timing, but real truth buried in the things he said and what they lacked in truth, they made up for in fear.  Thanks, Trump. Let's not forget the Middle East peace plans, settling North Korea down like an unruly child. He made John Kerry and Hillary Clinton look like fools on their own turf. Then there were three Supreme Court Justices and 200 Federal Justices. He expanded the Republican base to include the working class, which included the Democrats, I mean included blacks and Hispanics, which the Democrats forgot. He showed us how delusional people get when overtaken by infantile emotion. Trump Derangement had anchors setting their hair on fire every night. He showed America how little journalists cared for the principles of journalism and how much contempt they had for America.  Thanks, Trump. So true to form, Trump will keep fighting. That's who he is, which is why millions voted for him. Trump exposed the media. He exposed the pollsters. He exposed the elites. He exposed the political system. Thanks to him we finally saw things the way they really are. He removed the blindfold. For that, I thank you, Donald Trump. See you in 2024.  As for VP, it's either me or Kanye. We'll flip for it.",

You think it looks like that because we were worried what would happen if Trump lost? No, so yes, for Dems calling Trump or anyone a sore loser right now that might be the worst case of historical blindness ever. Remember, we endured these hypocrites spending four years pushing a Russian collusion hoax passing around a bogus dossier like a bong made of porn. They believed crappy memes by Russian bots helped Trump get 300 plus electoral votes. They pushed the fine people hoax and deemed Trump orange Hitler. So you think they wouldn't cheat against Hitler? I mean they should, unless they like Hitler. They were wrong on so many things from Covington to Smollett. They even said Biden had a landslide coming, so it's okay to be skeptical. But still, the news says he won and you don't question the news. But the great news about being you is that politics won't affect your health, your love life, your family, and your relationships with true friends or with your God. Ask yourself, would you give up any of those things to change the race? No. You're not a liberal. Politics isn't your life. Life is your life, unlike this creep."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "The feeling is likewise. It's sad it took 12 of his writers to write Americans are stupid so the big question, what's Trump going to do now, he has two months left. Remember how much he packed into four years? Two months of Trump equals 12 terms of Joe. He could declare the next four years tax-free, open the doors to Area 51. We let the aliens in. Let's let them out. And weren't we supposed to buy Greenland? Make it a going-away gift for Melania. Also let's bring back \"Melrose Place.\" I missed Daphne Zuniga. And isn't it time to invade Portland? They're asking for it. Since Trump didn't start a single war, he kind of deserves this. And how about one last stimulus just for cops? So chin up, America. The fact is Trump as President was fun, but Trump as ex-Pres. Holy crap. Seriously? Who is more interesting? Godzilla or Godzilla on vacation? He is going to be more fun than magic mushrooms in a bouncy castle. He is corn on the cob to Joe's strained peas. You can't get him out of your teeth and the media won't be able to get enough of him after claiming they had enough of him -- given that they won't be doing any real journalism anyway. They have got to keep busy somehow. And trump will keep them busy. He wasn't just a leader, he was us. He took aim at everything from a place of power that none of us had. Even in the establishment he wasn't the establishment. He was real. Look at his first term and it's only his first term, kids. First, he showed you that the media hates you. The phrase \"fake news\" defined the illusion of authority. It is our \"tear down this wall.\" Same with pollsters, those vote suppressing hucksters who asked loaded questions creating fake opinions that fit their narratives, predicting nothing. They got paid, we got screwed. But not anymore. From now on, when a pollster calls, remember the two words that would get you grounded as a child, it ain't \"thank you.\" It's close. We've also learned a crap load about government. Trump shared it all because he was an outsider on your side, not theirs. He would tell you about the conversations, the petty grievances, the silliness of it all and like a new boss, he asked questions no one else would. Why do we do that? Why don't we ask for more? Why is he still here? These were great questions which had great outcomes. He taught the difference between words and deeds. He could send out a mean tweet at 4:00 a.m., but he didn't send our boys to death in faraway lands. His words started fights, his deeds stopped wars. He was fun as hell, he captivated holding your attention hostage. He is the first politician to turn politics into a friar's roast where no one was safe including us. He was the love child of Don Rickles and Phyllis Diller. The late night comics lacked what he had, not just comic timing, but real truth buried in the things he said and what they lacked in truth, they made up for in fear. Thanks, Trump. Let's not forget the Middle East peace plans, settling North Korea down like an unruly child. He made John Kerry and Hillary Clinton look like fools on their own turf. Then there were three Supreme Court Justices and 200 Federal Justices. He expanded the Republican base to include the working class, which included the Democrats, I mean included blacks and Hispanics, which the Democrats forgot. He showed us how delusional people get when overtaken by infantile emotion. Trump Derangement had anchors setting their hair on fire every night. He showed America how little journalists cared for the principles of journalism and how much contempt they had for America. Thanks, Trump. So true to form, Trump will keep fighting. That's who he is, which is why millions voted for him. Trump exposed the media. He exposed the pollsters. He exposed the elites. He exposed the political system. Thanks to him we finally saw things the way they really are. He removed the blindfold. For that, I thank you, Donald Trump. See you in 2024. As for VP, it's either me or Kanye. We'll flip for it."

When you read the history books and you saw what Martin Luther King marched for and what we did for was equality and everyone to sit at the table and make their own choices. I think President Trump helped us do that. We were all so focused on him and all his weird tweets and angry moments that we forgot and we thought about what was important -- our ideals. And although that's not sexy and there's no ratings in that and I know mainstream media always wanted to remind us, it was all about the color of our skin when it was really about what was up in our heads and that's what we saw in this election.

That was the day that I voted -- I decided to vote for Trump. I wasn't actually because I hadn't voted in like 20 years and I always felt that not voting was my vote, but it's like when somebody is intimidating and threatening you, you've got to vote the opposite because that's what Americans do. You stand up against threats and fascism."

But the sad thing is, the people who do care and you've seen them during the Trump years, you see people, that's it. I deny this man. They're trying to get in good with these people.

Recreational pot passed in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota while medicinal use passed in South Dakota and Mississippi. The nation's capital voted to decriminalize the use of psilocybin, the key ingredient in magic mushrooms, while Oregon became the first state to fully legalize the freaky fungi. Now, people ask me all the time, hey, Greg where do you stand on drugs? Well mostly in my living room, but the real winner in all of this is my cat -- I hope it's not the other one -- who has been dealing smack for years. Here is tape of his most recent drug deal."
