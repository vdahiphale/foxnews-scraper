Almost 60,000 of those have resulted in deaths. 115,000 patients have recovered from COVID-19. The president is celebrating another southern state, Texas, suspending much of its economic lockdown. Tennessee and Wisconsin will begin reopening tomorrow, with several others set to relax restrictions by the end of the week.  All of this comes as the Trump administration's efforts to try to keep American business from going under are so in demand, they crash the system.

There are different disputes here, and now, a couple of them involve two House committees who are trying to get their hands on tax and financial records of the president, not from him, but from outside companies that have custody of those records.  So, in a somewhat unexpected move yesterday, the court asked all the parties to those disputes, involving the House committees to file new briefs. They're addressing what's known as the political questioned doctrines.  It will boil that down if the justices are asking, they want to know if this is a dispute between the executive and legislative branches at the judicial branch, does not need to get involved with. Now, if they do that, they don't get involved with the case and there's not really a ruling. There are big implications, first, for the president, he wouldn't have a way to protect his records or to stop those companies from turning them over. They have said, they'll cooperate. On the other hand, though, if that's the decision, it's going to make it tougher for Congress, then in the future, to go to federal courts to try to get subpoenas enforced like they're doing here.

First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox Six in Milwaukee, where police are investigating a shooting that left five people dead. The police chief, says he's department received a call Monday morning from a man who said his family was dead. Officers discovered five victims ranging in age from 14 to 41. The person who called 911 was taken into custody. Fox Two in St. Louis, says national federal safety regulators, say actions by the owners of a tourist boat that sank in Missouri in 2018 and the U.S. coast guard contributed to the tragedy that killed 17 people. The National Transportation safety board, says if the coast guard had followed recommendations for fixing small passenger vessels, the duck boat likely would not have sunk. Fox Four in Dallas, says severe thunderstorms this morning brought brief heavy rain and some damaging hail to parts of north Texas. Forecasters say baseball size hail and hurricane-force winds are possible today in parts of Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. And this is a live look at San Diego from Fox Five, our affiliate there. One of the big stories there tonight and across the country. The Pentagon officially releases three short videos showing what it calls unidentified aerial phenomenon.  The images had previously been released by a private company. This video show, what appear to be, unidentified flying objects rapidly moving while recorded by infrared cameras. The Navy acknowledged the veracity of the videos last September. We'll follow that. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT\". We'll be right back.",

But yet what I see now is someone enabling a sexual predator, and it was my former boss, Joe Biden, who raped me. Hillary Clinton has a history of enabling powerful men to cover their sexual predatory behaviors and their inappropriate sexual misconduct. We don't need that for this country. We don't need that for our generation coming up that wants institutional rape culture to change. I will not be smeared, dismissed, or ignored. I stand in truth and I will keep speaking out.\" This as this story has crossed over into mainstream coverage, albeit a little interesting, \"The Washington Post\" in the headline says \"Developments in allegations against Biden amplify efforts to question his behavior.\" He has not been asked, as far as I can tell, this question on the record at all. Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Amy, I was asked about this the other day, and I said just strictly on the Brett Kavanaugh coverage disparity, this is becoming a big issue. AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": Well, I think it's an issue that has gone from something that started off sort of quietly, and now has really burst it onto the scene, as you pointed out, is now getting coverage in almost every major mainstream news organization as well as a bunch of other smaller organizations that have broken stories about this. In fact, the story really first broke in a liberal media outlet about a couple of weeks ago. I think what we are looking at right now is the big question about when Joe Biden will have to talk about this. I don't think it's going to be able -- he's going to be able to not answer these questions to reporters or go directly to voters. After all, he is spending a lot of time in his basement talking to a camera. It may be time for him to address this personally instead of just having the candidate's campaign staff do that for him.",

MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": These accounts are mounting, and I think the key thing there, Bret, was the fact that the woman spoke to the \"Business Insider\" on the record, which was something missing back during the Kavanaugh episode. Many people in the allegations against Kavanaugh were kept anonymously. I also have to say extra credit must go to that \"Washington Post\" headline writer. They must have taken a course in creative obfuscation in journalism school.

So, here the governor, and I believe it's the health secretary there, would actually have to file their own response by Monday at noon. And it's not unusual for the justices to handle these kinds of things remotely. They handle emergency requests like this when they are not in session. So, the fact that they're not all in the courthouse to hear this is not going to slow it down. Bret, I would say at this point, I think, you'd get the decision on this by next week."

So, they're going to hear this case via phone, and that's scheduled for May 12th. There are different disputes here, and now, a couple of them involve two House committees who are trying to get their hands on tax and financial records of the president, not from him, but from outside companies that have custody of those records. So, in a somewhat unexpected move yesterday, the court asked all the parties to those disputes, involving the House committees to file new briefs. They're addressing what's known as the political questioned doctrines. It will boil that down if the justices are asking, they want to know if this is a dispute between the executive and legislative branches at the judicial branch, does not need to get involved with. Now, if they do that, they don't get involved with the case and there's not really a ruling. There are big implications, first, for the president, he wouldn't have a way to protect his records or to stop those companies from turning them over. They have said, they'll cooperate. On the other hand, though, if that's the decision, it's going to make it tougher for Congress, then in the future, to go to federal courts to try to get subpoenas enforced like they're doing here. So, we'll wait and see. Those new briefs have to be in next Friday, May 8th. And again, the case is supposed to be heard on May 12th. Bret."

First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox Six in Milwaukee, where police are investigating a shooting that left five people dead. The police chief, says he's department received a call Monday morning from a man who said his family was dead. Officers discovered five victims ranging in age from 14 to 41. The person who called 911 was taken into custody. Fox Two in St. Louis, says national federal safety regulators, say actions by the owners of a tourist boat that sank in Missouri in 2018 and the U.S. coast guard contributed to the tragedy that killed 17 people. The National Transportation safety board, says if the coast guard had followed recommendations for fixing small passenger vessels, the duck boat likely would not have sunk. Fox Four in Dallas, says severe thunderstorms this morning brought brief heavy rain and some damaging hail to parts of north Texas. Forecasters say baseball size hail and hurricane-force winds are possible today in parts of Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. And this is a live look at San Diego from Fox Five, our affiliate there. One of the big stories there tonight and across the country. The Pentagon officially releases three short videos showing what it calls unidentified aerial phenomenon. The images had previously been released by a private company. This video show, what appear to be, unidentified flying objects rapidly moving while recorded by infrared cameras. The Navy acknowledged the veracity of the videos last September. We'll follow that. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT\". We'll be right back."

A 29-year-old Frenchman who claims allegiance to the Islamic State group is facing possible terrorism charges after ramming his car into police, injuring three officers. The incident occurred Monday in the northwestern Paris suburb, while police were conducting an I.D. check. A fuel tanker exploded today on an attack on the northern Syrian town controlled by Turkish-backed opposition fighters. Turkish defense ministry, says, at least, 40 civilians were killed in that attack. Brazil's Supreme Court is authorizing an investigation into whether President Jair Bolsaro -- Bolsonaro, I should say, committed crimes by allegedly attempting to interfere with the country's federal police. The president has denied, wanting to know about investigations underway, but has not addressed an accusation. He wanted a justice minister who would share information.

      "utterance": "Hillary Clinton endorsing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden today. This as there is an allegation of sexual assault, a former staffer to senator Joe Biden, Tara Reade, has allegations out there about a sexual assault that happened in 1993. She talked to FOXnews.com today, \"I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, I voted for her in the primary. I'm a lifelong Democrat. But yet what I see now is someone enabling a sexual predator, and it was my former boss, Joe Biden, who raped me. Hillary Clinton has a history of enabling powerful men to cover their sexual predatory behaviors and their inappropriate sexual misconduct. We don't need that for this country. We don't need that for our generation coming up that wants institutional rape culture to change. I will not be smeared, dismissed, or ignored. I stand in truth and I will keep speaking out.\" This as this story has crossed over into mainstream coverage, albeit a little interesting, \"The Washington Post\" in the headline says \"Developments in allegations against Biden amplify efforts to question his behavior.\" He has not been asked, as far as I can tell, this question on the record at all. Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Amy, I was asked about this the other day, and I said just strictly on the Brett Kavanaugh coverage disparity, this is becoming a big issue. AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": Well, I think it's an issue that has gone from something that started off sort of quietly, and now has really burst it onto the scene, as you pointed out, is now getting coverage in almost every major mainstream news organization as well as a bunch of other smaller organizations that have broken stories about this. In fact, the story really first broke in a liberal media outlet about a couple of weeks ago. I think what we are looking at right now is the big question about when Joe Biden will have to talk about this. I don't think it's going to be able -- he's going to be able to not answer these questions to reporters or go directly to voters. After all, he is spending a lot of time in his basement talking to a camera. It may be time for him to address this personally instead of just having the candidate's campaign staff do that for him."

She had told me about this guy, and I didn't really know who Joe Biden was, but she had worked for the senator. She said that she had put her up against the wall and he had put his finger inside of her. She was talking about how dirty she felt. I'm personally a Democrat, a very strong Democrat, and I'm for Biden regardless, but still, I still have to come out and say this.\" We apologize for all these details, but this is just coming out in the past few days. Add to this the tape of what she says is her mother calling into a \"Larry King Live\" show in 1993, a call-in show about sexual abuse on Capitol Hill. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": These accounts are mounting, and I think the key thing there, Bret, was the fact that the woman spoke to the \"Business Insider\" on the record, which was something missing back during the Kavanaugh episode. Many people in the allegations against Kavanaugh were kept anonymously. I also have to say extra credit must go to that \"Washington Post\" headline writer. They must have taken a course in creative obfuscation in journalism school. The media's double standard is flagrant, but I'm worried that this is one area that Joe Biden may be being shielded by coronavirus. As long as the attention of the nation is on the pandemic, I think he might be able to skirt some of these questions for a little while longer."

We are going to get to a point where this virus is obviously a big story and it's going to be a referendum on this election. But at some point this is going to come down to Joe Biden versus Donald Trump head-to-head, and it's going to get ugly, likely, with ads and everything else. The latest Real Clear Politics average politics poll has Biden up about 6.3 percent if you look at all the recent polls on the national basis. But our state polls in big states like Michigan and Pennsylvania and even Florida have Biden with a lead, Byron. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Look, it is not going to go away. In 2018 when Democrats decided to challenge the Brett Kavanaugh nomination in the way that they did with a very, very old, uncorroborated allegation from Christine Blasey Ford, and this just completely off-the-wall gang rape allegation from Julie Swetnick and Michael Avenatti, when they chose to believe that, when they chose to actually use the phrase \"believe all women,\" they didn't know it, but they set themselves up for this. And so now all Republicans are saying is, does \"believe all women\" apply to Tara Reade as well? What has really been amazing is reporters have had a few, not very many, a few opportunities to question Biden, and they have not asked him about this. And he has never made a direct statement. His spokesperson has completely denied it, said it did not happen, but he has not made a statement about this."

More people disapprove than approve. I think where Trump does best is when he is able to make not necessarily the case for himself but make the case against his opponent. He does really well when he's up against Hillary Clinton, up against a James Comey, up against Adam Schiff, and it's a contrast, not just a referendum.

And I think it's incumbent on all of us to watch these other examples, and then in order to modify our own behavior accordingly.

One last little thing. At the White House you saw today the president trying to emphasize the other side of the story, which is the economic side of the story.
