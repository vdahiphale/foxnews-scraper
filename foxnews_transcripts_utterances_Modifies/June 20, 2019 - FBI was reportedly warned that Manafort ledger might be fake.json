      "sentences": "Yes, Iran made a very big mistake. They will pay. But, tonight, the president is clearly giving the mullahs an opening to pick up the phone and come clean in their hostile behavior. I like that patience. What about all the liberals who said Donald Trump is rogue and we can't trust him? OK, he's being very patient.  Now, after meeting at the White House, Congressional Republicans, they released a statement. Quote: Iran directly attacked a United States asset over international waters, this provocation comes after they attacked and destroyed two commercial tankers in international waters. This provocation comes a week after they attacked and destroyed two commercial tankers in international waters. There must be a measured response to these actions.   Hmm, how do we define measured? President Trump does not want war. He's said so clearly during the campaign. He's not interested in another, you know, years and years-long international entanglement, I don't expect one.  But in coming days, we will know if the mullahs are smart enough to take the opportunity which is a small window -- it may not even exist within five minutes. Because if they don't, the president will have no choice, he will bomb the hell out of them. No need for a long protracted boots on the ground kind of war. We have the greatest military, thank God, on the face of this earth. We have the most advanced weapon system, and a strong message needs to be sent that a huge price will be paid if you take on the United States of America.  Simple peace through strength and it works. My strong opinion, it is imperative that we as a country develop what I call the next generation of military weaponry. We have learned from Vietnam. We have learned from Iraq and Afghanistan.  Sadly, wars we get involved in quickly become politicized. They do not end as they should with complete victory. We don't want our kids going door- to-door like they did in Iraq and having Democrats say come home and then being told, never mind, we didn't mean it. America needs the single most advanced weaponry for all future conflicts. I'd prefer we devastate our enemies from Tampa, Florida. That generation of weaponry is something we need to advance as a country quickly and expeditiously.  Thankfully, tonight, we are in a new era. The weak, feckless Biden-Obama foreign policy is long dead and gone. There will be no more shipments of $150 million in cash and other currency, and cargo planes headed for the mullahs in Tehran.   There will be no more bribes. There will be no European frolics for John Kerry. There will be no United Nations. This is now a different time. There will be hell to pay, and the world is watching. China tonight is watching. Russia tonight is watching. What happens in Iran will have ramifications all over the world. The North Koreans are watching.  This brings us now to a quick “Hannity” history lesson. It is no mystery why Iran is acting out. Why? In 2015, how this happened I cannot explain, it is inexplicable.  The single dumbest foreign policy deal ever made in the history of this country, Biden-Obama literally loosened economic sanctions on Iran after they had a chance to support young freedom fighters, the younger generation that wanted help that were quoting Jefferson and Washington and our framers and founders -- and, yes, Biden-Obama gifted the radical Islamic mullahs of Iran $150 billion in cash and other currency. In exchange, the Iranian government, they made an unverifiable promise not to build a nuclear weapon for years, but they can do it in 10 years. And, of course, the radical Islamic extremist government of Iran continued to fund terrorism as they always have all over the world, proxy wars. They continue to chant \"death to Israel\", \"death to America\". They continue to burn the American flag, the Israeli flag.   They are a hostile actor in the region. And thanks to Biden-Obama, well, they have a boatload of cash to spend, funding, fomenting terror around the world. All of this changed to January 20th 2017. President Trump was inaugurated. He pulled the United States out of this horrific Iranian nuclear deal. He reimposed devastating sanctions and they are working.  Today, tonight, Iran feeling the effects of the president's policies, they are feeling it in a big way because of the reimposed sanctions. They are now facing years-long recession. 2018, their economy retracted by a whopping 4 percent. This year, the International Monetary Fund is predicting Iran will lose another 6 percent. Inflation also a massive issue in Iran, 2019 alone, inflation likely to top 40 percent.  Meanwhile, our economy is booming, and because of the president's efforts to unleash American energy, we are in the best position we have ever been in as it relates to any conflict in the Middle East. We are now shielded from the crisis because of course the lifeblood of every economy is oil and gas, not the New Green Deal. And the Iranian economy has lost the value as we have become energy independent. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas. For the first time in 75 years, America is energy independent. We are a net exporter of energy. In other words, we have their leverage. If we don't need the Straits of Hormuz as we once did and Iran is suffering economically. The Iranian people are growing more and more angry and frustrated with their radical government. Iran's armed forces cannot match the might of our military.   Now, the mullahs must see the riding is on the wall. They either stop funding terror, proxy wars, stop attacking ships in the Gulf of Oman, stop plotting the annihilation of Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East, and the United States.  If they do not end this hostility, if they do not stop, the mullahs of Iran will feel pain I predict like never before. And they will earn it. They will make it happen. We'll have more of my monologue in a minute. First, joining us now, someone who just met with today Iran's chief spokesperson in the United Nations, our friend, Fox news correspondent Geraldo Rivera, and retired CIA senior intelligence officer, Fox News contributor, Dan Hoffman.  I'm assuming, Geraldo, this was a preplanned meeting. You didn't know this was going to happen.",

They are never -- must never be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons. But, today, sleepy creepy, the guy who helped give them $150 billion to bribe them, oh, well, he blamed President Trump for the hostility, a self- inflicted disaster. Yes, because you trained the mullahs to, if they act out, we'll give you money. You're an appeaser, Joe Biden. You and Obama gave $150 billion to radical mullahs who want to destroy us -- brilliant. They in turn use the money we know to fund terrorism around the world and fight proxy wars.

So, if we are confronted in that place, as this administration has been, we have to respond. It doesn't mean you start a war. We don't need boots on the ground but this Islamic Republic of Iran is not a republic at all. It is completely Islamist and they seek to control as much as they can.  And they want -- you know, the Obama administration, they knew they were dealing with weakness. So, these provocations bring us to the table on their terms. In this case, you know this White House. And guess what? I think John Bolton is a patriot. I don't think John Bolton wants boots on the ground and some massive war in the Middle East. I think he wants America to stand strong and respond proportionally to put Iranians on their heels and say these sanctions are going to work. They're going to make you hurt.

This is being spun by the people in the Ben Rhodes echo chamber. This is spun by Obama era holdovers in the State Department. John Bolton is a patriot and he will never, ever give a device that he doesn't think is sound to the president but the president makes the decision. He built his campaign on two things, Sean.

There's a heads up from a \"New York Times\" reporter, Michael Schmidt, about an anti-Trump Russia story concerning Jared Kushner that he sent over to the FBI as a heads up, but not looking for a comment but just as a friendly, hey, you might want to pay attention to this. It shows, again, collusion between the media and the Comey FBI, and then quite funnily in some ways or sadly, there is email traffic between Strzok and Page where they get into a spat over who sent what emails to whom about the grand jury that was looking into Hillary Clinton.

You can embrace Jimmy Carter's foreign policy, a wild failure or you can embrace Ronald Reagan's foreign policy, a wild success. I'm also hearing maybe it's coming from Iran or China or Russia or North Korea, a concerted now clear campaign against John Bolton. John Bolton hasn't done anything. He is a National Security Adviser; he advises the President of the United States. I'm sure China and Russia and North Korea and Iran love it, when they hear hosts and others trashing John Bolton, part of a massive propaganda effort. The President of the United States is a strong leader. He's Commander-in- Chief. He listened to advice from many people. He'll make the decision. But these attacks on both including leaks coming out of the White House on Bolton are a disgrace, absolute disgrace.",

Sometimes there will be military action, sometimes there won't that. The word here to keep in mind is prudence, not ideology from the Code Pink Republicans in the hard left to sound alike, not the radical interventionists, prudence. The Iranians attacked us. The Iranians attacked oil rigs in commercial waterways. The Iranians have captured American sailors in the past. The Iranians have killed American soldiers in Iraq and the Iranians have killed American Marines in Lebanon. Now, I don't know, what do you think Red China would do about this? What do you think Russia would do about this? What do you think any self-respecting nation would do about this?

In other words, integration in public schools in the 1970's. He made inflammatory comments when pushing the 94 Clinton crime bill. He used the phrase, predators on our streets talking about urban crime, even made excuses for segregationist Strom Thurmond calling him \"a product of his time\" and remarks at his funeral. And don't forget just a few decades ago, racist, bigots, they ruled the day. The Democratic Party. In fact, a significant number of congressional Democrats, they opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Yeah people like Robert KKK Byrd, Al Gore's father, nowhere to be found. The 65 Voting Rights bill largely opposed by Democrats, a whopping 70 Democratic lawmakers opposing landmark historic legislation. One of the longest serving Democratic stars in the U.S. Senate was none other than former Klansman himself, Robert KKK Byrd. And Biden spoke at his funeral saying nice things about him. The funeral of a former Klansman. Hillary called the former Klansman her mentor. Let's think for a second, what if Donald Trump did that. Now this is all getting so bad that Biden's advisors are actually now even publicly begging him to stop talking about your political past, because it's a massive liability. Biden has no core values, we see that, no core ideas, no solutions. Eight years of failure, willing to say and do anything and everything to try and appease the new extreme radical democratic socialist party. But is anyone buying it? Remember, his Anita Hill apology tour, the flip flopping on the Hyde Amendment. He held that position for 40 years and having to pander to, yes, the real Speaker of the House, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and by the way, I'm not saying she's the real speaker for you idiots in the media, it's not a conspiracy theory, but. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez scares the living daylights out of the Presidential candidates and Pelosi, and he adopted, yes, the crazy new Green Deal climate change nonsense. Now, he's averaging about a flip flop a week, making the campaign spend and spin in a million different directions. Now, we are here to do the vetting to expose Biden for who he really is. Like most of the Democrats. He's a complete creature of the swamp, the sewer, a fraud, someone with no plan for our future and he has to run on the Biden Obama record. 150 billion to mullahs in Iran, 30 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more on poverty, you know my list. Here now, Secret Service Agent, former Secret Service Agent, Fox News Contributor Dan Bongino, you know it's interesting. I mean he's trying.

This provocation comes a week after they attacked and destroyed two commercial tankers in international waters. There must be a measured response to these actions. Hmm, how do we define measured? President Trump does not want war. He's said so clearly during the campaign. He's not interested in another, you know, years and years-long international entanglement, I don't expect one. But in coming days, we will know if the mullahs are smart enough to take the opportunity which is a small window -- it may not even exist within five minutes. Because if they don't, the president will have no choice, he will bomb the hell out of them. No need for a long protracted boots on the ground kind of war. We have the greatest military, thank God, on the face of this earth. We have the most advanced weapon system, and a strong message needs to be sent that a huge price will be paid if you take on the United States of America. Simple peace through strength and it works. My strong opinion, it is imperative that we as a country develop what I call the next generation of military weaponry. We have learned from Vietnam. We have learned from Iraq and Afghanistan. Sadly, wars we get involved in quickly become politicized. They do not end as they should with complete victory. We don't want our kids going door- to-door like they did in Iraq and having Democrats say come home and then being told, never mind, we didn't mean it. America needs the single most advanced weaponry for all future conflicts. I'd prefer we devastate our enemies from Tampa, Florida. That generation of weaponry is something we need to advance as a country quickly and expeditiously. Thankfully, tonight, we are in a new era. The weak, feckless Biden-Obama foreign policy is long dead and gone. There will be no more shipments of $150 million in cash and other currency, and cargo planes headed for the mullahs in Tehran. There will be no more bribes. There will be no European frolics for John Kerry. There will be no United Nations. This is now a different time. There will be hell to pay, and the world is watching. China tonight is watching. Russia tonight is watching. What happens in Iran will have ramifications all over the world. The North Koreans are watching. This brings us now to a quick “Hannity” history lesson. It is no mystery why Iran is acting out. Why? In 2015, how this happened I cannot explain, it is inexplicable. The single dumbest foreign policy deal ever made in the history of this country, Biden-Obama literally loosened economic sanctions on Iran after they had a chance to support young freedom fighters, the younger generation that wanted help that were quoting Jefferson and Washington and our framers and founders -- and, yes, Biden-Obama gifted the radical Islamic mullahs of Iran $150 billion in cash and other currency. In exchange, the Iranian government, they made an unverifiable promise not to build a nuclear weapon for years, but they can do it in 10 years. And, of course, the radical Islamic extremist government of Iran continued to fund terrorism as they always have all over the world, proxy wars. They continue to chant \"death to Israel\", \"death to America\". They continue to burn the American flag, the Israeli flag. They are a hostile actor in the region. And thanks to Biden-Obama, well, they have a boatload of cash to spend, funding, fomenting terror around the world. All of this changed to January 20th 2017. President Trump was inaugurated. He pulled the United States out of this horrific Iranian nuclear deal. He reimposed devastating sanctions and they are working. Today, tonight, Iran feeling the effects of the president's policies, they are feeling it in a big way because of the reimposed sanctions. They are now facing years-long recession. 2018, their economy retracted by a whopping 4 percent. This year, the International Monetary Fund is predicting Iran will lose another 6 percent. Inflation also a massive issue in Iran, 2019 alone, inflation likely to top 40 percent. Meanwhile, our economy is booming, and because of the president's efforts to unleash American energy, we are in the best position we have ever been in as it relates to any conflict in the Middle East. We are now shielded from the crisis because of course the lifeblood of every economy is oil and gas, not the New Green Deal. And the Iranian economy has lost the value as we have become energy independent. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas. For the first time in 75 years, America is energy independent. We are a net exporter of energy. In other words, we have their leverage. If we don't need the Straits of Hormuz as we once did and Iran is suffering economically. The Iranian people are growing more and more angry and frustrated with their radical government. Iran's armed forces cannot match the might of our military. Now, the mullahs must see the riding is on the wall. They either stop funding terror, proxy wars, stop attacking ships in the Gulf of Oman, stop plotting the annihilation of Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East, and the United States. If they do not end this hostility, if they do not stop, the mullahs of Iran will feel pain I predict like never before. And they will earn it. They will make it happen. We'll have more of my monologue in a minute. First, joining us now, someone who just met with today Iran's chief spokesperson in the United Nations, our friend, Fox news correspondent Geraldo Rivera, and retired CIA senior intelligence officer, Fox News contributor, Dan Hoffman.

And we have driven their economy into freefall, their currency is worth nothing, and that's why they have threatened us with nuclear blackmail. Back on May 8th, they said they would begin enriching uranium to weapons grade levels if they didn't receive relief from sanctions, we are crushing them. And that's what this is all about. And the key date for me is going to be, as we head towards July 8th, does Iran start to weaponize their uranium? That's another point.

Thank you both. The mullahs of Iran, they've never good people. Given the opportunity, yes, I believe they would wipe Israel and the United States off the map and think they are doing the will of God. Their radical form of Islamic extremism, it is dangerous, it is a real clear and present danger, it is scary, they have a history of fomenting war and terror and fighting proxy wars. They are never -- must never be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons. But, today, sleepy creepy, the guy who helped give them $150 billion to bribe them, oh, well, he blamed President Trump for the hostility, a self- inflicted disaster. Yes, because you trained the mullahs to, if they act out, we'll give you money. You're an appeaser, Joe Biden. You and Obama gave $150 billion to radical mullahs who want to destroy us -- brilliant. They in turn use the money we know to fund terrorism around the world and fight proxy wars. And, by the way, for a bunch of known liars that want to build a nuclear weapon and you got a ten-year promise but you don't even get real inspections, Iran vowed to quadruple the rate of Iranian enrichment, Obama and Biden failed this country and failed the entire world.

Joining us now, first, \"Fox & Friends\" co-host, Pete Hegseth, Salem nationally syndicated radio talk show host, Sebastian Gorka. Pete, we'll start with you. I know your time, your service to your country. You heard me and Geraldo. Your reaction? PETE HEGSETH, \"FOX & FRIENDS\" WEEKEND CO-HOST: Yes.

There is no U.N. navy. No one else is going to make sure that oil flows, that our ships are able to trade around the world -- it is us. So, if we are confronted in that place, as this administration has been, we have to respond. It doesn't mean you start a war. We don't need boots on the ground but this Islamic Republic of Iran is not a republic at all. It is completely Islamist and they seek to control as much as they can. And they want -- you know, the Obama administration, they knew they were dealing with weakness. So, these provocations bring us to the table on their terms. In this case, you know this White House. And guess what? I think John Bolton is a patriot. I don't think John Bolton wants boots on the ground and some massive war in the Middle East. I think he wants America to stand strong and respond proportionally to put Iranians on their heels and say these sanctions are going to work. They're going to make you hurt. We want you to hurt, so much that you have to come to the table on our terms, because you'll never have a nuclear weapon. We'll never allow it."

I'm sick of that. If we're not -- they don't have the will. We must develop the next generation of weaponry, we will fight the war from Tampa, and we will destroy the living crap out of anybody. Now, it can be proportional. I have a rule in my own life. If you hit me, I'm going to hit you back ten times harder. Let's start there. SEBASTIAN GORKA, SALEM RADIO'S \"AMERICA FIRST\" HOST: Yes, that's how it works. First things first, can I congratulate you on the sleepy creepy? That's excellent. And we need to get that to the White House. That's Crooked Hillary level of branding. That's very good level of branding. Can I just cut through all of this? Because there's so much garbage being spewed here, even by some people who are appearing on Fox shows. I actually had the title of strategist to the president, let me tell you about this president. He will never, ever deploy the 82nd Airborne onto the streets of Tehran. That is not Donald -- that is not Donald Trump. And the idea that there is some malevolent conspiracy of dark neocons in the White House including John Bolton, Pete is absolutely right. It's garbage. This is being spun by the people in the Ben Rhodes echo chamber. This is spun by Obama era holdovers in the State Department. John Bolton is a patriot and he will never, ever give a device that he doesn't think is sound to the president but the president makes the decision. He built his campaign on two things, Sean. Build the wall, reform immigration, and stop the stupid wars. The idea that suddenly he is going to be suckered into something that his whole campaign was the antithesis of is just ridiculous."

They thought it might wrong. They weren't sure. As you know, there's a debate about how many emails were there. So, they tried to muddy the record with Congress by sending them a letter that tried to walk it back but didn't. It shows again that the FBI was concerned about protecting Hillary Clinton. And then you have emails concerning \"The New York Times\". There's a heads up from a \"New York Times\" reporter, Michael Schmidt, about an anti-Trump Russia story concerning Jared Kushner that he sent over to the FBI as a heads up, but not looking for a comment but just as a friendly, hey, you might want to pay attention to this. It shows, again, collusion between the media and the Comey FBI, and then quite funnily in some ways or sadly, there is email traffic between Strzok and Page where they get into a spat over who sent what emails to whom about the grand jury that was looking into Hillary Clinton. It shows you that the FBI under Comey was unethical mess, unprofessional, and their handling of these investigations deserved -- deserves another look-see."

And, you know, dossier, it's going to go down as fake news. That all of this was just planted into the FBI and used.

And you guys were asking the right questions. Now that we know that they used more false information that they were warned about. To what level can we say this was a premeditated.

What we found is, even with this John Solomon reporting, it's not only that they knew that it was false, then they actually worked with the media to make sure it gets reported so they can use the same media reports to justify their surveillance. And so, here's the real problem that I have with all of it. The deeper we dive, the more we see that protocols were broken.

It's called Unfreedom of the Press. I call him the Great One for a reason. He hosts the number one rated cable show, Sunday nights at 10 Eastern and he's the host of LevinTV and Nationally Syndicated Radio Host. You know Mark, this is now your fifth week and I noticed four weeks in a row, number one on The New York Times bestseller list, which doesn't surprise me. All your books have been number one. Now, Jimmy Acosta has some book, I don't even know what it's called. You sold in your fifth week at least according to Book Scan over 35,000 books That's your fifth week. You've sold hundreds of thousands of books. I looked at the numbers. Jimmy Acosta barely sold over 6500. Is that a failure on his part? Because I'd say that's a disaster."

      "speaker": "MARK LEVIN, AUTHOR, UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS",
      "utterance": "No, it is a disaster. And he wrote a book about himself. He wrote a book about himself. He's always been about himself and the fact of the matter is, he has disrupted the Presidential press conferences. His book isn't about the media. Let me be honest, Jim Acosta is a clown. He's not a reporter. He's an advocate. He's a partisan. He is a Democrat, if not in fact in name and the American people are onto him. His book is rejected, despite the fact that he was promoted by The New York Times, promoted on the Sunday shows, promoted on CNN and so forth. But you know Sean, I want to raise a point with you as I sit here and listen for my segment coming up on this Iranian matter. We're starting to get now propaganda; it sounds like Iranian propaganda coming out of the mouths of Americans. Americans who should know better. They ask you; can you point to one example where Iran committed a terrorist act. I can point to many. But let me start with 1983, Beirut Lebanon Hezbollah, which has the terrorist militia wing of Iran blew up our Marine barracks with two truck bombs killed over 250 Americans, most of whom were Marines. That was Iran. Iran was behind that. Stop apologizing for Iran. What I hear tonight and what I'm hearing throughout the day is a bunch of people who are embracing Jimmy Carter's foreign policy of appeasement, of distraction, of excuses, of spin. You can embrace Jimmy Carter's foreign policy, a wild failure or you can embrace Ronald Reagan's foreign policy, a wild success. I'm also hearing maybe it's coming from Iran or China or Russia or North Korea, a concerted now clear campaign against John Bolton. John Bolton hasn't done anything. He is a National Security Adviser; he advises the President of the United States. I'm sure China and Russia and North Korea and Iran love it, when they hear hosts and others trashing John Bolton, part of a massive propaganda effort. The President of the United States is a strong leader. He's Commander-in- Chief. He listened to advice from many people. He'll make the decision. But these attacks on both including leaks coming out of the White House on Bolton are a disgrace, absolute disgrace."

You worked in the Reagan administration, a man by the name of Ed Meese. And the point here that I'm making is peace through strength is our only option. But you and I have both watched now, wars started then politicized and then we say, never mind. I personally would like to see the next generation of sophisticated technology and weaponry, where we don't have to send kids there to fight and to do what's necessary from here."

We're not the ones who instigate wars and I'm sick and tired of hearing people on cable TV in other words suggest that the President of the United States is provoking anything. We're not provoking a damn thing. In fact, we never provoke anything. You know why we went into Afghanistan, because that's where 9/11 was hatched. That's where we were attacked. And don't tell me, Iraq is a reason not to deal with Iran. One has nothing to do with the other. And the world's always going to be evil. Sometimes there will be war, sometimes there won't. Sometimes there will be military action, sometimes there won't that. The word here to keep in mind is prudence, not ideology from the Code Pink Republicans in the hard left to sound alike, not the radical interventionists, prudence. The Iranians attacked us. The Iranians attacked oil rigs in commercial waterways. The Iranians have captured American sailors in the past. The Iranians have killed American soldiers in Iraq and the Iranians have killed American Marines in Lebanon. Now, I don't know, what do you think Red China would do about this? What do you think Russia would do about this? What do you think any self-respecting nation would do about this? So, to turn over and pretend that if we do something, we're provoking, for God sakes quote the Foreign Minister of Iran is a disgrace."

Wow, you have for the first time an African American that's clean and articulate. What? Now, there is a pattern here because Crazy Uncle Joe came out hard against busing. In other words, integration in public schools in the 1970's. He made inflammatory comments when pushing the 94 Clinton crime bill. He used the phrase, predators on our streets talking about urban crime, even made excuses for segregationist Strom Thurmond calling him \"a product of his time\" and remarks at his funeral. And don't forget just a few decades ago, racist, bigots, they ruled the day. The Democratic Party. In fact, a significant number of congressional Democrats, they opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Yeah people like Robert KKK Byrd, Al Gore's father, nowhere to be found. The 65 Voting Rights bill largely opposed by Democrats, a whopping 70 Democratic lawmakers opposing landmark historic legislation. One of the longest serving Democratic stars in the U.S. Senate was none other than former Klansman himself, Robert KKK Byrd. And Biden spoke at his funeral saying nice things about him. The funeral of a former Klansman. Hillary called the former Klansman her mentor. Let's think for a second, what if Donald Trump did that. Now this is all getting so bad that Biden's advisors are actually now even publicly begging him to stop talking about your political past, because it's a massive liability. Biden has no core values, we see that, no core ideas, no solutions. Eight years of failure, willing to say and do anything and everything to try and appease the new extreme radical democratic socialist party. But is anyone buying it? Remember, his Anita Hill apology tour, the flip flopping on the Hyde Amendment. He held that position for 40 years and having to pander to, yes, the real Speaker of the House, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and by the way, I'm not saying she's the real speaker for you idiots in the media, it's not a conspiracy theory, but. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez scares the living daylights out of the Presidential candidates and Pelosi, and he adopted, yes, the crazy new Green Deal climate change nonsense. Now, he's averaging about a flip flop a week, making the campaign spend and spin in a million different directions. Now, we are here to do the vetting to expose Biden for who he really is. Like most of the Democrats. He's a complete creature of the swamp, the sewer, a fraud, someone with no plan for our future and he has to run on the Biden Obama record. 150 billion to mullahs in Iran, 30 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more on poverty, you know my list. Here now, Secret Service Agent, former Secret Service Agent, Fox News Contributor Dan Bongino, you know it's interesting. I mean he's trying. But the problem is, he's made a lot of incendiary statements and decisions on racial issues and rightly, he should defend it, but he says, I did nothing wrong."
