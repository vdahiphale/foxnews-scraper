      "sentences": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington. Chris Christie will be here live in the second half of the show. Two segments. He's done a lot of interviews, but guess what? He hasn't laid out how Trump can win in 2020 and whether in fact he might just end up eventually having a rollback with President Trump, either in a campaign or who knows the White House. I'm going to press it. Plus, a new segment on the show coming up. This is your country on liberalism. The frigid city of Portland, Maine, overrun, yes, by asylum- seekers. Former Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, was called racist over his concern about illegal immigration and the asylee issue when he was governor. Well, he is here tonight to react and maybe say, \"See, I told you so.\"  But first, Trump versus the party of death. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Democrats seem awfully cocky lately. Since winning the House in November and forcing Trump's hand on the shutdown, they feel like they're on a glide path to 2020. Every other day, it's a litany of smugness from the resistance. 21 months out from the election, of course, they are practically calling the race already. They hope that the sheer volume of negative headlines about Mueller and the showdowns with Pelosi and Schumer, they're all going to take their toll.  Well, objective reporting, of course, is the last thing on their minds because that would require a focus on the smashing success of the Trump economy, which is far and away the strongest in the world. So what is their goal? To demoralize Trump's base. The Washington Post delivers dour headlines like this. \"Walls around Trump are crumbling. Evangelicals may be his last resort.\" And why bother dissecting the genius of like Trump's maneuvers with China on trade when you can assign some flack to write headlines like this? \"White evangelical support for President Trump slips in the midst of the government shutdown.\" Now, think about it.  While the President's approval numbers may have taken a hit during the shutdown, the President's numbers were identical before and after the shutdown, unlike Pelosi, who actually lost support during the shutdown battle. So my prediction? The more full of themselves the Democrats get, the more voters learn about this new breed of radical zealots. The lefts are going to want to roll the dice with this crowd and the more they'll start to appreciate President Trump. And if, by the way, the bright lights of the pundit class think that evangelicals are going to abandon the GOP and Trump, they're suffering from delusions of electoral grandeur.  The Democrats have completely misread what happened in November. They captured one House of Congress and handily, of course. But this doesn't mean that the American people are willing to ditch capitalism for socialism or that they have abandoned totally their core humanity for cold convenience. But I'll tell you, many Democrats have. Like Virginia State Delegate Kathy Tran pressed here by House Majority Leader in Virginia about her latest abortion bill.",

In a somewhat related story of how liberalism does damage under the guise of compassion, I don't really like to call it liberalism because it's kind of illiberal when you thing about it. But we're going to take you, though, to the state of Florida. The Sunshine State is also teaming with new immigrant children that not only need to be educated but need to learn the English language in the process, like all new immigrants. But to combat this issue, they aren't establishing more rigorous requirements to graduate but are considering, quote, alternate pathways for immigrants to get their high school diplomas. So I was always taught to raise the bar for people, but now they want to lower the bar because you have such a big influx of immigrants. So Representative Susan Valdes, a Democrat from Tampa, has even proposed to establish test score substitutes for students who cannot pass any of the versions currently allowed. I wish they had that when I was a kid. In other words, the objective standard by which most American students are assessed have been deemed by some to be unfair because some of the kids can't keep up with the material. We've heard that from teachers in the past. A couple nights ago, we defended Tom Brokaw against the completely unfair pile-on that he received following his suggestion that immigrant communities better assimilate to U.S. communities. Like the Brokaw critics, these Florida lawmakers fail to realize that the immigrant communities they wish to serve are only hamstrung, they're held back by lowering standards. And you are also insulting their abilities in limiting their potential in the process. Immigrants should be challenged to rise in America, given the opportunity to do so, but not given a diploma for staying down. All right, coming up, Chris Christie is here live for the rest of the show. This is going to be fun. So does the former New Jersey governor really think he'd be a better president than Trump?

      "utterance": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington. Chris Christie will be here live in the second half of the show. Two segments. He's done a lot of interviews, but guess what? He hasn't laid out how Trump can win in 2020 and whether in fact he might just end up eventually having a rollback with President Trump, either in a campaign or who knows the White House. I'm going to press it. Plus, a new segment on the show coming up. This is your country on liberalism. The frigid city of Portland, Maine, overrun, yes, by asylum- seekers. Former Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, was called racist over his concern about illegal immigration and the asylee issue when he was governor. Well, he is here tonight to react and maybe say, \"See, I told you so.\" But first, Trump versus the party of death. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Democrats seem awfully cocky lately. Since winning the House in November and forcing Trump's hand on the shutdown, they feel like they're on a glide path to 2020. Every other day, it's a litany of smugness from the resistance. 21 months out from the election, of course, they are practically calling the race already. They hope that the sheer volume of negative headlines about Mueller and the showdowns with Pelosi and Schumer, they're all going to take their toll. Well, objective reporting, of course, is the last thing on their minds because that would require a focus on the smashing success of the Trump economy, which is far and away the strongest in the world. So what is their goal? To demoralize Trump's base. The Washington Post delivers dour headlines like this. \"Walls around Trump are crumbling. Evangelicals may be his last resort.\" And why bother dissecting the genius of like Trump's maneuvers with China on trade when you can assign some flack to write headlines like this? \"White evangelical support for President Trump slips in the midst of the government shutdown.\" Now, think about it. While the President's approval numbers may have taken a hit during the shutdown, the President's numbers were identical before and after the shutdown, unlike Pelosi, who actually lost support during the shutdown battle. So my prediction? The more full of themselves the Democrats get, the more voters learn about this new breed of radical zealots. The lefts are going to want to roll the dice with this crowd and the more they'll start to appreciate President Trump. And if, by the way, the bright lights of the pundit class think that evangelicals are going to abandon the GOP and Trump, they're suffering from delusions of electoral grandeur. The Democrats have completely misread what happened in November. They captured one House of Congress and handily, of course. But this doesn't mean that the American people are willing to ditch capitalism for socialism or that they have abandoned totally their core humanity for cold convenience. But I'll tell you, many Democrats have. Like Virginia State Delegate Kathy Tran pressed here by House Majority Leader in Virginia about her latest abortion bill."

This is the Democrat Party decomposing for all to see. While a good chunk of Trump voters, they might get tired of some of his tweets. I get it. Or they just want him to dial back the drama on occasion. It's really hard to see how independents in any way, shape, or form are going to cozy up to this Democrat Party."

So, my friends, next time if someone tells you \"It's all over for Trump,\" just remember, the full effects and the start costs of the Democrat agenda are just now coming to light for many Americans. They say that there are two sure things in life: death and taxes. But do you really want to be a party that advocates for both? And that's “The Angle.” Joining me now with reaction, to the war on religion in the Democrat Party is Bill Donohue, President of The Catholic League. Bill, why do you think the Democrat Party today is so hell-bent on removing all limitations on abortion. It used to be safe, legal, and rare. But now, it's full on embrace of infanticide, and many Roman Catholic politicians, I might add, advocating for it."

And in Virginia, you have a man who is justifying infanticide. The American people, by the way, do not know about what's happening. I live in New York. When - they didn't tell everybody here in New York what was happening. The way they poached it was saying, well, this is going to codify Roe v. Wade. No, no, no, no. We are talking about partial-birth abortion. You're talking about allowing a child to die on a table unattended if he survives a botched abortion. And you're talking about non- physicians performing abortions. We know which women they'll be. They'll be the ones that Kamala Harris likes to champion. They'll be Black and Hispanic poor women.

And you have to be somebody who is engaged in actually performing it, this ugly procedure. I know that Cuomo would like to be excommunicated. Then he could call - he can claim martyrdom status. But the real question here is why are we allowing in this country a debate - why don't we have a debate about taking a scissors and jamming it into the skull of a child who is 80 percent born? That's what partial-birth abortion is. And then if he survives, then you don't have to attend to him. Every - this I hear in Virginia, what the Governor said, well, it's up to the mother and the physician to decide whether or not the child is attended to."

They just want to get up in the morning, go to work, make a decent living, and get home, maybe crack open a beer. All right. Well, take, for instance, Portland, Maine. It's pretty far from the border. So they shouldn't be impacted, right, by the illegal immigration crisis? Well, wrong. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the city is being overrun by asylum-seekers to the point where they are taking up 90 percent of Portland's family shelters. And city assistance for them is drying up. In fact, 75 percent of all population growth they saw between 2011 and 2016 was from foreign-born individuals. This is wild. For anyone who's spent time up in Portland, and it's cold up there tonight, that is wild. OK. Former Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, warned about this years ago.

When I was Governor, we had a litigation against the City of Portland for that exact reason. I - when the economy started getting better, I removed all the wait lists. We - there was 4,200 people on wait lists. We budgeted for it totally, balanced budget, paid for it. The Democrats came in, took the money, and put the people back on a wait- list. And they're still there now on a wait-list.

But Portland brought it on itself, and people are going to be left to pick up the pieces. Governor, think you so much. In a somewhat related story of how liberalism does damage under the guise of compassion, I don't really like to call it liberalism because it's kind of illiberal when you thing about it. But we're going to take you, though, to the state of Florida. The Sunshine State is also teaming with new immigrant children that not only need to be educated but need to learn the English language in the process, like all new immigrants. But to combat this issue, they aren't establishing more rigorous requirements to graduate but are considering, quote, alternate pathways for immigrants to get their high school diplomas. So I was always taught to raise the bar for people, but now they want to lower the bar because you have such a big influx of immigrants. So Representative Susan Valdes, a Democrat from Tampa, has even proposed to establish test score substitutes for students who cannot pass any of the versions currently allowed. I wish they had that when I was a kid. In other words, the objective standard by which most American students are assessed have been deemed by some to be unfair because some of the kids can't keep up with the material. We've heard that from teachers in the past. A couple nights ago, we defended Tom Brokaw against the completely unfair pile-on that he received following his suggestion that immigrant communities better assimilate to U.S. communities. Like the Brokaw critics, these Florida lawmakers fail to realize that the immigrant communities they wish to serve are only hamstrung, they're held back by lowering standards. And you are also insulting their abilities in limiting their potential in the process. Immigrants should be challenged to rise in America, given the opportunity to do so, but not given a diploma for staying down. All right, coming up, Chris Christie is here live for the rest of the show. This is going to be fun. So does the former New Jersey governor really think he'd be a better president than Trump?

And he's gotten much better deal with Canada and Mexico than we had before. And I think he'll achieve the same things with the EU and with Japan. I think he's been better for us in terms of our regulatory policy, and has put much more of a focus than we were putting on one we controlled Congress and could have done more there, too, on regulatory issues. Now, in the places where I disagree, I think there are times in foreign policy where he acts impulsively. Whether it's some discussions about Syria and the crosscurrents involved there. I think he should take a more deliberative approach. I think he is now taking a more deliberative approach. But listen, in the main, I would say he's made a party better because he won.

And I think the people, that really got their attention, because people are very war-weary, whether it's Syria. They are very war-weary. We've got 2,000 troops in Syria. Everyone wants to knock the crap out of ISIS, and Trump's like, OK, why exactly are our guys still getting killed there? And I think ultimately he's probably going to be more cautious. But the party's turn was in the right direction under Trump, and I think you were closer to that than those other guys."

And those areas in foreign policy where I've disagreed with him at times, and I maybe would have a more aggressive, more interventionist policy than he would have, I don't think that would've determined a loss in the election to me when contrasted up against Hillary Clinton with all the other advantages. But in the end, it doesn't matter. He was the nominee. I was the first person to go out and support him. You were telling me I should do that. And I went out and I did it. And I think that represented a big moment in the campaign when someone who had been seen, at least, as part of the mainstream because I was a governor, even though a very different kind of governor in a blue state, I think that was a big turning point in the primary campaign which I believed he was going to win, and even more important, for the general election."

When the president stays out of the negotiations, we almost always succeed. When he mixes in, it's a formula for failure. So I would ask President Trump, let Congress deal with it on its own."

      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "Listen, the reason he doesn't want Donald Trump involved is because he wants to try to roll over Congressional Republicans. And I just think the idea -- I used to have a saying in Trenton that there were only three important numbers in Trenton, 41, 21, and one -- 41 votes you needed in the lower house to pass a bill, 21 in the upper house, and one, which was the signature of the governor. It's the same thing with different numbers in the Congress. And if you don't have the president involves, you're not going to come to a solution. And so the idea that he wants to keep the president out I think is very Machiavellian on his part. He doesn't want the toughest guy in the room at the table, and he wants to roll some people. And, quite frankly, I think the president has to be involved. Any negotiation without the president is doomed for failure because he won't agree."

Are the left actually helping Trump now as we move into the election cycle?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "They are significantly helping him by continuing to move to the left, putting people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez out in front, being a spokeswoman for the party, talking about a 70 percent tax rate, Kamala Harris talking about eliminating all health insurance companies and having insurance for all. And let's not forget our friend Howard Schultz. I'm going to get a t-shirt made up that says \"Run, Howard, Run.\" Let's go, Howard, get in there, run as an independent. All those things are process things that are helping to shape the landscape to make the contrast even better. What you want in an election politically is a great contrast. You had a great contrast between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. That's what we want again. We don't want people to muddle things up in the middle. We want contrast. Do you want a socialist society, or do you want a capitalistic society? Do you want a society that respects life, or do you want a society that denigrates life? Do you want a society that gives opportunity for everybody, or were government controls everything? Donald Trump has to be able to draw that picture very starkly and clearly. The Democrats, doing what they are doing, are going to help them. He needs to get better people around him, Laura. So many of the mistakes in the first two years of this administration, and I write about this in the book, have been unforced errors, unnecessary errors by people who don't have the experience in Washington, D.C. It's great to be a disrupter. I was a disrupter in Trenton. I would have disrupted in Washington. But I also need to have people around me and he needs to people around him, me as a former prosecutor, him as a businessman, that understands the politics of the capital. And it helps to avoid some of those unforced errors like government shutdown."

My viewers want to know, Chris Christie is no nonsense. You've known Trump for all these years. You have a good managerial sense. You are no-nonsense, and you can take criticism, because I've seen you take criticism because I've given it to you and you actually listen to people.

We learned today, and I learned today, that this was all complete bull, you know what. And tonight it was confirmed that the president announced his intention to nominate the stars in the Ninth Circuit, Daniel Collins, Daniel Bress, and Kenneth Lee, two of them Scalia clerks, all phenomenal. Governor, explain, why is it so important -- the president has really done well on judges. You didn't tick that off earlier. Why is it so important that this Ninth Circuit is not allowed to become a runaway injunction train that's going to run over the president's policies?"

Everybody runs to the Ninth Circuit and the lower district courts in the Ninth Circuit to challenge the president's actions, because they know that the Ninth Circuit is the most activist, ultraliberal of all our circuits. And that's why these nominations are so important. Donald Trump promised to transform the federal courts, and he has done great work, great work at the Supreme Court and the circuit courts. But he has not been able to yet crack the code in the Ninth Circuit. He goes in with Lindsey Graham, pushes these nominations through and fights it, it's going to make a big difference for the last two years."
