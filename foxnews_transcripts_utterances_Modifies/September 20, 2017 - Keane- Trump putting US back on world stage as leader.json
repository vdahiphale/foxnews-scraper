And those 145-mile-per-hour winds were strong enough to rip the sides off, rip balconies down, rip satellite fixtures down. That wind just kept ripping through here and snapping off trees. Widespread damage across the island. This was a worst-case scenario for Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 3.5 million people.  A powerful storm moving diagonally around the most heavily populated eastern tip of the island. As it stands now, there is still danger ahead even after these winds. Widespread flooding, perhaps, flash flooding as well as a storm surge. Right now, as you pointed out, no electricity. There is some generator power behind me and here near the airport, but 3.5 million people; the entire island in the dark. The electrical grid was already weakened by Irma, now it could be the start of a cleanup and recovery that could take months. Martha, back to you.",

Of course, you know, these people -- let's say, I don't think there's any speech that Donald Trump could've given to the U.N. that the people at the U.N. would've liked. They despise him and everything he stands for every bit as much as they love Barack Obama and everything Barack Obama stood for, even before he accomplished a single thing or in my view, failed to accomplish a single thing, but even before he took office they loved him. That said, he did give a very Trumpian speech. I thought it was terrific. I think a lot of people -- I think any, you know, an unbiased observer would agree that it was a great speech. But the real problem -- this is the thing that kills me, Martha -- is listening to the people on the left and listening to Democrats talk about all of these things that Trump didn't address or didn't address properly, or didn't respect, all of these problems were given to us by Barack Obama. And whether it's Russian run amok, whether it's nuclear North Korea or ISIS on the march or the mayhem in Syria, all of this was bequeathed to us by his predecessor.

ADRIAN ELROD, STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE CLINTON 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: No. Look, first of all, Secretary Clinton made very clear in her book and during the campaign, especially when we realized that there may have been significant influence by the Russians and potential collusion by the Russians and the Trump campaign. We sounded the alarm that she's talking about today around this time last year, if not before. But I'm glad that she's going here in her book because, first of all, when Secretary Clinton speaks, people listen. She makes a point, it drives news, we're talking about it tonight, for example. Secondly, the Russians did have a lot of issues. I mean, it's indisputable they did have an influence on this election. What we don't know is to the extent that they may have had a contact in collusion with Donald Trump's campaign. So, again, she's sounded the alarm, she's speaking. I love her Revere comment because I think, again, that drives headlines and that's what we're talking about. And we need -- regardless if you're a Democrat or Republican, everyone in this country should be concerned about any adversarial government trying to influence the election process.",

So, maybe today after she's lost the election, she's decrying the involvement of Russia and saying that they are a foe of the United States. But when she was secretary of state, she sought a reset, she turned a blind eye to their expansionism and she dismissed them as being a foe and called anybody who thought that as being irrational. So, you know, this book, I'm reading the book. First of all, she misquotes me on page nine, but that's a minor thing. This book depicts, just as her speeches are, that the American people are a bunch of racist and misogynist and deplorable, and that she is the victim of an unfair campaign.

First of all, Keith Ellison is the last person who should be making holocaust reference considering that he spent the last 30 years of his life opposing Jews. I mean, he was very close with nation of Islam -- in that 1990's. He gave a lead-off speech for a guy name, -- Mohammed, who is so radical that he was thrown out of the nation of Islam for anti-Semitism. He's tried to back off of that in recent years. But Alan Dershowitz said that if Keith Ellison had been appointed head of the DNC, he would have left the Democratic Party wholesale. Keith Ellison is not the guy to be making this particular reference to begin. If Keith Ellison had been around in 1941, I have my doubts about what he would have done with Jews trying to hide from Nazis. But beyond that, the reference with regard to ICE, that ICE is somehow a Nazi force enforcing immigration laws is just an absurd. And the idea that people who are here illegally, who have been living in the country in largely freedom, many of their kids are going to public schools, they're taking advantage of public benefits, they have jobs here. The idea that this is the same thing is making legal citizens of your country illegal, and then throwing them into concentration camps or gassing them is just beyond the pale.

The practice began in the NFL by Colin Kaepernick, and that happened this Sunday during the national anthem. They did it in protest. This is an 8 and under league. The coach said that the young players wanted to do it in protest of the St. Louis cop killing verdict, which as you know has caused a lot of problems in St. Louis. We're told the parents supported the coach's decision to take a knee, and that the coach thought it was a good teaching moment. He said he likes to teach them about integrity and honesty.

A powerful storm moving diagonally around the most heavily populated eastern tip of the island. As it stands now, there is still danger ahead even after these winds. Widespread flooding, perhaps, flash flooding as well as a storm surge. Right now, as you pointed out, no electricity.

I think that that very clear message is something that's very, very important. Of course, you know, these people -- let's say, I don't think there's any speech that Donald Trump could've given to the U.N. that the people at the U.N. would've liked. They despise him and everything he stands for every bit as much as they love Barack Obama and everything Barack Obama stood for, even before he accomplished a single thing or in my view, failed to accomplish a single thing, but even before he took office they loved him. That said, he did give a very Trumpian speech. I thought it was terrific. I think a lot of people -- I think any, you know, an unbiased observer would agree that it was a great speech. But the real problem -- this is the thing that kills me, Martha -- is listening to the people on the left and listening to Democrats talk about all of these things that Trump didn't address or didn't address properly, or didn't respect, all of these problems were given to us by Barack Obama. And whether it's Russian run amok, whether it's nuclear North Korea or ISIS on the march or the mayhem in Syria, all of this was bequeathed to us by his predecessor.

Yet, despite the fact that Trump's own administration is saying that Iran is not making a nuclear weapon, the administration -- he is winking and nodding saying that he's going to blow up this agreement and blow up American credibility with the world, with the Iranians. and with North Korea, who if we want to enter into some sort of agreement so that they would rid themselves of nuclear weapons, they'll point to what we did with Iran -- where we broke our word when we said that we would keep an agreement with them that the Iranians were keeping, but the United States did not."

And to Trump, direct, bold, fearless, he has been, for nine months, and I've been watching this very closely to see what are the contours of Donald Trump's foreign policy and national security direction, and this is consistent with the direction he's moving in -- and that is to put America back on the world stage as a global leader promoting stability, security, and prosperity.

They are now marauding over Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. They are trying to dominate entire region. North Korea is not trying to do that. Iran has been in the killing business for a long time outside of its own country. North Korea is in the killing business, certainly, inside of its own country.

So, this argument was made in a number of places today that Hillary Clinton is really not standing on firm ground when she says that she's been warning people about Russia. ADRIAN ELROD, STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE CLINTON 2016 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: No. Look, first of all, Secretary Clinton made very clear in her book and during the campaign, especially when we realized that there may have been significant influence by the Russians and potential collusion by the Russians and the Trump campaign. We sounded the alarm that she's talking about today around this time last year, if not before. But I'm glad that she's going here in her book because, first of all, when Secretary Clinton speaks, people listen. She makes a point, it drives news, we're talking about it tonight, for example. Secondly, the Russians did have a lot of issues. I mean, it's indisputable they did have an influence on this election. What we don't know is to the extent that they may have had a contact in collusion with Donald Trump's campaign. So, again, she's sounded the alarm, she's speaking. I love her Revere comment because I think, again, that drives headlines and that's what we're talking about. And we need -- regardless if you're a Democrat or Republican, everyone in this country should be concerned about any adversarial government trying to influence the election process."

In fact, back then, Mitt Romney said that he thought Russia was a nation that lines up with the world's worst actors, which, you know, now turns out to be true in a lot of places. And at this point, that narrative has been completely lost. Democrats seem to have invented it."

The 1980's are calling, they want their foreign policy back dismissing this as inaccurate. What was interesting was what happened next. The secretary of state, who normally stays on the sidelines in political campaigns, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton jumped into it and attacked Mitt Romney, saying his views were dated. So, maybe today after she's lost the election, she's decrying the involvement of Russia and saying that they are a foe of the United States. But when she was secretary of state, she sought a reset, she turned a blind eye to their expansionism and she dismissed them as being a foe and called anybody who thought that as being irrational. So, you know, this book, I'm reading the book. First of all, she misquotes me on page nine, but that's a minor thing. This book depicts, just as her speeches are, that the American people are a bunch of racist and misogynist and deplorable, and that she is the victim of an unfair campaign. At the woman has no ability to assume responsibility. No losing presidential candidate has ever written a book like this nor should they -- it diminishes her and diminishes the process."

Puerto Rico was slammed today with fierce winds, heavy rainfall that left the entire island without electricity. Authorities say it could be months before they get back regular electricity there. The storm now a category 2, continues to make its way to the Atlantic, and that raises some concerns over where it may head next as it goes north. Would it hit the east coast of the continental U.S.?

And now St. Croix, the southern island here watching the eye wall go right over the island from this storm, and cutting diagonally across Puerto Rico, really the worst-case scenario impacting the entire island, that's what all of it is without power now. Now, the storms is to the north of the island, take a look at that. It is starting to get that back together. Likely will be strengthening backup into a cat 3, cat 4 hurricane at it moves towards the north. Here is what you look at though for hurricane force winds. The darker colors the higher the probability of hurricane force winds. Notice this, less of a chance in across the Dominican Republic, less of a chance in Turks and Caicos. Likely staying just to the north and just to the east there of Turks and Caicos, which would be great news. The official track pulls this off towards the north. And you've said it, it gets very close towards the eastern seaboard, somewhere between the outer banks and Bermuda by the time we gets, say towards Monday and Tuesday. You notice though it's a much weaker storm at that point. It will begin to get pull apart. Likely, we're going to see impacts here primarily coastal erosion and some very strong waves, but if it inches a little bit closer, obviously, those impacts go up.

The president tweeted, quote, Rand Paul is a friend of mine, but he is such a negative force when it comes to fixing health care. Graham-Cassidy bill is great. End's O-care. Meanwhile, the vice president has been literally shuttling back and forth between those U.N. meetings and health care conversations back here in Washington.

Former president Barack Obama declaring that to see people trying to undo his hard-won progress is, quote, aggravating to him. Critics immediately pass on social media the real aggravation goes to people who lost their doctors and health plans. And you have to watch this because the other big thing here is the former president getting involved may actually get the right more excited, more invested in this vote, and rally behind the current president, President Trump, right after President Obama's comments.

Hillary Clinton said it was cruel. So you're calling Bill Cassidy, you're saying this man is a liar, he is cruel, he is a moral garbage truck fire starter, so he's immoral, cruel and dishonest.

But, you know, the point is that should we be looking for -- because a lot of people have questioned whether or not Jimmy Kimmel is actually right on the facts when he talks about this policy.

So, if he and his bosses want to put an hour up about the reproductive habits of chinchillas, or if they want to do a firing line hour-long health care debate, it's up to them. They can do whatever they want to do, and that's what's great about this country. My point, my problem here is the degree to which -- and Republicans have done it, too, but in this instance we're talking what Democrats, the degree to which they become personal attacks on individuals who are in the arena. They're trying to fix things, whether you agree with Bill Cassidy or not, I don't care. What I care about is when people get in the arena and try to have a civil discussion and try to talk about issues it immediately goes to invective. It goes to ad hominem personal attacks. You cannot run a country this way. If federalism is immoral, then the federal government itself is immoral, and it's time for us to face facts."

But you make a great point, which is that once we get into this purely emotional area, unfortunately, very few people end up with the facts on the table that they need to make a decision about how they feel about the legislation.

Ben, good to see again, tonight, welcome back to the program."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, there are about one bajillion things wrong with everything that he just said. First of all, Keith Ellison is the last person who should be making holocaust reference considering that he spent the last 30 years of his life opposing Jews. I mean, he was very close with nation of Islam -- in that 1990's. He gave a lead-off speech for a guy name, -- Mohammed, who is so radical that he was thrown out of the nation of Islam for anti-Semitism. He's tried to back off of that in recent years. But Alan Dershowitz said that if Keith Ellison had been appointed head of the DNC, he would have left the Democratic Party wholesale. Keith Ellison is not the guy to be making this particular reference to begin. If Keith Ellison had been around in 1941, I have my doubts about what he would have done with Jews trying to hide from Nazis. But beyond that, the reference with regard to ICE, that ICE is somehow a Nazi force enforcing immigration laws is just an absurd. And the idea that people who are here illegally, who have been living in the country in largely freedom, many of their kids are going to public schools, they're taking advantage of public benefits, they have jobs here. The idea that this is the same thing is making legal citizens of your country illegal, and then throwing them into concentration camps or gassing them is just beyond the pale. It's insane language from Ellison, but nothing shocking considering who Ellison is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, unfortunately, has become all too convenient in this debate to sort of go directly to the Nazi argument. You know, the idea that anyone who is conservative is sort of somewhere on that spectrum that is espoused by some people, and appears to be used as, sort of, a tangential argument here by Keith Ellison, really puts this in a place -- you know, it goes back to what we were talking about in the last segment where everything is so fired up, so emotional, that we have little opportunity to actually have a good, solid exchange of ideas that doesn't go to that place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, on the internet it's called Godwin's Law, the idea of the first person to invoke the Nazi losses the argument. And in this particular case, I think it's a pretty good example of it. I mean, Keith Ellison could make a decent argument in favor of DACA. I think he would have to make a strong argument against President Trump, who apparently wants to re-enshrine DACA with the help of congress. But, again, comparing our law enforcement officers at ICE to Nazis is about the most insulting thing that I've heard since, like, the senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin, did the same thing (INAUDIBLE). It seems like certain Democrats from the Midwest sometimes have problems with these sorts of linguistic analogs."

He will take some questions about what's been going on at the U.N. this week. So stay with Fox throughout the evening for more news to come on that. That's expected about 10 minutes from now. And finally tonight, a story that has been going viral. Every player on this peewee football team, peewee football team in Illinois took a knee. The practice began in the NFL by Colin Kaepernick, and that happened this Sunday during the national anthem. They did it in protest. This is an 8 and under league. The coach said that the young players wanted to do it in protest of the St. Louis cop killing verdict, which as you know has caused a lot of problems in St. Louis. We're told the parents supported the coach's decision to take a knee, and that the coach thought it was a good teaching moment. He said he likes to teach them about integrity and honesty. So what do you think about that? Send me a tweet @MarthaMaccallum using the #TheStory. We'll see you right back here tomorrow night at 7:00. My colleague and friend Tucker Carlson coming up next from D.C. We'll see you tomorrow. END Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
