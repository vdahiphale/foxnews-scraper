Well, that's true, by the way as Democrats across the country learned the hard way today. Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified on Capitol Hill this morning. If you watch the other cable channels, you're probably accustomed to thinking of Robert Mueller as a kind of progressive superhero sent here from on high to do battle with the diabolical Mr. Orange on behalf of the forces of light and justice.  Hollywood literally produced a comic book about Robert Mueller. That's how convinced they were of his power and goodness. Single handedly, Robert Mueller was going to save America. And then came the long, sad spectacle of today.",

Well, it turns out that if you're watching this show right now, you almost certainly know more about the Russia investigation than the man who led the Russia investigation.   You know that Fusion GPS is the democratic oppo firm that paid Christopher Steele to produce the Trump dossier. Fusion GPS is the reason we're talking about Russia right now. In fact, Fusion GPS is the reason we had a Mueller investigation in the first place. But of course, you knew that because you're paying attention. Somehow Robert Mueller himself did not know that. What does that say about Robert Mueller? Well, this isn't a medical program, so we're not going to speculate about it. What we can say for certain, though, is that Robert Mueller never should have been testifying before Congress today. He didn't want to come. He came because Democrats forced him. They knew his condition. They were happy to exploit him anyway, and they did. To the left, the individual is always far less important than the mission, and the mission never changes, acquiring political power. Watch, the congenitally shameless Jerry Nadler of New York use Mueller as a kind of human backboard, throw the question -- get it back.",

Second, Mueller himself said today that he was able to conduct and conclude his investigation, unhindered. Third, I think the substance of the investigation was really called into question, particularly even looking at the fact that Aaron Zebley was sitting next to him, a guy who represented Justin Cooper, a top Hillary Clinton aide, who both set up the server -- the private server -- and also destroyed evidence. Also, I think what Representative Ratcliffe pointed out is the fact that President Trump was denied his presumption of innocence by Mueller and his team.

Those 13 Democrats were close allies of Hillary Clinton, in some cases, donors to her or lawyers for people closely associated with her, but you couldn't criticize because Robert Mueller who was a nominal Republican, was beyond reproach. And what we learned today was that Robert Mueller is not very familiar with the investigation that he was the figurehead of. The entire question of Russia collusion, we were told for years that Donald Trump was a traitor who colluded with Russia to steal the election -- that imploded. Then we were told, well, he got upset about being called the traitor and that might be obstruction. I don't think that case was well made today. People keep trying to keep us from asking questions.

Well, that's true, by the way as Democrats across the country learned the hard way today. Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified on Capitol Hill this morning. If you watch the other cable channels, you're probably accustomed to thinking of Robert Mueller as a kind of progressive superhero sent here from on high to do battle with the diabolical Mr. Orange on behalf of the forces of light and justice. Hollywood literally produced a comic book about Robert Mueller. That's how convinced they were of his power and goodness. Single handedly, Robert Mueller was going to save America. And then came the long, sad spectacle of today. Here's the actual Robert Mueller caught without his cape and mask, squirming under the cold light of television cameras."

In fact, Fusion GPS is the reason we had a Mueller investigation in the first place. But of course, you knew that because you're paying attention. Somehow Robert Mueller himself did not know that. What does that say about Robert Mueller? Well, this isn't a medical program, so we're not going to speculate about it. What we can say for certain, though, is that Robert Mueller never should have been testifying before Congress today. He didn't want to come. He came because Democrats forced him. They knew his condition. They were happy to exploit him anyway, and they did. To the left, the individual is always far less important than the mission, and the mission never changes, acquiring political power.

Mueller just told us that he doesn't know if Christopher Steele is lying about the basis of the entire Russia investigation. Nope, he doesn't know. And by the way, he doesn't care. Keep in mind, Robert Mueller is the very same man who as of right now is trying to send Roger Stone to prison for the rest of his life, for telling minor and totally irrelevant lies, allegedly, that hurt no one. But he doesn't care to know if Christopher Steele is lying about the most important question in the investigation, to which he has dedicated two and half years of his life.

So, I thought somehow, it was an act, some of it, you know, he's just the older gentleman. But that does not excuse him putting this country through hell as a special prosecutor dragging this thing out. I don't know if you're aware, but back last summer, he was on with Harris Faulkner and she was saying, \"Well, Rudy Giuliani is saying he is going to be done for the end of the summary. Didn't want to let it affect the election,\" I said, \"He doesn't know Mueller like I do.\" This guy is going to keep this thing going as long as he can, and he is certainly not going to end it before the 2018 election. I knew the guy. I knew he wouldn't do that. He would probably have continued, if we hadn't had a strong Attorney General come in and see that he had nothing after two years. This is my speculation.

As you know, there's a court case going on right now in the District Court of D.C., where an indictment was brought against the so-called troll farms for election fraud. The defendant say, \"Wait a second. You guys published this entire report linking us to the Kremlin. There is no connection.\" The judge says, \"Fair point. That's prejudicial. Department of Justice, show us your evidence linking these troll farms to the Russian government.\" And the DOJ says, \"We don't have any evidence.\" That is stunning."

Why did so many people in Washington, including a lot of Republicans, I can say, Congressman Hurd I saw today, fall hook, line and sinker for this Russia must be behind everything idea, and not asked the questions that you did."

What we found out on May 28th, during this court hearing is they don't have any evidence. The judge says, \"This is awful. I'm going to consider contempt of court citations against the government.\" The very next day is when Robert Mueller called his press conference, and in that press conference, in one line, he very cleverly separates out the allegation that the troll forms were connected to the Russian government from the rest of his report. I asked him did that have anything to do with the court hearing the prior day? He said, \"No,\" I'm sorry, that really doesn't pass the smell test."

And then a former entertainment producer called Jeffrey Zucker took over the place. Zucker has long aspired to run for office as a Democrat. He has bragged about it. And so he decided to use CNN as his personal mouthpiece for political purposes. Net result -- more than any other media company, by far CNN bears responsibility for promoting the absurd Russia hoax day and night for years. At times, Zucker's puppets on the channel openly colluded with Robert Mueller's prosecutors. For one example, Mueller's team clearly tipped off CNN before arresting Roger Stone at his home in Florida. There was a CNN crew on the scene before dawn to humiliate Stone as armed Federal agents barged into his home at 6:00 a.m. for purposes that have never been clear, even to this day. Congressman Chris Stewart of Utah asked about that during today's hearing, here's how Mueller responded."

It was clearly within the guardrails that he had set up with things that he would and would not talk about. And I think it was important for people to know were individuals within the Special Counsel leaking information, and by the way, Tucker, if you noticed, I made this point before. In every one of these cases, all 25 of them, it was always information that was detrimental to the President. It was always embarrassing and meant to diminish him. They never leaked anything that exonerated him, to use the word you just used, or that seemed to indicate that you know, there was innocence involved. It was always negative information.

You always have the right to go to the public forum and to tell your side of the story, especially, Tucker, as you just pointed out, when the government isn't muzzled. The government hasn't been held back on this. And even when they are held back, many times they leak information anyway. You look at this, and by the way, Mr. Stone, who is a bit of a character and someone I've gotten to know a little bit, but he's not the only one who's been treated in this way."

Why is it impossible to get answers from the Federal government about the FISA process? And was the F.B.I. and Department of Justice, honest about their application to the FISA? I mean, we could go down a list of dozens and dozens of questions. And by the way, something that I never really understood and that is, this administration has empowered you. Look at some of these individuals and think, \"Hey, look, we're trying to help you. We're trying to facilitate, you know, truth and transparency here.\" If Hillary Clinton had been elected President, I could understand why we've hit so many roadblocks.

And he, I have to say this, for all of some of his other failings today, he clearly prepped hard on that. He did not give them the opportunity that they wanted. And he did not in any way didn't do any audio for them. He wouldn't read his own report for them.

The party is also hopelessly divided over this between the sort of crazies that are desperate to impeach Trump, parts of the resistance, and then the calmer heads like Nancy Pelosi who know that that can be terribly bad for them politically. So, those who really want impeachment, this was their last gasp to get Mueller. A hope that he gave them some great soundbites, gin up the troops, and I don't think that they stopped to consider his ability to manage a hearing like this, or the fact that he had no interest whatsoever in putting himself in the middle of a political fray. And he definitely was careful not to do so."

By the way, I think the only person in Washington perhaps more happy with Mueller's appearance than Donald Trump would be Nancy Pelosi, who doesn't want to go down the impeachment road, and he made it a lot easier for her today. You know, I mean, I just think that in general, they didn't know where else to go with this. The report did not help them out. And look at -- think about how disingenuous this was, in a way, too, Tucker. We have been hearing from the day that Mueller put out his report that all they wanted to do was talk to him so that they could ask him more questions about the underlying evidence. There were no questions like that today. All there was, was attempt after attempt to get Mueller to agree to publicly say that Trump had committed a crime."

And so they wanted to make it into a TV show or a movie. And they tried and their star fell flat on his face. And let me say also that and you know, God bless, Mr. Mueller, but the Democrats and the committee were not up to the task either. They were ill- prepared. They didn't have what I thought were intelligent questions. I don't think they moved anything forward. Whatever it is they were trying to achieve, I don't think they achieved it. Mr. Mueller really deflected almost every Republican question with a \"That's not within my purview.\" The word purview was used more times today than any other single day in television history.

She watched the hearings today. Lisa Boothe, I understand that the people running for President are on the road. It's hard to catch up with the news. I've been there, I get it. But they also seem unusually unwilling to readjust their perceptions to suit reality, if you know what I mean."

      "utterance": "I do. But it's intentional, Tucker. And that's the key point to keep in mind. The reason they're doing this is because they're running in the Democratic primary. Those are the voters they're concerned about right now, that progressive base that wants to impeach President Trump, even if it's to the detriment to the party as a whole. And you contrast that Tucker to what Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been doing. She doesn't want to move forward on impeachment because she wants to protect the Democratic majority in the House and she knows that that majority runs through districts that President Trump won in 2016. And the problem for Democrats is that President Trump has two important things going for him. One, he is an incumbent; two, the economy is strong. So, they have been desperately hoping that Robert Mueller and both the reports, and his testimony today would somehow do irreparable harm to President Trump, but it simply just did not happen."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I understand the strategy completely. But at some point, and it's not that far off, one of these -- in fact, it's a year from now, one of these candidates is going to be the Democratic nominee and it's going to have to pivot and appeal to the whole country. This is pretty late to be pretending that they can impeach Trump, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think from us, if you're an objective observer, yes, but if you're a partisan Democrat who despises this President, you want to keep hearing what you want to keep hearing, which is \"Let's impeach the President.\""

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "\"It's still possible, we can still do this.\" But as we both know, and what the majority of the country knows who actually watched today, is they did a lot of damage to that impeachment narrative for three key reasons. One, Mueller was a terrible witness. Even David Axelrod admitted this saying it was very painful to watch him in a tweet. Second, Mueller himself said today that he was able to conduct and conclude his investigation, unhindered. Third, I think the substance of the investigation was really called into question, particularly even looking at the fact that Aaron Zebley was sitting next to him, a guy who represented Justin Cooper, a top Hillary Clinton aide, who both set up the server -- the private server -- and also destroyed evidence. Also, I think what Representative Ratcliffe pointed out is the fact that President Trump was denied his presumption of innocence by Mueller and his team. So, I think for those three reasons, Mueller did a lot of damage to Democrats' impeachment narrative."

      "utterance": "Thank you. In a resurfaced interview from 2018, Ilhan Omar told Al Jazeera that America ought to engage in racial profiling of white men, whom she blamed for, quote, \"Most of the deaths within this country.\" In the same interview, Omar said America shouldn't worry about young Muslims leaving her State of Minnesota to fight for ISIS or Al-Shabaab. The real -- I'm not making this up -- I've got a pause right here, because we're not making this up. It's hard to believe, but we're actually not, this is real. Omar said the real concern was the rhetoric of local politicians, which apparently drove these young terrorists into terrorism. In short, Ilhan Omar is a lunatic, an embarrassing blight on American politics, but hopefully, one that will eventually pass. Recently, the group Judicial Watch filed a formal ethics complaint against Omar. The group requested a full investigation into matters that include potential tax fraud, marriage fraud, and immigration fraud, as well as perjury. Tom Fitton is the President of Judicial Watch, and he joins us tonight. Tom, thanks for coming on. What are you hoping to find from Congresswoman Omar?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH",
      "utterance": "Well, whether she's a crook or not. The House Ethics Committee needs to begin the process of figuring out whether the strong evidence of marriage and other criminal activity or marriage fraud and other criminal activity is accurate, in terms of she did it. And you know, we've had Powerline blog, and you've had them on talking about their comprehensive investigation. Her left-wing hometown newspaper has basically said these allegations are out there, she hasn't disproven them, and has raised more questions than answers. And it's about time for the House Ethics process to begin to work. Now, I say that knowing that the House Ethics Committee is split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, but the American people are probably going to want the House to make sure that Ms. Omar who may have committed marriage fraud by marrying her brother, and then we know for sure that she was signing incorrect tax returns. So, the extent of the criminality needs to be explored. And if the Houses are going to -- the House needs to do it. But the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the IRS need to do something as well. This is -- you know, she has been protected from this scandal by the big media for a long time. And you know, we've got to lift that protection. She is not above the law, you know, and this isn't about her crazy socialism and her anti-American statements. This is about whether she just follows the basic rules that other Americans would be subject to severe scrutiny over if they were seeing to be breaking them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Some scrutiny. I mean, she's credibly accused of coming here to this country under a false identity, marrying her brother. Clearly she lied about it. I'm just going to say that flatly. She lied about it. She said she was married in her faith tradition, she wasn't. She was married by a Christian Minister."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

And this is about the most significant congressional scandal by a member that, you know, I'm aware of, you know, you have to go back to Traficant, I think back in Ohio to come up with something so far out. But in terms of the scope of the potential criminality, this is pretty significant. And the question is that, if this doesn't go forward, it's probably going to be because Democrats are protecting her. And so you know, they tell us today at the Mueller hearing, because we know they don't believe it that no one is above the law. The question for the House Democrats is Ms. Omar above the law?"

But to Democrats in the Congress, Americans are, quote, \"not fully exonerated, and therefore they're guilty.\" Congressman James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin blasted Mueller for enabling this Democratic talking point. Watch this."

Now, you didn't use the word impeachable conduct like Starr did. There was no statute to prevent you from using the word, impeachable conduct. And I go back to what Mr. Ratcliffe said, and that is, is that even the President is innocent until proven guilty. My time is up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, that's it. That's it right there. Congressman Sensenbrenner joins us and for raising that point. It's not a defense of any specific politician, it's a defense of the centerpiece of our justice, which is the presumption of innocence. Why is that getting lost?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SENSENBRENNER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's getting lost because Democrats want it to get lost. After sitting through this hearing today, I think it's over. The case is closed. Let's have the country move on. We've got a whole lot of things to do -- crisis at the border, deficits, fiscal responsibility, healthcare, I can go on and on and on. But Chairman Nadler and the left-wing of the Democratic Party, you know, is absolutely zeroed in on impeachment. Good luck getting that after the performance today, both in the Judiciary Committee and in the Intelligence Committee."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SENSENBRENNER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you're going to have to ask the Democrats on that. You know, I've known Bob Mueller since my Chairmanship of that committee 15 years ago, and today, he wasn't the person he was five years ago. Now, whether or not the Democrats knew it and, you know, trying to put a good face on, I don't know. You know, the fact is, is that, you know, I kind of felt sorry for Bob Mueller, because he evaded questions about a hundred times. And, you know, he was their star witness. If I were sitting on a jury, you know, I wouldn't put a lot of credibility into him."

I don't think there's anybody that would say he did well. I looked at your people. They're saying it was devastating for the Democrats. The performance was obviously not very good. He had a lot of problems. But what he showed more than anything else is that this whole thing has been three years of embarrassment and waste of time for our country. The Democrats had nothing. And now they have less than nothing."

And so to close out our hour, we want to turn to someone who has actual mastery of the Russia story. That person certainly is not Robert Mueller as we saw today. That person is the great Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and a very frequent guest on the show on this subject. She joins us right tonight. Mollie, you obviously watched all of this. This kind of coda to this long story. What do you make of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it was really interesting. We were told for years that you could not criticize the Special Counsel or Robert Mueller in any way precisely because Robert Mueller had such credibility. That's what we were told. That, yes, he had hired 13 Democrats and no Republicans to run this investigation. Those 13 Democrats were close allies of Hillary Clinton, in some cases, donors to her or lawyers for people closely associated with her, but you couldn't criticize because Robert Mueller who was a nominal Republican, was beyond reproach. And what we learned today was that Robert Mueller is not very familiar with the investigation that he was the figurehead of. The entire question of Russia collusion, we were told for years that Donald Trump was a traitor who colluded with Russia to steal the election -- that imploded. Then we were told, well, he got upset about being called the traitor and that might be obstruction. I don't think that case was well made today. People keep trying to keep us from asking questions. But I think that now more than ever, people need to know, how was the Special Counsel setup? How were the people picked for it? How did they understand their job? How did the investigation of the Russia hoax begin with? And these are questions that Robert Mueller was unable and unwilling to answer today, but people will need those answers."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "The fact that he made baseless allegations against Russia and I know, having been accused of being a hand maiden to Vladimir Putin, and maybe I shouldn't say this, but there is something kind of infuriating and really wrong about changing our foreign policy on the basis of lies. I mean, is that a concern as well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, even just the role that people being upset about foreign policy motivated quite a bit of this investigation, we learned that the Special Counsel was setup in part because bureaucrats opposed the foreign policy that voters put in place by electing Donald Trump."
