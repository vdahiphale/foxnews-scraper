So, he's just basically putting it out there. I don't think he's afraid. I think that's a talking point. You can always tell when the bat phone, the bat signal has gone out with the -- everybody say the word afraid today and you'll get a gold star in your chart at the end of the day. The thing about Schiff having the whistleblower complaint before, it does - - I think for Nancy Pelosi, her deputizing him to be basically the spokesperson on this is not a clear-cut win for her, because he want made up -- the parity of the phone call that he led the serious hearing with is -- just keeps coming up over and over again. And then there's this question of why weren't you completely forthcoming?  Now, I think they have a good point that they can say, well, the White House had the heads-up about the whistleblower account because the CIA had gone to the White House lawyers first of all before they went to the Justice Department.  So that gets a little bit more complicated. But I think Schiff as the spokesperson for this is not necessarily great for Nancy Pelosi, but I don't think she has any other good options.

And just because Joe Biden happens to be running against the president doesn't make him above the law, OK? He could drop out tomorrow and then Trump could ask China? Get out of here. You're saying the U.S. government and the Chinese government and the Ukrainian government can't ask questions about the Biden family because he's a politician? It's crazy.  So, I believe that Trump's -- any sort of FEC violation. Also, it boils down to this, Trump is draining the swamp and that's what the Democrats want him impeach him for. And they care more about him fingering their corruption than the actual corrupt acts themselves. And he's going to swing for the fences like you've said. He's going to double down and do this right out in the sunlight, and he's going to say why are you trying to impeach me? Let the Americans vote on this.  Now, the Chinese thing also uncovered some interesting facts about Hunter, because Hunter is in business with John Kerry's son-in-law, a Heinz, and what did they do in 2017? They cut a deal with a Chinese communist backed company for $600 million for an automobile firm. And you know what the Chinese-backed company had done a few years before? Stolen American technology and used it on their stealth fighter jets. And you know who let the deal go through? John Kerry when he was secretary of state, also, while Joe Biden was vice president. To say that that is zero evidence of corruption, you put that to the American people and you think they're going to say, oh, yeah, nothing to see here? That's crazy. And there's a long laundry list of Biden family members for sale. If you look at Hunter, if you look at his brother. His $1.5 billion deal in Iraq, while Joe was the point man for Iraq. So the whole thing is crazy. And if you look at what Hillary Clinton was, when she was running for Senate in 2000 in New York, Bill Clinton pardoned all of those Puerto Rican terrorists so she could get the Puerto Rican vote.   Or in 1999 when Rudy was mayor here, and he was considering running for Senate against Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton sent the feds to go investigate Rudy and the NYPD. So, there's no corruption there? Or how about Hillary when she's secretary of state or running for president, her foundation is getting tens of millions of dollars from Morocco, Saudi Arabia, that's not foreign interference in the election?

It brings up the issue of corruption. And Joe Biden now has been inconsistent in his account of his talks with his son.  So, just now in that clip he says zero, zero, zero evidence of any corruption or wrongdoing. But when you say zero, zero, zero, you better be correct because when something comes up in the future, especially in a campaign, you're going to get nailed on it either by Trump or all the other Democrats running in the party. And Elizabeth Warren is now -- I think going to be the front runner pretty soon when it comes to leaping over Joe Biden.  She hasn't really jump on to this because she's allowing Joe Biden to get over this with Trump. But, you know, Joe Biden might not even be the nominee, so what's the question then?

We have to pretend as we report this stuff that to you we believe that it's really, really important, when for us it's just a carousel that we've got to hop on and then hop off at the end of the day.

Now, some Democrats will say, well, there's a law and the law says you can't do this. But then, President Trump is saying, well, there's laws against corruption as well. So, he's just basically putting it out there. I don't think he's afraid. I think that's a talking point. You can always tell when the bat phone, the bat signal has gone out with the -- everybody say the word afraid today and you'll get a gold star in your chart at the end of the day. The thing about Schiff having the whistleblower complaint before, it does - - I think for Nancy Pelosi, her deputizing him to be basically the spokesperson on this is not a clear-cut win for her, because he want made up -- the parity of the phone call that he led the serious hearing with is -- just keeps coming up over and over again. And then there's this question of why weren't you completely forthcoming? Now, I think they have a good point that they can say, well, the White House had the heads-up about the whistleblower account because the CIA had gone to the White House lawyers first of all before they went to the Justice Department. So that gets a little bit more complicated. But I think Schiff as the spokesperson for this is not necessarily great for Nancy Pelosi, but I don't think she has any other good options. She's probably going to have to drive this train herself."

Our senior judicial analyst, Judge Napolitano, he wrote -- he said, you know, just the summary of the phone call with the President Zelensky of Ukraine shows, and I'm quoting here, criminal and impeachable behavior."

And just because Joe Biden happens to be running against the president doesn't make him above the law, OK? He could drop out tomorrow and then Trump could ask China? Get out of here. You're saying the U.S. government and the Chinese government and the Ukrainian government can't ask questions about the Biden family because he's a politician? It's crazy. So, I believe that Trump's -- any sort of FEC violation. Also, it boils down to this, Trump is draining the swamp and that's what the Democrats want him impeach him for. And they care more about him fingering their corruption than the actual corrupt acts themselves. And he's going to swing for the fences like you've said. He's going to double down and do this right out in the sunlight, and he's going to say why are you trying to impeach me? Let the Americans vote on this. Now, the Chinese thing also uncovered some interesting facts about Hunter, because Hunter is in business with John Kerry's son-in-law, a Heinz, and what did they do in 2017? They cut a deal with a Chinese communist backed company for $600 million for an automobile firm. And you know what the Chinese-backed company had done a few years before? Stolen American technology and used it on their stealth fighter jets. And you know who let the deal go through? John Kerry when he was secretary of state, also, while Joe Biden was vice president. To say that that is zero evidence of corruption, you put that to the American people and you think they're going to say, oh, yeah, nothing to see here? That's crazy. And there's a long laundry list of Biden family members for sale. If you look at Hunter, if you look at his brother. His $1.5 billion deal in Iraq, while Joe was the point man for Iraq. So the whole thing is crazy. And if you look at what Hillary Clinton was, when she was running for Senate in 2000 in New York, Bill Clinton pardoned all of those Puerto Rican terrorists so she could get the Puerto Rican vote. Or in 1999 when Rudy was mayor here, and he was considering running for Senate against Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton sent the feds to go investigate Rudy and the NYPD. So, there's no corruption there? Or how about Hillary when she's secretary of state or running for president, her foundation is getting tens of millions of dollars from Morocco, Saudi Arabia, that's not foreign interference in the election?

They can make their own decision. So I'm going to hold off on my judgment of that. I do want to say that, Jesse, you should do a one more thing that is treaties with Watters, all around the world. Tell us about new treaties --"

The first reason is that it is bringing attention to these accusations that have been written up in mainstream media for over a year, the New Yorker, the New York Times, about Hunter Biden's dealings. It brings up the issue of corruption. And Joe Biden now has been inconsistent in his account of his talks with his son. So, just now in that clip he says zero, zero, zero evidence of any corruption or wrongdoing. But when you say zero, zero, zero, you better be correct because when something comes up in the future, especially in a campaign, you're going to get nailed on it either by Trump or all the other Democrats running in the party. And Elizabeth Warren is now -- I think going to be the front runner pretty soon when it comes to leaping over Joe Biden. She hasn't really jump on to this because she's allowing Joe Biden to get over this with Trump. But, you know, Joe Biden might not even be the nominee, so what's the question then? Do the investigations continue forward if Warren wins? We have to see. Or --"

      "utterance": "They should be scared. Look, I hate complaining about this job. We have a great job. We get paid to talk about stuff. But this story just bugs the crap out of me because I know it's so fake. This is a political story masquerading as a moral, social story, right? It's an attempt to turn hearsay into heresy. It's just a congenial phone call. But it becomes something so big and we have to pretend every day when we come here. We have to pretend as we report this stuff that to you we believe that it's really, really important, when for us it's just a carousel that we've got to hop on and then hop off at the end of the day. Thank God for Hunter Biden because this is just so much easier to understand when he becomes the focus. The American viewer in their home, they don't care about the phone call. They can look at the transcript and see what it is. But everybody understands nepotism. Everybody understands the pampered jack-ass offspring who did nothing productive with his life and just fed off his daddy's name. Everybody knows that guy. Everybody can't stand him. And he's a hood ornament of the swamp jalopy. Right then and there, he is. He is everything that is bad. And then the best part is the media complaining -- not complaining but concerned about Trump's anger yesterday. Oh, he seems so upset. That's like lighting firecrackers and complaining about the noise. That's like going to a fish restaurant and going, you know this taste fishy. Dude, you created this mess. You've been spending three years trying to get the bear to snap. You've got him to snap. I also noticed how happy the media is that Rachel Maddow finally, you know, has a story, right? Because for the last six months, it's been really sad on her show, the numbers are down, but now she's gone -- she's on The View, there's articles about her. It's like her homecoming.

And then -- they own -- I've always said this before that's why I'm tired of saying it. They own the field. They own the refs. They own the equipment. How dare Trump show up and beat them at their own game. You know, they've never had this -- it reminds me a lot of when Fox News showed up and everybody was going, oh, my God, there's this polarization. No, you only liked it when there was one pole, and then you've got another poll and now you've got to deal with that, and it's just not fair. You have to work harder to defend your beliefs. And I think that's what the problem is. As for the, you know, the death threats, we all get the death threats, and that's just part of the game. There's a lot of crazy people out there. And there's a lot of new avenues to go after people. It's very simple. The bar is low for people to do that. But I think it's healthy that for both sides that there are now two sides.

We need to be working on the important -- work -- that people want us to deal with. We have to work on the trade deal, infrastructure, gun control, and lowering drug prices. And she wants to do all these things. Well, she's going to be very measured. And then you had Maxine Waters says, actually, he should be killed, or he should be in solitary confinement.

We witnessed daily destruction of people's lives based on past mistakes that mean nothing compared to something as horrifying and permanent as the murder of a loved one. People today are getting fired over Halloween costumes and pronouns. It's a lesson not just on forgiveness, but the pettiness of our recent and rampant scalp hunting. This courtroom moment should be played every morning in schools and workplaces. Imagine in HR department that showed that to a workforce or a social media company that would hire that young man for its board. It might be one solution for our grievance culture. A diversity of forgiveness. There are all kinds, some more intense than others including Brandt Jean who revealed the selflessness you might never forget or perhaps ever see again.

I don't know if I could forgive someone who shot and killed my brother regardless of the circumstances, it was a horrible awful situation. And I think for him to talk about his faith and to say you know the ultimatum here is that I want the best for you, but I wish that you would give your life to Christ because that's what he believes in.

And of course, when you stop and think about it, you just hope that this is reciprocal because I think in this country, we have a lot of, especially in the court system institutionalized racial issues.
