This is pure energy for the base. And by the way, all the energy in American politics right now, to my mind, is on the left. They are riding high after November. They feel they have Trump on the run. This is a pure base pleasing exercise for the time being. And the polls tend to show, as is often the case, the Republicans are getting blamed for the shutdown. Democrats seem to be paying no price with the broader public. And frankly, I don't think there is a broader public anymore. We have a right, we've got a conservative base, we've got a liberal pace, and they just don't talk.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I'm not sure if I agree with what Charles is saying here about how this is playing out. I don't think it's particularly good to take over the House of Representatives and immediately have a government shutdown that you don't seem to care about, that you have your members vacationing in Puerto Rico or working on other issues. I don't know if that shows a level of seriousness that is particularly good. There's also the issue that I think this is kind of unlike any other shutdown that we've had before in that 75 percent of the government is funded, so I think the polls show that only six percent of American voters even say that the shutdown has affected them negatively. Most people aren't even aware of it. So I'm not sure that it is quite the same situation that we have dealt with before.  At some point I think people are going to have to stop thinking about who gets credit or blame, who does this help or hurt, and just remember there is a government that shut down. There is a fairly modest proposal on the table for border security and other issues that will help with the inflow of drugs and other problems that happen over the border.
