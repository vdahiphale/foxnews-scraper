And look, anyone who engages on social media can see both the very apparent bias like what we saw with Mitch McConnell's Twitter account. And I'm glad that there was a hard line drawn, and that Twitter essentially righted a wrong.   There's also the subtle bias, the people I don't have the ability to go to the big airwaves and draw attention to this. And you could see in both the language of some of these videos that have come out, of some of tech executives apologizing for the results, the 2016 election which we saw with Google.

But mind you, it wasn't Mitch McConnell's volunteers or staffers that were the one saying these vile things, they were simply cataloging and publicizing it. And it's important to note that for a specific period of time, almost 12 hours, Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader didn't have a Twitter account. But Hamas did and Antifa did.  Antifa, the very same organization that does this is -- these sort of a tactics that goes outside of people's private residences, says vile things and sometimes goes as far to assault journalists in the streets. I don't understand how Twitter and these tech companies can continue to do these things, use very sort of loose explanations, and then, be OK with it.

That Senate majority leader's political team that was simply cataloging the hostility and the radicalism towards himself, he is the one that should get penalized for that?

Clearly, there's a difference from the video coming from the Senators campaign showing the violence that was portrayed towards him, which is absolutely awful and has no place on or offline.  But it was also taken down from people that were spreading it because they wanted violence against the majority leader. And that's terrible.

I think there's a close call in particular about whether the federal government has the constitutional authority to regulate gun sales within a state interest -- you know, completely intrastate gun sales but there's authority for the proposition that they can. And my piece which address red flag laws simply points out that while I'm an enthusiastic supporter of the Second Amendment, all of our rights are -- all of our fundamental rights, none of them is absolute. And I would just point out that in terms of predictive judgments that we make, every time someone gets arrested in federal or state court, a judge has to set bail. And even though the Eighth Amendment says that you can't -- you know, you basically have a presumptive right to bail, the court can't set excessive bail.

I'm Jon Scott, in for Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” The three-day saga over the threatening video which is once again viewable on McConnell's campaign account ended after the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and top conservative groups vowed to stop any spending on Twitter advertising if the social media giant didn't \"address this disgusting bias\". Here is President Trump today."

Michael Beckerman of the Internet Association was in that meeting. He will join us in moments to tackle both of these issues. But first, Charlie Kirk, founder and executive director of Turning-Point USA. The president says conservative voices are being stifled online, Charlie. You've said essentially the same thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "That's exactly what's happening. An independent study by Collette showed that out of 22 people that were politically active on Twitter, 21 of them had voice support of President Trump. And the one person that didn't got suspended temporarily from Twitter for posting a personal cellphone number. And look, anyone who engages on social media can see both the very apparent bias like what we saw with Mitch McConnell's Twitter account. And I'm glad that there was a hard line drawn, and that Twitter essentially righted a wrong. There's also the subtle bias, the people I don't have the ability to go to the big airwaves and draw attention to this. And you could see in both the language of some of these videos that have come out, of some of tech executives apologizing for the results, the 2016 election which we saw with Google. And look, these tech companies have an enormous amount of power but they also have an enormous amount of responsibility. Because people look at them as neutral platforms, and they have to start acting like it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, let's talk about the McConnell situation for just a moment. The Senate majority leader is home, recuperating, after breaking his shoulder. His house gets surrounded by protesters, and when his campaign account sends out some video on Twitter of what some of these people were saying, his campaign account gets suspended. How do -- how do they justify that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "And they didn't justify it. Now, it's important to remember that the McConnell team, they appealed the decision, and then, Twitter doubled down. And then, finally, today, Twitter backed off because of such an enormous amount of backlash from the Trump campaign and the Republican Party. But mind you, it wasn't Mitch McConnell's volunteers or staffers that were the one saying these vile things, they were simply cataloging and publicizing it. And it's important to note that for a specific period of time, almost 12 hours, Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader didn't have a Twitter account. But Hamas did and Antifa did. Antifa, the very same organization that does this is -- these sort of a tactics that goes outside of people's private residences, says vile things and sometimes goes as far to assault journalists in the streets. I don't understand how Twitter and these tech companies can continue to do these things, use very sort of loose explanations, and then, be OK with it. But I think there's a lesson here, that if you put that, if you attack the pocketbook, and you threaten that, some very -- some very real change can occur."

    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "I would have to -- well, I think it might be two-pronged. I think that plays a part in a piece of it. Because imagine, it's not just the Trump campaign and the Republican Party, but imagine, all Republicans did it. Look, I mean, if they actually want the most amount of business, why would they want to disenfranchise 40 to 45 if at most 50 percent of the country, it's not good for business. But secondly, this is an indefensible position that they were taking. That Senate majority leader's political team that was simply cataloging the hostility and the radicalism towards himself, he is the one that should get penalized for that? It's inexcusable, but this is a pattern of behavior, it's a pattern behavior from these tech companies and their excuses are flimsy at best and this is a major issue heading in 2020. I applaud the president for tackling it head-on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Real quickly, you have said that conservatives tend to acknowledge this bias, pointed out, and then, kind of throw up their hands and say, that's the way of the Internet these days. What do you think they should do beyond that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a difficult question, because as conservatives, we're inherently more appreciative of the free market. And we don't want to use regulatory power, we don't want to put more bureaucrats towards any sort of problem. But this is a difficult conversation that's happening right now on the right. And you see it in robust -- in a robust conversation which is what is the proper role of government when you have three or four companies that control basically all the lines of communication online. Are they monopolies? Should they be treated as monopolies? Should be platforms or publishers? And I think though, the lesson here is that we as conservatives should not just throw up our hands and say there's nothing we can do. There is something we can do, I think the Republican Party and the Trump campaign did the right thing through trying to challenge the pocketbook. I think a conversation needs to happen about what is the correct role of government and potential litigation against these tech companies."

We all have a role to play, and the meeting at the White House was a great conversation. Very productive about talking about all the positive things that our members are doing as good actors in society. On trying to take down hate speech and extremist content from the platforms to be part of the solution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, but what about the kind of thing that we were just talking about with Charlie Kirk. When Mitch McConnell's campaign account puts out a video of the threats that are being directed against him and gets suspended? Can you explain that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECKERMAN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And this is -- this has greatly shows how difficult his calls are. The reason that, that video was taken down was they have terms of service they don't want, violent speech or threats against people. The video was not just taken down from Senator McConnell's campaign. It was taken down across accounts because it was threatening harm against him. And again, it shows a difference. Clearly, there's a difference from the video coming from the Senators campaign showing the violence that was portrayed towards him, which is absolutely awful and has no place on or offline. But it was also taken down from people that were spreading it because they wanted violence against the majority leader. And that's terrible. And so, again, like Twitter, Twitter did the right thing in the end. But it shows how difficult these calls are, they don't want violence on the platform, and they don't want that kind of hate speech, and that's why it was taken down. It wasn't based on political bias or anything else."

And these companies, I assure you have no interest business or otherwise to disenfranchise half the country. In fact, the social media platforms are one of the best ways price since talk radio, or since Fox News for conservatives to get their voices out. There are more conservatives on platforms that are able to without a filter, reach an audience, and there's countless examples of folks who had their start on social media, and then, later discovered by networks such as yours and are picked up in other places and later on invited to speak at things and have audiences of millions of millions of people because they got to start on social media. The platforms are not biased."

      "speaker": "BECKERMAN",

This is issue that is not an online-only issue, and the companies are working hard both independently and with government agencies here in the U.S. and around the world. There needs to be more cooperation between government and private companies. But not -- let's not pretend that extremism only exists on the Internet or online. This is a problem that we have in our society, we need to be more civil, treat each other with a little bit more respect. But the companies absolutely are working hard every day on their own developing new tools with technology, A.I., human reviewers, and talking to government agencies all the time to make sure we can stop some of this extremism, and be good actors.

And like I said before and I'll say it again, this is not -- this is a game of two things. One, it's a game of what happens in the court of public opinion, and number two it's a game of math. And whether or not the House decides to move forward with impeachment proceedings, you still need 67 senators in the United States Senate who will vote for an impeachment. And right now, those numbers just don't exist and I think speaker Pelosi understands that very well. And while it is the job of the House to provide oversight, they should continue to investigate. There just don't seems to be the votes in the Senate to get an impeachment motion through which is why I think the Speaker is so reticent to do it."

You know, I can understand, Jon, why some Democrats might be reticent or reluctant to take advice from a woman who felt like she didn't have to go to Wisconsin or Michigan in 2016. But in this case, I actually think that she's right. But were wait passed that advice. All the advice that she gave there and the soundbite was sound and has been ignored by a lot of these Democrats, in particular, Jerry Nadler. I don't know what the heck he's talking about saying this is a formal inquiry. It's not. And Richard was talking about math. let me remind people of some math. What was it, two weeks ago there was a vote on whether or not to pursue a formal impeachment inquiry and the vote was 320 to 95 against, more than a three-to-one margin. So I think Nadler in this particular case, he understands what the math is in reality. He also sees polling. Emerson had a new poll out last week. The number one priority of Democrats still the base is impeachment so he's trying to placate some dum-dums by telling them this is happening when in fact it is not. Words have meaning and he's wrong."

With that being said, once again, I think this is a debate for the court of public opinion, and right now what House Democrats lack is the court of public opinion. The public is adamantly against impeachment probably because there is a likelihood that people today can beat Donald Trump in the 2020 election which is where I think we should beat him. If you have a problem with this president, register to vote. Go vote and vote him out in 2020."

Richard and I were on this show together just a few weeks ago talking about the exact same topic of impeachment and we keep bringing it up because the Democrats keep stepping on the rake and insisting that we all talk about it when it's not working for them. They can talk about Don McGahn. They can fulminate about all this stuff that they want. We had two years of a thorough investigation, a lopsidedly democratic donor-heavy Mueller team, they came up with no evidence of collusion. They made no recommendation on obstruction. And we've all seen the Mueller report. It's been out there now for months at this point.

On background checks, I think there are some significant constitutional issues, although I'm persuaded at a National Review, my brilliant colleague, Jon, you a professor of law at Berkeley has written a piece on background checks that flushes out what the constitutional issues are. I think there's a close call in particular about whether the federal government has the constitutional authority to regulate gun sales within a state interest -- you know, completely intrastate gun sales but there's authority for the proposition that they can. And my piece which address red flag laws simply points out that while I'm an enthusiastic supporter of the Second Amendment, all of our rights are -- all of our fundamental rights, none of them is absolute. And I would just point out that in terms of predictive judgments that we make, every time someone gets arrested in federal or state court, a judge has to set bail. And even though the Eighth Amendment says that you can't -- you know, you basically have a presumptive right to bail, the court can't set excessive bail. We have pretty significant restrictions on our liberties. Judges can find someone's a risk of flight or a danger to the community and actually jail them for lengthy periods of time even though they haven't been convicted of anything."

What I think the inquiry should be is, would these laws catch other potential shooters and are they reasonable restrictions. To my mind, they don't have any kind of an intrusion at all on reasonable law-abiding gun owners. I don't think it's a proper objection to it that the laws or the regulations could be abused, or the courts could make bad decisions. I mean, if that was the reason not to take action then we would never take action. So, I think it would be nice to get rid of all of the politics, and I do agree with Congressman Scalise that, the issue here is what works. And we ought to try to get past all the hysteria and get down to the business of empirically what it is that would really actually help us reduce the shootings."

And we have not seen any suggestion as he appeared to make that race is anything of a factor in this movie. But there are political overtones in the trailer. And the Hollywood reporter claims the movie was originally called \"Red State Versus Blue State.\" It also reports that early in the screenplay one of the characters says, quote, \"nothing better than going after the manner and slaughtering a dozen deplorables.\" That of course is the same word Hillary Clinton famously used to describe Donald Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential election campaign. We cannot independently confirm that line about deplorables is in the movie. What we have seen is one of the trailers released by Universal, in which two characters talk about the right of wealthy people to hunt other humans."

I think it is admirable that Hollywood is finally admitting what we have all seen far too clearly this week, which is that liberal elites genuinely detest their fellow countrymen who are conservative. You know there was a CNN contributor Wajahat Ali who said that a public call to murder Mitch McConnell gave him faith in the country. Former CNN contributor and current cannibal Reza Aslan publicly called for the murder of senior counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway this week. I mean, this has been shown again and again, mainstream liberals, mainstream Democrats, all the way up to Joe Biden, who is openly condemning the president and consequently half of the country as white supremacists. We are seeing that not just the fringes but the mainstream left in this country genuinely despises conservatives. The Hollywood didn't invent this. They didn't come up with the title deplorable, that was Hillary Clinton in 2016 who called half her countrymen deplorable and irredeemable. Art is supposed to reflect life and from what we've seen of this movies it seems that it's actually doing a pretty good job of reflecting the political situation in this country."

      "utterance": "Of course. I hope they do release the movie. I mean, NBC Universal is putting it on. They probably had an insider track into how liberal elites really view half of their countrymen because they own NBC News and MSNBC News. I think this is a movie that conservatives should encourage to be released. It shows that disdain that we have long suspected is true of our liberal elites. It doesn't cut both ways for conservatives viewing liberals in this country. You don't see movies in the other direction, these conservatives don't actually want to go down there. We don't have the sick fantasies about liberals in this country. But the mainstream left genuinely does. We've seen it for this whole past week. And I look forward to seeing the movie."

And you've seen the hypocrisy in the reaction not just to this movie but the reaction to those tragic shootings that occurred a week ago, which is we're told that we need tone down the rhetoric, we need to tone down the hatred, we need to have love for our fellow countrymen. But just look at the vitriol that has poured out all week from people on Twitter all the way up to Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC, who said that President Trump wants more of these white supremacist mass shootings all the way up to presidential candidates. That is the reality that's going on here. And there is so much tripe that comes out of Hollywood, so many ways in which Hollywood tries to portray leftists as good and noble and wonderful and perfect and virtuous, and conservatives as awful and deplorable. And I think here you're actually seeing that script flipped, whether it's because of some bizarre fantasy that leftist Hollywood has, or because they're actually intuiting the culture. But either way, I totally welcome it."

Also, she made a comment saying would it be an endorsement or would it be a liability, which to me screamed of arrogance, that somehow she believes that her endorsement would make a material impact on the election anyway, which we know it would not.

It's also about what candidates eat. They have their pick of fried foods and meats on a stick. Ronald Reagan was the first presidential candidate to flip a pork chop at the fair and it has been a tradition for candidates to try it every election year since. There are some flips and some flops like Mitt Romney in 2007 when his pork chop landed right on the ground. Even President Trump try to pork chop and went down in history as the very first presidential candidate to arrive at the fair by helicopter. Jon, there is a point to all this pork.
