      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Juan Williams, Katie Pavlich, Jesse Watters and her Malibu Barbie is still distancing from a very frustrating Ken, it's Dana Perino, THE FIVE. The great American escape begins. The CDC now says half of all U.S. adults are vaccinated and as such, crowds are back in full force. Filling the streets after work, carousing like sailors who just won a war. Sports fans returning to the stands and heckling overpaid athletes with their favorite four letter words. Juan has been practicing on us all month. Beaches reopening for the summer. You can already see tiny bits of sand falling out of Jesse's slacked hair. Bars and restaurants are finally starting to fill up. People partying until the wee hours, and speaking of wee, last night, Dana was seen throwing up outside a club. Yes, it seems everything will be okay except for that fire hydrant. But it makes sense after being locked down for so long. People have to learn how to be normal again. Deodorant and teeth whiteners are flying off the shelves apparently because for the past year we stopped brushing and bathing or what scientists call the Stelter. Of course the weather is heating up. More people outside enjoying nature and communing with the beautiful animals within or in Katie's case, shooting them and eating them. Meanwhile, Equinox is seeing a surge in membership with customers returning to the gym. This is good news for Chris Cuomo. I mean, what's the point of flexing if no one is watching. Have you seen his ratings? They are lower than Don Lemon's IQ. An experts are even teaching people how to safely get a tan, which raises the question, there are experts on tanning? And is it Donny Deutsch? Because I'm still trying to figure out what the hell he does. As for me I'm all about being cautious. When you are rusty, you know, you got to take it -- you got to take it slow. Well, that's the stuff. So, Jesse, I bet you're wondering where I got this flask.",

You know, wine got us through the pandemic, but now that bars are open, I'm thinking White Claw, beer, tequila, that will go nuts. And then naturally, DUI's will probably double. So, don't drink and drive. As a matter of fact, don't drive at all especially on the Garden State Parkway on late Sunday evenings. It's bad for the environment and if you have to drive I guess, you know, maybe share a car with someone else. Clothing sales are going to go up, I can already tell, Emma is shopping. The credit card has gotten out of hand, boxes are showing up from Amazon. I know she's looking for new outfits, everyone else must be, too. Handshakes are back, so are selfies.

I must say, I just think it's a sign of America leading the way and so, you know, we had such, right now -- what did you say, half of American adults have been vaccinated? That's incredible. For a while there we were leading in terms of infection rate. So, you know, I just think it's just a wonderful time. I do say you have to give credit, I know this is not going to go over so well, but you got to give credit to Joe Biden. I think he really has had a great opening segment here for his presidency. You know, when you think about even going back to the inauguration, he didn't have a big inauguration with a lot of people to avoid a super spreader event. That's, you know, setting an example. Same thing with masks and now with getting people vaccinated. This is all good news and that's why people are partying and getting out and going to the beach and causing Jesse problems on the Garden State Parkway. But I will say this, one note of caution, I have been reading and I see that people who are not vaccinated are still getting COVID at very high rates, like back in December and January rates. And so I say, you know, don't just party and think, hey, it's not a problem anymore, everything's great. If you haven't been vaccinated you are still at high risk.",

No. So why should we do that for them? Now, I'm being slightly facetious but I'm also trying to be devious because that's really my nature. And when it came to the media, everyone just take a step back. In this past five years, right, what happened to your judgment when you looked at possible issues that came up? When Secretary Pompeo, who is in a position to know as the Secretary of State says it's a good possibility that this could've come from a lab or we have a reason to believe it may have come from a lab. Why don't you believe him? And think about that. Like, why wouldn't you believe him and why would you believe anything anyone says now? So, one of the things you have to do with reporters, you trust and verify and then verify again. And I'm glad that the reporters are continuing to do this.

Now, every time I see something in the mainstream media, I assume it's wrong and I work back from that assumption because when they say something is a conspiracy theory, it just means the theory they disagree with. When they say something is debunked it hasn't been debunked at all. They just get triggered when someone besides the legacy media breaks news or pursues a story that they disagree with. And then they try to tell everybody its fringe. It's not fringe. We've known this was likely from the jump. Juan said yesterday that oh, you know, just because a couple of days ago the journal reported these lab workers got sick. That was a morsel of the evidence that's mounted. I don't know, Juan, if you've seen \"Watters World\" for the last year. Probably not. Disappointing. I mean, it would be weird if you put up with me all week and then watch \"Watters World\" on Saturday night. But we have covering this. They did gain a function at the lab. I think the Chinese have still not even said what species that this originated from a year later. Did this thing actually attacks humans and has never been found in the nature, once. That's absurd. Every kind of virus we've ever had within a month we've been able to say that's the host, that's the intermediate host. A year later they still can't name where it came from. Don't you think that's odd? Dana's right, the burden of proof is on China.",

But now they've just admitted that their own Trump derangement syndrome has caused them to trash science and even ignore possibly the most plausible theory because when you think about -- think about the other theory, right? So you use the Occam's razor, the most obvious explanation tends to be the truest. They thought that the most obvious explanation was it came from a wet market from a pangolin or a bat that was eaten. So that was somehow, somehow more plausible than a freaking lab that is literally down the street doing experiments with novel corona viruses that are known to not be totally competent when it comes to their hygiene, known for their sloppy work, that could, in fact, allow the virus to escape. What is the more plausible theory? Obviously, that one, but we were bullied into it by the media because Trump, because Trump.

      "utterance": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Juan Williams, Katie Pavlich, Jesse Watters and her Malibu Barbie is still distancing from a very frustrating Ken, it's Dana Perino, THE FIVE. The great American escape begins. The CDC now says half of all U.S. adults are vaccinated and as such, crowds are back in full force. Filling the streets after work, carousing like sailors who just won a war. Sports fans returning to the stands and heckling overpaid athletes with their favorite four letter words. Juan has been practicing on us all month. Beaches reopening for the summer. You can already see tiny bits of sand falling out of Jesse's slacked hair. Bars and restaurants are finally starting to fill up. People partying until the wee hours, and speaking of wee, last night, Dana was seen throwing up outside a club. Yes, it seems everything will be okay except for that fire hydrant. But it makes sense after being locked down for so long. People have to learn how to be normal again. Deodorant and teeth whiteners are flying off the shelves apparently because for the past year we stopped brushing and bathing or what scientists call the Stelter. Of course the weather is heating up. More people outside enjoying nature and communing with the beautiful animals within or in Katie's case, shooting them and eating them. Meanwhile, Equinox is seeing a surge in membership with customers returning to the gym. This is good news for Chris Cuomo. I mean, what's the point of flexing if no one is watching. Have you seen his ratings? They are lower than Don Lemon's IQ. An experts are even teaching people how to safely get a tan, which raises the question, there are experts on tanning? And is it Donny Deutsch? Because I'm still trying to figure out what the hell he does. As for me I'm all about being cautious. When you are rusty, you know, you got to take it -- you got to take it slow. Well, that's the stuff. So, Jesse, I bet you're wondering where I got this flask."

There is a tremendous amount of pent up sexual energy just waiting to explode. Also, alcohol sales will skyrocket. You know, wine got us through the pandemic, but now that bars are open, I'm thinking White Claw, beer, tequila, that will go nuts. And then naturally, DUI's will probably double. So, don't drink and drive. As a matter of fact, don't drive at all especially on the Garden State Parkway on late Sunday evenings. It's bad for the environment and if you have to drive I guess, you know, maybe share a car with someone else. Clothing sales are going to go up, I can already tell, Emma is shopping. The credit card has gotten out of hand, boxes are showing up from Amazon. I know she's looking for new outfits, everyone else must be, too. Handshakes are back, so are selfies. I'm getting mobbed by fans, Greg. I forgot what it was like to be famous, and boy do I love it."

God bless you. I just think this is great. I must say, I just think it's a sign of America leading the way and so, you know, we had such, right now -- what did you say, half of American adults have been vaccinated? That's incredible. For a while there we were leading in terms of infection rate. So, you know, I just think it's just a wonderful time. I do say you have to give credit, I know this is not going to go over so well, but you got to give credit to Joe Biden. I think he really has had a great opening segment here for his presidency. You know, when you think about even going back to the inauguration, he didn't have a big inauguration with a lot of people to avoid a super spreader event. That's, you know, setting an example. Same thing with masks and now with getting people vaccinated. This is all good news and that's why people are partying and getting out and going to the beach and causing Jesse problems on the Garden State Parkway. But I will say this, one note of caution, I have been reading and I see that people who are not vaccinated are still getting COVID at very high rates, like back in December and January rates. And so I say, you know, don't just party and think, hey, it's not a problem anymore, everything's great. If you haven't been vaccinated you are still at high risk."

I also -- I got to do Pilates without a mask at Equinox myself. It's so freeing. But I'll tell you the other thing -- my last thing, Greg, that I think is going to be a big thing this summer is concerts.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I mean, it would be a shame if we never find out the actual truth. I think at this point, though, it seems plausible, even likely, unless the Chinese want to show as otherwise, then I think that the rest of the world would be forgiven for assuming that that's exactly what happened. Like, why don't we just flip the tables on them? I mean, why are we just assuming that we need an independent investigation? Like, in a way, would they ever do that for us? No. So why should we do that for them? Now, I'm being slightly facetious but I'm also trying to be devious because that's really my nature. And when it came to the media, everyone just take a step back. In this past five years, right, what happened to your judgment when you looked at possible issues that came up? When Secretary Pompeo, who is in a position to know as the Secretary of State says it's a good possibility that this could've come from a lab or we have a reason to believe it may have come from a lab. Why don't you believe him? And think about that. Like, why wouldn't you believe him and why would you believe anything anyone says now? So, one of the things you have to do with reporters, you trust and verify and then verify again. And I'm glad that the reporters are continuing to do this. I do think this is the biggest man-made disaster, the most consequential one in the history of the world. And even if the Chinese never let people in to find out what's going to happen, everyone is going to think what we already assume in our guts anyway."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "So Jesse, part of this is obviously following the money. Dr. Fauci has been questioned a lot in recent weeks about the NIH's funding of these labs and now he's finally admitting that they gave them $600,000 of modest grant money to study whether coronavirus' could actually infect humans in terms of the bat coronaviruses. And he is trying to kind of get ahead of this narrative we are seeing now of it coming from a lab when he dismissed the idea when President Trump was in office."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes. He changed his answer three times now. His agency actually trained bat lady to do these types of research things in Wuhan. I mean, they brought her to America, North Carolina, and they trained her there. The media has blown the biggest story of the 21st century. A once in a 100-year pandemic that killed millions of people, changed all of our lives. A year later, they are getting around to figuring out where it came from while conservatives on social media knew the whole time because they follow the facts. I mean they blew Epstein and Weinstein and Trump 2016, the Cuomo scandals, the crime wave, what else? The laptop from hell was a blueprint for Biden family crimes. They care more about what flavor Gatorade he drinks. I had a friend, Katie. He used to say, I assume everyone I meet is a pedophile, and then I work back from that assumption. Now, every time I see something in the mainstream media, I assume it's wrong and I work back from that assumption because when they say something is a conspiracy theory, it just means the theory they disagree with. When they say something is debunked it hasn't been debunked at all. They just get triggered when someone besides the legacy media breaks news or pursues a story that they disagree with. And then they try to tell everybody its fringe. It's not fringe. We've known this was likely from the jump. Juan said yesterday that oh, you know, just because a couple of days ago the journal reported these lab workers got sick. That was a morsel of the evidence that's mounted. I don't know, Juan, if you've seen \"Watters World\" for the last year. Probably not. Disappointing. I mean, it would be weird if you put up with me all week and then watch \"Watters World\" on Saturday night. But we have covering this. They did gain a function at the lab. I think the Chinese have still not even said what species that this originated from a year later. Did this thing actually attacks humans and has never been found in the nature, once. That's absurd. Every kind of virus we've ever had within a month we've been able to say that's the host, that's the intermediate host. A year later they still can't name where it came from. Don't you think that's odd? Dana's right, the burden of proof is on China."

But now that the media has been caught essentially, you know, destroying factual information for the sake of a political narrative, \"The New York Times\" is now blaming President Trump for discrediting the lab theory. Let's take a listen."

      "speaker": "MAGGIE HABERMAN, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES",
      "utterance": "President Trump and Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, both suggested they had seen evidence that this was formed in a lab and they also suggested it was not released on purpose, but they refused to release the evidence showing what it was. And so because of that, that made this instantly political. I think that, you know, example 1,000 when the Trump administration learned that when you have burned your own credibility over and over again, people are not immediately going to believe you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's rich. So this answers the question when Dana says why wouldn't you believe Pompeo? They wouldn't have diminished the lab theory if it wasn't for their emotional hatred for Trump. Their emotional dislike actually prevented them from logically thinking about this. Who's been pointing out this disorder for four years? We have. But now they've just admitted that their own Trump derangement syndrome has caused them to trash science and even ignore possibly the most plausible theory because when you think about -- think about the other theory, right? So you use the Occam's razor, the most obvious explanation tends to be the truest. They thought that the most obvious explanation was it came from a wet market from a pangolin or a bat that was eaten. So that was somehow, somehow more plausible than a freaking lab that is literally down the street doing experiments with novel corona viruses that are known to not be totally competent when it comes to their hygiene, known for their sloppy work, that could, in fact, allow the virus to escape. What is the more plausible theory? Obviously, that one, but we were bullied into it by the media because Trump, because Trump. By the way, when you put it this way and you think about it, China murdered my father-in-law. Everybody you know that -- was murdered, changed my life forever, change my wife's life forever. You know, they are murderers. That government is a murderous government. We know that, so what are we going to do about it? I don't know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "It's a great question. Juan, don't you think as a journalist, they should just be at least interested in information and running it down to see if it's true or false before just dismissing it outright?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And I don't, you know, I'm just listening in and I'm thinking to myself, I think that's what they did. I mean, I think that people -- I mean, I'm sitting here and I'm thinking, I was open to this idea. I remember there was a doctor in Wuhan who died, he was trying to raise awareness of it and the Chinese government wouldn't listen and the guy ends up dead and became a sensation in China. There was long talk of people in that lab up to something, not being forthcoming and we know that China is an authoritarian, repressive society where telling the truth can lead to you, you know, be a death sentence for you. So all of that is real. But it's also real that Secretary Pompeo and President Trump did not provide any evidence and that we now have evidence that there were some people in that lab who got sick earlier than we knew. And so I think it opens new lines of inquiry. But, you know, for all this, you know, slapping on the back, oh, conspiracy theorists we have been proven right. Wait a minute. A birther movement, the big steal? Come on. That's why when you say people cry wolf, you know, they lose credibility."

But it's like, look, it just shows you how embed our corporate overlords are with a totalitarian regime that they can get arguably the toughest actor in Hollywood to offer a groveling apology in Mandarin.

And it impacts every aspect of American life, whether it's the things that we buy, whether it's our pharmaceuticals coming from China, all of our PPE.

And remember, that was a huge thing. Oh, my gosh, how could he possibly do this. Well, you know what, because he was sending a message.

It takes a lot of courage to go through it. And they've been wonderful. And I've spoken with the negotiators. I'm hopeful that sometime after Memorial Day we'll have an agreement on the George Floyd legislation, and so I'm optimistic.

But with President Trump it was the opposite though, right? It was that, oh, he likes his steak well done. By the way, so do I. And he eats with ketchup. And also he eats french fries and has a terrible diet. Like, those are the -- those are the things that reporters would write about and click on. Everybody clicked on him.

People hated Trump so much that they over-scrutinized everything he did to a point of actually hallucinating things that he didn't do. But with Joe, he's just so Joe. He just goes along to get along. The media is pleased as punch because they don't have to work that hard. They get to sleep at night and are getting the far-left policies. And it really is -- it comes down to it's so important to like your president. Sure, you're going to have inflation, you're going to have a terrible border and rampant crime that is all like 20 cities now that hasn't been seen since the 1960s. We're seeing expanding unemployment. We're seeing media-driven racial conflict. But for God's sake, there's no tweeting at midnight. What a trade-off. I am so happy I can sleep."
