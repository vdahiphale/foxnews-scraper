We have to let people that can love our country in and I want to do that, but we cannot let the wrong people in and I will not allow that to happen during this administration. And people, citizens of our country, want that, and that's our attitude too.   Wow. Funny how all of these chaps sound exactly alike, yet the media pretends otherwise, depicting these recent raids as unique only to President Trump. But they aren't. And they also depict these raids as attacks on all innocent immigrants, which they aren't. Ninety-five percent were male, mostly criminal, from a dozen countries. These were not 6-year-old girls clutching teddy bears. But it raises this question: What were these people doing before they were arrested? Are these the folks that liberal lawmakers try to protect in sanctuary cities? If not, why get so upset when they're caught? What B.S. When Clinton or Obama did it, oh, it's fine, but under Trump, it's evil.  But it's not. Security for all is a moral virtue that requires sensible measures. It's no injustice to target fugitive criminals. It is officials simply doing their jobs. If the left doesn't want ICE doing this, then what do they want? Are we allowed to remove anyone or should we just invite the world to empty their jails into the U.S.?   If the left had their way, the whole country would be a halfway house for the planet's felons and orange would be the new red, white and blue.",
