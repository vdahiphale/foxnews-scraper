And, man, oh, man, is it cold outside, across the Midwest and the Northern Plains, even here along the East Coast. Americans are bracing for the bitter cold from this deepest of deep freezes. It is so cold, states of emergency have been declared in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan.  The Postal Service is holding mail deliveries in parts of 11 states. In Chicago, they're setting fire to train tracks to keep those trains moving. It's so cold there that even hot water is literally freezing over, as our Mike Tobin discovered.",

Of course, that's having quite an impact on travel across the country, including right here in the Midwest.  I want to show you the latest numbers of flights being affected by this extreme cold weather. Right now, there are 2,446 delays within, into and out of the United States. The cancellations so far today in the United States, more than 2,600, a bulk of the problem coming from right here in Chicago, where we have seen passengers just grimacing as they check the departures board that is full of cancellations and delays. At O'Hare Airport right here, more than 1,500 flights have been canceled today. Now, this is the hub for United Airlines, which has canceled about 80 percent of its schedule here. The other main Chicago airport, Midway, has about 330 cancellations at this point.  The city aviation department simply tells me it's due to extreme cold weather. I'm hearing from passengers here at O'Hare that planes are having trouble refueling in this cold. American Airlines is serving chili to employees here, handing out cold weather gear as well.  Down at Midway Airport, Southwest Airlines says it just does not want to expose the employees to these extreme conditions for more than 10 minutes at a time. So, some stranded travelers I have spoken to say they understand they have to be patient during this deep freeze.",

And we're not done with this arctic air. Tomorrow, we're talking about windshields here again in Chicago negative-40 to negative-45, so the travel at the airports is going to be impacted.

Cold -- really cold that lasts a really long time is certainly much worse than really cold that doesn't last a super long time.   Last night, this is what your overnight low temperatures were, minus-28, actual air temperature. These aren't windchills. These are actual air temperature. Minus-23 in Chicago. With these kinds of numbers, none of those places broke their all-time records. Chicago, you're getting closest, and your coldest ever is minus-27.  Tonight, we have one more shot to get at that. Here's the windchill, though, minus-40 up in Baker Lake. That's way north towards the Arctic Circle here in Canada. And it's minus-41 windchill in Chicago. Cold air settles down here across the part -- across parts of the South. But it doesn't go real deep down across areas of Florida. And this colder air mass is going to slowly retreat up towards the north. So, obviously, it's still really cold here, especially across the Ohio Valley, around areas of the Great Lakes.  When it goes in towards the temperature -- you can see temperatures minus- 15 in Chicago, and with the wind, feels like minus-41. That's kind of the repeated story. When you go towards the all-time lows, though, the only one here that we stand a chance of breaking, that's that minus-27 in Chicago, likely tonight, right around minus-24, minus-25.  I think all the rest of the cities, we're not going to break those records. Here's your forecast windchill. Watch how this plays out throughout the next number of hours. By tonight, colder. In fact, there's a snow squall moving through New York City down towards Philadelphia. Behind that is where the cold area is. And you will see it's going to feel below zero by this evening across parts of the Eastern Seaboard, tomorrow morning, still very cold back across parts of the Great Lakes, and then goes out through the day on Thursday.  And by the time we get towards Friday, the really, really cold air is gone. That said, we're still at 3 in Chicago, so not getting that much better right away. But, Neil, this is the point. Today, we might get to, say, minus-14 in Chicago. Watch what happens here by the weekend, Saturday 40, Sunday 48. You're going to be outside in short sleeve shirts by Sunday in Chicago.

They're juggling calls. One I spoke with today here in the city say that had they had 18 broken pipe calls just last week. More are coming in today, he said, adding they also get a lot of calls when the temperature goes back up, when an icy pipe melts and a leak then reveals itself.   There is such high demand for heat, U.S. trucking regulators suspended work restrictions for truck drivers hauling heating oil, propane and other fuel across 23 states through the end of the week. Auto shops, you better believe they're busy. They're seeing an increase in business, dead batteries leading the charge of complaints.",

And according to Planalytics, other categories which will see spikes this week compared to the same week last year, snow removal up 50 percent, sales of blankets up 45 percent, heaters up 41, firewood up 35 percent, and jackets up 30 percent. Businesses that are seeing or expected to see declines, sit-down restaurants, malls, basically anything you got to get in your car and go out and see yourself, and ice cream shops too.  And, Neil, surprisingly, beer and alcohol sales are on the list of expected losses.

But I will tell you, when you're from Chicago, you get used to it, but you're not going to get used to your heating bills when you open up that bill this month. We're going to see a substantial price spike, because these type of temperatures mean you're going to be using a lot more energy to keep your house heated with natural gas or heating oil, you name it.  But that doesn't matter to a lot of people in Chicago. They would be just happy to have heat and electricity in the first place. They'd be happy to pay anything right now, with these kind of temperatures. But we're hearing a lot of power outages in Chicago, a lot of places where they haven't had heat. There was even one report that they lost power on the trading floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group for a short period of time. They went to emergency generators, but the report was the heat was off. But thank God that traders can keep warm by moving around a lot, because they were able to continue trading today. But, seriously, we're very hopeful that if we see a warmup in the temperatures next week, which is -- which is predicted, that the bills in February hopefully will not be that bad. We have seen a switch in the weather forecast for February, which may ease our year-over-year heating bill pain.   But winter is not over yet, Neil. It's going to be very expensive this month.

There are a lot of concerns about the president using the declaration of an emergency in order to accomplish this, although that's something ultimately he may be able to do.

And all it requires on the part of the Democrats is them being willing to come to the table and negotiate in good faith. My impression has been all along that, for them, this is all about beating the president. And they have developed now this question of the morality of a wall, not something that plagued them when they were building them under Clinton or building them under Obama.

And some studies suggest that within four years a single-payer system would eliminate all known private insurance companies.

And that's what he was alluding to earlier previously, Rashad was alluding to earlier, is that when Americans find out that Medicare for all would eliminate all private insurance companies, only 37 percent of them say they support that. So there really isn't the kind of support here that she needs in order to get votes. A lot of people are scared of this idea of socialized medicine. It's -- it may be something that plays well in super left circles, and being super left can get you a lot of media coverage, if you look at AOC, if you look at Bernie Sanders.

When you have private companies like Hobby Lobby and you have religious organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor, who have the Supreme Court's backing for religious exemptions to not have to provide coverage for contraceptive use or for state-funded abortions or for private-payer abortions, then you have to have single-payer health care, so that we have state-sponsored abortions. Then the progressive left will advance their sexual revolution agenda, and they will then run the fallacious argument of separation of church and state and say that, under single-payer health care, government has to sponsor abortions.

That almost feels balmy, according to those who are staying in Chicago and other parts, where it's feeling like 60 degrees below zero. It's practically like summertime there. But, again, this is the effect across the Midwest and the East Coast. And it is going to get colder before it gets better. But we're told it will get better, it will get warmer. As to whether that's a metaphor for what I'm talking about going on in Washington, chilly talks over whether we can get this whole thing resolved with a government shutdown that could be repeated again in 16 days, to avoid that. Republican Congressman Chuck Fleischmann is a member of the so-called bipartisan conference committee, a number of Democrats and Republicans on board, with negotiating border security. Congressman, good to have you. What was it like in there? What's the mood and how are people feeling?",

It is so cold, states of emergency have been declared in Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. The Postal Service is holding mail deliveries in parts of 11 states.

Of course, that's having quite an impact on travel across the country, including right here in the Midwest. I want to show you the latest numbers of flights being affected by this extreme cold weather. Right now, there are 2,446 delays within, into and out of the United States. The cancellations so far today in the United States, more than 2,600, a bulk of the problem coming from right here in Chicago, where we have seen passengers just grimacing as they check the departures board that is full of cancellations and delays. At O'Hare Airport right here, more than 1,500 flights have been canceled today. Now, this is the hub for United Airlines, which has canceled about 80 percent of its schedule here. The other main Chicago airport, Midway, has about 330 cancellations at this point. The city aviation department simply tells me it's due to extreme cold weather. I'm hearing from passengers here at O'Hare that planes are having trouble refueling in this cold. American Airlines is serving chili to employees here, handing out cold weather gear as well. Down at Midway Airport, Southwest Airlines says it just does not want to expose the employees to these extreme conditions for more than 10 minutes at a time. So, some stranded travelers I have spoken to say they understand they have to be patient during this deep freeze."

They're still trying to figure out if there will be deliveries tomorrow. It's not the first time mail carriers haven't been able to do their jobs. But past disruptions have been on a smaller scale. And we're not done with this arctic air. Tomorrow, we're talking about windshields here again in Chicago negative-40 to negative-45, so the travel at the airports is going to be impacted. Here in Chicago, even Lou Malnati's Pizza closed down today, worried about the safety of delivery drivers. So when pizza is disrupted here in Chicago, you certainly know it is cold -- back to you, Neil."

      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a good question. Not that long, and that's the good part. Cold -- really cold that lasts a really long time is certainly much worse than really cold that doesn't last a super long time. Last night, this is what your overnight low temperatures were, minus-28, actual air temperature. These aren't windchills. These are actual air temperature. Minus-23 in Chicago. With these kinds of numbers, none of those places broke their all-time records. Chicago, you're getting closest, and your coldest ever is minus-27. Tonight, we have one more shot to get at that. Here's the windchill, though, minus-40 up in Baker Lake. That's way north towards the Arctic Circle here in Canada. And it's minus-41 windchill in Chicago. Cold air settles down here across the part -- across parts of the South. But it doesn't go real deep down across areas of Florida. And this colder air mass is going to slowly retreat up towards the north. So, obviously, it's still really cold here, especially across the Ohio Valley, around areas of the Great Lakes. When it goes in towards the temperature -- you can see temperatures minus- 15 in Chicago, and with the wind, feels like minus-41. That's kind of the repeated story. When you go towards the all-time lows, though, the only one here that we stand a chance of breaking, that's that minus-27 in Chicago, likely tonight, right around minus-24, minus-25. I think all the rest of the cities, we're not going to break those records. Here's your forecast windchill. Watch how this plays out throughout the next number of hours. By tonight, colder. In fact, there's a snow squall moving through New York City down towards Philadelphia. Behind that is where the cold area is. And you will see it's going to feel below zero by this evening across parts of the Eastern Seaboard, tomorrow morning, still very cold back across parts of the Great Lakes, and then goes out through the day on Thursday. And by the time we get towards Friday, the really, really cold air is gone. That said, we're still at 3 in Chicago, so not getting that much better right away. But, Neil, this is the point. Today, we might get to, say, minus-14 in Chicago. Watch what happens here by the weekend, Saturday 40, Sunday 48. You're going to be outside in short sleeve shirts by Sunday in Chicago. So cold doesn't last all that long."

We're talking about plumbers and heating services, online services, but not every business is so lucky, if you want to call it that. The plumbers are certainly very busy right now. They're juggling calls. One I spoke with today here in the city say that had they had 18 broken pipe calls just last week. More are coming in today, he said, adding they also get a lot of calls when the temperature goes back up, when an icy pipe melts and a leak then reveals itself. There is such high demand for heat, U.S. trucking regulators suspended work restrictions for truck drivers hauling heating oil, propane and other fuel across 23 states through the end of the week. Auto shops, you better believe they're busy. They're seeing an increase in business, dead batteries leading the charge of complaints."

How can you blame them? But anything with the word cold is down 42 percent. It's all about the soup. And according to Planalytics, other categories which will see spikes this week compared to the same week last year, snow removal up 50 percent, sales of blankets up 45 percent, heaters up 41, firewood up 35 percent, and jackets up 30 percent. Businesses that are seeing or expected to see declines, sit-down restaurants, malls, basically anything you got to get in your car and go out and see yourself, and ice cream shops too. And, Neil, surprisingly, beer and alcohol sales are on the list of expected losses. So chances are most people went and supplied themselves with that, as well as the food they need during this bitter cold snap -- back to you."

I'm telling you, I don't think I have ever experienced anything quite like it. But I will tell you, when you're from Chicago, you get used to it, but you're not going to get used to your heating bills when you open up that bill this month. We're going to see a substantial price spike, because these type of temperatures mean you're going to be using a lot more energy to keep your house heated with natural gas or heating oil, you name it. But that doesn't matter to a lot of people in Chicago. They would be just happy to have heat and electricity in the first place. They'd be happy to pay anything right now, with these kind of temperatures. But we're hearing a lot of power outages in Chicago, a lot of places where they haven't had heat. There was even one report that they lost power on the trading floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group for a short period of time. They went to emergency generators, but the report was the heat was off. But thank God that traders can keep warm by moving around a lot, because they were able to continue trading today. But, seriously, we're very hopeful that if we see a warmup in the temperatures next week, which is -- which is predicted, that the bills in February hopefully will not be that bad. We have seen a switch in the weather forecast for February, which may ease our year-over-year heating bill pain. But winter is not over yet, Neil. It's going to be very expensive this month. Let's hope it warms up for next month, so we don't have to empty our wallets."

      "speaker": "NESHEIWAT",
      "utterance": "Correct. It takes, Neil, as little as five to 10 minutes to develop frostbite, hypothermia. Frostbite, that occurs when the tissues, your fingers, your toes, becomes almost frozen cold. Sometimes, it's reversible, and sometimes it's not. And hypothermia can set in. That's when your body temperature, if it drops as low as just to 95 degrees, you can start having symptoms. Hypothermia, even if it becomes more significant, your -- you can have heart arrhythmias, you can go into cardiac arrest, muscle breakdown, tissue breakdown. So it's very important to stay indoors when the weather's -- when the temperature is so extremely low. But if you do it have to..."

And it can cause wheezing and coughing and fluid buildup in your lungs, where you end up in respiratory distress. And it's even more of a problem if you have underlying asthma or COPD. So that's why it's important stay indoors, stay hydrated, keep your inhaler on you, and make sure you're taking your medications."

That helps with circulation and tissue function. Get plenty of rest.

But once we can sort of resolve those issues, we ought to be able to come together in a bipartisan deal and find something that the president would be willing to sign into law. I think that's the way out of this dilemma that we seem to be currently in."

We know how much -- where they can be dialed. And so once these folks sit down at that table, Neil, and are sincerely willing to get a result or to get an outcome, I think it can happen. And I certainly hope that it does, because, as you mentioned earlier, we don't want to go down that path. Nobody has an appetite for another shutdown. There are a lot of concerns about the president using the declaration of an emergency in order to accomplish this, although that's something ultimately he may be able to do. But the best way to do this is the old-fashioned way, negotiating it, legislating it. And all it requires on the part of the Democrats is them being willing to come to the table and negotiate in good faith. My impression has been all along that, for them, this is all about beating the president. And they have developed now this question of the morality of a wall, not something that plagued them when they were building them under Clinton or building them under Obama. But now all of a sudden they have this newfound opposition to walls. But whether you want to call it a wall or a fence, physical barrier of some sort, let's get some resources allocated to defending America's border and stopping all the gang traffic, the drug trafficking, the human trafficking, the weapons trafficking."

She is saying the same thing, but it's getting a lot more scrutiny because she's a prominent and right now a front, leading Democratic candidate for the presidential nomination. What she said was eventually to get rid of private health insurance, in favor Medicare for all. She's finessed it somewhat there, talking a little bit about some of these other issues that are getting a lot of attention. We have the director of public policy, Jenna Ellis, over at Dobson. We also have the FOX News contributor Kat Timpf, progressive commentator Rashad Richey. Rashad, to you. How big a deal is this, this distinction she draws, saying, in the quest for Medicare for all or coverage for all, the goal is the same, health coverage for all?"

    {
      "speaker": "RASHAD RICHEY, PROGRESSIVE COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "I think it is a big deal how you word things in a presidential election. So, let's be clear. Insurance companies are not in the business of making you healthy. They are in the business of making money. A lot of people are actually in favor of Medicare for all, until they realize that it de facto eliminates private insurance companies. And some studies suggest that within four years a single-payer system would eliminate all known private insurance companies. But I think she is on a route in her presidential campaign to have a Bernie Sanders-like movement as it relates to health care reform in the United States. And I believe we have room for that conversation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Kat, do you think the quest for Medicare for all, which would seem by extension the mean private insurance for none, if that's the route you're going to go, she has to clarify that, or did her distinction today that her goal is to make sure everyone has health coverage enough for the time being?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATHERINE TIMPF, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think that she absolutely needs to clarify that, because it's something that matters to Americans. Recent polls show that the majority of Americans who do have an employer- sponsored plan are happy with that plan, and Medicare for all means if you like your plan, too bad, you can't keep your plan. And that's what he was alluding to earlier previously, Rashad was alluding to earlier, is that when Americans find out that Medicare for all would eliminate all private insurance companies, only 37 percent of them say they support that. So there really isn't the kind of support here that she needs in order to get votes. A lot of people are scared of this idea of socialized medicine. It's -- it may be something that plays well in super left circles, and being super left can get you a lot of media coverage, if you look at AOC, if you look at Bernie Sanders. But when it comes to average Americans, a lot of Americans don't want to hear language like that. And they like the insurance plans that they have already."

I mean, all of these candidates are saying a variation of coverage for everybody is still alive and well. The buzz saw that the senator ran into is apparently torpedoing private plans -- initially, that was the perception -- in favor of something government-run to do it, but that -- that is the direction the Democrats are in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENNA ELLIS, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. And the progressive left is continuing in that direction. And we know that single-payer health care is not economically viable or even constitutionally available. But I think that there's a more sinister reason why the progressive left is so focused on single-payer health care, and that's for state-sponsored abortion coverage. When you have private companies like Hobby Lobby and you have religious organizations like Little Sisters of the Poor, who have the Supreme Court's backing for religious exemptions to not have to provide coverage for contraceptive use or for state-funded abortions or for private-payer abortions, then you have to have single-payer health care, so that we have state-sponsored abortions. Then the progressive left will advance their sexual revolution agenda, and they will then run the fallacious argument of separation of church and state and say that, under single-payer health care, government has to sponsor abortions. And when you look at the laws coming out of New York, coming out of Virginia, and this emphasis on abortion, that's really what this is all about to the progressive left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

And what -- I can't believe we're this early into it, where they are already announcing, but that you have to find a way to pay for something you're proposing. And the hard lesson here for the senator, whether it was by accident or design, is people are going to come to back to her and say, the only way you can get Medicare for all is to junk private insurance for all as well. And she ran into that reality. So, math might be a bigger issue than right to life, right?"

      "utterance": "Because she's dynamic. She has a credible voting history as it relates to those in the Democratic establishment. She actually does have a liberal voting record as a U.S. senator, as short-lived as that has been. But, Neil, I think her bigger issue is not really to sell this to the general American voter, but really her own party. You have U.S. senators like Tim Kaine and others who are not there get as a relates to eliminating the private -- the private payer system and extending Medicare for all. So even within her own ranks, you do not have a general consensus yet."

      "utterance": "I mean, right, she is a target. She is a likable person, right? She had a huge rally. She had 20,000 people there when she gave that speech. She obviously has some appeal, so she's obviously going to be a target. But, at the same time, I think that we're going to see the Democratic field be much wider. We're going to have a lot more people still announcing. So I think she just announced at the right time. I think maybe Elizabeth Warren announced a little too early. But she is able to get people excited. And we can see that that's something that does matter. I mean, if you look back to candidates from Barack Obama, President Trump, these are people that people got excited about.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is unprecedented. I just wonder too. Sometimes, it doesn't even matter what the book is about. And your last book, \"The Triumph of William McKinley, for example, you could argue -- and it was praised by the right and the left and looking back at the importance of that presidency and what have you. But I'm sure on the book tour itself, they would pepper you with questions about the political environment..."

      "utterance": "Oh, sure."

      "utterance": "Oh, sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So you have to be prepared for that as an author to stay on message, to quote the book, to relate in your case President McKinley and whatever. But what advice would you give these authors who come out, some of whom espouse the fact they're not out to get the president, even though the interviewers are very much out to get the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, you got -- you got to have a -- you're going to get those kind of questions. So better that you have a clarity of what it is -- what's the tone you want to adopt, what's the impression you want to leave, and what are the specific issues that you're likely to be asked a question about, and what do you think about them? And to the best extent possible, you need to be well-prepared for those moments. Of course, what comes out of left field, you can't necessarily always be prepared for. But, look, if you're going to do a book tour, and you're writing a book about politics, and you're in a high political moment, count on the book tour being more interested in the things of the moment than necessarily the things in your book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, obviously it's going to help Christie's book sales, right? That's a given? They do, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Oh, sure. Absolutely. Look, every time you go on television, or every time you go on radio, or every time you give a speech, there are people who are potential book buyers. And, in fact, I was just helping a friend of mine, Andrew Roberts, organize a trip tour -- a tour of Texas. He's going to do 14 cities to promote his Churchill book, Winston Churchill, who died 60-some-odd years ago. And at every one of the events that we have had thus far, there's been somebody who says, well, what would Winston Churchill think about Brexit, which is an issue of currency that's happening today, not something that happened in his time. So an author has to be prepared for those kind of moments. The things that are going on are going to be thrown up at people who've written books about history or politics. People are going to want to know, what do you think the guy you wrote about would think, or what do you think about this moment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Which is icier, Milwaukee right now, where it's minus-8 degrees, which is like minus-35 degrees with the windchill factor, or in this conference room in Washington, D.C., at the White House? You have the key players in the China-U.S. trade talks. What if I told you, in that room -- I have no idea -- but that's what we call a metaphor, as it were. Blake Burman at the White House with more. Blake, what's it looking like?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLAKE BURMAN, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neither do we, because this has been so secretive, Neil, for the most part. It's been going on for the better portion or at least close to eight hours now, these talks between the United States and China here on day one, the senior most levels from both countries. This is the senior most meeting since President Trump and President Xi of China met about two months ago down at the G20 in Buenos Aires. The U.S. team sitting down with their counterparts. The treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, saying in advance of this that he does think that significant progress will be made, but if the Chinese come to some sort of compromise on the key issues, that would also have to be met with enforcement measures. Tariffs still very much in play here. In fact, the Fed chair, Jay Powell, weighed in on that today, saying that he doesn't think at least up until this point that the tariff battle between the United States and China has impacted growth. But he warned that the longer that these talks go on between these two sides, that it could impact the economy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN",
      "utterance": "The concern is more a longer, drawn -- for me, a longer, drawn-out set of negotiations back and forth, which could -- which could result in sapping business confidence. Uncertainty is not the friend of business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURMAN",
      "utterance": "We do believe, tomorrow, Neil, that President Trump will sit down and meet with the vice premier of China, Liu He, which would be a significant development in both of these talks. He is the top negotiator for China. I should mention, my colleague Edward Lawrence just posted a note saying that the talks are progressing, according to his sources, and that they should go into the early evening. So if you're trying to figure out which is colder, Neil, I guess they should probably keep the thermostat turned up in there, because they could be in there for a while -- Neil."

      "utterance": "You're looking live in Tannersville, Pennsylvania. This is the Poconos in Pennsylvania, where it's minus-15 degrees with the windchill factor. That almost feels balmy, according to those who are staying in Chicago and other parts, where it's feeling like 60 degrees below zero. It's practically like summertime there. But, again, this is the effect across the Midwest and the East Coast. And it is going to get colder before it gets better. But we're told it will get better, it will get warmer. As to whether that's a metaphor for what I'm talking about going on in Washington, chilly talks over whether we can get this whole thing resolved with a government shutdown that could be repeated again in 16 days, to avoid that. Republican Congressman Chuck Fleischmann is a member of the so-called bipartisan conference committee, a number of Democrats and Republicans on board, with negotiating border security. Congressman, good to have you. What was it like in there? What's the mood and how are people feeling?"

And our friends in the Senate and on both sides were very cordial. So, I think we're going to make some progress. Metaphorically, as you say, perhaps it's warming up here in Washington."

      "speaker": "FLEISCHMANN",

But let's face it. Today, we heard in that room very few absolutes, and I think that's a good thing. I think all the parties were saying, this is what we need, this is what we don't want. But it was very good. It was very flexible. And it was a great start."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, Republicans aren't even calling it or referring to it as a wall. I understand that Democrats are refusing to name figures. So you're both doing sort of like the good general overview thing so far, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FLEISCHMANN",
      "utterance": "Well, yes. And there's a lot of issues behind -- beyond the parochial issue of a physical barrier. We have got the entire Homeland bill. We have other appropriation bills where there are genuine, not only bipartisan, but bicameral differences. There's differences between House and Senate appropriators on some of the other bills that we have yet to conference."
