I also want to mention to you tonight that later in the show we will speak with Glen Greenwald of The Intercept and Sohrob Ahmari of The New York Post about the very consequential hearings today on Capitol Hill where Jack Dorsey of Twitter was grilled over why he blocked the Hunter Biden laptop story so stick around for that.  That's going to come up later in the hour but first actually election, front and center as President Trump crosses the country with a stop in Las Vegas, two back to back events today in Arizona as he fights to keep that state in his column. Joe Biden stayed in Delaware today.  He did go out to vote. There he is voting in Wilmington, Delaware with his wife, Dr. Jill Biden. No official campaign events for him today.",

Four years ago they had Hillary Clinton, their final poll had Hillary Clinton up six points. It was 46 to 40. This time around it's Biden plus five, 48 - 43 and so the question is you know can Trump overperform in Wisconsin like he did four years ago?

I think it's very dangerous because in a lot of instances, we just don't know whether these are voters who would have turned out on election day that are now turning out early so it's a cannibalization of their vote or in some cases we don't know party registrations so there are lot of reasons that I think trying to extrapolate the early votes to an election outcome is really, really tricky and dangerous.",

But yet that doesn't appear in the regular polls. We don't know the effect Martha of maybe a million college students in the - These states have the biggest universities in the United States, Michigan, Ohio state, Florida, Arizona, what's the effect of the semi and complete lockdowns were and speaking of somebody who spent my life on campus, polling day on campus is Halloween.   It's rallies, it's mass voting, it's polls on campus, everybody is registered in there. We don't know the effect on that at all. We don't know effect when you say early voting, everybody use this term 70 percent has to be democratic to withstand the election day way for Republicans but we don't know when a person says they're a Democrat or Republican, how they're going to vote in a weird year like this.  I think it is clear, it's kind of Orwellian though because the way I think most people feel they're just being fuddled because in 2016, they were told that this was - this was going to happen and while the national polls were knocked out off, on the state polls they were way off 2-3-4-5-6 and yet those with the so called credible polls. Reuters, Politico, The Hill, et cetera and then the outlier polls were pretty accurate. Maybe not so much on the national but even there but really accurate on the state. Now we go four years later and the Trafalgar poll, the Inside Advantage poll, the Democracy Institute, Rasmussen, Ogbe, they are showing a race very close or within the margin of error, in some cases Trump winning and yet we're told, they can't be credible like the ones that were discredited in 2016 even though they were credible.  And so everybody says well, OK and then they look at it empirically, they look at signs and enthusiasm and they have no idea what's going on but what I look for is, the polls that were wrong have they produce credible evidence to show us why they were wrong. Have they altered their methodologies or are they coming out and being transparent that there is such a thing as a silent Trump voter.  This is how we reworded our questions, this is how we redid our samples and you don't hear much of that at all. It's almost as if they learned nothing and forgotten nothing and it reminds me of the Mueller investigation a lot. For 22 months, we were told bombshell, walls are closing in, the Dream Team is going to - and we believed it and then every day, it didn't turn out the way the media told us.",

Would you say to China, you know what, we want to detone, let's just call office trade war or recalibration, go back to the way it was before Trump came into office. Let's tell the NATO allies, we've been a little bit too excessive. If you don't want to pay the 2 percent of your defense obligation, that's OK with us. I could go on a long list but you get the impression that Biden says there's no plan, that's a disaster but he - but he wouldn't - he doesn't have a plan to replace what Trump is and I don't think he's going to say to Saudi Arabia, please don't come out in the future and recognize Israel or United Arab Emirates.   Just take that back, that's not helpful. Let's get the Palestinians back in the center of the whole Middle East question as they've been for the last 70 years.

The avalanche of mail-in ballots across the country now is nearing tonight five -- 50 million -- 50 million according to the U.S. Elections Project. That is almost double the number of people who had voted in person so far. But you know, every state starts counting the ballots as they arrive, some by locked cannot even begin that process until the polls close on Tuesday night. So, we could know the results in the key states of Arizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, and Colorado rather quickly because those are among the six states that have been counted for just over a week now. Well five other states including, Iowa, New Jersey, and parts of Texas well, they've started with a little bit less time. But that monster list, the majority, 37 states do not start counting until election day arrives, that morning or after the polls close next Tuesday night. They include the key battleground states of Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, mostly Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. But despite the confusion, voting rights groups are helping voters sort it all out. The Washington, D.C. based lawyers' committee for civil rights under law says it has deployed 23,000 volunteers at polling places across the country and set up a hot line for campaigns that received more than 7,000 calls each day. The most common complains are from voters who don't receive their mail-in ballots, those long lines and delays of course and voting machine snafus. The voting hotline by the way is 866 or vote.

Tonight we will speak with Tom Bevan of Real Clear Politics and then we will bring in Victor Davis Hanson. He wrote a piece today called Trump versus Biden, a run down. He has two great pieces this week and we're going to talk to him in just a minute but we want to start with Tom Bevan over at Real Clear. Tom, good to see you tonight so obviously there are arguments being made on both sides. There are six days to go here. What makes the most sense to you at this point?"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

It's hard to imagine anybody working harder in the home stretch of this campaign, whether or not it will pay off for the incumbent, we don't know. What about Texas?

    {
      "speaker": "DEVAN",

So there's not a whole lot of consistency in doing of these two states. Look, I think Texas is - it's a state that is - Trump is probably going to win it but it's going to be closer than - than it was certainly four years ago. There's an awful lot of time and money being spent on there but the latest polls look like Trump has a small but fairly stable lead in Texas."

      "speaker": "DEVAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean that poll's ridiculous. Nobody thinks Trump's going to lose Wisconsin by 17. We had another poll out today that had it at one point but the Marquette University law school poll which is sort of considered the gold standard came out today and had it at five points. Four years ago they had Hillary Clinton, their final poll had Hillary Clinton up six points. It was 46 to 40. This time around it's Biden plus five, 48 - 43 and so the question is you know can Trump overperform in Wisconsin like he did four years ago? Have the folks at Marquette University Law school adjusted their methodology to try and capture the vote more accurately this time around? We're not going to know that answer until after the votes are cast."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

How do you calibrate that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think it's pretty dangerous. I mean certainly the pollsters, when they're asking a question, they're asking people whether they've already voted and getting the responses but it's become a real sort of parlor game for folks to try and read the tea leaves on these early voting numbers and divine from that what the election outcome is going to be. I think it's very dangerous because in a lot of instances, we just don't know whether these are voters who would have turned out on election day that are now turning out early so it's a cannibalization of their vote or in some cases we don't know party registrations so there are lot of reasons that I think trying to extrapolate the early votes to an election outcome is really, really tricky and dangerous."

One of the unknowns that you write about is this whole issue of all of these millions and millions of Americans who have already voted and then the parlor game as Tom Bevan puts it of trying to figure out who they likely are based on where they're voting from and how early they're voting and whether or not those who are left over can change this dynamic. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think there's too many unknowns and we don't know - we keep seeing our polls that suggest the minority vote, particularly the African-American vote might have gone up, 8 to 12 or 1 and that would make a big difference in these swing states, that these urban voters would not be able to balance or countervene the rural voters. But yet that doesn't appear in the regular polls. We don't know the effect Martha of maybe a million college students in the - These states have the biggest universities in the United States, Michigan, Ohio state, Florida, Arizona, what's the effect of the semi and complete lockdowns were and speaking of somebody who spent my life on campus, polling day on campus is Halloween. It's rallies, it's mass voting, it's polls on campus, everybody is registered in there. We don't know the effect on that at all. We don't know effect when you say early voting, everybody use this term 70 percent has to be democratic to withstand the election day way for Republicans but we don't know when a person says they're a Democrat or Republican, how they're going to vote in a weird year like this. I think it is clear, it's kind of Orwellian though because the way I think most people feel they're just being fuddled because in 2016, they were told that this was - this was going to happen and while the national polls were knocked out off, on the state polls they were way off 2-3-4-5-6 and yet those with the so called credible polls. Reuters, Politico, The Hill, et cetera and then the outlier polls were pretty accurate. Maybe not so much on the national but even there but really accurate on the state. Now we go four years later and the Trafalgar poll, the Inside Advantage poll, the Democracy Institute, Rasmussen, Ogbe, they are showing a race very close or within the margin of error, in some cases Trump winning and yet we're told, they can't be credible like the ones that were discredited in 2016 even though they were credible. And so everybody says well, OK and then they look at it empirically, they look at signs and enthusiasm and they have no idea what's going on but what I look for is, the polls that were wrong have they produce credible evidence to show us why they were wrong. Have they altered their methodologies or are they coming out and being transparent that there is such a thing as a silent Trump voter. This is how we reworded our questions, this is how we redid our samples and you don't hear much of that at all. It's almost as if they learned nothing and forgotten nothing and it reminds me of the Mueller investigation a lot. For 22 months, we were told bombshell, walls are closing in, the Dream Team is going to - and we believed it and then every day, it didn't turn out the way the media told us."

I mean I think so many people are so wary of talking to anyone or breaking their privacy which they feel is infringed upon all the time on social media and everyone else in their lives so I think that's going to be one of the biggest dynamics out there. I wonder you know if people are right about what they see in this early vote count. Before I let you go, one of the sections of your piece that I thought was so interesting, talked about foreign policy in the future and what we haven't - haven't learned about what that might look like in a Biden administration. Can you just give us a quick thought on that before we let you go tonight Victor?"

      "speaker": "DAVIS HANSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, Joe Biden keeps saying he has a plan but all he has to do is, identify particularly where Trump went wrong because he says it's disaster. So my question is would you take the embassy back from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. Would you tell the Assad dynasty, you're going to have the Golan Heights. Would you say to China, you know what, we want to detone, let's just call office trade war or recalibration, go back to the way it was before Trump came into office. Let's tell the NATO allies, we've been a little bit too excessive. If you don't want to pay the 2 percent of your defense obligation, that's OK with us. I could go on a long list but you get the impression that Biden says there's no plan, that's a disaster but he - but he wouldn't - he doesn't have a plan to replace what Trump is and I don't think he's going to say to Saudi Arabia, please don't come out in the future and recognize Israel or United Arab Emirates. Just take that back, that's not helpful. Let's get the Palestinians back in the center of the whole Middle East question as they've been for the last 70 years. So there's just this generic, sort of like the COVID crisis. He didn't - he didn't have a plan but then when you ask him exactly travel ban, respirators, ventilators, what would you've done exactly different? There's no detail that's forthcoming and that's - I think that's significant."

Can you sort that out for us because we were told by the postmaster that there's nothing to worry about in this process. Obviously, there is a deadline that you have to get your vote in the mailbox by but how worried should people be?"

    {
      "speaker": "ELLEN WEINTRAUB, COMMISSIONER, FEC",
      "utterance": "Well, as you know there were measures taken back in July by the Post Office to cut back on service, to shorten the hours, not do overtime, not allow extra trip and there was a recent decision just today from a DC judge saying that he was taking over and ordering the postal service to go back to the old rules to reinstitute the longer hours, whatever is necessary in order to make sure that the election mail in particular gets delivered. Now we are less than a week away from the election and I think under any circumstances, I would be nervous about entrusting my ballots to the mail at this point just because delays can happen and it might not get there on time. The rules are different in every state and in some states, the mail - the ballot has to be received by election day so actually if I've already voted, I'd try--"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, there has been - Ellen, there has been a lot of - I'm sorry, we have a little bit of a delay, there's been a lot of time you know. Everybody - I mean my ballot arrived several weeks ago. I filled it out and put it in a voter box and we're looking at one of them on the screen. It was really - it was very easy and you've got 73 million Americans who have already voted and six more days to go find the ballot box. So it seems to be a bit of a stretch to say that you know that people aren't able to vote, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEINTRAUB",
      "utterance": "Well obviously, people are voting. We're seeing massive turnout and that is a great thing so I think anybody who has their ballot in hand should do whatever they can to get it in on time. As I said I think just in the normal course of mail, a delay could take more than a week so if people haven't mailed their ballot in yet and they're planning on using an absentee ballot, I would do a drop box just like you did, that's what I did."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

I know there are some places where they're more less plentiful than others but you've got six days to go, find one of those boxes and it seems like it's going actually pretty well by now with 73 million already voted. So in Pennsylvania, the decision to say that you cannot reject a ballot if the signatures don't match up, what do you think about that? Isn't that one of the reasons that we sign our ballots so that it can be looked at against the book like we've always done?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEINTRAUB",
      "utterance": "Well, there is so much litigation going on throughout the country in Pennsylvania. They also have the problem of the naked ballots where people don't put their ballots in the inner envelope. I don't want to get into the details of what's going on in each state. I think the big picture issue is that there are measures in place throughout the country to ensure that the ballots are secure and that they come from the people that they are supposed to come from and that people can trust the system and have faith in the results."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEINTRAUB",
      "utterance": "Again, that varies from one state to the next. Some places, the ballots have to be received by election day. Other states have provisions in place that as long as it's postmarked by election day and received within a certain number of days after that, they will continue to count them. As you know the official results are never in on election night. That often takes weeks but that usually takes weeks in order for the official results to be certified so the important thing is that every citizen should try and vote and have their vote counted."

I was - I've been traveling with Ivanka Trump. We have our Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. Lara Trump is on the trail and let me tell you, they talk so eloquently about why President Trump's vision of growing this economy, of standing up for American families and American workers is so critical and why we need to reelect this president.

They need to go to their place of employment and when Joe Biden is pushing a lockdown message of from his basement and from his multi house, I really don't want to hear it. In our cases, we want to make sure as the president has said, this is about the Trump boom. This is about getting Americans back to work safely and responsibly. I had one quick instance where we were on an airplane, the pilot comes out and says for you all it's a flight. For us and for my flight crew, it's a paycheck and thank you for flying. Why? Because for Americans we're resilient and we're strong.

Look, nobody in my age or younger, I expect maybe most Americans period, no one really thinks that we're going to have the exact same energy profile in 2050 that we do in 2020.

I think his position is one that really resonates with the American people who understand that in the long run, we're going to need to continue to transition to more renewable energy, which is obviously not going to happen when the sitting president of the United States says climate change is a hoax and that wind mills kill birds.

      "utterance": "It's completely unaccountable and this is what -- this is the problem with big tech, which is why I'm happy that lawmakers on the Hill today pressed Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. But they have far too much power and control over what we see and what we think. And it's increasingly partisan power that seems to -- the ratchet is only one sided. It only seems to target the right. In this case, just before an election when we found an apparent case of corruption. Which as you noted, Martha, neither Mr. Joe Biden nor Mr. Hunter Biden has denied the authenticity of the e-mails. Neither has denied the ownership of the laptop. And now we have an on-the-record source who was on one of the e-mail threads that we have reported out saying yes, they're real."

      "utterance": "Exactly. I want to show everybody this quote from Matt Taibbi in his op-ed in the New York Post and get a quick thought from you on the other side of it. He says, editors have been telling staffers that any effort to determine whether or not the Biden laptop material is true or to ask the Biden campaign to confirm or deny the story will either not be allowed or put through heightened fact-checking procedures. On the other hand, if you want to assert with that any evidence at all that the New York Post story is Russian interference, you can essentially go straight into print. Your thought on that."

It's a legitimate story. And we will continue to follow it here. Thank you so much, Sohrab. Good to have you with us tonight. So how the process of counting your mail-in ballots could lead to election night cliff-hangers? We're going to explain a lot about this process because we all have a lot of questions. And that's coming up next. So stay with us."

      "utterance": "It looks like the Supreme Court has ruled that North Carolina can take mail-in ballots until November the 9th, so the process of counting, all of these ballots varies from state to state. And for those that don't start until election day like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, it could mean that we might get a delay in that final result. Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn has THE STORY for us tonight. Eric?"

      "speaker": "ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. You're right, the record number of mail-in ballots means we will likely not know the election winner right away. The avalanche of mail-in ballots across the country now is nearing tonight five -- 50 million -- 50 million according to the U.S. Elections Project. That is almost double the number of people who had voted in person so far. But you know, every state starts counting the ballots as they arrive, some by locked cannot even begin that process until the polls close on Tuesday night. So, we could know the results in the key states of Arizona, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, and Colorado rather quickly because those are among the six states that have been counted for just over a week now. Well five other states including, Iowa, New Jersey, and parts of Texas well, they've started with a little bit less time. But that monster list, the majority, 37 states do not start counting until election day arrives, that morning or after the polls close next Tuesday night. They include the key battleground states of Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, mostly Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. But despite the confusion, voting rights groups are helping voters sort it all out. The Washington, D.C. based lawyers' committee for civil rights under law says it has deployed 23,000 volunteers at polling places across the country and set up a hot line for campaigns that received more than 7,000 calls each day. The most common complains are from voters who don't receive their mail-in ballots, those long lines and delays of course and voting machine snafus. The voting hotline by the way is 866 or vote. Kristen Clarke is the group's president."

      "utterance": "Sometimes those long lines are attributable to officials just not making enough sites available, but sometimes those long lines are the result of machines that have not malfunctioned or co-workers who are new and may not be well trained. So, we want people to call that 866 our vote hotline whenever they encounter or experience a problem."

      "utterance": "Well, (Inaudible) and experts say neither candidate can really declare a victory on election night. And if it's this quicker, well some states gave mail-in ballots a grace period of 10 days after election day. Illinois two weeks and -- Martha, get this, Washington State, almost three weeks about time already there I guess carve the turkey. can you believe that?"
