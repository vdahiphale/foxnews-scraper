Blacks, he's in the mid-20's? Mid-20's. And then the base, the Republicans have him at 93. Sorry, haters. So despite all of the stuff they've thrown at this guy, you know, the spies, the lies, the probes, the 25th amendment, all of this stuff, his numbers are at or near record highs. So the buzz from the Mueller report is there's not going to be all this collusion that they're going to report. So the Democrats are getting nervous and they're scrambling for new crimes. And it doesn't look like they've found any in the House report, in the Senate report, in the counter intel probe. And the sentencing memos from Mueller indicate that they don't really have anything there.  So the bottom line is this, there is nothing that the middle-class can look and see what the Democrats are doing and say this affects my life. This is what I want. I want to see Trump's taxes. I want these investigations. I want Don Jr. up on the hill. It doesn't deliver and the polling never shows it delivers.

All the rational people have left the room. And now, everyone that's left is looking at this and saying, OK, these are people who are dissatisfied with the election results. They don't have an agenda of their own that's appealing to people. What are you going to go out to most of the country and talk the way AOC does? Socialism. A green new deal. None of this stuff makes practical sense to the average person.  The average person in the United States is not a socialist. They see that, it sounds extreme. Democrats need to learn, though, you're not going to win an election by going after the other guy and being constantly negative about him. You have to bring something positive to the table yourself. So they either need to be proud of this very, very extreme agenda that includes late-term abortion. Let them talk about infanticide and getting rid of all the electric cars in ten years.

Half of the respondents, this Quinnipiac poll that came out today, think that they believe -- guess -- this is so unbelievable to me, they believe Cohen more than they believed Trump, 64 percent think that Trump committed crimes before he was President of the United States.

But the thing is, now she's been told so many times that you have to wonder like how do you solve -- from the musical, how do you solve a problem like Maria? I think that's what the Democrats are -- like how do you solve this problem of Congresswoman Omar because this is a story that keeps coming back over and over again. To the extent that Mark Mehlman who's a Democratic pollster, kind of guy, a consultant, they've started a group, Democrats for Israel, right? Like to explain to people why if you're Jewish and you're a Democrat, you should be supportive. And they have to do like a whole reeducation -- that's probably the wrong word.

Instead however advocates and their supportive media simply say that equal pay must mask a more hidden discrimination. Now why would they say that? Two reasons, one for many advocates progress can be bad because an end to inequality means the advocates are out of work, so their role is less about helping people than ensuring a livelihood. Two, you lose a villain. Every day it gets harder to say men have an edge on anything. Look at education, more women graduate than men. Look at workplace death or injury, men lead that by a mile. In fact, look at all the grim stats from heart attacks to suicides to the ultimate gauge lifespan. Men are screwed from top to bottom. But in today's media landscape, gender progress is a zero-sum game meaning to elevate women, you must hammer men and if you say something like, hey, fathers' matter, that has to be an insult to women.

And they want to do that instead of getting legislation passed, and it's a disgrace. It's a disgrace to our country. I'm not surprised it's happening. Basically they've started a campaign, so the campaign begins. But they just haven't gotten used to the fact that we won a lot of states that haven't been won by Republicans in a long time. Instead of doing infrastructure, instead of doing health care, instead of doing so many things that they should be doing, they want to play games."

These numbers from the president that just came out are pretty spectacular, and the NBC poll approval ratings at 46 percent. Rasmussen is at 48. Harvard and Harris have him at 45. Blacks, he's in the mid-20's? Mid-20's. And then the base, the Republicans have him at 93. Sorry, haters. So despite all of the stuff they've thrown at this guy, you know, the spies, the lies, the probes, the 25th amendment, all of this stuff, his numbers are at or near record highs. So the buzz from the Mueller report is there's not going to be all this collusion that they're going to report. So the Democrats are getting nervous and they're scrambling for new crimes. And it doesn't look like they've found any in the House report, in the Senate report, in the counter intel probe. And the sentencing memos from Mueller indicate that they don't really have anything there. So the bottom line is this, there is nothing that the middle-class can look and see what the Democrats are doing and say this affects my life. This is what I want. I want to see Trump's taxes. I want these investigations. I want Don Jr. up on the hill. It doesn't deliver and the polling never shows it delivers. If I were the president, I would cooperate but I would -- I would call privilege on a lot of this stuff, the same way Barack Obama did."

This is so desperate now that even people who were originally on board saying, look, if there was collusion with Russia, let's investigate it. Let's figure out. All the rational people have left the room. And now, everyone that's left is looking at this and saying, OK, these are people who are dissatisfied with the election results. They don't have an agenda of their own that's appealing to people. What are you going to go out to most of the country and talk the way AOC does? Socialism. A green new deal. None of this stuff makes practical sense to the average person. The average person in the United States is not a socialist. They see that, it sounds extreme. Democrats need to learn, though, you're not going to win an election by going after the other guy and being constantly negative about him. You have to bring something positive to the table yourself. So they either need to be proud of this very, very extreme agenda that includes late-term abortion. Let them talk about infanticide and getting rid of all the electric cars in ten years. Either, be proud of that, put that front and center, and make that -- do what you've got to do and create some optimism there. Or leave the room because you are giving Trump a victory right now by doing this and the poll numbers show that."

But here's the thing, if you look at those numbers, 64 percent of Americans right now think that the president should release his tax returns. That's two-thirds of the American people. How about this? Half of the respondents, this Quinnipiac poll that came out today, think that they believe -- guess -- this is so unbelievable to me, they believe Cohen more than they believed Trump, 64 percent think that Trump committed crimes before he was President of the United States. So Republicans have a strong affinity for the constitution as it was written. And the constitution is very clear. Congress is an equal branch of government with oversight responsibilities, and they need to gather facts in the course of exercising oversight before they come to any kind of decision about impeachment and the like. But Republicans are acting like, oh, it's impeachment right now."

Their role right now, simply, is to distract a man from doing his job. The problem is he's America's air-traffic controller. He's America's surgeon. So a lot of people kind of don't like this distraction. Let's say you have a normal job. I was thinking about this today. Let's say you have a normal job. You're an electrician or an insurance agent, and all the sudden your boss comes in and says, hey, you know what, I'd like you to devote more time into investigating that electrician across the street or devote more time to investigating that insurance agent across the street."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes. As if you have time, right? You have time to do this. So what I'm learning is these politicians have a lot of time to do this sort of thing. In a sense, they're creating an argument for their own uselessness, that they're able to do unending investigations. At best, being a congressman is a part-time job. It's a seasonal occupation, like being a department store Santa or an NFL ref. And what we have done by allowing them to have a full-time job is we're allowing them to investigate instead of legislate. I've learned everything and it's left or right or center, this should not be a full-time job. And I think that you have to be better than the people who upset you. Eight years ago there were people like this about Obama, right?"

The party, however, is split over whether to include Omar's name in the resolution. So, Dana, let's just go to the heart of the matter because there're people who are saying she's talking about American policy in the Middle East. Why is that anti- Semitic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, it's because there's a code, right? So she also talks about dual loyalty. That's what she's suggesting is that people who support the State of Israel, that if they're Jewish, that you, actually -- your loyalty is not just to the United States. Your loyalty is Israel. And it's been something that has been considered anti-Semitic and goes way back. And so -- perhaps she didn't know initially that when she said that, that that was offensive. But the thing is, now she's been told so many times that you have to wonder like how do you solve -- from the musical, how do you solve a problem like Maria? I think that's what the Democrats are -- like how do you solve this problem of Congresswoman Omar because this is a story that keeps coming back over and over again. To the extent that Mark Mehlman who's a Democratic pollster, kind of guy, a consultant, they've started a group, Democrats for Israel, right? Like to explain to people why if you're Jewish and you're a Democrat, you should be supportive. And they have to do like a whole reeducation -- that's probably the wrong word. But education to people who are younger, somebody like Congresswoman Omar who is younger, but this is not -- she's not an isolated case. Like this is being taught across universities and, in particular, the BDS movement to try to divest from anything that has to do with Jewish people or Israel. That -- it's growing and so I think that there does need to be a decision by the Democrats, and I think they would be smart to go ahead and take it on now because it's clearly not going to get better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, Jesse, in fact, a lot of people argue that this is not about Jewish people, that the biggest supporters of Israel are evangelical Christians and the Republican Party on the right that have made Israel into a sort of a litmus test for themselves. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, this is universal condemnation from -- to Omar. I mean, Nancy Pelosi, the anti-defamation league, the Jewish policy center have all said that what she said is offensive and prejudice. It's not something that the evangelical right is creating here as a wedge issue. She reminds me, you know, of a freshman in college, like two weeks into the semester, first term, she's already on probation. She's already had her parents called. This is not good. I mean, she's barely a freshman and she's already getting spanked by the leadership. It's humiliating to her and it's got to be humility to the Democratic leadership right now. If you combine her with AOC's green new deal and then she stepped in with this, you know, felony campaign finance scandal, and then the other Tlaib woman with the -- impeachment rhetoric that came out of her mouth, these three radical musketeers are causing a big problem for the Democratic Party. And I guarantee you there's some picture of her with Farrakhan or someone that's about to drop. If you look -- we've talked about this the other day. She wrote that letter of support to ISIS recruits. She's traffic in anti-Semitic tropes. She's used, kind of, money language about Jewish people and their influence. And she has been educated. The Jewish community in her district in Minnesota had a big summit with her. They called it an anti-Semitic intervention and they told her this, you can't say this, this is the history of the Jewish people, and she still doesn't get it."

I mean, they come after -- they try to believe that what you said mean something else. She can say what she wants. She just has to live with it. What bugs me about her is -- there's this other hypocrisy that she gets away with. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, LGBTQ -- am I missing one?"

And that's the country she keeps harping on, and I don't think that's a coincidence because what are the other countries that -- it is definitely linked to her religious background. But that somehow skates by as everybody makes fun of Mike Pence, her religion makes Mike Pence look like Freddie Mercury. So -- I think that's something -- I think that's something that is, kind of like not discussed that probably could be raised, like, what are her thoughts?

She wants to talk about this and everybody immediately says, well, you said this and it wasn't explicitly anti-Semitic but it could be viewed that way.

But I think when you look at the actual polls, not just the focus group of a limited number, the most recent polls had Biden with 37 percent of Democrats saying he's their number one choice, and 51 percent saying he's one of their top choices.

As far as Biden goes, I agree, you know, people want the new car smell. And the zeitgeist of the Democratic Party is they want the opposite of Donald Trump. They want a young female socialist with a blank slate who can just go there and punch the president in the mouth and take him down.

And that's because if you look at for example the Democrats already given him a hard time, because he's out there giving $200,000 speeches or do, we have the transcripts of those speeches. Also, he's doing all these public events actively talking about whether he's going to run. He's thinking about it. They can't decide, can't decide. So, he had plenty of time to make a decision.

But when you look closely at the details, the differences tend to shrink even disappear. Take Google who has been accused of underpaying female workers. But when they investigated this charge, they found what, they indeed were underpaying men. There goes another narrative. Now this should be good news. It's progress for women, right. Instead however advocates and their supportive media simply say that equal pay must mask a more hidden discrimination. Now why would they say that? Two reasons, one for many advocates progress can be bad because an end to inequality means the advocates are out of work, so their role is less about helping people than ensuring a livelihood. Two, you lose a villain. Every day it gets harder to say men have an edge on anything. Look at education, more women graduate than men. Look at workplace death or injury, men lead that by a mile. In fact, look at all the grim stats from heart attacks to suicides to the ultimate gauge lifespan. Men are screwed from top to bottom. But in today's media landscape, gender progress is a zero-sum game meaning to elevate women, you must hammer men and if you say something like, hey, fathers' matter, that has to be an insult to women. So, even though we know both sexes complement each other, the media drives a wedge between the sexes, because it pays. When will it end? As long as their salary depends on conflict.

She is the woman who was kidnapped when she was a girl. And it's called Abducted in Plain Sight. I urge you to check out this documentary on Netflix, because we're doing a segment on it tomorrow.

The alligator didn't attack anybody. That's not what we're talking about. In fact, some people from the Villages think they know this alligator, and he's a local celebrity.
