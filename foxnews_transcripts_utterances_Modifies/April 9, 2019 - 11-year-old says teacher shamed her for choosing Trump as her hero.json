Congressman Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are here to react. Plus, what don't the media and the democrats tell you about child separation under Obama? Newt Gingrich is here to expose it. Also, what is the President's path to victory in 2020? His campaign manager making a rare appearance. Brad Parscale will tell us tonight. And an 11-year-old little girl says she was shamed by her left-winged teacher when she proposed writing a pro-Trump report for school. Her parents are steaming mad and they are here exclusively to sound off. But first, persistence versus the resistance. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  After spending a few precious hours watching the Attorney General testify today before the House Budget Committee, I thought one thing. Why on earth did Bill Barr volunteer for this type of abuse? Leaving the comfort of his retirement just to have to answer to some of the nastiest people on the face of the planet? Nita Lowey of New York badgered Barr on his synopsis on the Mueller report.",

Now, of course, Congress does have legitimate important constitutional obligations to do proper oversight of the executive branch. I'm all for it.  But, what the Democrats have been doing since Trump took the oath of office isn't oversight, it's character assassination, either of the President himself that he was secretly working with the Russians or of anyone who works for him.

He eventually decided not to go against Pelosi. But by 2018, he was much more concerned about raising money for his fellow Democrats than defending his own seat. Even when he heard that a 28-year- old Bronx bartender had gathered enough signatures to qualify for the primary, the headline in the \"Queens Chronicle\" said, quote, \"Crowley expects an easy primary win.\" But the book's authors, \"Politico\" reporters Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman also note that Ocasio-Cortez had no problem going after Crowley, attacking everything from his voting record to his residency. The book says it, quote, \"was an open secret that Crowley lived with his family in suburban Virginia, not in Queens.\" And during their only debate, Ocasio-Cortez zeroed in on that point, quote, \"If a person loves their community they would choose to raise their family here. They would choose to send their kids to our schools. They would choose to drink our water and breath our air.\" But Crowley thought that going dirty against Ocasio-Cortez would be a sign of weakness, and the book says he had plenty of fodder he could have used against her, including that her campaign used tactics to evade campaign finance laws.

They don't do anything with labor law problems. The truth is Pelosi wants to throw sand in Trump's gears every chance she gets. If Obama had negotiated the same deal, she'd have been all for it. But, she'd rather deny Trump a victory than do the right thing by the American people. Same scenario by the way is that play with the ongoing invasion across our southern border. Congress could fix this in a weekend. Now, estimates are that this month alone, we could see 150,000 migrants overwhelming our border, our Border Patrol. So instead of closing loopholes, ending this crisis, Democrats just use every opportunity to grandstand for the cameras."

By the way, if he did review it, he would become political. If he reviewed it and didn't have a problem with it, the democrats would attack him and the Republicans would use him as a cajole (ph) against the Democrats. So, I have no problem with Mueller declining to review it. I do have a problem if any of his people leaked their unhappiness with Attorney General Barr to the press. But remember, Barr made it very clear in his letter. He said, \"Mueller isn't making the call.\" But Mueller took all the obstructive acts, the allegedly obstructive acts and he set out both sides of the question, both sides of the issue, the side that would this might be obstruction and the side that would argue against it."

District courts have the inherent authority to release grand jury materials.\" The D.C. Circuit overruled him a couple of days ago and said, \"No, you don't. If it's not a judicial proceeding under 6(e) - in connection with a judicial proceeding, you cannot release - order the release of grand jury materials.\" And that could have - what that could essentially mean is that even if Barr wanted to, he doesn't, but even if Barr wanted to go to the court and get a 6(e) exception, he probably couldn't get one in D.C."

He eventually decided not to go against Pelosi. But by 2018, he was much more concerned about raising money for his fellow Democrats than defending his own seat. Even when he heard that a 28-year- old Bronx bartender had gathered enough signatures to qualify for the primary, the headline in the \"Queens Chronicle\" said, quote, \"Crowley expects an easy primary win.\" But the book's authors, \"Politico\" reporters Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman also note that Ocasio-Cortez had no problem going after Crowley, attacking everything from his voting record to his residency. The book says it, quote, \"was an open secret that Crowley lived with his family in suburban Virginia, not in Queens.\" And during their only debate, Ocasio-Cortez zeroed in on that point, quote, \"If a person loves their community they would choose to raise their family here. They would choose to send their kids to our schools. They would choose to drink our water and breath our air.\" But Crowley thought that going dirty against Ocasio-Cortez would be a sign of weakness, and the book says he had plenty of fodder he could have used against her, including that her campaign used tactics to evade campaign finance laws. A conservative watchdog group has now filed Federal Election Commission complaints against her. Laura?"
