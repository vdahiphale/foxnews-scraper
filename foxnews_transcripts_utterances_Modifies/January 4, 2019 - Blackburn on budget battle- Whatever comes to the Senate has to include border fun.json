      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” Busy breaking news night this Friday. It was a huge, productive, extraordinarily important 24 hours for President Trump and the deranged hate-Trump left. They are spinning out of control, beyond even my predictions. Calls for impeachment, vulgar tirades, plans for a 70 percent federal tax hike, a bill to radically alter the U.S. Constitution.  Now, it's only day two of the Democratic-controlled hate Trump House of Representatives. The wheels are coming off. It is not a pretty picture.  And as you watch tonight's monologue, be sure to ask yourself this important question. We'll be asking questions they never ask in the media. Is what you are hearing and seeing and witnessing, is it good for you, for your family? Is it good for the country we love?  We start today with our congressional watch. I long warned you that in 100 days, the entire country will know what we know, and that is just how radical this new Congress is. And we're getting off to a quick start. Just hours last night, after getting sworn in, you have Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib went on a profanity-laced rant while screaming for the president's impeachment. By the way, they filed that yesterday, too. They're going to rush, for what reason, God only knows.  Take a look.",

They need two- thirds of the Senate to get a conviction. It is not going to happen, in spite of all of the hype, all of the hysteria that you are going to be hearing every single day. The media is lying to you. Now, is this what the Democratic Party has become? The media, they hate Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day. And today, the same congresswoman doubled down on her dumb remarks, tweeting, quote: I will always speak truth to power, #unapologeticallyme.

Now, far left Trump hater Congressman Stephen Cohen, he is already introduced two constitutional amendments, they will go nowhere. He is wasting your time.  This is false hope, the media will hype it up, and then it will never happen. One that would eliminate the Electoral College, one that outlaws of the president from pardoning himself. Not going to happen. And just as we predicted, they also want their crumbs back. They didn't tell you that during the election, did you?  That is why we now have Hannity watch on socialism. Here is our update tonight. In order to fund a plan for the so-called \"green new deal,\" Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she is now calling, get this, she wants a 70 percent federal tax rate for the rich, 70 percent. Now, if you live in New York, you're a 10 percent state income tax. That's 80. If you work in New York City, that's another 4 percent. If you live in Westchester or Nassau County, the two highest property tax counties in the country, that's $0.90 of every dollar she wants people to pay.

In our Hannity watch on the economy feature tonight, while President Trump's free market, low regulation, low tax policies, they are working in real time for real Americans in the month of December. Look at this, job numbers far exceeded all expectations as the U.S. economy for December added a whopping 312,000 new jobs, and for the first time, by the way, in 20 years, we now have real wage increase of 3 percent for the American worker.  2018 ended with a record number of Americans in the workforce. Our manufacturing industry posts their biggest job gains in 20 years. The Hispanic unemployment at its lowest point ever.  Add to that, record low unemployment for African-Americans, Asian- Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, our vets are getting jobs in the largest numbers we have seen in a long time. And we are now the largest producer of crude oil in the entire world. That's right, more than Russia and more than Saudi Arabia, the lifeblood of our economy. Have you noticed the price of gasoline has dropped considerably? President Trump is making history every day. The media that hates him will never talk about it, because he's keeping his promises. Our economy right now is running on all cylinders. You probably wouldn't know it if you watched fake new CNN or conspiracy TV MSNBC. In fact, most members of the mainstream media, they have the exact same M.O. as their friends in the Democratic Party.

We are understanding it now on day two. Many on the left including nearly everyone on every other network, because, of course, it's the hate Trump media, they seem to want a weaker country, filled with lofty, surreal, progressive principles, and they're not looking out for the safety of you and your family. Progressive principles come with serious consequences. Not only will they have unsecure borders, higher taxes, that leads to economic growth that stagnant. Open borders, that can lead to death and terrorism and drugs. A progressive takeover, the United States of America will drastically be in decline. Is that the America you want? Those are the questions we have to ask, so my humble advice is the shutdown, as much as it inconvenienced some people that work for the government, and I hope they get their back pay, it needs to continue straight through the state of the union, and maybe beyond. The state of the union, the president, he can take his case directly to you, we, the people. And while the president should support back pay for those furloughed employees, make no mistake, no matter what the president does, he must hold firm on this border wall funding from Congress. There must be no amnesty under any circumstances. Lindsey Graham, he has made a proposed compromise that would give DACA recipients three years of a work permit that they might be able to renew down the line. If there is no amnesty and money for the border wall to protect the American people, then they will have accomplished something very important.  By the way, they will politically benefit for it, but that shouldn't be the reason they do it. If they capitulate, Republicans, the political damage frankly is incalculable. And it will hound a lot of these people, you know, throughout the rest of the Trump presidency. Also, it will have an impact on the 2020 race. The point now is stay the course, don't back down. This is important for the country. When we come back, Congressman Mark Meadows, he'll give us a congressional Hannity watch update in the House, and Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Hannity congressional Senate watch as this watch on the border on the shutdown continue straight ahead.",

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” Busy breaking news night this Friday. It was a huge, productive, extraordinarily important 24 hours for President Trump and the deranged hate-Trump left. They are spinning out of control, beyond even my predictions. Calls for impeachment, vulgar tirades, plans for a 70 percent federal tax hike, a bill to radically alter the U.S. Constitution. Now, it's only day two of the Democratic-controlled hate Trump House of Representatives. The wheels are coming off. It is not a pretty picture. And as you watch tonight's monologue, be sure to ask yourself this important question. We'll be asking questions they never ask in the media. Is what you are hearing and seeing and witnessing, is it good for you, for your family? Is it good for the country we love? We start today with our congressional watch. I long warned you that in 100 days, the entire country will know what we know, and that is just how radical this new Congress is. And we're getting off to a quick start. Just hours last night, after getting sworn in, you have Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib went on a profanity-laced rant while screaming for the president's impeachment. By the way, they filed that yesterday, too. They're going to rush, for what reason, God only knows. Take a look."

Remember, they were telling Maxine Waters, just don't say it, don't say it, we are going to do it but don't say it. By the way, you will never get a conviction in the Senate. They need two- thirds of the Senate to get a conviction. It is not going to happen, in spite of all of the hype, all of the hysteria that you are going to be hearing every single day. The media is lying to you. Now, is this what the Democratic Party has become? The media, they hate Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day. And today, the same congresswoman doubled down on her dumb remarks, tweeting, quote: I will always speak truth to power, #unapologeticallyme. But today, Tlaib was a little too afraid to answer reporters' questions, including SiriusXM Patriot's Kerry Picket, friend of the show. She asked her directly.

He didn't lose 69 seats like Obama or 60 seats like Bill Clinton. Clinton lost eight Senate seats, Obama lost six. Obama lost 63 House seats. Take a look."

And while impeaching 45 appears to be at the top of the giddy Democrats, hate Trump Democrats, he is never going to be convicted in the U.S. Senate, no matter how much the only news media in this country, the hate Trump media, says it's going to happen. It's not. And don't worry, by the way, Democrats are also finding plenty of time for other stupid volleys that will never pass. Now, far left Trump hater Congressman Stephen Cohen, he is already introduced two constitutional amendments, they will go nowhere. He is wasting your time. This is false hope, the media will hype it up, and then it will never happen. One that would eliminate the Electoral College, one that outlaws of the president from pardoning himself. Not going to happen. And just as we predicted, they also want their crumbs back. They didn't tell you that during the election, did you? That is why we now have Hannity watch on socialism. Here is our update tonight. In order to fund a plan for the so-called \"green new deal,\" Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she is now calling, get this, she wants a 70 percent federal tax rate for the rich, 70 percent. Now, if you live in New York, you're a 10 percent state income tax. That's 80. If you work in New York City, that's another 4 percent. If you live in Westchester or Nassau County, the two highest property tax counties in the country, that's $0.90 of every dollar she wants people to pay. But she says only $0.70 out of every dollar or 70 percent nationally. Take a look."

Once you get to the tippy top, on your $10 million, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at extremely high rates, but it means as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more."

We already have what you are calling for on a pretty high level. But that's why Hannity watch on socialism, we will update you as events warrant. But that would mean no businesses, no wealthy individual would ever invest, spend money, create jobs in a place where they are taking $0.70 or $0.80 of every dollar.

In our Hannity watch on the economy feature tonight, while President Trump's free market, low regulation, low tax policies, they are working in real time for real Americans in the month of December. Look at this, job numbers far exceeded all expectations as the U.S. economy for December added a whopping 312,000 new jobs, and for the first time, by the way, in 20 years, we now have real wage increase of 3 percent for the American worker. 2018 ended with a record number of Americans in the workforce. Our manufacturing industry posts their biggest job gains in 20 years. The Hispanic unemployment at its lowest point ever. Add to that, record low unemployment for African-Americans, Asian- Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, our vets are getting jobs in the largest numbers we have seen in a long time. And we are now the largest producer of crude oil in the entire world. That's right, more than Russia and more than Saudi Arabia, the lifeblood of our economy. Have you noticed the price of gasoline has dropped considerably? President Trump is making history every day. The media that hates him will never talk about it, because he's keeping his promises. Our economy right now is running on all cylinders. You probably wouldn't know it if you watched fake new CNN or conspiracy TV MSNBC. In fact, most members of the mainstream media, they have the exact same M.O. as their friends in the Democratic Party. All of these disparate groups, it is all about hating Trump, every second, every hour, every day, nothing changes, nothing else seems to matter.

We like to look at ourselves as a little bit of an island or oasis. That brings us to Hannity watch on border security tonight, and an update on the partial government shutdown. At this hour, a deal to fund the government is facing gridlock in Washington, all because Democrats are fighting tooth and nail against the president's vow to secure our borders with the tragic walls fencing, a wall that border patrol agents, as they did yesterday, are asking for, a wall that protects our homeland, a wall that keeps of gang members and potential terrorists.

We've got to protect our borders. It is about national security. Even if the 99 percent of people that want to come in just want a better life. You Republicans have got to stay the course. You can't back down. Now, the president's base is now deeply invested in the shutdown. The president has taken a stand, and it is time for the Republicans to do the same. How many more innocent Americans -- think about this -- would need to die before Democrats, that five years ago supported building a wall, will protect the border. I'm t not just talking about murder, the opioid crisis, in small towns and big cities, most of those drugs, especially the heroin with fentanyl, are coming into this country from the cartels. They are targeting our kids. The United States literally has arrested thousands of people with ties to terror organizations, gang members, violent cartels trying to cross our borders come, along with people that just want a better life.

      "utterance": "As you can see from tonight's Hannity watch, the radical base of the Democratic Party, they are already unhinged. I thought it would take 100 days to fully understand it. We are understanding it now on day two. Many on the left including nearly everyone on every other network, because, of course, it's the hate Trump media, they seem to want a weaker country, filled with lofty, surreal, progressive principles, and they're not looking out for the safety of you and your family. Progressive principles come with serious consequences. Not only will they have unsecure borders, higher taxes, that leads to economic growth that stagnant. Open borders, that can lead to death and terrorism and drugs. A progressive takeover, the United States of America will drastically be in decline. Is that the America you want? Those are the questions we have to ask, so my humble advice is the shutdown, as much as it inconvenienced some people that work for the government, and I hope they get their back pay, it needs to continue straight through the state of the union, and maybe beyond. The state of the union, the president, he can take his case directly to you, we, the people. And while the president should support back pay for those furloughed employees, make no mistake, no matter what the president does, he must hold firm on this border wall funding from Congress. There must be no amnesty under any circumstances. Lindsey Graham, he has made a proposed compromise that would give DACA recipients three years of a work permit that they might be able to renew down the line. If there is no amnesty and money for the border wall to protect the American people, then they will have accomplished something very important. By the way, they will politically benefit for it, but that shouldn't be the reason they do it. If they capitulate, Republicans, the political damage frankly is incalculable. And it will hound a lot of these people, you know, throughout the rest of the Trump presidency. Also, it will have an impact on the 2020 race. The point now is stay the course, don't back down. This is important for the country. When we come back, Congressman Mark Meadows, he'll give us a congressional Hannity watch update in the House, and Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Hannity congressional Senate watch as this watch on the border on the shutdown continue straight ahead."

That this could go on for a longer time, but the reason why we are here tonight talking about this is because the president has looked into the eyes of moms and dads who have lost loved ones because of the fact that we have not secured our border, and he made a promise to them and he made a promise to the American people that he would fix it.

What this woman did - a 41-year-old mother of two young children, you show the lack of respect they have for American institutions such as Congress. But the broader point is the one you just mentioned. They're not interested in in helping America. Just one thing, this woman actually said during her campaign, she would make the perfect juror to convict the President and to impeach him, that's her platform. The Democrats just released their spending bill. Sean, they want to spend an additional $12 billion on foreign aid when they will give zero for a wall. What does that tell you?

These are individuals who are mercenaries, who are not here for the country. They are not here for the future of American families, and we see that now in an attitude. Now, Nancy Pelosi's refusal to repudiate that the nature of the language that was said is also telling. She's - she herself, I think, is afraid - it reveals that she does not have control over this environment.
