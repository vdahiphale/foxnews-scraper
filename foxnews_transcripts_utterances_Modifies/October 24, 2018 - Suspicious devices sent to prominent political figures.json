This is a Fox News alert, the hunt is on to find out who's responsible for sending suspicious packages with suspected explosive devices to several prominent Democrats including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, and also to CNN's New York City offices. We have team Fox coverage with John Roberts at the White House, and Bryan Llenas at Chappaqua, New York. First, let's go to Bryan near the Clinton's home in Westchester County with brand-new information on the FBI's involvement in this investigation. Bryan?",

They were all the same type of packaging. The potential explosive devices were packed into heavy manila envelopes with computer-generated headers, they all had six American postage stamps, and all of the packages had a return address of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz in Florida, and her name was misspelled. Now on Tuesday night, a package sent to the Clinton's was intercepted before it even reached their home here in Chappaqua, New York, a screening technician spotted it on an off-site facility where they checked all of the Clinton mail. Now, President Bill Clinton was at home at the time. Former secretary Hillary Clinton has been campaigning in Florida. Meantime, this morning, this explosive device was mailed to CNN's headquarters in New York. It was address to former CIA Director John Brennan, who was a contributor at CNN. It contained wires and a black pipe, there's also an envelope filled with white powder. Now, the Time Warner Center was evacuated. The bomb was moved by a concrete truck, brought to a bomb squad facility to be examined and then safely detonated. Now here in Chappaqua, we're just 15 minutes away from the home of George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and mega Democratic donor, and you will remember that on Monday a package was delivered to his mailbox. Now investigators are now looking at surveillance tape to determine whether or not that package, which had an explosive device, was hand delivered, put into the mailbox, and not brought there via the mailing system.

But I'm a wait-and-see guy, so I don't want to make -- I think at times like this, you should have less speculation, not more speculation. The problem with cable news is you're required to fill time and speculate. But I realize that when it becomes to mass shootings and suspicious packages and certain events, the first conclusion is often -- the first conclusion on twitter is never the right one. The guy that comes out first usually ends up looking like an idiot. So you need, I think, less speculation is better. But I want to say this illustrates how easy it is to disrupt a free society simply with fear and panic. One person -- one person or a handful of people can have an impact of millions with boxes, pipes, and postage. And I think the upside to this is that it is so shocking because it's rare, and we have to remind ourselves it shocks us because it's rare. Because back in the 1970's, this wasn't rare. This was a common problem. They were actual terror groups, domestic terror groups, more than a handful of them, who were setting bombs, pipe bombs, trying to kill police officers, actually blowing up themselves. This was a regular thing after, you know, in the early '70s, mid '70s. So, this is a rare, disgusting event. It's an act of terror.

And that brings to me to my next point which is that we shouldn't isolate this, or we should include a larger spectrum of what this act means. And by that -- so this was -- there was an explosive device. There was also powder, as you pointed out. That's kind of two different things. When I got my death threat as a federal acting director, I was able to call in an FPS, federal practice service, OPD -- I mean, they were at that guy doorstep within 30 minutes. And my point is that the resources, there's a whole spectrum of them dedicated to ensuring that nothing does fall within the cracks.

We've been watching the Dems offer emotionally lopsided views of the caravans, then, they smear you and me for bringing up any consequences.

Of course, you'd only launch a dozen new caravans, each filled with knowns and unknowns. It's obvious. Oh, wait, that's already happening. That's a consequence. So why aren't the Democrats worried? Because they know the Republicans and the U.S. border patrol will end up being the bad guys, we always are, and bail them out.

And then the mob narrative, it doesn't neutralize it, but it definitely slows it down temporarily. So I think the president right now has to think to himself, right now, he's not dominating. And he's 99 percent dominating and usually never on the defensive, but he's going to be a little bit on the defensive after these bombings -- attempted bombings, because the media is going to blame him.

He's going to fight back, and he's going to say something; and there's going to be a big brawl. You can just see it now. Democrats probably feel a little vindicated when they look at some of these attacks, because they think, you know, \"We've been saying that the president's rhetoric is going to cause violence and cause a political civil war in this country, and look what is happening.\" Republicans are probably looking at this and thinking, \"You know what?\" Probably feeling a little bit guilty if it's some crazy right-wing psychopath and a little bit depressed, and feeling sad.

And, of course, this device, described as a pipe bomb, could be described as an attempted terror attack and appeared to be a legitimate threat, which is why it was transported by the NYPD and a special truck known as a total containment vehicle to a facility in the Bronx that's used to investigate and detonate suspicious packages and unexploded ordinances. But in this case, authorities do not want to blow this thing up, of course, because it's evidence. Once it's rendered safe, the FBI will take possession and likely move it to Quantico, where they'll examine every inch of it. What are the materials used? Where were they purchased? What similarities does it have, not just to the other devices sent this week but devices found in past months and years? How sophisticated is it? Was it built from instructions off the Internet or by someone with military training? And they have no doubt already obtained surveillance footage from the facilities where these devices were mailed from. One thing the FBI has proven it's very good at is investigating after incidents.

We have team Fox coverage with John Roberts at the White House, and Bryan Llenas at Chappaqua, New York. First, let's go to Bryan near the Clinton's home in Westchester County with brand-new information on the FBI's involvement in this investigation. Bryan?"

They were all the same type of packaging. The potential explosive devices were packed into heavy manila envelopes with computer-generated headers, they all had six American postage stamps, and all of the packages had a return address of Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz in Florida, and her name was misspelled. Now on Tuesday night, a package sent to the Clinton's was intercepted before it even reached their home here in Chappaqua, New York, a screening technician spotted it on an off-site facility where they checked all of the Clinton mail. Now, President Bill Clinton was at home at the time. Former secretary Hillary Clinton has been campaigning in Florida. Meantime, this morning, this explosive device was mailed to CNN's headquarters in New York. It was address to former CIA Director John Brennan, who was a contributor at CNN. It contained wires and a black pipe, there's also an envelope filled with white powder. Now, the Time Warner Center was evacuated. The bomb was moved by a concrete truck, brought to a bomb squad facility to be examined and then safely detonated. Now here in Chappaqua, we're just 15 minutes away from the home of George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and mega Democratic donor, and you will remember that on Monday a package was delivered to his mailbox. Now investigators are now looking at surveillance tape to determine whether or not that package, which had an explosive device, was hand delivered, put into the mailbox, and not brought there via the mailing system.

When you tick off the list of names of people who got these devices, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Brennan, Eric Holder, Maxine Waters, George Soros, they count among the president's fiercest either political rivals or critics. So this afternoon when the president was talking about this he was very careful to stay away from politics. Listen here."

So I think any sense of political comity when it comes to actually defending these races may go out the window, but maybe there's a difference, Jesse, and I don't know between, you know, the harsh rhetoric that could lead to political violence and the rhetoric to try to win the seat.

They're all coordinating with the alcohol, tobacco and firearms, and also the NYPD, Washington, D.C. This is something that they train for, they planned for. It is unfortunate. The good news for America is that the U.S. Secret Service, very good investigators. They have great leads. They have the ability to track this stuff down. Plus, thankfully, because none of these devices detonated, they have the evidence to be able to look through, find a fingerprint, cross-check it with possibly any social media posts. I'm not trying to downplay it. It is extremely serious. There could be more out there. But the full weight of the American justice system and our investigative capabilities makes it much more likely that this individual or this group will be caught sooner than later."

It's an act of terror by, likely, a deranged perpetrator or a group. But when I look at stuff like that, it looks almost always like it's a single person. But I'm a wait-and-see guy, so I don't want to make -- I think at times like this, you should have less speculation, not more speculation. The problem with cable news is you're required to fill time and speculate. But I realize that when it becomes to mass shootings and suspicious packages and certain events, the first conclusion is often -- the first conclusion on twitter is never the right one. The guy that comes out first usually ends up looking like an idiot. So you need, I think, less speculation is better. But I want to say this illustrates how easy it is to disrupt a free society simply with fear and panic. One person -- one person or a handful of people can have an impact of millions with boxes, pipes, and postage. And I think the upside to this is that it is so shocking because it's rare, and we have to remind ourselves it shocks us because it's rare. Because back in the 1970's, this wasn't rare. This was a common problem. They were actual terror groups, domestic terror groups, more than a handful of them, who were setting bombs, pipe bombs, trying to kill police officers, actually blowing up themselves. This was a regular thing after, you know, in the early '70s, mid '70s. So, this is a rare, disgusting event. It's an act of terror. But to go and try to speculate on anything without first having an arrest or suspect, I'd stay away from it."

And I don't think that this is representative of his supporters in anyway, but I do think that there are people out there who hear him very clearly when he says, oh, you know, those Democrats, lock up Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, he's not really an American. These people want to do away with ICE. They don't want borders. These are people who want to turn America into Venezuela -- I mean the rhetoric. And then, of course, he's the one who always said, go ahead and punch them. I'll pay your legal bills. The big problem around here is that we don't want to hurt anyone anymore. That kind of rhetoric, I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat, really does invite violence. And then you see these, today, and, of course, I think for people on the left, the instinct, and I think it's a mistake, would be to jump and say, I know exactly the source of this."

Just recently we had a Democratic -- former Democratic staffer that was arrested, charged with multiple felonies for doxing three GOP senators. Certainly, you can't isolate -- not only the rhetoric, but also the actual act. And that brings to me to my next point which is that we shouldn't isolate this, or we should include a larger spectrum of what this act means. And by that -- so this was -- there was an explosive device. There was also powder, as you pointed out. That's kind of two different things. When I got my death threat as a federal acting director, I was able to call in an FPS, federal practice service, OPD -- I mean, they were at that guy doorstep within 30 minutes. And my point is that the resources, there's a whole spectrum of them dedicated to ensuring that nothing does fall within the cracks. And that they treat every threat -- you know the word credible threat, that's a misnomer. Every threat is credible. Nothing is isolated or ignored because all it takes is one, and that speaks to integrity of the secret service and -- as well as the FBI and the other agencies."

Now, no longer in power, they depend on the Republicans to play grown-up and they be the kids, as thousands of migrants come our way. Fact is the Democrats need Republicans to be the bad guys, I.E., the adults. So the Democrat can hold dumb stances they don't even like. We've been watching the Dems offer emotionally lopsided views of the caravans, then, they smear you and me for bringing up any consequences. But imagine if there were no border constraints to stop the caravan. Imagine if we just hum John Lennon songs as we waved everyone through. Of course, you'd only launch a dozen new caravans, each filled with knowns and unknowns. It's obvious. Oh, wait, that's already happening. That's a consequence. So why aren't the Democrats worried? Because they know the Republicans and the U.S. border patrol will end up being the bad guys, we always are, and bail them out. It's perfect for Democrats because, really, it's all about looking good by feeling really bad about telling the migrants they can't stay. It's all theater. And in this theater the evil characters are anyone who thinks critically, and a hero, the progressive who pushes emotion without consequence, and he wins because he can fake empathy, still have a border, and an orange villain to blame it on. It's great being a kid. You can demand the dumbest things and secretly hope your parents aren't listening. What do you think of my theory, Dana, that the Democrats actually need Republicans to be the bad guys because they know that they're going to -- they're going to pull the band aid off, they're going to ground the students, you know what I mean?"

So when you see a bunch of impoverished strangers from Central America, kind of hostility, you're rushing north, and they're chanting things about our president, and they're wearing t- shirts that kind of a little offensive, and they're paying coyotes cash, and then they meet up with a bunch of lawyers from the ACLU, south of the border, and they're coached on what to say in order to get asylum. A lot of Americans look at that and they're a little uneasy with that. All we're saying is don't cut in line. Come here in an orderly process. We want a fair and orderly immigration system. But we also want compassion for Americans. Yuma and, I think, Arizona, this town is being overwhelmed by immigrants who are just dump there by the border patrol because they can't hold them. And the town's people and the citizens of Yuma, Hispanics, blacks, and white, American citizens are feeling like, what is happening to our town? We didn't vote for this. Where's the compassion for them?"

And also, I think, no polls matter except for the poll after the election of who voted. You know what I mean? Everything is always going to be probably wrong. There's huge margin of error, we learned that multiple times. And I think the races that matter or that would be very fascinating are the ones outside of Washington state, legislators and the governors. And I think is where a lot of policy will be driven moving forward, especially with the climate we're in, in terms of the state laws. That's going to be an interesting arena moving forward."

A kind of an October surprise, not a political conspiracy with these bomb mailings, but it changes the entire midterm dynamic in a huge way. Think about it. Right now it takes the caravan completely off the front page. It really puts Kavanaugh more in the rear mirror. And then the mob narrative, it doesn't neutralize it, but it definitely slows it down temporarily. So I think the president right now has to think to himself, right now, he's not dominating. And he's 99 percent dominating and usually never on the defensive, but he's going to be a little bit on the defensive after these bombings -- attempted bombings, because the media is going to blame him. And they've already started to blame him. So he has a choice. Does he sit back and try to rise above it, or does he, you know, fight back? He's going to fight back, and he's going to say something; and there's going to be a big brawl. You can just see it now. Democrats probably feel a little vindicated when they look at some of these attacks, because they think, you know, \"We've been saying that the president's rhetoric is going to cause violence and cause a political civil war in this country, and look what is happening.\" Republicans are probably looking at this and thinking, \"You know what?\" Probably feeling a little bit guilty if it's some crazy right-wing psychopath and a little bit depressed, and feeling sad. And independents, I think, have kind of started to feel a little calmer with the Trump presidency, but this really brings a whole lot more instability to the Trump presidency. So I think they're a little unnerved by what's going on."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, there's separate reasons for that. But the Democrats focus on health care for a good reason. Every poll shows, including the Fox News poll, it's the No. 1 issue on everyone's minds. So I do think that the Republicans didn't realize that the issue of preexisting conditions, no matter how many times they say, \"We are for covering preexisting conditions,\" there is just a way for the Democrats to get in there and get under peoples' skin and worry people about it. Two weeks is an eternity. The political winds can change. Two things will be, for sure, happening. One, President Trump will continue to saturate the airwaves. It was a strategy that worked for him in 2016, and he's going to ride that to the end. But the other thing is that the 2020 Democrats have realized that Elizbeth Warren getting out last week and trying to, you know, show that she's Indian, Native American, it fell flat. So you don't see a lot of the 2020 Democrats getting out ahead of the midterm elections. They're going to wait until the starting pistol goes off. And that will be at midnight on Election Day."

It could be a partial fingerprint, or a tiny speck of DNA, or fibers or traceable components. And while the NYPD and local police may have been the first to respond to these incidents, the FBI will take the lead. Its primary focus is preventing and investigating terror attacks. And, of course, this device, described as a pipe bomb, could be described as an attempted terror attack and appeared to be a legitimate threat, which is why it was transported by the NYPD and a special truck known as a total containment vehicle to a facility in the Bronx that's used to investigate and detonate suspicious packages and unexploded ordinances. But in this case, authorities do not want to blow this thing up, of course, because it's evidence. Once it's rendered safe, the FBI will take possession and likely move it to Quantico, where they'll examine every inch of it. What are the materials used? Where were they purchased? What similarities does it have, not just to the other devices sent this week but devices found in past months and years? How sophisticated is it? Was it built from instructions off the Internet or by someone with military training? And they have no doubt already obtained surveillance footage from the facilities where these devices were mailed from. One thing the FBI has proven it's very good at is investigating after incidents. So there will be clues, and the FBI most likely will find them -- Emily."

And so I don't expect any sort of national unity now to last any longer than a couple of days. Unfortunately, this country is so divided that something even as heinous as this isn't going to bring us together. With that said, everyone is speculating on the motives. We still don't know the motive of the Las Vegas shooter, so for people to think we're going to get to the bottom of this now, they have no clue. These investigations could go any way. Right now, it's -- all signs are pointing to some lunatic right-wing psychopath loner or a group of people, but you don't know what the investigation could find. It could find anything.

It's easy enough to tell lies. Let the people try to catch up with it later. The press is the enemy.\" You mentioned the shooting at the Capital Gazette in Annapolis. But there's also, I mean, a constant kind of language that we hear at the rallies. So to me, this is very disturbing. And again, I'm with Jesse on this one. I don't think we know what's behind it or who's behind it. But I can say I live in America today, that we are not only divided, we are being intentionally divided. We talk about the Russians going at the various fissures in American society, whether it be race or income or party. And this is where we are.

There was a tangential relationship to say, well, we shouldn't say the press is the enemy of the people. Absolutely agree. But if we blame people that are speaking -- like, Juan, last night, your \"One More Thing\" was about the importance of the First Amendment and freedom of speech. Speech is not violence.
