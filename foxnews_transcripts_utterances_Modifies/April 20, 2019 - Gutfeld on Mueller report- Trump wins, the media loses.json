Announce another less redacted report in three weeks just to watch them fall for this a third time. You can keep doing this for years. The bottom line the press wanted America's President to be a Russian stooge, even if that would have destroyed the country. And don't expect them to stop. They're going to push the Mueller hysteric because what else do they have? This is a pretty prosperous peaceful era -- low unemployment, economic growth, strong military -- the media can't do a thing with that. So every day on CNN or MSNBC, it's a therapy session.

People -- when you bring up sex addiction, they say, \"Oh, that's not a real thing.\" Which is weird, because it just got added it to the Diagnostic Statistical Manual.  But then, if you consider all the mental illnesses people do consider real, like being afraid of clowns. You could go -- you could go into a psychologist office and say I'm a sex addict. And they would -- it's ruining my life personally and professionally. They would say that's not a real thing. But you could say I'm afraid clowns. And he would say, well, that's very interesting. Did your father try to fit a whole bunch of you into a really small car?"

They found that 39 percent of beard samples had harmful bacteria compared to only 13 percent on the pooch. The study concluded quote, \"Bearded men harbor significantly higher burden of microbes and more human pathogenic strains than dogs.\" They are right.  This time, we took a deep dive inside the beard."
