Restrictions are coming back in blue states as a top official say one mandate could be made permanent. And the White House playing cleanup over a Kamala Harris interview that went completely off the rails. But first, President Biden's agenda implodes after moderate Senator Joe Manchin says he's a no on the massive Build Back Better spending plan. The squad going nuclear over that.",

It was just kind of a naked tell when you heard that. Whose side they were on. And then you sit there and you go OK, who's fault is this? Because we just saw that the squad was just about on every single show. So, it wasn't like people were keeping them quiet, they had every moment and opportunity to explain why this bill should be the best thing since sliced bread, so you can't blame a Joe Manchin. You actually have to blame the Democrats like Joe Biden who did not have the guts to stand up to the militant progressive wing of their party who turned an infrastructure -- an infrastructure bill into a Candyland of Marxist, you know, dreams and junk science and junk economics. Lastly, it's like if you think about -- if you think about what liberals consider heroes these days, obviously Bernie Sanders, but you have like Lynne Cheney, you have Adam Kinzinger.

And then through the negotiating process he opted to 1.7 trillion. There's a report that he went to the White House the other day and said I want the 1.8. Whether it's true or not this is what's reported. September 29th, and Dana, we talked about this earlier in the show, Manchin put out a statement that he said, what I made clear is that spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs where you can't even pay for the central social programs like social security and Medicare is the definition of fiscal sanity. He is always mentioned mean testing. He's always mentioned work requirements. Without a and b there, you're just, you're back to welfare. And a significant way built into this bill. During that interview with Bret yesterday Manchin mentioned a hearing from years ago. It was joint chiefs chair Michael McMullen (Ph), I think it was 2011, and he was asked the question, what is the biggest danger to America? And his answer was our national debt. Well, in 2011, our national debt was $14 trillion. Today we're 29 trillion. We've easily doubled that since then. Manchin hasn't changed. He has felt this the entire time. Why does this fail? If you want to find faults, look at the president and look at Democrats in Congress with a 50/50 Senate and a four-seat majority in the House. They overplayed their hand --",

After saying behind the scenes that Joe was a joke, he forced Buttigieg, Klobuchar out, because they were afraid that someone like socialist Bernie was going to get the race. And so, they forced all these people out because Joe was the guy, but Joe changed once Georgia happened. He went from being moderate Joe to saying, look, I think we can actually be progressive. Bernie flipped and said he may be the most progressive president. AOC flipped. And the whole squad coalesce behind Joe Biden. But they didn't do that with Manchin. And so, I think what you are looking at right now is that, you know, the political compass of Joe Biden used to be Joe Manchin.

We walk around the city today and people are in lined for two and half hours just trying to get a test. Whereas in Europe you can walk in to anywhere. Or you mailed the test for free or for a dollar you can get one in the pharmacy. Here everybody is sold out. So, testing in this country has become a complete and terrible situation.

And the colds, I'm the worst when I have a cold, I hate it. I get that. But the CDC's protocol are that you have to -- if you test positive, you have to take 10 days off of work. One of the reasons the hospitals are getting overwhelmed is because many people, because it's highly transmissible, are testing positive even if they don't feel sick which means that then they have to stay home for 10 days. So, you're talking all sorts of people at hospitals, anywhere, maybe even you know, here -- anywhere -- and that's not just in New York City, that's across the country.

Whether it's true or not this is what's reported. September 29th, and Dana, we talked about this earlier in the show, Manchin put out a statement that he said, what I made clear is that spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs where you can't even pay for the central social programs like social security and Medicare is the definition of fiscal sanity. He is always mentioned mean testing. He's always mentioned work requirements. Without a and b there, you're just, you're back to welfare. And a significant way built into this bill. During that interview with Bret yesterday Manchin mentioned a hearing from years ago. It was joint chiefs chair Michael McMullen (Ph), I think it was 2011, and he was asked the question, what is the biggest danger to America? And his answer was our national debt. Well, in 2011, our national debt was $14 trillion. Today we're 29 trillion. We've easily doubled that since then. Manchin hasn't changed. He has felt this the entire time. Why does this fail?

After saying behind the scenes that Joe was a joke, he forced Buttigieg, Klobuchar out, because they were afraid that someone like socialist Bernie was going to get the race. And so, they forced all these people out because Joe was the guy, but Joe changed once Georgia happened. He went from being moderate Joe to saying, look, I think we can actually be progressive. Bernie flipped and said he may be the most progressive president. AOC flipped. And the whole squad coalesce behind Joe Biden. But they didn't do that with Manchin.

And the colds, I'm the worst when I have a cold, I hate it. I get that. But the CDC's protocol are that you have to -- if you test positive, you have to take 10 days off of work. One of the reasons the hospitals are getting overwhelmed is because many people, because it's highly transmissible, are testing positive even if they don't feel sick which means that then they have to stay home for 10 days. So, you're talking all sorts of people at hospitals, anywhere, maybe even you know, here -- anywhere -- and that's not just in New York City, that's across the country.

Whether it's true or not this is what's reported. September 29th, and Dana, we talked about this earlier in the show, Manchin put out a statement that he said, what I made clear is that spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs where you can't even pay for the central social programs like social security and Medicare is the definition of fiscal sanity. He is always mentioned mean testing. He's always mentioned work requirements. Without a and b there, you're just, you're back to welfare. And a significant way built into this bill. During that interview with Bret yesterday Manchin mentioned a hearing from years ago. It was joint chiefs chair Michael McMullen (Ph), I think it was 2011, and he was asked the question, what is the biggest danger to America? And his answer was our national debt. Well, in 2011, our national debt was $14 trillion. Today we're 29 trillion. We've easily doubled that since then. Manchin hasn't changed. He has felt this the entire time. Why does this fail?

After saying behind the scenes that Joe was a joke, he forced Buttigieg, Klobuchar out, because they were afraid that someone like socialist Bernie was going to get the race. And so, they forced all these people out because Joe was the guy, but Joe changed once Georgia happened. He went from being moderate Joe to saying, look, I think we can actually be progressive. Bernie flipped and said he may be the most progressive president. AOC flipped. And the whole squad coalesce behind Joe Biden. But they didn't do that with Manchin. And so, I think what you are looking at right now is that, you know, the political compass of Joe Biden used to be Joe Manchin.

At the same time, you have some of the mainstream media is now starting to say wait a second, let me look into this data about, you said that mask is working in schools. But can I see behind the curtain? It turns out the data is not there. So, there's questions about that. I also think that the testing situation is a complete and total disaster. We walk around the city today and people are in lined for two and half hours just trying to get a test. Whereas in Europe you can walk in to anywhere. Or you mailed the test for free or for a dollar you can get one in the pharmacy. Here everybody is sold out. So, testing in this country has become a complete and terrible situation. So, I do think that they have to try something new. The other thing I would say is that when Kamala Harris said that nobody saw this coming, it doesn't inspire confidence. Because, one, that's how viruses work. And now that's what her team is trying to say.",

And the colds, I'm the worst when I have a cold, I hate it. I get that. But the CDC's protocol are that you have to -- if you test positive, you have to take 10 days off of work. One of the reasons the hospitals are getting overwhelmed is because many people, because it's highly transmissible, are testing positive even if they don't feel sick which means that then they have to stay home for 10 days. So, you're talking all sorts of people at hospitals, anywhere, maybe even you know, here -- anywhere -- and that's not just in New York City, that's across the country.

Restrictions are coming back in blue states as a top official say one mandate could be made permanent. And the White House playing cleanup over a Kamala Harris interview that went completely off the rails.

They just wanted a victory at any cost, never mind what it would do to inflation and everybody knew it would be a disaster and they didn't care about what was buried in the bill. It was just kind of a naked tell when you heard that. Whose side they were on. And then you sit there and you go OK, who's fault is this? Because we just saw that the squad was just about on every single show. So, it wasn't like people were keeping them quiet, they had every moment and opportunity to explain why this bill should be the best thing since sliced bread, so you can't blame a Joe Manchin. You actually have to blame the Democrats like Joe Biden who did not have the guts to stand up to the militant progressive wing of their party who turned an infrastructure -- an infrastructure bill into a Candyland of Marxist, you know, dreams and junk science and junk economics. Lastly, it's like if you think about -- if you think about what liberals consider heroes these days, obviously Bernie Sanders, but you have like Lynne Cheney, you have Adam Kinzinger. You've got John McCain. These are all these people that like stood up and spoke truth to power. Manchin just did the same thing."

I think if you were paying attention to the case at hands, Senator Manchin made his intentions clear the entire time. Over the summer when Chuck Schumer said I'm good for 1.5 trillion. And then through the negotiating process he opted to 1.7 trillion. There's a report that he went to the White House the other day and said I want the 1.8. Whether it's true or not this is what's reported. September 29th, and Dana, we talked about this earlier in the show, Manchin put out a statement that he said, what I made clear is that spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs where you can't even pay for the central social programs like social security and Medicare is the definition of fiscal sanity. He is always mentioned mean testing. He's always mentioned work requirements. Without a and b there, you're just, you're back to welfare. And a significant way built into this bill. During that interview with Bret yesterday Manchin mentioned a hearing from years ago. It was joint chiefs chair Michael McMullen (Ph), I think it was 2011, and he was asked the question, what is the biggest danger to America? And his answer was our national debt. Well, in 2011, our national debt was $14 trillion. Today we're 29 trillion. We've easily doubled that since then. Manchin hasn't changed. He has felt this the entire time. Why does this fail? If you want to find faults, look at the president and look at Democrats in Congress with a 50/50 Senate and a four-seat majority in the House. They overplayed their hand --"

Please assume that you can get one over on me easily, because I'm from Virginia or West Virginia. And then you sit back and do you watch there, as I said before, their pomposity melt into horror when they realize that they've lost. But these temper tantrums that they had on national TV, and I'm talking about AOC and her click, since when the temper tantrums make you look strong. They look weak. They are a party controlled by petulant children. Veruca Salt. I want it, and I want it now! They are mad, they are stomping and they are blinded by ideology. And they -- this is not the work of pragmatic people. Danger is inside, and Manchin said this on that radio interview, that he said it's not the president, it's the staff. It's the progressive staff, Ron Klain and the people he hired who are pushing this far-left wing agenda at a time when Medicare is running out of money. So, the Wall Street Journal wrote today in the editorial like, is he going to -- if he wants to make a pivot, he's got to jettison."

I mean, Joe Biden and his camp it should be Manchin based on what the promise during the presidential campaign. Remember back on the campaign, Barack Obama got involved with the race. After saying behind the scenes that Joe was a joke, he forced Buttigieg, Klobuchar out, because they were afraid that someone like socialist Bernie was going to get the race. And so, they forced all these people out because Joe was the guy, but Joe changed once Georgia happened. He went from being moderate Joe to saying, look, I think we can actually be progressive. Bernie flipped and said he may be the most progressive president. AOC flipped. And the whole squad coalesce behind Joe Biden. But they didn't do that with Manchin. And so, I think what you are looking at right now is that, you know, the political compass of Joe Biden used to be Joe Manchin. And now he's trying to pretend like Joe changed, Joe Manchin changed when he really was the one that changed. And I think the voters see this and I think this is why the Biden agenda is dead, because he never really had a compass."

That is them trying to frighten the badubies (Ph) of the people for no reason. It is clearly not working. Number one. The -- Joe Biden said on the campaign trail if the president had done his job and done his job from the beginning, all of these people would still be alive. well, that's on him now because he's been in office almost a year. There's a few things going on. The fact that you have all of these antiviral drugs that have not been passed out of the FDA. Merck and Pfizer to name two. There's another one. Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant that they could be prescribing people. With the Pfizer drug, i said it Friday, it completely eliminates death. And another problem is, it is this -- it's this knee jerk of going to have to get a booster in New York. Kathy Hochul is going to force people to get boosters. It's expected that all of the top ecologists are going to make students get boosters in the spring. Well, kids who are fully vaccinated under the age of 30 there is zero death, that's without a booster. And there's been poultry little work done on myocarditis and pericarditis. And these colleges are, they're flirting with disaster with the students if they're going to make them get boosters, because they do not have enough research on the effects of boosters and -- I mean, they don't have enough research on the effect of vaccines, but the boosters are not needed in the young because there is no death in people under 30."

Because it's so urgent they had to wait until Tuesday in order to give a speech. I feel like they have to change up their tactics, because I could write the speech today. If they are going to talk about vaccines, boosters, masks, and dire, and doom. And they just say the same thing over and over. And it's obviously not moving the needle. At the same time, you have some of the mainstream media is now starting to say wait a second, let me look into this data about, you said that mask is working in schools. But can I see behind the curtain? It turns out the data is not there. So, there's questions about that. I also think that the testing situation is a complete and total disaster. We walk around the city today and people are in lined for two and half hours just trying to get a test. Whereas in Europe you can walk in to anywhere. Or you mailed the test for free or for a dollar you can get one in the pharmacy. Here everybody is sold out. So, testing in this country has become a complete and terrible situation. So, I do think that they have to try something new. The other thing I would say is that when Kamala Harris said that nobody saw this coming, it doesn't inspire confidence.

The public ended the war on drugs just by changing opinion and people talking about it. I say I'll probably argue that with Afghanistan, too. Probably like Vietnam. So, I think that right now it's the American -- it's the public that has to take control, because the government is too scared of liability, litigation, of being voted out of office to actually have any balls to do anything for this.

To see what happened to this country, to see the pain of American citizens, because the people that are making these decisions -- it's not going to hit them. It really isn't.

So, it's like lefties only embrace incentives to control decent law-abiding citizens, but when it comes to criminals, no cash bail, no prison time. That's an incentive for committing crime.

It is very transmissible. I mean, like, every -- like, it's exponentially transmissible. But for most people, it's either asymptomatic or very mild like a cold. And the colds, I'm the worst when I have a cold, I hate it. I get that. But the CDC's protocol are that you have to -- if you test positive, you have to take 10 days off of work. One of the reasons the hospitals are getting overwhelmed is because many people, because it's highly transmissible, are testing positive even if they don't feel sick which means that then they have to stay home for 10 days. So, you're talking all sorts of people at hospitals, anywhere, maybe even you know, here -- anywhere -- and that's not just in New York City, that's across the country. So, first and foremost, I think the President could do something helpful tomorrow which is to say that he's asked the CDC to revise those guidelines because that is clearly not necessary. The other thing is, they got to come out tomorrow with some sort of encouragement."

And then she got into this whole thing about her being the VP and everyone knows that. And then she had a great moment at the end where she was aggressive and -- but there was no substance there which is her problem. She has great moments when they can script them out with we saw at the early of the campaign with Joe Biden.

It was just kind of a naked tell when you heard that. Whose side they were on. And then you sit there and you go OK, who's fault is this? Because we just saw that the squad was just about on every single show. So, it wasn't like people were keeping them quiet, they had every moment and opportunity to explain why this bill should be the best thing since sliced bread, so you can't blame a Joe Manchin. You actually have to blame the Democrats like Joe Biden who did not have the guts to stand up to the militant progressive wing of their party who turned an infrastructure -- an infrastructure bill into a Candyland of Marxist, you know, dreams and junk science and junk economics. Lastly, it's like if you think about -- if you think about what liberals consider heroes these days, obviously Bernie Sanders, but you have like Lynne Cheney, you have Adam Kinzinger.

And then through the negotiating process he opted to 1.7 trillion. There's a report that he went to the White House the other day and said I want the 1.8. Whether it's true or not this is what's reported. September 29th, and Dana, we talked about this earlier in the show, Manchin put out a statement that he said, what I made clear is that spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs where you can't even pay for the central social programs like social security and Medicare is the definition of fiscal sanity. He is always mentioned mean testing. He's always mentioned work requirements. Without a and b there, you're just, you're back to welfare. And a significant way built into this bill. During that interview with Bret yesterday Manchin mentioned a hearing from years ago. It was joint chiefs chair Michael McMullen (Ph), I think it was 2011, and he was asked the question, what is the biggest danger to America? And his answer was our national debt. Well, in 2011, our national debt was $14 trillion. Today we're 29 trillion. We've easily doubled that since then. Manchin hasn't changed. He has felt this the entire time. Why does this fail? If you want to find faults, look at the president and look at Democrats in Congress with a 50/50 Senate and a four-seat majority in the House. They overplayed their hand --"

It's the progressive staff, Ron Klain and the people he hired who are pushing this far-left wing agenda at a time when Medicare is running out of money.

I mean, Joe Biden and his camp it should be Manchin based on what the promise during the presidential campaign. Remember back on the campaign, Barack Obama got involved with the race. After saying behind the scenes that Joe was a joke, he forced Buttigieg, Klobuchar out, because they were afraid that someone like socialist Bernie was going to get the race. And so, they forced all these people out because Joe was the guy, but Joe changed once Georgia happened. He went from being moderate Joe to saying, look, I think we can actually be progressive. Bernie flipped and said he may be the most progressive president. AOC flipped. And the whole squad coalesce behind Joe Biden. But they didn't do that with Manchin. And so, I think what you are looking at right now is that, you know, the political compass of Joe Biden used to be Joe Manchin. And now he's trying to pretend like Joe changed, Joe Manchin changed when he really was the one that changed. And I think the voters see this and I think this is why the Biden agenda is dead, because he never really had a compass."

The -- Joe Biden said on the campaign trail if the president had done his job and done his job from the beginning, all of these people would still be alive. well, that's on him now because he's been in office almost a year. There's a few things going on. The fact that you have all of these antiviral drugs that have not been passed out of the FDA. Merck and Pfizer to name two. There's another one. Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant that they could be prescribing people. With the Pfizer drug, i said it Friday, it completely eliminates death. And another problem is, it is this -- it's this knee jerk of going to have to get a booster in New York. Kathy Hochul is going to force people to get boosters. It's expected that all of the top ecologists are going to make students get boosters in the spring. Well, kids who are fully vaccinated under the age of 30 there is zero death, that's without a booster. And there's been poultry little work done on myocarditis and pericarditis. And these colleges are, they're flirting with disaster with the students if they're going to make them get boosters, because they do not have enough research on the effects of boosters and -- I mean, they don't have enough research on the effect of vaccines, but the boosters are not needed in the young because there is no death in people under 30."

At the same time, you have some of the mainstream media is now starting to say wait a second, let me look into this data about, you said that mask is working in schools. But can I see behind the curtain? It turns out the data is not there. So, there's questions about that. I also think that the testing situation is a complete and total disaster. We walk around the city today and people are in lined for two and half hours just trying to get a test. Whereas in Europe you can walk in to anywhere. Or you mailed the test for free or for a dollar you can get one in the pharmacy. Here everybody is sold out. So, testing in this country has become a complete and terrible situation. So, I do think that they have to try something new. The other thing I would say is that when Kamala Harris said that nobody saw this coming, it doesn't inspire confidence.

And the colds, I'm the worst when I have a cold, I hate it. I get that. But the CDC's protocol are that you have to -- if you test positive, you have to take 10 days off of work. One of the reasons the hospitals are getting overwhelmed is because many people, because it's highly transmissible, are testing positive even if they don't feel sick which means that then they have to stay home for 10 days. So, you're talking all sorts of people at hospitals, anywhere, maybe even you know, here -- anywhere -- and that's not just in New York City, that's across the country. So, first and foremost, I think the President could do something helpful tomorrow which is to say that he's asked the CDC to revise those guidelines because that is clearly not necessary.

The thing is, how bad is this, when you are with Charlamagne, with Symone Sanders in the control room, and it's -- you have the most benevolent situation and it still that bad. That's why she can't do other interviews. I have a feeling that the Dems want an entire clean slate for 2024.

I have a different view about this. I think that this interview helped Kamala Harris with the people she needs to have more confidence in her, and that's their base. Midterm elections are not about independent swing voters who show up once in a while for a midterm. These are about base elections. At the end of the interview, what Charlamagne says is that's the Kamala I have missed. That's the Kamala I want to see. So, I have a feeling you're going to see a lot more of that."

The question was, who has the most power, which is Manchin. And she refused to answer that question. He also followed up by saying, is Manchin a problem? She didn't answer that question as well. And then she got into this whole thing about her being the VP and everyone knows that. And then she had a great moment at the end where she was aggressive and -- but there was no substance there which is her problem. She has great moments when they can script them out with we saw at the early of the campaign with Joe Biden. But when you start getting into policy where she stands on things -- and don't take my word for it, look at her people. Her people don't even trust her to answer the question because she clearly heard the question."

She went into a five minutes soliloquy at the beginning of the interview, and then at the end, just repeated the exact same thing she had said at the beginning. And Charlamagne kept asking, when are we going to get a real -- get real with the American people and know that Joe Manchin is ruining the country? He's stopping progress and ruining democracy. He just went on and on. Kamala -- the whole thing was just a (INAUDIBLE)."

They just wanted a victory at any cost, never mind what it would do to inflation and everybody knew it would be a disaster and they didn't care about what was buried in the bill. It was just kind of a naked tell when you heard that. Whose side they were on. And then you sit there and you go OK, who's fault is this? Because we just saw that the squad was just about on every single show. So, it wasn't like people were keeping them quiet, they had every moment and opportunity to explain why this bill should be the best thing since sliced bread, so you can't blame a Joe Manchin. You actually have to blame the Democrats like Joe Biden who did not have the guts to stand up to the militant progressive wing of their party who turned an infrastructure -- an infrastructure bill into a Candyland of Marxist, you know, dreams and junk science and junk economics. Lastly, it's like if you think about -- if you think about what liberals consider heroes these days, obviously Bernie Sanders, but you have like Lynne Cheney, you have Adam Kinzinger.

And then through the negotiating process he opted to 1.7 trillion. There's a report that he went to the White House the other day and said I want the 1.8. Whether it's true or not this is what's reported. September 29th, and Dana, we talked about this earlier in the show, Manchin put out a statement that he said, what I made clear is that spending trillions more on new and expanded government programs where you can't even pay for the central social programs like social security and Medicare is the definition of fiscal sanity. He is always mentioned mean testing. He's always mentioned work requirements. Without a and b there, you're just, you're back to welfare. And a significant way built into this bill. During that interview with Bret yesterday Manchin mentioned a hearing from years ago. It was joint chiefs chair Michael McMullen (Ph), I think it was 2011, and he was asked the question, what is the biggest danger to America? And his answer was our national debt. Well, in 2011, our national debt was $14 trillion. Today we're 29 trillion. We've easily doubled that since then. Manchin hasn't changed. He has felt this the entire time. Why does this fail? If you want to find faults, look at the president and look at Democrats in Congress with a 50/50 Senate and a four-seat majority in the House. They overplayed their hand --"

They are a party controlled by petulant children. Veruca Salt. I want it, and I want it now! They are mad, they are stomping and they are blinded by ideology. And they -- this is not the work of pragmatic people. Danger is inside, and Manchin said this on that radio interview, that he said it's not the president, it's the staff. It's the progressive staff, Ron Klain and the people he hired who are pushing this far-left wing agenda at a time when Medicare is running out of money.

I mean, Joe Biden and his camp it should be Manchin based on what the promise during the presidential campaign. Remember back on the campaign, Barack Obama got involved with the race. After saying behind the scenes that Joe was a joke, he forced Buttigieg, Klobuchar out, because they were afraid that someone like socialist Bernie was going to get the race. And so, they forced all these people out because Joe was the guy, but Joe changed once Georgia happened. He went from being moderate Joe to saying, look, I think we can actually be progressive. Bernie flipped and said he may be the most progressive president. AOC flipped. And the whole squad coalesce behind Joe Biden. But they didn't do that with Manchin. And so, I think what you are looking at right now is that, you know, the political compass of Joe Biden used to be Joe Manchin. And now he's trying to pretend like Joe changed, Joe Manchin changed when he really was the one that changed. And I think the voters see this and I think this is why the Biden agenda is dead, because he never really had a compass."

The -- Joe Biden said on the campaign trail if the president had done his job and done his job from the beginning, all of these people would still be alive. well, that's on him now because he's been in office almost a year. There's a few things going on. The fact that you have all of these antiviral drugs that have not been passed out of the FDA. Merck and Pfizer to name two. There's another one. Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant that they could be prescribing people. With the Pfizer drug, i said it Friday, it completely eliminates death. And another problem is, it is this -- it's this knee jerk of going to have to get a booster in New York. Kathy Hochul is going to force people to get boosters. It's expected that all of the top ecologists are going to make students get boosters in the spring. Well, kids who are fully vaccinated under the age of 30 there is zero death, that's without a booster. And there's been poultry little work done on myocarditis and pericarditis. And these colleges are, they're flirting with disaster with the students if they're going to make them get boosters, because they do not have enough research on the effects of boosters and -- I mean, they don't have enough research on the effect of vaccines, but the boosters are not needed in the young because there is no death in people under 30."

If they are going to talk about vaccines, boosters, masks, and dire, and doom. And they just say the same thing over and over. And it's obviously not moving the needle. At the same time, you have some of the mainstream media is now starting to say wait a second, let me look into this data about, you said that mask is working in schools. But can I see behind the curtain? It turns out the data is not there. So, there's questions about that. I also think that the testing situation is a complete and total disaster. We walk around the city today and people are in lined for two and half hours just trying to get a test. Whereas in Europe you can walk in to anywhere. Or you mailed the test for free or for a dollar you can get one in the pharmacy. Here everybody is sold out. So, testing in this country has become a complete and terrible situation. So, I do think that they have to try something new. The other thing I would say is that when Kamala Harris said that nobody saw this coming, it doesn't inspire confidence.

Right? Someone that needs to get in there who is not left or right. Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, Betty White."

The public ended the war on drugs just by changing opinion and people talking about it. I say I'll probably argue that with Afghanistan, too. Probably like Vietnam. So, I think that right now it's the American -- it's the public that has to take control, because the government is too scared of liability, litigation, of being voted out of office to actually have any balls to do anything for this.

So, it's like lefties only embrace incentives to control decent law-abiding citizens, but when it comes to criminals, no cash bail, no prison time. That's an incentive for committing crime.

It is very transmissible. I mean, like, every -- like, it's exponentially transmissible. But for most people, it's either asymptomatic or very mild like a cold. And the colds, I'm the worst when I have a cold, I hate it. I get that. But the CDC's protocol are that you have to -- if you test positive, you have to take 10 days off of work. One of the reasons the hospitals are getting overwhelmed is because many people, because it's highly transmissible, are testing positive even if they don't feel sick which means that then they have to stay home for 10 days. So, you're talking all sorts of people at hospitals, anywhere, maybe even you know, here -- anywhere -- and that's not just in New York City, that's across the country. So, first and foremost, I think the President could do something helpful tomorrow which is to say that he's asked the CDC to revise those guidelines because that is clearly not necessary. The other thing is, they got to come out tomorrow with some sort of encouragement."

And then she got into this whole thing about her being the VP and everyone knows that. And then she had a great moment at the end where she was aggressive and -- but there was no substance there which is her problem. She has great moments when they can script them out with we saw at the early of the campaign with Joe Biden.
