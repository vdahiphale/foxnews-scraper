      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". A lot of breaking news this Thursday night.  Tracking multiple developing stories, including calls for Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign or to be impeached. But Cuomo doesn't seem too concerned.  Of course, the legal issues he's facing are worse than anything.  But there he is lounging by the pool with an aide. These photos exclusively obtained by \"The New York Post\" for some much needed I guess west and relaxation. We'll have a lot more on this later in the show. Also tonight, more rampant hypocrisy on Capitol Hill -- shocking, I know, right? This time, Congresswoman Cori Bush is actually facing criticism for she was hiring private security while leading the \"defund the police\"  movement, you can't make it up. You'll definitely want to see her unhinged response, coming up. Also, we have the very latest from the recall election in California where Gavin Newsom, the current governor, is actually underwater in one poll as they have tightened considerably. Larry Elder who is leading in the polls could very well be the next governor of the Golden State. That's all coming up, straight ahead.  And later, Dan Bongino, Geraldo Rivera, they will be here to throw down over what is the single biggest largest most massive super spreader event, and that is our southern border. That is the Biden super spreader.   But, first, it is official. Biden's dark summer is now upon all of us, and Dr. Doom and Gloom Flip-Flop Fauci is predicting that it's all about to get a whole lot worse. And, of course, despite promising to get covert under control, getting three vaccines handed to him and therapeutics like Regeneron handed to him and vowing that life would return to normal -- well, this delta variant is now raging -- Democrats eagerly ramping up restrictions all across the country, maybe somebody might think -- hey, maybe we should close the border with there's a high rate of COVID positivity, just a thought. Comrade de Blasio in New York announcing vaccine passports or you will be shut out of New York City. Los Angeles now is moving in a similar direction with a similar mandate for restaurants, bars, gyms, even retail locations and, of course, concerts, sporting events.   And breaking tonight, the entire state of California will soon mandate vaccines for all of its 2 million health care workers. Hold on a second. The very people that risked their own lives every single day during this pandemic to save the lives of others, you're going to mandate that they get the vaccine now? What if those medical heroes contracted COVID? What if they have what's called natural immunity or T-cell immunity? Well, we now know the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, they now say if in fact, you had COVID-19, you don't need any vaccine. What about people with rare conditions that prevent them from getting the vaccine? What happens to them? Are they shut out too?  Forget medical privacy, forget doctor-patient confidentiality, forget about the freedom that America used to have to make your own decisions based on your own unique medical history, your current medical condition. Democrats now want to force your hand and it's kind of like no matter, what one size fits all medicine for everybody -- led, of course, by the non-medical professional politicians in the swamp and the non-medical professional members in the media mob.   You had one MSDNC host not understanding why the Biden-approved vaccine mandates, why could these things be so controversial? Where do I begin? Take a look.",

Now, of course, why not listen to the idiots all the great doctors over at MSDNC.  And not to be outdone, one fake news CNN analysts are pushing for unvaccinated Americans to be banned from flights. You mean like the travel ban for people that are identified as potential terrorists, they can't fly?   And more medical geniuses on TV. And then to make matters worse, the Biden administration is still flirting with the possibility of, yep, you got it, new lockdowns. Now, in-person learning may not actually return in certain school districts, that's almost a certainty by now. The White House is attempting to roll out an in-school vaccination program for the schools that are open. So, parents now have to worry that they might not be consulted and that the schools will be vaccinating their children without parental consent? I mean, please tell me that's not even a possibility, that left-wing radical authoritarians would go that far. I guess time will tell. I've been -- well, I've been kind of shocked along the way. So why not be shocked again.  Either way, following the CDC's new guidance, many schools will require children as young as three to wear masks at all times. In fact, Biden's so- called health experts, the ones that have been wrong the whole time they're advising that all Americans vaccinated, unvaccinated wear masks in any crowded setting. But, of course, don't expect Joe Biden or Kamala Harris to actually follow their own guidelines, because today, yep, more mass confusion at the White House because you see there, not a mask in sight among the adults, and definitely no social distancing.  Here's Joe actually once again back to his old habits, sniffing hair and touching every person in sight. And remember, earlier this week, the NIH director actually recommended that you parents at home, that you wear masks at home in your house to protect your children. I guess that order never made its way to the White House.   If you're confused by all of the evolving rules and regulations seemingly changing by the hour, you're not alone. The mixed messages from the Biden administration have been pretty hard to follow. You might need a calculator at some point to keep up with it. And especially since they don't actually follow any of their own rules, the only consistent message from team Biden is complete and a total lie because for months, the White House has viciously attacked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for not imposing more rules, more regulations. He's the one guy that got it right. He mobilized every single state agency early in the pandemic in Florida for the very purpose of protecting the very large elderly population that is in Florida, and they did a darn good job of it.  And all of that freedom in Florida I guess, it's just two alien and dangerous, according to team Biden. And today, after DeSantis rip Biden for allowing thousands of COVID-infected migrants across our border, over a million, Biden responded. Take a look.",

But we honestly have to ask, was Biden actually trying to insult DeSantis, or did he actually probably forget who the governor of Florida is?  Now, the good news is Governor DeSantis, he kind of kicked Biden's ass this week and set him straight. But at this point, given Biden's obvious cognitive decline, it is a legitimate question. Either way, while Biden spins in circles with an endless stream of mixed messages every second, minute, hour seemingly of every day, Governor DeSantis, he has been consistent. No lockdowns, no mask mandates, no vaccine mandates, no vaccine passports, no matter what. And guess what? His schools have been open for in-person learning for an entire year already. Now, at least one major sport is also coming out against mandate. Got to give props to our friend, UFC president Dana White, who just announced that vaccine requirements for the UFC fighters, that's never going to happen. And when Dana says it, he means it, trust me.   And let me be clear: my message has always been consistent. I'm not telling you what to do because I'm not a doctor. Take the virus seriously. It can kill you. Research extensively. Take into account your medical history, your current medical condition, talk to your doctor, doctors, medical professionals you trust. And then with information, you make the decision that is best for you, based on your unique medical history and condition.  This is the United States of America, supposedly the land of the free and the home of the brave. Not the land of Joe Biden government mandates of everything and taking away everyone's freedom -- oh, and one size fits all medicine from people that have zero medical experience. Our great system relies on a free people making their own decisions, giving up that freedom will not save us. In fact, it will make everything a whole lot worse for years and years to come, the same geniuses that destroyed our school system can't keep their cities safe and secure, that lied about Obamacare and that rated the lock boxes for Medicare and Social Security that are now headed towards insolvency. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Lara Trump, former White House physician, Texas Congressman Ronny Jackson.   Lara, let me start with you on the political side of this, because on the political side of this, let's see -- your father-in-law left not one, not two, but three vaccines. Then, of course, he left a therapeutic known as Regeneron. I've had people that -- a good friend of mine fully vaccinated got tested positive on Saturday, had Regeneron in less than 24 hours, I just talked to him about an hour ago, he's feeling great. As a matter of fact, he's out fishing alone in his boat happier than he's ever been. He's like yeah I still have seven days to quarantine I'm doing great. He's happy. But that -- but look at how Joe Biden took all of that that was already done, a million shots going into people's arms a day, when your father-in- law left office, how could they possibly screw it up this bad with open borders and a million people in a high rate of positive COVID cases?",

      "speaker": "LARA TRUMP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "sentences": "It does make you wonder, how could they do it, Sean? The answer is it's because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are supposedly in charge of our country. So, until we get a handle on the immigrants that are free-flowing over our southern border, many of them infected with COVID, many of them never get tested -- they certainly haven't had the vaccine, and until we stop using taxpayer funds to ship them all over the country, we are giving them bus tickets and plane tickets paid for by the American taxpayers to infect the rest of the country -- then I don't think Joe Biden has a leg to stand on here.  It is absolutely insane. It's almost like the southern border itself. All they had to do was leave it alone, Sean, and it was already done for them. But they couldn't help themselves.  They confused a lot of people, though, during the campaign because don't forget, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris told people, well, we're not sure if we're going to get the vaccine because it was developed under President Donald Trump. Well, how ridiculous a statement is that now? Of course, the vaccines work. Of course, they're safe. But last time I checked -- I liked your monologue, Sean -- we live in the United States of America. We have freedoms here to decide what is best for us. So if we're going to start mandating everything, then I guess let's get rid of alcohol again, let's get rid of high calorie foods. Heck, let's get rid of cars because people could injure themselves in cars too.  They've got to let people start being Americans again and start living life again.",

We have a high -- Joe built the cages that were overcrowded in the middle of a pandemic, no testing at whatsoever, no vaccinations, no mandates for the people in Joe's cages. No, they get a bus or a plane ticket to the city of their choice and they're now being spread out all across the U.S. And I would assume that many Americans actually now got COVID positive test results because of Joe's open border policies with that larger number of people and a high percentage of COVID positive rates.

I've been on planes. I've been out to the border multiple times. Every time I get on a plane from the border, it's packed with these people that are flying all over the country. And now we know a lot of them are COVID positive. I told you before, when I was out there, they were documenting to me that 25 percent of everybody that crossed the border was COVID positive, 20 percent when they engaged them, and 5 percent during their time with either the border patrol or HHS.  So there is a huge problem on the border, a huge number of these people coming across, they're almost all unvaccinated. So a large proportion of them do have the virus, and they're infected with it. And they're being shipped out all over this country.  And the Biden administration treats it like it's a completely separate reality what's going on down in the border and the risks down there versus the rest of us. It's crazy.",

Now, I would argue, tell me if I'm wrong, Doctor, if this sounds logical to you, if anyone gets COVID as a result of Joe allowing -- not enforcing the laws, allowing illegal immigrants with COVID in the country and people get sick and dying, does he play a role in that death?",

We'll show you what they're doing. We first showed you this emergency tent compound that was built in the middle of McAllen last night. Well, overnight, they moved it to here in Mission, Texas, and we've now confirmed what they're using it for is to house COVID-19 positive illegal immigrants who have been released from federal custody. Now, this is Anzalduas Park here, and local officials say they have to do this because the federal government has been dropping off so many migrants in downtown McAllen, many of which later test positive for COVID, that they can't handle it anymore. Take a look at this video we shot on the ground. Some of the migrants already started showing up today. Right now, this compound has a capacity of 250. They said they expect to expand it all the way up to 650.  What we've been told by officials is just in the last week alone, the feds have dropped off more than 1,500 COVID-19 positive migrants into the city of McAllen. They say they had to build this.

Now already released well over a million illegal immigrants since January 20th, hundreds of thousands of people every month, tens of thousands of COVID positive migrants, yeah, then dispensed to the interior of the entire country. It is beyond a dereliction of duty.  People will get sick and people will die. Science, fact, it's math, it's sad. These are real Americans, real lives. It's a disgrace, it's an attack on American sovereignty and it comes all while vaccine mandates for you law-abiding Americans are coming coast to coast. Joe Biden -- well, he seems to want more COVID restrictions everywhere for every American but not illegal immigrants that don't respect our laws, our borders and our sovereignty. And Joe Biden isn't the only far left failure who's imploding. Look at these new photos obtained by \"The New York Post\" -- we'll get to this later -- showing disgraced Governor Andrew Cuomo lounging poolside in Albany amid growing calls for him to resign and, of course, the trustee aide with -- by the pool with him, and multiple criminal investigations throughout New York state.

There's been 109 murders there this year and a hundred of those victims have been black people. Okay? And they're not being killed by cops. They're being killed by criminals and murderers. And you know who chases criminals and murderers? Well, it's cops and that's exactly who she wants to defund. This goes directly against where her community actually wants and needs. Eighty-one percent of the black community favors the same or more policing. And here's the big takeaway here. We have to do away with this notion that that the Democrats are not this radical party. They are a radical party. This isn't some fringe activist that you just played on TV. That was a Democrat member of Congress and a very popular one at that, right? Member of the squad, they have the highest social media following. They have real influence into the Democrat Party. Defunding the police is not just some radical talking point. It's happened across the country and in American cities, murders have gone up 33 percent this year. It's because of defunding the police, it's because of this sort of social justice bail reform where they're letting criminal criminals out on bail instead of putting them in jail and our communities are being killed and hurt, and she doesn't seem to care, she doesn't seem to care.

Seventy-five percent of black boys in California -- I'm not making this up, Sean -- cannot read at state levels of proficiency and that was pre-pandemic and the levels of proficiency aren't very high. Nearly half of all third graders cannot and they lost a whole year of in-school education while as you pointed out his own kids were enjoying in-person private education.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". A lot of breaking news this Thursday night. Tracking multiple developing stories, including calls for Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign or to be impeached. But Cuomo doesn't seem too concerned. Of course, the legal issues he's facing are worse than anything. But there he is lounging by the pool with an aide. These photos exclusively obtained by \"The New York Post\" for some much needed I guess west and relaxation. We'll have a lot more on this later in the show. Also tonight, more rampant hypocrisy on Capitol Hill -- shocking, I know, right? This time, Congresswoman Cori Bush is actually facing criticism for she was hiring private security while leading the \"defund the police\" movement, you can't make it up. You'll definitely want to see her unhinged response, coming up. Also, we have the very latest from the recall election in California where Gavin Newsom, the current governor, is actually underwater in one poll as they have tightened considerably. Larry Elder who is leading in the polls could very well be the next governor of the Golden State. That's all coming up, straight ahead. And later, Dan Bongino, Geraldo Rivera, they will be here to throw down over what is the single biggest largest most massive super spreader event, and that is our southern border. That is the Biden super spreader. But, first, it is official. Biden's dark summer is now upon all of us, and Dr. Doom and Gloom Flip-Flop Fauci is predicting that it's all about to get a whole lot worse. And, of course, despite promising to get covert under control, getting three vaccines handed to him and therapeutics like Regeneron handed to him and vowing that life would return to normal -- well, this delta variant is now raging -- Democrats eagerly ramping up restrictions all across the country, maybe somebody might think -- hey, maybe we should close the border with there's a high rate of COVID positivity, just a thought. Comrade de Blasio in New York announcing vaccine passports or you will be shut out of New York City. Los Angeles now is moving in a similar direction with a similar mandate for restaurants, bars, gyms, even retail locations and, of course, concerts, sporting events. And breaking tonight, the entire state of California will soon mandate vaccines for all of its 2 million health care workers. Hold on a second. The very people that risked their own lives every single day during this pandemic to save the lives of others, you're going to mandate that they get the vaccine now? What if those medical heroes contracted COVID? What if they have what's called natural immunity or T-cell immunity? Well, we now know the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, they now say if in fact, you had COVID-19, you don't need any vaccine. What about people with rare conditions that prevent them from getting the vaccine? What happens to them? Are they shut out too? Forget medical privacy, forget doctor-patient confidentiality, forget about the freedom that America used to have to make your own decisions based on your own unique medical history, your current medical condition. Democrats now want to force your hand and it's kind of like no matter, what one size fits all medicine for everybody -- led, of course, by the non-medical professional politicians in the swamp and the non-medical professional members in the media mob. You had one MSDNC host not understanding why the Biden-approved vaccine mandates, why could these things be so controversial? Where do I begin? Take a look."

Now, of course, why not listen to the idiots all the great doctors over at MSDNC. And not to be outdone, one fake news CNN analysts are pushing for unvaccinated Americans to be banned from flights. You mean like the travel ban for people that are identified as potential terrorists, they can't fly? And more medical geniuses on TV. And then to make matters worse, the Biden administration is still flirting with the possibility of, yep, you got it, new lockdowns. Now, in-person learning may not actually return in certain school districts, that's almost a certainty by now. The White House is attempting to roll out an in-school vaccination program for the schools that are open. So, parents now have to worry that they might not be consulted and that the schools will be vaccinating their children without parental consent? I mean, please tell me that's not even a possibility, that left-wing radical authoritarians would go that far. I guess time will tell. I've been -- well, I've been kind of shocked along the way. So why not be shocked again. Either way, following the CDC's new guidance, many schools will require children as young as three to wear masks at all times. In fact, Biden's so- called health experts, the ones that have been wrong the whole time they're advising that all Americans vaccinated, unvaccinated wear masks in any crowded setting. But, of course, don't expect Joe Biden or Kamala Harris to actually follow their own guidelines, because today, yep, more mass confusion at the White House because you see there, not a mask in sight among the adults, and definitely no social distancing. Here's Joe actually once again back to his old habits, sniffing hair and touching every person in sight. And remember, earlier this week, the NIH director actually recommended that you parents at home, that you wear masks at home in your house to protect your children. I guess that order never made its way to the White House. If you're confused by all of the evolving rules and regulations seemingly changing by the hour, you're not alone. The mixed messages from the Biden administration have been pretty hard to follow. You might need a calculator at some point to keep up with it. And especially since they don't actually follow any of their own rules, the only consistent message from team Biden is complete and a total lie because for months, the White House has viciously attacked Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for not imposing more rules, more regulations. He's the one guy that got it right. He mobilized every single state agency early in the pandemic in Florida for the very purpose of protecting the very large elderly population that is in Florida, and they did a darn good job of it. And all of that freedom in Florida I guess, it's just two alien and dangerous, according to team Biden. And today, after DeSantis rip Biden for allowing thousands of COVID-infected migrants across our border, over a million, Biden responded. Take a look."

Either way, while Biden spins in circles with an endless stream of mixed messages every second, minute, hour seemingly of every day, Governor DeSantis, he has been consistent. No lockdowns, no mask mandates, no vaccine mandates, no vaccine passports, no matter what. And guess what? His schools have been open for in-person learning for an entire year already. Now, at least one major sport is also coming out against mandate. Got to give props to our friend, UFC president Dana White, who just announced that vaccine requirements for the UFC fighters, that's never going to happen.

And then with information, you make the decision that is best for you, based on your unique medical history and condition. This is the United States of America, supposedly the land of the free and the home of the brave. Not the land of Joe Biden government mandates of everything and taking away everyone's freedom -- oh, and one size fits all medicine from people that have zero medical experience. Our great system relies on a free people making their own decisions, giving up that freedom will not save us. In fact, it will make everything a whole lot worse for years and years to come, the same geniuses that destroyed our school system can't keep their cities safe and secure, that lied about Obamacare and that rated the lock boxes for Medicare and Social Security that are now headed towards insolvency. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Lara Trump, former White House physician, Texas Congressman Ronny Jackson. Lara, let me start with you on the political side of this, because on the political side of this, let's see -- your father-in-law left not one, not two, but three vaccines. Then, of course, he left a therapeutic known as Regeneron. I've had people that -- a good friend of mine fully vaccinated got tested positive on Saturday, had Regeneron in less than 24 hours, I just talked to him about an hour ago, he's feeling great. As a matter of fact, he's out fishing alone in his boat happier than he's ever been. He's like yeah I still have seven days to quarantine I'm doing great. He's happy. But that -- but look at how Joe Biden took all of that that was already done, a million shots going into people's arms a day, when your father-in- law left office, how could they possibly screw it up this bad with open borders and a million people in a high rate of positive COVID cases?"

      "speaker": "LARA TRUMP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It does make you wonder, how could they do it, Sean? The answer is it's because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are supposedly in charge of our country. So, until we get a handle on the immigrants that are free-flowing over our southern border, many of them infected with COVID, many of them never get tested -- they certainly haven't had the vaccine, and until we stop using taxpayer funds to ship them all over the country, we are giving them bus tickets and plane tickets paid for by the American taxpayers to infect the rest of the country -- then I don't think Joe Biden has a leg to stand on here. It is absolutely insane. It's almost like the southern border itself. All they had to do was leave it alone, Sean, and it was already done for them. But they couldn't help themselves. They confused a lot of people, though, during the campaign because don't forget, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris told people, well, we're not sure if we're going to get the vaccine because it was developed under President Donald Trump. Well, how ridiculous a statement is that now? Of course, the vaccines work. Of course, they're safe. But last time I checked -- I liked your monologue, Sean -- we live in the United States of America. We have freedoms here to decide what is best for us. So if we're going to start mandating everything, then I guess let's get rid of alcohol again, let's get rid of high calorie foods. Heck, let's get rid of cars because people could injure themselves in cars too. They've got to let people start being Americans again and start living life again."

We have a high -- Joe built the cages that were overcrowded in the middle of a pandemic, no testing at whatsoever, no vaccinations, no mandates for the people in Joe's cages. No, they get a bus or a plane ticket to the city of their choice and they're now being spread out all across the U.S. And I would assume that many Americans actually now got COVID positive test results because of Joe's open border policies with that larger number of people and a high percentage of COVID positive rates.

I've been on planes. I've been out to the border multiple times. Every time I get on a plane from the border, it's packed with these people that are flying all over the country. And now we know a lot of them are COVID positive. I told you before, when I was out there, they were documenting to me that 25 percent of everybody that crossed the border was COVID positive, 20 percent when they engaged them, and 5 percent during their time with either the border patrol or HHS. So there is a huge problem on the border, a huge number of these people coming across, they're almost all unvaccinated. So a large proportion of them do have the virus, and they're infected with it. And they're being shipped out all over this country. And the Biden administration treats it like it's a completely separate reality what's going on down in the border and the risks down there versus the rest of us. It's crazy."

Now, I would argue, tell me if I'm wrong, Doctor, if this sounds logical to you, if anyone gets COVID as a result of Joe allowing -- not enforcing the laws, allowing illegal immigrants with COVID in the country and people get sick and dying, does he play a role in that death?"

Small businesses have not been forced to shut down and are never going to reopen. Look at the housing market in Florida right now, it is skyrocketing through the roof. And you contrast that with these Democrat-run states like the state of New York. It is absolutely abysmal and terrible. What has happened in these states -- so sad -- should have never happened.

They say the feds are failing to do their job here at the border. So they got to fill that void and they got to do it for them. Take a look at this video we shot with our FOX drone. We'll show you what they're doing. We first showed you this emergency tent compound that was built in the middle of McAllen last night. Well, overnight, they moved it to here in Mission, Texas, and we've now confirmed what they're using it for is to house COVID-19 positive illegal immigrants who have been released from federal custody. Now, this is Anzalduas Park here, and local officials say they have to do this because the federal government has been dropping off so many migrants in downtown McAllen, many of which later test positive for COVID, that they can't handle it anymore. Take a look at this video we shot on the ground. Some of the migrants already started showing up today. Right now, this compound has a capacity of 250. They said they expect to expand it all the way up to 650. What we've been told by officials is just in the last week alone, the feds have dropped off more than 1,500 COVID-19 positive migrants into the city of McAllen. They say they had to build this. Take a listen to what some of the local politicians had to say, including a Democratic county judge."

Now already released well over a million illegal immigrants since January 20th, hundreds of thousands of people every month, tens of thousands of COVID positive migrants, yeah, then dispensed to the interior of the entire country. It is beyond a dereliction of duty. People will get sick and people will die. Science, fact, it's math, it's sad. These are real Americans, real lives. It's a disgrace, it's an attack on American sovereignty and it comes all while vaccine mandates for you law-abiding Americans are coming coast to coast. Joe Biden -- well, he seems to want more COVID restrictions everywhere for every American but not illegal immigrants that don't respect our laws, our borders and our sovereignty. And Joe Biden isn't the only far left failure who's imploding. Look at these new photos obtained by \"The New York Post\" -- we'll get to this later -- showing disgraced Governor Andrew Cuomo lounging poolside in Albany amid growing calls for him to resign and, of course, the trustee aide with -- by the pool with him, and multiple criminal investigations throughout New York state.

And you know who chases criminals and murderers? Well, it's cops and that's exactly who she wants to defund. This goes directly against where her community actually wants and needs. Eighty-one percent of the black community favors the same or more policing. And here's the big takeaway here. We have to do away with this notion that that the Democrats are not this radical party. They are a radical party. This isn't some fringe activist that you just played on TV. That was a Democrat member of Congress and a very popular one at that, right? Member of the squad, they have the highest social media following. They have real influence into the Democrat Party. Defunding the police is not just some radical talking point. It's happened across the country and in American cities, murders have gone up 33 percent this year. It's because of defunding the police, it's because of this sort of social justice bail reform where they're letting criminal criminals out on bail instead of putting them in jail and our communities are being killed and hurt, and she doesn't seem to care, she doesn't seem to care.

      "utterance": "Let me first of all say I agree. I don't want any harm to occur to Congresswoman Bush. But how dare she? She talks about flaunting $70,000, $80,000, $100,000 of her private security, and what about the black people in Chicago, L.A., in Washington, D.C., they don't have a hundred thousand dollars. They're just trying to put food on the table. And she is not helping black people. She's gaslighting -- gaslighting black people. She needs to pick a side. Either she helps the black people in her community or she picks -- goes with the criminals. It is insulting for her to sit there and say she's doing the work. She's doing the work for no one. She is destroying black communities by taking away their only line of defense. Police -- black people want police. And so, for her to go up there and talk about her ability to spend $70,000, $80,000, $100,000, who in her community have a hundred thousand dollars to spend? It is insulting. She doesn't represent anyone and she doesn't represent black people. She represents criminals."

When we come back, oh, we got uh photos from \"The New York Post\", Governor Andrew Cuomo poolside with an aide, and California Governor Newsom complaining about the recall effort against him. He's not polling well. Larry Elder is. He'll weigh in next, straight ahead."

      "utterance": "Now failed far left governor and supreme hypocrite Evan Newsom he is in real recall danger in that zone tonight. A new poll out shows only 40 percent of a thousand people polled -- it was in SFGate.com -- actually want him to remain in office. Survey USA San Diego, 40 percent, that's it. And Newsom is also now in an all-out desperation. He's claiming the recall effort is unfair and that it its impacts will be felt across the country. No, Gavin, you'll feel the impact. Newsom has failed the state. He has shown breathtaking hypocrisy. The state is spiraling out of control. He needs to go. And by the way, so does Andrew Cuomo -- oh, there he is today. Not exactly the best optics in my humble opinion based on 11 women making accusations against him and the AG report that said, well, he's -- we have now four investigations into criminal behavior and that's state and federal criminal law. But this footage courtesy of \"The New York Post\", hanging out poolside with a young aide amid the multiple criminal investigations across the state. Okay, here with reaction, California gubernatorial candidate, Larry Elder. I've always doubted if -- I had this doubt that California would get to question two. They get to question two right now, you have a significant lead in the polls. My question is this --"

      "utterance": "Well, Sean, there's a reason that 45,000 people have contributed to my candidacy. We're going to have the actual fundraising numbers later on put out. But 2.2 million people signed a petition to have this man recalled. We're talking about 25 percent of them at least independents and Democrats who just voted for him two years earlier. So it's awfully hard to characterize this as some sort of Republican takeover and 53 percent of people say that they don't want Gavin Newsom to have a second term. And it's because of the crime, because the rising homelessness, because of the outrageous way he shut down this state in the more most draconian way than any of the other 50 states, while sitting up there at that French laundry restaurant with the very people that drafted the mandates, not wearing masks, not socially distancing, but telling everybody else to do just that. And then you have the outrageous cost of living. The average price of a home in California because of the environmental extremists that he doesn't want to stand down costs 150 percent more than the average price of a home in the United States. You add it all up -- this guy has got to go. And as you pointed out more people now want him to go they want him to stay and he's very, very nervous. If Andrew Cuomo isn't, he sure is."

So I think people -- one too many examples of just utter elitism and hypocrisy. Speaking of Cuomo, let me run \"The New York Post\" images. I don't know, Larry, maybe -- what do I know? I'm just a talk show host. But, you know, 11 women making serious allegations against you, that a report from the attorney general in New York says is criminal both on the state level and on the federal level, and there he is today poolside with a young aide and uh they're there together. I don't think the optics are exactly ideal."

    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "No, they aren't. And the optics out here in California weren't ideal when he had as you pointed out, Gavin Newsom's -- his own kids in summer camp, not wearing mass. Well, just momentarily, he had suggested that everybody else should be wearing masks. And you mentioned education. Seventy-five percent of black boys in California -- I'm not making this up, Sean -- cannot read at state levels of proficiency and that was pre-pandemic and the levels of proficiency aren't very high. Nearly half of all third graders cannot and they lost a whole year of in-school education while as you pointed out his own kids were enjoying in-person private education. It is why one of the many things I'm going to do if I'm fortunate enough to be elected governor is to push for choice. The money should follow the child rather than the other way around. The polls show that black and brown parents overwhelmingly want school choice and they keep pulling that lever for the Democratic Party that's not giving it to them. I'm going to change that narrative. And that's why I'm asking people to go to ElectElder.com, throw a little something in the tip jar because he can raise an unlimited amount of money. I cannot. I need help from other people. ElectElder.com. I really appreciate it."

We will expose the left's rampant COVID hypocrisy, flip-flopping and much more, oh, and open borders. That's all tomorrow night. Let not your heart be troubled. In the meantime, here's Laura.
