Frankly, I don't think the term that the president use was strong enough. MS-13 has done heinous acts. It took an animal to stab a man 100 times and decapitate him and ripped his heart out. It took an animal to beat a woman, they were sex-trafficking with a bat. Twenty- eight times indicting part of her body. And it took an animal to kidnap, drugged and rape a 14-year-old Houston girl.

So, I remember there were times when -- like an editor up here in New York would write a headline or a caption or choose a photo that was out of context. And you would actually have White House reporters -- let's just call the New York Times as a hypothetical. They would call up to New York, and I, woo, woo, woo, that's not what he was saying. That's not what he was doing. And I don't know what happened here. Possibly could have happened, but it can happen soon enough. And then, some of the outlets like the A.P. deleted the tweet which is better than nothing, but it does show you that immediately they heard animals and immigrants and they put it together without that context, and so that's unfortunate.   I do want to make one point about this, it's not -- it does have -- the president on this MS-13 issue. But it also happened to somebody recently, Ed Gillespie when he was running for governor of Virginia, he was one of this issues -- one of his issues was MS-13. And the Washington Post had several headlines. I think if we have them here, we can show you about how Ed -- basically describing Ed as a racists, saying that Ed -- poisonous. OK. So, a month later and since, the Washington Post all of a sudden had a change of heart about MS-13 in their headlines, post-election, after Ed Gillespie loses, they talk about how MS-13 is terrible. They're -- the violence. Then, the talking feud, they show a couple of examples. But it's just very interesting that they -- the media tends to defend MS-13 in the strangest ways in order to help -- to hurt a Republican. It's an unfortunate set of events.

I don't think the president took a far enough saying animals and I'll tell you why, because when you see their handiwork and you're actually at the crime scene, you see these photos, you talked to the family members of MS-13 and other gang members, they commit these heinous atrocities, just vicious gangs and killing. Showing no regard for human life. Use of the machete.  Another favorite is they love to put nails on baseball bats to beat people to death. The types of crimes they commit. The young girl who is a teenager who they felt disrespected. The gang leader's shrine to a demon. And family members not even able to identify their children because of the state that their bodies are left in dealing with these guys. You know what? Not even animals.

It's probably a pre-buttal by leakers at the FBI and the DOJ because they know the I.G. is coming out with some pretty damning stuff. And there is an abuse of power, I believe, in the way this whole thing started. When you look at how it started, Papadopoulos is a 28-year-old kid. He gets invited to an event at Cambridge in England. Who invited him? It's a good question. We're going to find out more about that later. At the event, some professors say, you know what? I've heard that the Russians hacked some Democrat emails. So, he then gets set up for drinks with the Australian ambassador. Set up for drinks, also interesting. Where he passes it along, he says, listen, you know, I heard that the Russians had some Democrat emails. Not that the Trump campaign had anything to do with the hacking or were involved at all. Just passed it on. And so, then, the ambassador calls the FBI, says this is want I hear. The FBI, guess who they send? They sent Peter Strzok, the infamous Peter Strzok over to London to check things out. And what do you know? They open up not a criminal investigation, which is important, a counterintelligence investigation because for a criminal investigation you actually have to have hard evidence of treason or espionage. Didn't have either of that, OK. So, they open up this thing on four members of the Trump campaign. Flynn, Papadopoulos, Carter Page and Manafort. To this day, none of these people have been charged with anything relating to collusion, espionage, spying or treason, OK. And what do they do? They use these highly secretive subpoenas. They're called national security letters, very controversial. Extremely secretive. To get information from computers and from phone logs. And they had at least one spy in their campaign.  Now, I think I know who it is. I was talking to someone today about it. There's no way I'm going to say the name. I have enough problems already. But the name will come out, OK. And everybody -- it will be very clear. It will be very clear. So, to put it in perspective, the Obama FBI had spies in the Trump campaign a couple of months before an election, illegally surveilled, we believe, people in the Trump campaign based on political opposition research paid for by Hillary and gotten through Russian sources. And, any time you try to ask questions, they stonewall or put out this highly redacted nonsense, and all the people involved are Trump haters. Strzok, Page, Comey, Yates. Everybody involves hates Trump and are bias, and you can't get any straight answers.",

It's going to be quite damaging. That's what they do, they're trying to get out ahead of the story to say, OK, this is what happen. By the way, Democrats, Republicans, independence, questioning, whatever you are, you should be really concerned that this level of spying and duplicity would be happening to any person in this country. There has to be facts and evidence to support it. You can't just have an open-ended investigation. There has to be scope, focus, evidences to back it up to make sure.  And that's what I get concerned about as a former prosecutor. I mean, I've gone before judges. I would never go before a judge, for example, unless I had some very good specific, hard facts, pursuant to an investigation that my unit has conducted versus getting information from an outside source, from a dossier that came from a campaign that was from somebody who had, you know, foreign contacts, et cetera. So, when you look at this type of thing, it's worth the examination that's gone into it. Depends on the flip side, you see what Rudy Giuliani is saying, which is the president is innocent. He's been trying to prove himself innocent. This has been going on forever. It's a year now. What do you have? You can't just keep going and going and going to try to come up with something to get him to trip, because it looks like that your whole goal and focus is to try to undermine the president versus seeking justice.",

And the press therefore moved on to other non-happening things like collusion. So obviously, it's good news that this wasn't a big story. But it's also bad news that it isn't a big story for its own sake, because in this non-news story, truth is revealed: That one can save lives by actually protecting people. For the duration of a gun attack is always dictated by the arrival of a second gun. And this incident is no exception: Look up the unpublished CDC report that indicates nearly 2.5 million defensive uses of guns a year. Didn't hear about that either? I did say it was unpublished. I wonder why. It's the way the press uses silence selectively to create only one story angle that carries the seal of media approval.

Frankly, I don't think the term that the president use was strong enough. MS-13 has done heinous acts. It took an animal to stab a man 100 times and decapitate him and ripped his heart out. It took an animal to beat a woman, they were sex-trafficking with a bat. Twenty- eight times indicting part of her body. And it took an animal to kidnap, drugged and rape a 14-year-old Houston girl.

      "utterance": "Well, and also -- it grew because of social media. So, I remember there were times when -- like an editor up here in New York would write a headline or a caption or choose a photo that was out of context. And you would actually have White House reporters -- let's just call the New York Times as a hypothetical. They would call up to New York, and I, woo, woo, woo, that's not what he was saying. That's not what he was doing. And I don't know what happened here. Possibly could have happened, but it can happen soon enough. And then, some of the outlets like the A.P. deleted the tweet which is better than nothing, but it does show you that immediately they heard animals and immigrants and they put it together without that context, and so that's unfortunate. I do want to make one point about this, it's not -- it does have -- the president on this MS-13 issue. But it also happened to somebody recently, Ed Gillespie when he was running for governor of Virginia, he was one of this issues -- one of his issues was MS-13. And the Washington Post had several headlines. I think if we have them here, we can show you about how Ed -- basically describing Ed as a racists, saying that Ed -- poisonous. OK. So, a month later and since, the Washington Post all of a sudden had a change of heart about MS-13 in their headlines, post-election, after Ed Gillespie loses, they talk about how MS-13 is terrible. They're -- the violence. Then, the talking feud, they show a couple of examples. But it's just very interesting that they -- the media tends to defend MS-13 in the strangest ways in order to help -- to hurt a Republican. It's an unfortunate set of events.

So that's the -- it's the Laurel-Yanny, except it's different because they're mishearing this on purpose. This isn't an accident. They are -- I guess, maybe because of their own confirmation bias they're selectively hear something. And then, you know what's the next strategy is? OK. So they know that they're wrong, they know they made a mistake, what they're going to say is, well, Trump has said bad things before, and he will probably say them again. So, it doesn't really matter that they're wrong here. That's the same argument that it's used defending hate crimes. Oh, that racist graffiti was fake, but somewhere around the country it is real.

Because you see a situation like this, because the level of vitriol that they have and the angst and upset towards the president, they just took it too far. They tried to say, oh, look, this is a situation where he's being racist talking about this. I don't think the president took a far enough saying animals and I'll tell you why, because when you see their handiwork and you're actually at the crime scene, you see these photos, you talked to the family members of MS-13 and other gang members, they commit these heinous atrocities, just vicious gangs and killing. Showing no regard for human life. Use of the machete. Another favorite is they love to put nails on baseball bats to beat people to death. The types of crimes they commit. The young girl who is a teenager who they felt disrespected. The gang leader's shrine to a demon. And family members not even able to identify their children because of the state that their bodies are left in dealing with these guys. You know what? Not even animals. Not wild animals even behave like this. So, when you really think about the facts and about what the president was saying, he was showing a respect for victims, respect for law enforcement, and a total -- you know, flat out, you know, saying I have no tolerance for heinous crimes committed, and I look to public safety and the law enforcement to do something about this."

What, actually, what he was saying it's hard to watch because he's busy. As the president, it's hard for him to watch the Olympics or the Paralympics. Chris Hayes originally tweeted out that this was disgusting. And then, he watched it again and he goes the Yanny went to Laurel. And he goes, you know what? I was wrong. That he was talking about the schedule. And if people just go and they listen it's so obvious, he's talking about a gang. He's calling them animals. Everybody knows that.

I've heard that the Russians hacked some Democrat emails. So, he then gets set up for drinks with the Australian ambassador. Set up for drinks, also interesting. Where he passes it along, he says, listen, you know, I heard that the Russians had some Democrat emails. Not that the Trump campaign had anything to do with the hacking or were involved at all. Just passed it on. And so, then, the ambassador calls the FBI, says this is want I hear. The FBI, guess who they send? They sent Peter Strzok, the infamous Peter Strzok over to London to check things out. And what do you know? They open up not a criminal investigation, which is important, a counterintelligence investigation because for a criminal investigation you actually have to have hard evidence of treason or espionage. Didn't have either of that, OK. So, they open up this thing on four members of the Trump campaign. Flynn, Papadopoulos, Carter Page and Manafort. To this day, none of these people have been charged with anything relating to collusion, espionage, spying or treason, OK. And what do they do? They use these highly secretive subpoenas. They're called national security letters, very controversial. Extremely secretive. To get information from computers and from phone logs. And they had at least one spy in their campaign. Now, I think I know who it is. I was talking to someone today about it. There's no way I'm going to say the name. I have enough problems already. But the name will come out, OK. And everybody -- it will be very clear. It will be very clear. So, to put it in perspective, the Obama FBI had spies in the Trump campaign a couple of months before an election, illegally surveilled, we believe, people in the Trump campaign based on political opposition research paid for by Hillary and gotten through Russian sources. And, any time you try to ask questions, they stonewall or put out this highly redacted nonsense, and all the people involved are Trump haters. Strzok, Page, Comey, Yates. Everybody involves hates Trump and are bias, and you can't get any straight answers."

I do wonder about the whole issue and hope that we find out one day.

It's going to be quite damaging. That's what they do, they're trying to get out ahead of the story to say, OK, this is what happen. By the way, Democrats, Republicans, independence, questioning, whatever you are, you should be really concerned that this level of spying and duplicity would be happening to any person in this country. There has to be facts and evidence to support it. You can't just have an open-ended investigation. There has to be scope, focus, evidences to back it up to make sure. And that's what I get concerned about as a former prosecutor. I mean, I've gone before judges. I would never go before a judge, for example, unless I had some very good specific, hard facts, pursuant to an investigation that my unit has conducted versus getting information from an outside source, from a dossier that came from a campaign that was from somebody who had, you know, foreign contacts, et cetera. So, when you look at this type of thing, it's worth the examination that's gone into it. Depends on the flip side, you see what Rudy Giuliani is saying, which is the president is innocent. He's been trying to prove himself innocent. This has been going on forever. It's a year now. What do you have? You can't just keep going and going and going to try to come up with something to get him to trip, because it looks like that your whole goal and focus is to try to undermine the president versus seeking justice."

This comes from -- sorry, we don't know what the Mueller team. This comes from Rudy Giuliani alone. There's been no confirmation elsewhere.

And he said this isn't going to cut it. I mean, you could win 2018 by being against President Trump, but this is not going to win you a presidential election. You have to have better ideas than that. So I do think that that is starting to catch up with them. Plus, conservative policies are actually proving themselves to work. So I think that, as people start to realize that, oh, wow, the country is doing a little bit better. They all feel better. It's not as if the Democrats don't have some things to focus on. Certainly, health care is a vulnerability for Republicans. They don't talk about it enough. They don't seem to have a plan.

When we talk about schools and gun-free zones and things like that that are very, very vulnerable, they're soft targets, think about it over and over again. Like I said, I've responded to scenes of the crime when I was on the officer-involved shooting team. Any time there was a discharge of a weapon or a shooting like that, and the police had to go out on it. You see what happens. And you go to the movie theater, and you go to the school, and you go to these places and you say, \"If only someone had been armed there to be able to do something and act decisively, lives could be saved.\" So, you know, weapons are used in many instances and in wars to create peace, ultimately."

They don't cover news that might benefit the NRA narrative, and that's fine. Every outlet has to make their own editorial decision about what they do or don't cover. But when 90 percent of the media is liberal, and 10 percent isn't, there's a lot of impact about what that 90 percent does not cover.

There were armed guards at all of these mass shootings. Did it stop them? No. And then you look and you say, \"Well, let's ask the people involved. Let's get away from a bunch of TV people.
