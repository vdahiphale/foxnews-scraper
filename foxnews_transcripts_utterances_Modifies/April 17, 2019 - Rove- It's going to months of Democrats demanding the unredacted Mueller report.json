      "sentences": "All right. Buckle up for tonight's \"Hannity\". Brace for impact. Tomorrow morning, the Mueller report will be released and Mueller madness begins. Our sources telling us tonight, minimal redaction. The American people will see this and still the media mob of Democrats, Trump haters everywhere will get there one last itsy-bitsy chance to breathlessly, hysterically, hyperventilate over nothing. A baseless, a vengeful hoax, a Russian collusion witch hunt that has come up totally and completely and utterly empty. No collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction.  No matter what sentences, paragraphs, pages Democrats, the mob and the media fixate on, none of it changes the outcome. We already know the outcome. If you can go to Vegas, you can bet on what I'm telling you.  Four separate investigations now have cleared Donald Trump and the Trump campaign, including the also powerful special counsel filled with investigators who are, almost all of them, big time Democratic donors, supporters of Hillary, even somebody who went to her victory party, and a former lawyer of Hillary.  After 22 months, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 230 court orders, interviews with 500 people, the Mueller report -- this is directly from the report -- concluded, quote: The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government and its election interference activities, which, by the way, Devin Nunes warned us about in 2014.  No one inside the Trump campaign, that means Donald Trump, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. No one. That is now a fact. Two and a half years, you've had your tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, your daily lies and the media mob, the Democratic Party working in unison, in one voice, to slander, smear, besmirch, and destroy a duly elected president and everybody around him. They have for two and a half years flat out lied to you, we -- the American people over and over and over again. And we've got the proof.  Let's take a little trip down, well, memory witch hunt lane. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "They were all psychotic. They have all lost it. They've all lied.   Can anyone ever really believe the collusion truther Rachel Maddow ever again? She and all these others conning their viewers. And, by the way, many for a lot of financial gain. Tomorrow, they will give it there one last college try. Good luck. And you can expect more of what you just saw on steroids and human growth hormone.  But it is officially the media mob, the Democratic Party's last chance to revive their favorite, psychotic conspiracy theories. They still don't know it's done.  It's over. They lost again. It is election night all over again and 2016, and here's the sad reality, they'll never apologize. They won't retract false reports, retract their politically motivated daily hysteria. Their breathless, Russia, Russia, Russia, impeach, impeach, impeach, collusion, collusion, collusion insanity! Never. They will never own up to being a part of the biggest, most dangerous fraud conspiracy theory ever perpetrated against we the American people. And when they finally realized they lost and they did and they lied and they did and they failed on a spectacular level and they did, they're just going to move on to the next lie, and then next lie, and the next conspiracy theory. And they're going to act as if this never happened, badgering, hope you forgot.   As I've said mainstream media, so-called journalism is dead in America.  The fools who claim to have a monopoly of facts, they don't want to report Mueller's key findings.  Let me go back from the Mueller report. The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. Mueller words, not Hannity. A direct quote from the Mueller report. An undeniable, irrefutable fact. This is the paragraph that the liars on the left can barely bring themselves to acknowledge. But with the fake collusion narrative dead and buried, you can already see the mob switching their narrative. Or maybe we will get him on obstruction. We need his tax returns. We will have a memorandum of understanding and we'll agree to go after him on this.  Now, get this, obstruction of justice from a crime that was never committed. How can you obstruct without the underlying crime? By the way, with the statute of obstruction, you need intent, that is required by law when one has consistently and repeatedly and loudly, like the president, rightly proclaiming his innocence. He acted the way innocent people act, they are outraged.  So, of course, the president was never charged with obstruction, not by Mueller, not by the attorney general's office, not even Uncle Rod Rosenstein. And tomorrow in the report, you might see information about, well, the president, he fired Jim Comey. That is not obstruction. Even Comey pointed out, the president can fire an FBI director for any reason or no reason at all, and you might hear -- if they will hang on to evidence about, well, the president talked about firing Rod Rosenstein, and other officials like he talked about firing Mueller himself or the president wished a 33-year-old veteran, a hero who served this country in combat, General Flynn would not get in trouble. The president talked about, this is ridiculous. I hope he doesn't get in trouble. But guess what? The president never fired Rosenstein, never fired Mueller, never fired Sessions, never fired any of the Democrats hired to sustain the witch hunt.  He never stopped the investigation. In other words, he never impeded, he never obstructed. He didn't impede against the case against Lieutenant General Flynn or any other target of this witch hunt. And shouting from a rooftop that you're innocent as the president has, that you're a victim of a witch hunt, that's not a crime. Expressing frustration about injustice is not obstruction. Talking is not obstruction. Thinking about something is not obstruction.   Kind of like, like Rod Rosenstein, another deep state rat talking about wearing a wire because they wanted to spy on the president. Or conspiring and talking about using the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office.  Now, there are officials right now in our DOJ right now, they actually had those real conversations but none of them are being charged with the crime because they didn't act. They didn't commit. One in this case, well, maybe the others did, though, which we're going to get to. In this case, well, they didn't wear the wire. They didn't use the 25th Amendment. They never acted. They talked about it, talking is not a crime. Now, if the Democrats, the hate Trump media mob, if they really cared about obstruction and when you hear these people tomorrow, OK, I've got a great case for them. Why oh why oh why did they ignore the blatant obstruction of justice committed by one of their own, their favorite candidate, Hillary Clinton?   Now, we know she violated the Espionage Act, it's a fact. She stored classified, top secret information on an unsecured server. Here is the law. Irrefutable and you can see it right there, incontrovertible and overwhelming evidence, even Comey admitted she did this. And she deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, washed the hard drive with Bleach Bit, remove the SIM cards, had an aide destroyed her devices with hammers, just in case those emails were still on there. Now, the media mob that will be so outraged over obstruction tomorrow, this was the biggest slam dunk obstruction case ever. It had an underlying crime and intent, the intent in this case: destroy the evidence of the crime. More media, more liberal selective, phony moral outrage, that's what you'll see tomorrow. Remember in the Kavanaugh case, oh, they were -- I believe, I believe.  Where are the \"I believers\"? Because we have serious allegations of rape and violent sexual assault right now against the Democratic lieutenant governor of Virginia. All the \"I believers\" are quiet.   Now, we saw it with the Covington high school kids. There, they rushed they even slander a 16-year-old kid. We see it with climate change. We see it with their new green deal and socialist policies.  By the way, Hillary was never charged with her crime because her investigation which we now know was rigged by the deep state. Just the upper echelon, not rank-and-file. And that's why Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, is not rightly investigating the investigation into the Clinton email scandal. And in this case, the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible. It's now crystal clear we on the show and we have this ensemble cast, radio and TV, staffs, the people you see all for the last two years, we've been right all along. The Clinton investigation was fixed in her favor by a few high-ranking bureaucrats wanted her to be president, wanted to Trump to lose. Well, President Trump faced a modern day political persecution at the hands of those very same people, the same people that gave her a pass rigged her investigation. If the deep state was really concerned about collusion and why is there no investigation into collusion? We now know Ukraine is begging to give them evidence. They are admitting they colluded to help Hillary in the 2016 election, thanks to John Solomon.  We also know Ukrainian government official dead this and is admitting this and has evidence to this fact, to impact the 2016 election. So, is Robert Mueller going to be reappointed to investigate the Clinton campaign and only high Republican donors? And what about Clinton's bought and paid for dossier? Yes, the dossier with of all things, imagine this, Russian government lies, misinformation, propaganda now debunked.  Now, tonight, according to \"Politico\", we are learning that the DOJ inspectors report will likely target the author of the dossier, Christopher Steele. That's fine, but the real focus should be on the person that paid for that lying dossier. Those that never verified that dossier and committed a fraud on the FISA court, those that leaked the information in that dossier to their friends into the media, so they leaked it before the election to influence the election.  And those that use it to deny an American citizen, Carter Page, of his constitutional rights and use those Russian lies to commit a fraud again and again, four separate times on the FISA court to spy on the Trump campaign.  Now, thankfully, our calls for truth and justice are all about to be answered. After Mueller madness, hysteria and breathless reporting tomorrow begins to die down and it will, this is what's coming next in the coming days, months, weeks. There is a complete avalanche of truth that will start to cascade down on all of the deep state bad actors, the corrupt media, the Democratic Party, all the people missing in action and what is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in American history. We are talking about criminal referrals coming from Congressman Devin Nunes. More criminal referrals we expect from the Horowitz report. His report on the FISA investigation, committing fraud to FISA court judges.  They knowingly lie to those judges. Let's not forget the Uber investigation on leaking by these officials. The 302s, conversations, Christopher Steele, Bruce Ohr, the applications, the FISA applications themselves, especially the last one, pages ten through 12, 17 to 34. Then we'll get the Gang of Eight information. What did the FBI know and when did they know it? We might get information on Christopher Steele from a court in Florida. And this is very important, AG Barr's investigation into spying. They spied on the Trump campaign. It happened. Now, these investigations will bring a lot of bad actors to justice. The consequences will be steep and today, we have been right about everything that has transpired surrounding the deep states abuse of power, the witch hunt into president. And tomorrow, you will see the last mass hysteria, freak-out on this topic.  They'll be another one. And it will pass.  Now, this week I nearly had a heart attack. Why? Well, a columnist from \"The Washington Post\", they make get a Pulitzer like \"The New York Times\" for their hoax coverage, he had the courage to admit any article titled -- look at this: FOX News has been right all along.  Gary Abernathy, I'm worried for his job tonight. He writes, quote: FOX News hosts like Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and especially Sean Hannity have been slammed for spending nearly two years clamoring for an investigation of the investigators. It would behoove serious journalists to put aside their political biases and delve into the story that might actually be worthy of Watergate comparisons, even if it includes the painful admission that FOX News has been right all along. Wow, imagine that. Talk show hosts right again. We have listed all the times we have been right and they have been wrong. You know, I am a talk show host. I sometimes report straight news, I have hundreds of hours of coverage. We've done investigative reporting like vetting Obama. We have for the last two years. We also offer strong opinions, I don't hide it.  Sometimes we talk about sports, culture and even laugh and have fun. Like if you are talk show host, you're like the whole newspaper. You're a member of the press, the free press in America, and every news division in this country was wrong. Except I will say, people in our news division like Catherine Herridge, Ed Henry, I'm not going to name everybody. We had -- we even had our own sources. I have my own sources. And, by the way, I will protect them to the grave. And, by the way, I hope Mr. Abernathy, I hope you don't get fired. The truth actually got out \"The Washington Post.\" Only one small part of our promise to hold a deep state accountable.  Investigations taking place right now, in the DOJ, in Congress are the only thing standing in the way of this country becoming a banana republic if we don't investigate investigators, lock up the bad actors, this country will be over as we know it. Almost be held to account, including those who rigged Hillary's probe, prosecuted Trump, spied on a political campaign, try to rig a presidential election, attempted a deep state coup on a duly elected president of the United States. If justice is not served, say goodbye to our democratic republic, say goodbye to your freedoms. You can say goodbye to your precious rights endowed by our Constitution and creator, God.   We must protect also the 99.9 percent good people in the FBI, the intelligence community that protect the innocent people here and around the globe, premier agencies around the world. It's only 1 percent that did wrong. We either cut equal justice that we deserve or we will have no country. Here now, Fox News contributor, a big part of our ensemble cast right here, Joe diGenova, Sara Carter and Victoria Toensing. Good to see you all. Joe, when you said the first time on this show, bad cops -- being the son of a prison guard for 25 years my mom and my dad, a family court probation guy and family full of cops and two FBI guys, it stung.

The White House is running this. I covered law enforcement for 30 years. The White House doesn't normally run counterintelligence or Justice Department investigations. That text has remained in my head for a long time. And over the last few weeks I've been reporting, I think Victoria, in the last segment, something really important, she said, January 2017, there was one White House meeting, I think next week, we'll be talking about a meeting one year earlier where the origins of the Trump collusion case begins, a whole year earlier.

Our sources telling us tonight, minimal redaction. The American people will see this and still the media mob of Democrats, Trump haters everywhere will get there one last itsy-bitsy chance to breathlessly, hysterically, hyperventilate over nothing. A baseless, a vengeful hoax, a Russian collusion witch hunt that has come up totally and completely and utterly empty. No collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction. No matter what sentences, paragraphs, pages Democrats, the mob and the media fixate on, none of it changes the outcome. We already know the outcome. If you can go to Vegas, you can bet on what I'm telling you.  Four separate investigations now have cleared Donald Trump and the Trump campaign, including the also powerful special counsel filled with investigators who are, almost all of them, big time Democratic donors, supporters of Hillary, even somebody who went to her victory party, and a former lawyer of Hillary. After 22 months, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 230 court orders, interviews with 500 people, the Mueller report -- this is directly from the report -- concluded, quote: The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government and its election interference activities, which, by the way, Devin Nunes warned us about in 2014. No one inside the Trump campaign, that means Donald Trump, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government. No one. That is now a fact. Two and a half years, you've had your tinfoil hat conspiracy theories, your daily lies and the media mob, the Democratic Party working in unison, in one voice, to slander, smear, besmirch, and destroy a duly elected president and everybody around him. They have for two and a half years flat out lied to you, we -- the American people over and over and over again. And we've got the proof. Let's take a little trip down, well, memory witch hunt lane.

She and all these others conning their viewers. And, by the way, many for a lot of financial gain. Tomorrow, they will give it there one last college try. Good luck. And you can expect more of what you just saw on steroids and human growth hormone. But it is officially the media mob, the Democratic Party's last chance to revive their favorite, psychotic conspiracy theories. They still don't know it's done. It's over. They lost again. It is election night all over again and 2016, and here's the sad reality, they'll never apologize. They won't retract false reports, retract their politically motivated daily hysteria. Their breathless, Russia, Russia, Russia, impeach, impeach, impeach, collusion, collusion, collusion insanity! Never. They will never own up to being a part of the biggest, most dangerous fraud conspiracy theory ever perpetrated against we the American people. And when they finally realized they lost and they did and they lied and they did and they failed on a spectacular level and they did, they're just going to move on to the next lie, and then next lie, and the next conspiracy theory. And they're going to act as if this never happened, badgering, hope you forgot. As I've said mainstream media, so-called journalism is dead in America.  The fools who claim to have a monopoly of facts, they don't want to report Mueller's key findings. Let me go back from the Mueller report. The investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. Mueller words, not Hannity. A direct quote from the Mueller report. An undeniable, irrefutable fact. This is the paragraph that the liars on the left can barely bring themselves to acknowledge. But with the fake collusion narrative dead and buried, you can already see the mob switching their narrative. Or maybe we will get him on obstruction. We need his tax returns. We will have a memorandum of understanding and we'll agree to go after him on this. Now, get this, obstruction of justice from a crime that was never committed. How can you obstruct without the underlying crime? By the way, with the statute of obstruction, you need intent, that is required by law when one has consistently and repeatedly and loudly, like the president, rightly proclaiming his innocence. He acted the way innocent people act, they are outraged. So, of course, the president was never charged with obstruction, not by Mueller, not by the attorney general's office, not even Uncle Rod Rosenstein. And tomorrow in the report, you might see information about, well, the president, he fired Jim Comey. That is not obstruction. Even Comey pointed out, the president can fire an FBI director for any reason or no reason at all, and you might hear -- if they will hang on to evidence about, well, the president talked about firing Rod Rosenstein, and other officials like he talked about firing Mueller himself or the president wished a 33-year-old veteran, a hero who served this country in combat, General Flynn would not get in trouble. The president talked about, this is ridiculous. I hope he doesn't get in trouble. But guess what? The president never fired Rosenstein, never fired Mueller, never fired Sessions, never fired any of the Democrats hired to sustain the witch hunt. He never stopped the investigation. In other words, he never impeded, he never obstructed. He didn't impede against the case against Lieutenant General Flynn or any other target of this witch hunt. And shouting from a rooftop that you're innocent as the president has, that you're a victim of a witch hunt, that's not a crime. Expressing frustration about injustice is not obstruction. Talking is not obstruction. Thinking about something is not obstruction. Kind of like, like Rod Rosenstein, another deep state rat talking about wearing a wire because they wanted to spy on the president. Or conspiring and talking about using the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. Now, there are officials right now in our DOJ right now, they actually had those real conversations but none of them are being charged with the crime because they didn't act. They didn't commit. One in this case, well, maybe the others did, though, which we're going to get to. In this case, well, they didn't wear the wire. They didn't use the 25th Amendment. They never acted. They talked about it, talking is not a crime. Now, if the Democrats, the hate Trump media mob, if they really cared about obstruction and when you hear these people tomorrow, OK, I've got a great case for them. Why oh why oh why did they ignore the blatant obstruction of justice committed by one of their own, their favorite candidate, Hillary Clinton? Now, we know she violated the Espionage Act, it's a fact. She stored classified, top secret information on an unsecured server. Here is the law. Irrefutable and you can see it right there, incontrovertible and overwhelming evidence, even Comey admitted she did this. And she deleted 33,000 subpoenaed emails, washed the hard drive with Bleach Bit, remove the SIM cards, had an aide destroyed her devices with hammers, just in case those emails were still on there."

      "speaker": "Now, the media mob that will be so outraged over obstruction tomorrow, this was the biggest slam dunk obstruction case ever. It had an underlying crime and intent, the intent in this case",
      "utterance": "destroy the evidence of the crime. More media, more liberal selective, phony moral outrage, that's what you'll see tomorrow. Remember in the Kavanaugh case, oh, they were -- I believe, I believe.  Where are the \"I believers\"? Because we have serious allegations of rape and violent sexual assault right now against the Democratic lieutenant governor of Virginia. All the \"I believers\" are quiet. Now, we saw it with the Covington high school kids. There, they rushed they even slander a 16-year-old kid. We see it with climate change. We see it with their new green deal and socialist policies. By the way, Hillary was never charged with her crime because her investigation which we now know was rigged by the deep state. Just the upper echelon, not rank-and-file. And that's why Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, is not rightly investigating the investigation into the Clinton email scandal. And in this case, the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible. It's now crystal clear we on the show and we have this ensemble cast, radio and TV, staffs, the people you see all for the last two years, we've been right all along. The Clinton investigation was fixed in her favor by a few high-ranking bureaucrats wanted her to be president, wanted to Trump to lose. Well, President Trump faced a modern day political persecution at the hands of those very same people, the same people that gave her a pass rigged her investigation. If the deep state was really concerned about collusion and why is there no investigation into collusion? We now know Ukraine is begging to give them evidence. They are admitting they colluded to help Hillary in the 2016 election, thanks to John Solomon. We also know Ukrainian government official dead this and is admitting this and has evidence to this fact, to impact the 2016 election. So, is Robert Mueller going to be reappointed to investigate the Clinton campaign and only high Republican donors? And what about Clinton's bought and paid for dossier? Yes, the dossier with of all things, imagine this, Russian government lies, misinformation, propaganda now debunked. Now, tonight, according to \"Politico\", we are learning that the DOJ inspectors report will likely target the author of the dossier, Christopher Steele. That's fine, but the real focus should be on the person that paid for that lying dossier. Those that never verified that dossier and committed a fraud on the FISA court, those that leaked the information in that dossier to their friends into the media, so they leaked it before the election to influence the election. And those that use it to deny an American citizen, Carter Page, of his constitutional rights and use those Russian lies to commit a fraud again and again, four separate times on the FISA court to spy on the Trump campaign. Now, thankfully, our calls for truth and justice are all about to be answered. After Mueller madness, hysteria and breathless reporting tomorrow begins to die down and it will, this is what's coming next in the coming days, months, weeks. There is a complete avalanche of truth that will start to cascade down on all of the deep state bad actors, the corrupt media, the Democratic Party, all the people missing in action and what is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in American history. We are talking about criminal referrals coming from Congressman Devin Nunes. More criminal referrals we expect from the Horowitz report. His report on the FISA investigation, committing fraud to FISA court judges. They knowingly lie to those judges. Let's not forget the Uber investigation on leaking by these officials. The 302s, conversations, Christopher Steele, Bruce Ohr, the applications, the FISA applications themselves, especially the last one, pages ten through 12, 17 to 34. Then we'll get the Gang of Eight information. What did the FBI know and when did they know it? We might get information on Christopher Steele from a court in Florida. And this is very important, AG Barr's investigation into spying. They spied on the Trump campaign. It happened. Now, these investigations will bring a lot of bad actors to justice. The consequences will be steep and today, we have been right about everything that has transpired surrounding the deep states abuse of power, the witch hunt into president. And tomorrow, you will see the last mass hysteria, freak-out on this topic.  They'll be another one. And it will pass. Now, this week I nearly had a heart attack. Why? Well, a columnist from \"The Washington Post\", they make get a Pulitzer like \"The New York Times\" for their hoax coverage, he had the courage to admit any article titled -- look at this: FOX News has been right all along."

Wow, imagine that. Talk show hosts right again. We have listed all the times we have been right and they have been wrong. You know, I am a talk show host. I sometimes report straight news, I have hundreds of hours of coverage. We've done investigative reporting like vetting Obama. We have for the last two years.

Almost be held to account, including those who rigged Hillary's probe, prosecuted Trump, spied on a political campaign, try to rig a presidential election, attempted a deep state coup on a duly elected president of the United States. If justice is not served, say goodbye to our democratic republic, say goodbye to your freedoms. You can say goodbye to your precious rights endowed by our Constitution and creator, God.

House intel, bipartisan Senate committee and now the Mueller Report definitively no collusion. Fine. Keep going after that and then run on the New Green Deal, how does that impact 2020.  ROVE: Yes. Well, I think by the time 2020 rolls around and I suspect they'll get smart that candidates will get smart you'll notice the candidates are not talking to the same way that Schiff and Nadler are. In fact, I thought it was interesting. Bernie Sanders in the Fox Town Hall on Monday went out of his way to say, if we spend all of our time attacking Donald Trump, Democrats will lose. So, you're going to see a dichotomy between most of the presidential candidates particularly the ones near the top of the heap and the people who are the chairs of these committees in the house because they have nothing. First of all, they're all emotionally involved in this and they have nothing to go on in the house and nothing to do except vent their spleens.

Giannulli got a letter from the U.S. Attorney's office in Boston saying, she was also a subject of the investigation. It's unclear if Loughlin's oldest daughter Isabella also got a letter. But experts say prosecutors are making it very clear, they believe the kids knew about the cheating scandal and were willing participants. And it's hard to imagine the daughters didn't think something was up when they got recruited to be on the University of Southern California, crew team knowing that neither of them had ever rowed. They also sent pictures on their applications of them in rowing attire, on rowing machines. This is also an indication that the students themselves may face charges. And a source tells People magazine that Lori Loughlin and her husband resent how the case is playing out. \"This is putting unspeakable stress on her and her family.\" They're having to play this all out publicly and they're fair game for jokes and memes, but also outraged by people who are saying that they are cheaters.

Avenatti tells law on crime, \"I was contacted by the counsel for the brothers and was asked to consider coming into the case to assist them. I ultimately decided not to get involved.\" It's interesting that Mark Geragos has been representing Jussie Smollett since February. The text about Avenatti getting involved was March 3rd and three weeks later, Mark Geragos was reportedly a co-conspirator in Avenatti's alleged extortion of Nike. Avenatti says, Eric Gallegos was not a factor in his decision not to represent the Nigerian brothers. Finally, in her text messages, Kim Foxx called singer R. Kelly, a pedophile.
