      "sentences": "All right, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another busy Washington tonight. The president of course addressed the nation on the coronavirus response just a few short hours ago. Senator Tom Cotton has been at the forefront of this conversation and he joins us. Plus, we're going to take you live to South Korea where a U.S. military contractor explains what it's like living inside a country where the virus is spreading like wildfire. And also, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Dan Bongino, Richard Goodstein are all here in moments with reaction to last night's debate that does have Democrat voters panicked.  And on the same day, the Trump administration scores a court victory against sanctuary cities. You heard Sean talk about that. We bring you a report of how these reckless policies are endangering children and the communities that allow them. But first, the pandemic party. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  If you're worried about the spread of the Coronavirus, well you're obviously not alone. It's unsettling to see doctors and what look like hazmat suits in China. People quarantined, hanging out of hotel windows in Italy and of course, your fellow airline passengers wearing face masks.  Yet more unsettling is something happening right here in the United States. And it's not medical. It's political. Democrats and their media cronies have decided to weaponize fear and also weaponize suffering to improve their chances against Trump, in November.",

They learn from, they never let a crisis go to waste philosophy of Rahm Emanuel that many of them are frankly so sick with their anti-Trump fever that they actually consider this virus a political godsend. Finally, they think they might have something that may stick to Trump. Well, let's face it. They're really frustrated right now, these Democrats, think about it. After Mueller flopped, after the impeachment failed, after they constantly demonized Trump as a racist, sexist and every other ist you can think of, the economy and his approval numbers continued to grow.  All they know how to do though is stoke panic. What else they really have at this point. I guess they have Bernie's laundry list of freebies, free health care, free pre-K, free college, free medical care, free housing, it's all a fraud. No one takes any of this seriously. Remember, when Reagan told us, it's morning in America. And then Trump vowed to make America great again. And Obama, he offered hope and change. Well, the 2020 Democrats on the other hand are either hoping for misery or actually peddling it. None of the candidates have an answer to Trump's booming economy. So, they pretend as they did at last night's debate that Americans really aren't better off at all.",

And as the President has pointed out, one reason why we have the time now to try to control outbreaks, try to get testing kits out to the states is because he took decisive action last month to shut down travel from China. And what happened at the time, Joe Biden accused him of being xenophobic against the Chinese. And Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were too busy trying to impeach him at the time. So, it's very disappointing as the President sad to see the other party trying to politicize this matter, when it's something that we should be working together on. And when they criticize the President, really what they're doing are criticizing his advisers from public health agencies like the CDC and the FDA. They're not criticizing him.

A federal appeals court ruling that he can in fact withhold funding from so- called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with ICE. Perhaps the president should start with the sanctuary in his own backyard, the D.C. suburb of Montgomery County, Maryland, just a few miles from where we are broadcasting tonight. In the span of just two months in 2019, the county saw at least nine illegal aliens arrested for rape and sex abuse crimes, many of them against children. And this week we saw perhaps the most disturbing case yet. Two high school students aged 19 and 20, yes, you read that right, heard that right, were arrested and charged with raping two different 11-year-old girls -- 11-year-olds. One of the suspects, the 20- year-old, is a Salvadoran national who is living here illegally. So what's a 20-year-old man, illegal alien, doing enrolled in a public high school, paid for by the tax dollars obviously? Maryland law requires that all residents up to the age of 21 get free public education for high school, including illegal aliens. If you are a Maryland resident, maybe just think about calling your representative, ask why your tax dollars are going towards this? That would be a good idea. And my next guest says Montgomery County has become a hotbed of illegal alien crime, and now it's bleeding into his county, Frederick County. Joining me now is Chuck Jenkins, sheriff of Frederick County, Maryland. Sheriff, what's your message tonight to the people watching all of this?

      "utterance": "All right, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another busy Washington tonight. The president of course addressed the nation on the coronavirus response just a few short hours ago. Senator Tom Cotton has been at the forefront of this conversation and he joins us. Plus, we're going to take you live to South Korea where a U.S. military contractor explains what it's like living inside a country where the virus is spreading like wildfire. And also, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Dan Bongino, Richard Goodstein are all here in moments with reaction to last night's debate that does have Democrat voters panicked. And on the same day, the Trump administration scores a court victory against sanctuary cities. You heard Sean talk about that. We bring you a report of how these reckless policies are endangering children and the communities that allow them. But first, the pandemic party. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. If you're worried about the spread of the Coronavirus, well you're obviously not alone. It's unsettling to see doctors and what look like hazmat suits in China. People quarantined, hanging out of hotel windows in Italy and of course, your fellow airline passengers wearing face masks. Yet more unsettling is something happening right here in the United States. And it's not medical. It's political. Democrats and their media cronies have decided to weaponize fear and also weaponize suffering to improve their chances against Trump, in November."

      "utterance": "All right perhaps they could have done this a week ago, but the most important thing, the thing that matters to Americans coast-to-coast is that this effort is highly organized, extremely thorough and very well managed. But facts don't matter to the Trump haters. They learn from, they never let a crisis go to waste philosophy of Rahm Emanuel that many of them are frankly so sick with their anti-Trump fever that they actually consider this virus a political godsend. Finally, they think they might have something that may stick to Trump. Well, let's face it. They're really frustrated right now, these Democrats, think about it. After Mueller flopped, after the impeachment failed, after they constantly demonized Trump as a racist, sexist and every other ist you can think of, the economy and his approval numbers continued to grow. All they know how to do though is stoke panic. What else they really have at this point. I guess they have Bernie's laundry list of freebies, free health care, free pre-K, free college, free medical care, free housing, it's all a fraud. No one takes any of this seriously. Remember, when Reagan told us, it's morning in America. And then Trump vowed to make America great again. And Obama, he offered hope and change. Well, the 2020 Democrats on the other hand are either hoping for misery or actually peddling it. None of the candidates have an answer to Trump's booming economy. So, they pretend as they did at last night's debate that Americans really aren't better off at all."

Just today, we learned that the new home sales number hit a 12-year high last month. But again remember, good news for you is bad news for the misery party.

Why would they do that given how the decks are apparently stacked against all of them, a terrible rotten racist country. You'd have thought that the word would have gotten around by now. Don't go there. They hate you. It's all pretty weird though don't you think that such a racist society would see unemployment at record lows for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans. Friends, it's frankly just - thinking about this all day. It's just pathetic at this point. The Democrats are coming up empty. The great American comeback is a fact and everyone who wants a job, wants to work is benefiting. That's great news and it's happening because of President Trump's America First policies. That takes us back though to where we started. The Democrats latest desperate attempt to gain the political upper hand when nothing else is stuck.

And that raises concerns when he's trying to kind of assure the public saying oh by April this will be over, things like that, it just doesn't ring true.

Is that OK. I didn't interrupt you. Can I finish my point here? We had CNN complain about the lack of white males on the Trump task force for this. We had Nancy Pelosi today openly attack the President saying, we should fund it as much as we did Ebola and then simultaneously Laura said, but we didn't spend all the Ebola money and complaining about Trump. And then we had the Washington Post and Democrats, Richard your party there complained that Trump's travel ban. I'm sure you would have said the same thing a few months ago too that the travel ban was racist, and it was terrible, which looks like it saved us right now and this Coronavirus. So, spare me the Democrat nonsense talking points please. This is garbage. You know your party is in a retch right now and you know they're taking advantage of this thing.

The South Korean citizens are clamoring for travel lockdown from China altogether. And I would say to the Democrats today, are you willing to one up Trump on travel bans because that's what would really calm this thing down. If you really stop travel from the most affected province of China, but you have to extend it all to almost all of China, would Democrats be in favor of that.

And Dan Bongino, I think a lot of people are reexamining a lot of things right now given this health situation and so, it's great to say, kumbaya, globalization, globalism. But when something like this happens people think the nation state isn't a bad idea after all."

We don't know how deadly yet to be fair, but that's entering the country clearly from China where it originated. He can't concede the point that Trump's travel ban was a huge tactical success in mitigating the effect this year. So, what does he do, what do you want, a travel bans all over the world? You didn't say that. I didn't say that either. What the Trump administration wants to do is where is the probability that this would come from in certain countries, China, the probability is high. Maybe we should look at a travel ban, but Democrats don't do that because Richard has TDS level 6 Trump Derangement Syndrome."

But American people are smarter than this they see right through this. Joining me now Senator Tom Cotton, who has been leading in the - I think asking very common-sense questions about this, weeks before senators from the other party started piling on.

Nothing is inevitable and neither the President nor I will tolerate the kind of defeatism you hear from some quarters that there's nothing we can do to try to stop outbreaks in the United States or at least contain outbreaks because of course there's a big difference from having one case and having a hundred cases in a community. I know the President is very focused from my conversations with him on getting testing kits out to all 50 states. So, we don't have a bottleneck at the headquarters of the CDC in Atlanta. I think that's the one thing we could do right now that would help us either identify a potential outbreak and contain it if there is one."

When I first began focusing on this matter and early to mid-January, I was speaking to administration officials as they were going into these meetings and coming out of them as well. And as the President has pointed out, one reason why we have the time now to try to control outbreaks, try to get testing kits out to the states is because he took decisive action last month to shut down travel from China. And what happened at the time, Joe Biden accused him of being xenophobic against the Chinese. And Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were too busy trying to impeach him at the time. So, it's very disappointing as the President sad to see the other party trying to politicize this matter, when it's something that we should be working together on. And when they criticize the President, really what they're doing are criticizing his advisers from public health agencies like the CDC and the FDA. They're not criticizing him. They're criticizing those advisers. He's of course making sure that everyone is on top of it and as being as aggressive as they can.

So, last week, there were 51. Now, there are 1200. Now, just to give you a sense of how fast this could explode. There are now 50 Americans with confirmed cases. So, what is it like living in a country with highest number of cases outside China? We're joined by Steve Tharp with the retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel who has lived in South Korea for 30 years. Steve, good to see you.

And if I could just take a minute and explain it for your viewers back in the United States. Daegu is a town about the size of Kansas City. I am a Missouri guy so I like to use Kansas City as a reference. But imagine everybody in Kansas City being told to stay home and stay off the streets, and you have nothing but completely empty streets, with maybe a piece of trash floating here or there. That's the way it is in Daegu. And here in Seoul, it's a little better. You still have people, but most people have stayed home. When they go out, they wear masks.

Correct?"

And up ahead, one D.C. suburb's decision to become a sanctuary for illegals has made it a magnet for crime, and now it's spilling into neighboring counties. A local sheriff responds.

      "utterance": "This was a huge victory for the Trump administration today. A federal appeals court ruling that he can in fact withhold funding from so- called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with ICE. Perhaps the president should start with the sanctuary in his own backyard, the D.C. suburb of Montgomery County, Maryland, just a few miles from where we are broadcasting tonight. In the span of just two months in 2019, the county saw at least nine illegal aliens arrested for rape and sex abuse crimes, many of them against children. And this week we saw perhaps the most disturbing case yet. Two high school students aged 19 and 20, yes, you read that right, heard that right, were arrested and charged with raping two different 11-year-old girls -- 11-year-olds. One of the suspects, the 20- year-old, is a Salvadoran national who is living here illegally. So what's a 20-year-old man, illegal alien, doing enrolled in a public high school, paid for by the tax dollars obviously? Maryland law requires that all residents up to the age of 21 get free public education for high school, including illegal aliens. If you are a Maryland resident, maybe just think about calling your representative, ask why your tax dollars are going towards this? That would be a good idea. And my next guest says Montgomery County has become a hotbed of illegal alien crime, and now it's bleeding into his county, Frederick County. Joining me now is Chuck Jenkins, sheriff of Frederick County, Maryland. Sheriff, what's your message tonight to the people watching all of this? They're thinking, oh, this is just one county, or two counties."

Given the massive spike in referral to the DOJ for these types of cases, this new task force is absolutely necessary. Joining me now exclusively from Mexico City is John Bash, U.S. attorney for the western district of Texas. John, what can you tell us tonight about this new DOJ unit? We were dealing with county issue right outside of Washington, D.C., which is troubling. Tell us about this new unit."

We have stood up a unit of 20 to 30 attorneys who are going to work civil denaturalization cases. And what those cases are is when someone lies in the process of trying to get naturalized to be a citizen, usually about their criminal past, but then nevertheless obtain citizenship, we can actually go after the fact and strip them of citizenship so long as the judge agrees. And we have been doing that. We have stepped that up 200 percent in the last three years. But it's getting to the point where we are getting enough referrals that it's time to stand up a standalone unit, and so we have 20 to 30 lawyers dedicated to bringing justice to victims of child molestation, to victims of terrorism, war crimes, and so forth."

Despite the previous lies, Trump now confirms what we've known for years. His systematic campaign against black and brown people extends to U.S. citizens.\" Is that really what's going on here, John?

This is about people that never should have been naturalized, never should have been American citizens in the first case. I will just give you a couple examples. We denaturalized two Balkan conflicts war criminals who murdered unarmed civilians in the Balkans conflict. We denaturalized in my home state of Texas a man who was molesting a seven-year-old girl who was a family member and of course didn't disclose it on his naturalization application. I would really like for the ACLU or anyone else to confront the actual facts of these cases and explain why someone who has been molesting children and lies about it should not be denaturalized."

And just because you have a green card doesn't mean it's a free pass that you can stay in the United States forever. You can get denaturalized if you have lied in the process, if you've committed fraud in the process. That's U.S. law. The ACLU might not like U.S. law, but that's just the way it is. I don't know what they want. The question is how these people ever became citizens in the first place. I imagine a lot of them are from chain migration, correct?"
    },

      "speaker": "BASH",

Some of them are people who might have lied about being a family member, but a lot of people come here as refugees but then lie about the fact that the very conflict they are fleeing from, they were the war criminal in that conflict. And the other thing the ACLU leaves out is we have to prove almost beyond a reasonable doubt to a judge's satisfaction this person never should have been a U.S. citizen.
