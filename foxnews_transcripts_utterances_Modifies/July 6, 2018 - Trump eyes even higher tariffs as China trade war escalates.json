China is accusing the White House of launching the largest trade war in history for slapping billions of dollars' worth of tariffs on Chinese goods, this, as our economy continues to boom. U.S. employers adding a solid 213,000 jobs last month. President Trump explains why he's taking action against Beijing.",

So my question for the president is when he starts to hear from these states, from senators in the Republican Party who are up for re-election, or other members of congress, that the tariffs are hurting the voters back at home, will that change the calculation because the president hold -- fear of the cases if he puts these really tough tariffs on these other countries will come and negotiate and make better trade deals, but we haven't seen any evidence they're willing to do. So the president is playing hard ball. We have no new trade deals in place. And meanwhile, there's great economic news, as you mentioned, that has the potential to be undercut in people's paychecks and wallets if the tariffs continue for some time. It's a political question at some point. Not just an economic one for the president.",

The other thing is there's a piece in the New York Times today that reiterated the president floating that idea at the G-7, why don't we just take all the tariffs off? And Ed Feulner of the Heritage Foundation said that we'd be for that. And I'm like -- actually, go with that, why don't we try that with our allies. We're going to see most of them next week anyway when he goes to the NATO meeting. I do think it has the potential to hurt people. It takes a long time to build market share especially if you're a farmer, soybean farmer or cattle rancher. It takes a while and it can be undone pretty quickly. That's why I hope that it gets done. But one of the reasons that we have a trade deficit is that we are pretty wealthy country and we like to buy cheap things, and China makes a lot of cheap things that we like to buy. And I think that a little bit of this turned on its head. The other thing I would say is the president is about to embark on 11-day foreign trip. He's got a lot of great opportunities, but it's also fraught with a lot of challenges because my role is every time a president goes on a foreign trip, something major happens at home. So, on Monday night he'll announce the Supreme Court pick, and then he will be off and he'll go and he'll let the White House and the senate try to work on that nomination. And he'll be out of the country. I think that's actually a pretty smart strategy. But then always something else happens at home. Nobody knows what it's going to be.",

And they're building up their navy big time. So, all we're saying is, listen, you know, we need to contain China, and we've got to have our allies in order to contain China and protect U.S. workers because, you know, ever since China got into the WTO, the American blue collar men and women that worked a lot of long hours in this country have gotten hammered. The wages have gone down and the jobs have left. So Trump came in to protect those people. And one of the ways to do that is to contain the rise of China. They're a big global threat. There's going to be a big clash of the great powers eventually. And I would disagree with Marie.

The 38-year-old expert diver was coming out of the cave around 1 o'clock in the morning when he ran out of oxygen and passed out. At the time, he was trying to establish an oxygen line into the chamber where the boys are trapped because the oxygen level in there has dropped from 21 percent to 15 percent. That's significant. They are now using canister to try and fill the cavern with more oxygen, to kind of raise the level. The diver's death highlights what we have been emphasizing for days which is that even for experts getting in and out of the cave is extremely dangerous. And most of these boys don't even know how to swim, let alone utilize dive gear through muddy water and narrow passageways. Earlier on Shepard Smith reporting, I spoke with a former secret service agent and rescue diver about the emotional toll of trying to swim out. Watch.",

      "utterance": "Sure, yes, I will talk about China and the tariffs. So, what's interesting is these tariffs, not with just China, but also with Canada, Mexico, and the E.U., have the real potential to hurt real voters across the country whether it's soybean farmers in Indiana who are already starting to feel the consequences of this. So my question for the president is when he starts to hear from these states, from senators in the Republican Party who are up for re-election, or other members of congress, that the tariffs are hurting the voters back at home, will that change the calculation because the president hold -- fear of the cases if he puts these really tough tariffs on these other countries will come and negotiate and make better trade deals, but we haven't seen any evidence they're willing to do. So the president is playing hard ball. We have no new trade deals in place. And meanwhile, there's great economic news, as you mentioned, that has the potential to be undercut in people's paychecks and wallets if the tariffs continue for some time. It's a political question at some point. Not just an economic one for the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "OK. Well, the president, Dana, has been, you know, pretty steadfast on his talking points, you know, about the economy, about the tariffs that he feels it was unequal bargaining between the United States and China has been in place pretty much for 40 years where they have had these discrepancies where he feels like we have had sort of a disadvantage that we've been operating on, and so he's trying to correct that. What do you think about the timing and the impact on the economy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, I keep thinking that every morning we'll wake up and find out, oh, everything is solved, and there was a big agreement overnight and everything is fine, looks like that's not going to happen. The other thing is there's a piece in the New York Times today that reiterated the president floating that idea at the G-7, why don't we just take all the tariffs off? And Ed Feulner of the Heritage Foundation said that we'd be for that. And I'm like -- actually, go with that, why don't we try that with our allies. We're going to see most of them next week anyway when he goes to the NATO meeting. I do think it has the potential to hurt people. It takes a long time to build market share especially if you're a farmer, soybean farmer or cattle rancher. It takes a while and it can be undone pretty quickly. That's why I hope that it gets done. But one of the reasons that we have a trade deficit is that we are pretty wealthy country and we like to buy cheap things, and China makes a lot of cheap things that we like to buy. And I think that a little bit of this turned on its head. The other thing I would say is the president is about to embark on 11-day foreign trip. He's got a lot of great opportunities, but it's also fraught with a lot of challenges because my role is every time a president goes on a foreign trip, something major happens at home. So, on Monday night he'll announce the Supreme Court pick, and then he will be off and he'll go and he'll let the White House and the senate try to work on that nomination. And he'll be out of the country. I think that's actually a pretty smart strategy. But then always something else happens at home. Nobody knows what it's going to be."

They dumped all these cheap goods into the United States. They manipulate their currency. They don't allow foreign investment. They restrict that very forcefully. And they're building up their navy big time. So, all we're saying is, listen, you know, we need to contain China, and we've got to have our allies in order to contain China and protect U.S. workers because, you know, ever since China got into the WTO, the American blue collar men and women that worked a lot of long hours in this country have gotten hammered. The wages have gone down and the jobs have left. So Trump came in to protect those people. And one of the ways to do that is to contain the rise of China. They're a big global threat. There's going to be a big clash of the great powers eventually. And I would disagree with Marie. You said that, you know, our allies and the people that we've been, you know, doing these little tariff wars with haven't really done anything. South Korea caved on autos and steel."

I mean, China is not innocent here by a long shot, and especially when it comes to intellectual property theft and technology companies, they absolutely should be call on for that. But I think the place to do this would be with our allies with NATO. But, again, even that still is like, you know, giving NATO a bloody nose on the way to a better trade deal? I don't know.

      "utterance": "And, Marie, for the past four days the rescue teams in and around those caves in Thailand have had very high hopes for getting those 12 boys and their coach out safely, but now that optimism has diminished a bit following the death of a Thai navy seal. The 38-year-old expert diver was coming out of the cave around 1 o'clock in the morning when he ran out of oxygen and passed out. At the time, he was trying to establish an oxygen line into the chamber where the boys are trapped because the oxygen level in there has dropped from 21 percent to 15 percent. That's significant. They are now using canister to try and fill the cavern with more oxygen, to kind of raise the level. The diver's death highlights what we have been emphasizing for days which is that even for experts getting in and out of the cave is extremely dangerous. And most of these boys don't even know how to swim, let alone utilize dive gear through muddy water and narrow passageways. Earlier on Shepard Smith reporting, I spoke with a former secret service agent and rescue diver about the emotional toll of trying to swim out. Watch."

    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "It's worth noting that some of the passageways are so narrow that even with the help of expert divers there are portions of the trip out, like a mile, mile and a half, where the boys would have to navigate the channels alone. For now, the rescue teams are waiting. But if the oxygen levels continue to drop inside the cave or the water levels rise because of these monsoon rains that are forecast this weekend, swimming out sooner than later may be the only option. Marie?"

The Thai navy SEAL, God bless them, who is such a hero trying to go in to increase the oxygen levels in there so these children would be able to survive. And then he lost and gave his own life. That just goes to show you how dangerous and how serious and fraught the situation is. And you have to think that some of the best and brightest minds, you know, not just in this country but in the world are trying to put their heads together to work, cooperatively, and everybody comes together when you think about this to try to save the life of, you know, children who are just really just relying on us and just poor things are so desperate in there to be able to survive. And you see these images, and if you look at some of the graphics that you've seen on the internet, on the web, in terms of the whole layout, the structure of it, you see how complicated it is, in fact, to be able to effectuate a rescue. And I just say to myself this is really a situation where, you know, they need like a miracle. And they need our prayers and they need everybody to really think in a creative, unique way about how they can do this and, you know, keep them alive so that they can get them out."

      "speaker": "HARF",

One option is possibly boring a hole down into the cave, sort of like they did with the Chilean miners, if folks remember that several years ago. One option was for them to stay in the cave, bring in supplies, and they could stay there until the monsoon season ended and then they could get out more safely. But now, as Trace mentioned, there's an oxygen problem. So, people -- there's a 140 cave divers from around the world who are helping, and people are trying to come up with solutions here which is a good thing. There's a loft innovation in the world that maybe can help."

And everybody comes together, all these experts are volunteering their own time and money to go in. Other countries are getting involved, other organizations. Boring a hole seems dangerous because that could collapse it. And then, just feeding them oxygen could only last for so long because the monsoon season, I guess, ends in October. So that's what? Three months from now."

We do not have a crisis at the border, but we need better immigration policies, and we need border security. The problem is the president runs way far to the right.
