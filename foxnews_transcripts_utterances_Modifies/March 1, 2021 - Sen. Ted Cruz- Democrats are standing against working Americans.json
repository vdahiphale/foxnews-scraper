The man who ran against him and may yet again, has been warning about him for years. He's here to respond. And Joe Biden's visiting angel comes to his rescue again. Raymond Arroyo explains it in Seen and Unseen. But first, exposing themselves. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.",

With the pace of destructive change happening to our country, I know things may seem overwhelming. Well, this ANGLE is for you. For some perspective, we need to step back a little bit. Now for most of the time, think about this. since Reagan left office, the bipartisan establishment in Washington has been obsessed with five really bad ideas. Number one, they believe that we have a labor shortage here in the United States. So, they want the borders as wide open as possible. Now, even now, as the border is buckling under a surge of illegals. The Biden Administration's biggest concern isn't protecting Americans. It's facilitating more mass migration.",

And so, for decades, voters who disagreed with those policies, they really didn't have anyone speaking for them. They had very few advocates. After eight years, George W. Bush with his endless wars, flat wages and non-stop catch and release at the border, a lot of us on the Right decided we had to go in a different direction, even we like President Bush personally. At first, we were known as the tea party and our movement grew, more people started using the term populist as well. And after we coalesced around Donald Trump, we had a leader who took our ideas into the White House. In less than a decade, we had beaten the leadership of both parties. It's one of the most successful political movements in American history. They'll take you by surprise, the Empire struck back. They impeach President Trump not once, but twice. They censored us online and drove many into hiding into the canceled culture. They called us fascists and racists and still do. They even changed the voting rules in some states. And then they politicize the pandemic in their pursuit of power. A few months ago, I think they thought that they were on the verge of crushing us for good. But their landslide, it never happened. The GOP gained seats in the House and in state legislatures. We gained support with Hispanic Hispanics and African American working-class voters as well. For the establishment press, who've never been honest about our movement, CPAC, of course, was just an excuse to bring out their old fearmongering and Trump hatred. But if you saw any of it, you know how upbeat about the future pretty much everyone who was speaking there was. President Trump was defiant. And he vowed to support strong populist candidates in 2022. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is showing how our principles can work in a dynamic state like Florida was another star.",

It's funny because the same forces don't fear the CCP, they see China as their business partner. What they fear though is seeing power go into the hands of the middle class, hardworking Americans who know their rights and who refuse to be cheated or manipulated and who insist on fair wages for their work. This explains why they're doing everything possible to sow hatred and division against and between us. But we should relish this fight. Democrats are exposing themselves as frauds across the board. Governors Cuomo in New York, Newsom in California, Pritzker in Illinois and Whitmer in Michigan, love locking down everyone except criminals and illegal immigrants, and a bully like Cuomo. Well, he actually believed he deserved his good press. But now even the Democrats are abandoning him. Newsom is scrambling to try to get schools to reopen in a state only because he's facing a recall. 41 years ago, the conservatives led by Ronald Reagan took over the White House and save this country from an era of decline and despair. This generation of conservatives now has the organization and policies that can do the same again. Our ideas are already making life better for millions in the Red states. But we're not going to stop there. This must be a 50-state movement devoted to uplifting the whole country. And we're not going to stop until our mission is complete. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, you have become as well a popular target of the Left. They're trying to decouple any Republican who has a connection to the base, and the intellectual chops to actually make a coherent argument across the board.",

And for them, it's about power, they want to hold on to power they want to expand power, and when they have their power, they want to ram through their socialist vision for this country. I was listening to your opening monologue, and I think it is exactly right. You look at the Left, and far too many in the Republican party also. And for a long time, they have been on board with, essentially what I'd call America last, standing with our enemies, standing with the Chinese Communist government, standing with unlimited open borders, and standing against the working men and women. And I think the most significant political change of the last decade has been that the heart and soul of the Republican Party, we are a working-class party now, we are a blue-collar party. That's what we should have been and that's what we are. And if we're standing with the men and women who want to work. Right now, look at the Democratic Party, they want to close your businesses, they want your kids to stay home, they closed the schools, open borders, abolish the police, make your life less safe, your kids less safe, your family less safe. They side with our enemies, and they abandon our friends. It's all completely backwards. But the good news is also what you just said, they're revealing exactly who they are. What does it say the governor of New York and the governor of California are both in freefall, their ideas don't work? And we're going to sadly going to see that play out more and more over the next two years. I think that's going to lead us to a very good 2022 and a very good 2024.",

And the reason we have little boys and little girls being brought in by human traffickers is because of Obama's amnesty program that served as a magnet to begin with. But when the DHS secretary says there isn't a crisis at the border, from his perspective, he believes that because there's an old joke that the term illegal alien is no longer politically correct. The new term is undocumented Democrat. From his perspective, every person coming here illegally is another perspective voter and the Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class men and women, the millions of people who are out of jobs, who are seeing their wages pulled down, who are competing to provide for their families with people coming illegally. That's not who the Democratic Party represents anymore. They don't represent unions anymore. They don't represent construction workers or truck drivers or working men and women anymore.

When we look at this, is not only what you were talking about at the border, but it's our policy in terms of opening schools, it's our policies in terms of China. We're shipping jobs to China, instead of shipping them to Texas, and Ohio and Pennsylvania. We're energy dominant, and yet we're wanting to move that over to China and give them the advantage.

And what's interesting Laura, in that comment there, in that video you just played, it reminded me of Benazir Bhutto, because I remember being so shocked as a journalist on the ground in Pakistan, to discover that around 80 percent of Pakistani women couldn't read or write. They were illiterate. And guess who was the leader of Pakistan at the time? Yes, Benazir Bhutto, a woman. So, just because you have a woman appointed to a position of power doesn't necessarily mean anything. It's actions that count, right, real actions.

This is the tip of the iceberg. I honestly believe he has been corrupt since day one, and I did point that out in our debate in 2014. But this goes back a long time. When he was attorney general, he signed off on a settlement that let off the hook a sexual predator in the New York state assembly, Sheldon Silver's top aide, accused of sexual assault by many, many women. It was hush money that the governor signed off on. Then he becomes governor, and he does all these pay-to-play deals, like this Buffalo Billion, which was not the way to rebuild a beautiful city like Buffalo. It was all pay-to-play. It was all corruption. You had scandals upon scandals upon scandals. The Moreland Commission, which, believe it or not, in New York was set up as the anticorruption commission. And only in New York could the anti-corruption commission have been corrupted, and it was. And once the breadcrumbs started leading to Cuomo and his office, he shut it down unilaterally.

With the pace of destructive change happening to our country, I know things may seem overwhelming. Well, this ANGLE is for you. For some perspective, we need to step back a little bit. Now for most of the time, think about this. since Reagan left office, the bipartisan establishment in Washington has been obsessed with five really bad ideas. Number one, they believe that we have a labor shortage here in the United States. So, they want the borders as wide open as possible. Now, even now, as the border is buckling under a surge of illegals. The Biden Administration's biggest concern isn't protecting Americans. It's facilitating more mass migration."

      "utterance": "Here's the thing. All of these policies, of course, a total disaster for most Americans, but they were very popular with the donors who funded both parties. And so, for decades, voters who disagreed with those policies, they really didn't have anyone speaking for them. They had very few advocates. After eight years, George W. Bush with his endless wars, flat wages and non-stop catch and release at the border, a lot of us on the Right decided we had to go in a different direction, even we like President Bush personally. At first, we were known as the tea party and our movement grew, more people started using the term populist as well. And after we coalesced around Donald Trump, we had a leader who took our ideas into the White House. In less than a decade, we had beaten the leadership of both parties. It's one of the most successful political movements in American history. They'll take you by surprise, the Empire struck back. They impeach President Trump not once, but twice. They censored us online and drove many into hiding into the canceled culture. They called us fascists and racists and still do. They even changed the voting rules in some states. And then they politicize the pandemic in their pursuit of power. A few months ago, I think they thought that they were on the verge of crushing us for good. But their landslide, it never happened. The GOP gained seats in the House and in state legislatures. We gained support with Hispanic Hispanics and African American working-class voters as well. For the establishment press, who've never been honest about our movement, CPAC, of course, was just an excuse to bring out their old fearmongering and Trump hatred. But if you saw any of it, you know how upbeat about the future pretty much everyone who was speaking there was. President Trump was defiant. And he vowed to support strong populist candidates in 2022. And Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is showing how our principles can work in a dynamic state like Florida was another star."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "You know, the establishment is going to try to kneecap him politically, they already kind of have tried, just like they did with President Trump. They fear DeSantis. It's funny because the same forces don't fear the CCP, they see China as their business partner. What they fear though is seeing power go into the hands of the middle class, hardworking Americans who know their rights and who refuse to be cheated or manipulated and who insist on fair wages for their work. This explains why they're doing everything possible to sow hatred and division against and between us. But we should relish this fight. Democrats are exposing themselves as frauds across the board. Governors Cuomo in New York, Newsom in California, Pritzker in Illinois and Whitmer in Michigan, love locking down everyone except criminals and illegal immigrants, and a bully like Cuomo. Well, he actually believed he deserved his good press. But now even the Democrats are abandoning him. Newsom is scrambling to try to get schools to reopen in a state only because he's facing a recall. 41 years ago, the conservatives led by Ronald Reagan took over the White House and save this country from an era of decline and despair. This generation of conservatives now has the organization and policies that can do the same again. Our ideas are already making life better for millions in the Red states. But we're not going to stop there. This must be a 50-state movement devoted to uplifting the whole country. And we're not going to stop until our mission is complete. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, you have become as well a popular target of the Left. They're trying to decouple any Republican who has a connection to the base, and the intellectual chops to actually make a coherent argument across the board."

And for them, it's about power, they want to hold on to power they want to expand power, and when they have their power, they want to ram through their socialist vision for this country. I was listening to your opening monologue, and I think it is exactly right. You look at the Left, and far too many in the Republican party also. And for a long time, they have been on board with, essentially what I'd call America last, standing with our enemies, standing with the Chinese Communist government, standing with unlimited open borders, and standing against the working men and women. And I think the most significant political change of the last decade has been that the heart and soul of the Republican Party, we are a working-class party now, we are a blue-collar party. That's what we should have been and that's what we are. And if we're standing with the men and women who want to work. Right now, look at the Democratic Party, they want to close your businesses, they want your kids to stay home, they closed the schools, open borders, abolish the police, make your life less safe, your kids less safe, your family less safe. They side with our enemies, and they abandon our friends. It's all completely backwards. But the good news is also what you just said, they're revealing exactly who they are. What does it say the governor of New York and the governor of California are both in freefall, their ideas don't work? And we're going to sadly going to see that play out more and more over the next two years. I think that's going to lead us to a very good 2022 and a very good 2024."

This hodgepodge of a few Rust Belt states and turn around three times and hope you're going to win the majority. It's just - I think it's got to be much broader.

Well, those cages are being expanded, they're being reopened now that Biden's running them, they're simply safe humanitarian locations. Of course, Obama built the cages. And the reason we have little boys and little girls being brought in by human traffickers is because of Obama's amnesty program that served as a magnet to begin with. But when the DHS secretary says there isn't a crisis at the border, from his perspective, he believes that because there's an old joke that the term illegal alien is no longer politically correct. The new term is undocumented Democrat. From his perspective, every person coming here illegally is another perspective voter and the Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class men and women, the millions of people who are out of jobs, who are seeing their wages pulled down, who are competing to provide for their families with people coming illegally. That's not who the Democratic Party represents anymore. They don't represent unions anymore. They don't represent construction workers or truck drivers or working men and women anymore. The Democratic Party today is the party of wealthy elites on both coasts, it's the party of big tech and big business. It's the party of universities, and from their perspective, the more cheap labor that flows in particularly if they vote Democrat, the better."

But when Jimmy Carter boycotted the Olympics, I didn't think it was a very good policy. I think hurting American athletes is a policy of weakness. But the answer we shouldn't do is to do what a lot - all the democrats and a lot of Republicans will want to do, which is go over there and kiss Xi's behind.

And if you've watched President Biden speak on TV lately, one thing is clear. He's not in complete control. So, who is? Well, the Hill is reporting that Senate Republicans are attacking White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, as the guy behind the curtain and Prime Minister Klain, they're calling him. The GOP blames Klain for Biden's refusal to negotiate the price of his $1.9 trillion COVID relief package. Here with me now is Mark Meadows, former White House Chief of Staff to President Trump. Mark, this was obviously never a concern in the Trump administration that you were running things, was it? Is this even plausible? could Klain be running the show on big decisions for Biden?"

In fact, if anything, moderate Joe has gone into hiding, because we're seeing progressive Joe, we're seeing a $1.9 trillion COVID package that is a progressive wish list. And so, somebody is pulling the strings, whether it's Chief of Staff Ron Klain, or someone else there. The results are horrifying, Laura. When we look at this, is not only what you were talking about at the border, but it's our policy in terms of opening schools, it's our policies in terms of China. We're shipping jobs to China, instead of shipping them to Texas, and Ohio and Pennsylvania. We're energy dominant, and yet we're wanting to move that over to China and give them the advantage. So, it's time that somebody gets control. And hopefully it's somewhat different than Ron Klain and the others in the White House right now."

What do we find from the Biden administration, they're running back into the W.H.O., which basically the World Health Organization who apologizes for actually being the front man for the Chinese government? So, we've got to hold them accountable. And I think at this point to give them a win for the 2022 Olympics is not something we should be doing."

Strong, independent women who think for themselves. And if we weren't going to be, kept down by men all these years, we're certainly not going to be kept down by the politics of division and hatred. And what's interesting Laura, in that comment there, in that video you just played, it reminded me of Benazir Bhutto, because I remember being so shocked as a journalist on the ground in Pakistan, to discover that around 80 percent of Pakistani women couldn't read or write. They were illiterate. And guess who was the leader of Pakistan at the time? Yes, Benazir Bhutto, a woman. So, just because you have a woman appointed to a position of power doesn't necessarily mean anything. It's actions that count, right, real actions. And you know that as well as I do, and I'm really glad that you're covering this topic, because, I have a lot of feelings about it as a journalist and as a professional. But obviously, I'm a white woman. So, it's also personal. And these people aren't going to break my will. They're not going to force me into hatred and prejudice. And we all know that united we stand and divided we fall, right? It's very, very simple. that's been true since the beginning of time. And as you know, many people know, I was gang raped and sodomized and beaten almost to death by a gang, a mob of two to 300 men in Egypt many years ago when I was working, and they couldn't break my will. And I can tell you, these people, they can't break my will. And it's not just me. I mean, I really am speaking on behalf of all women, women of all races, and especially young women. I want them to know, because they haven't been around long enough like you and I, right. They haven't had enough experience to know how they're being bullied and intimidated into self- censorship.

Rob, I'm not going to condemn Andrew Cuomo because of accusations. I don't know what happened when, and the photo about the cheeks, I don't know.

But that doesn't mean it's not to be had for him. We should let justice play out, the investigations play out. But the deck of cards are really starting to fall on Andrew Cuomo. This is the tip of the iceberg. I honestly believe he has been corrupt since day one, and I did point that out in our debate in 2014. But this goes back a long time. When he was attorney general, he signed off on a settlement that let off the hook a sexual predator in the New York state assembly, Sheldon Silver's top aide, accused of sexual assault by many, many women. It was hush money that the governor signed off on. Then he becomes governor, and he does all these pay-to-play deals, like this Buffalo Billion, which was not the way to rebuild a beautiful city like Buffalo. It was all pay-to-play. It was all corruption. You had scandals upon scandals upon scandals. The Moreland Commission, which, believe it or not, in New York was set up as the anticorruption commission. And only in New York could the anti-corruption commission have been corrupted, and it was. And once the breadcrumbs started leading to Cuomo and his office, he shut it down unilaterally. So this is well-known in New York. Unfortunately, there's been way too many enablers, including the press, including Democrats and Republicans who have played footsie with him --"

There's a lot of political nepotism, especially in New York, but everywhere, frankly. You won Westchester County with a very commonsense, practical campaign. Are you going to perhaps run again? Will you challenge this Democrat stranglehold on the state again?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ASTORINO",
      "utterance": "I think what you and Senator Cruz were talking about earlier is so important. We have to have a 50-state strategy in America right now with the Republican Party. We should do what I did in Westchester, which is a two-to-one Democratic county, and I won it twice because I did talk to everyone. I did go to African-American neighborhoods. I did walk through Hispanic communities and tell what we need to do. Education choice we should be talking about as schools are locked down in New York. Businesses, reducing taxes. I was just down in Florida recently. I get off the plane, it's like welcome to adulthood. I come back, and the National Guard greets me, and contact tracers calling me every day, are you home? This is what's happening. And that's why people are fleeing the state. But I do think he can be beaten, or obviously if he has to step down, we can't replace him with someone who smiles as a lefty and does the same thing. So I do think we need to be bold, and I do think the Republicans can win it."

And remember, it's the 11,000 senior citizens who are lost during COVID as a result of these policies toward the senior care centers and sending COVID patients back there. That is the real huge story. We will see how the other stuff plays out. And up next, \"Freestylin' Biden\" gets rescued by his visiting angel.

And there was an interview with Univision, you may not have seen this, where Biden was asked if he could confirm whether his administration was opening tent cities for immigrant kids along the border. He needed some assistance even with that answer."

      "utterance": "No. In fact, I interviewed a number of Border Patrol officials, and they had diapers and formula. They spent their own money to buy children's clothing and brought clothing from their own homes to give to these kids. So that is a slander on our Border Patrol. I don't like that at all. We personally witnessed it. Ray, the Golden Globes aired last night, but the bicoastal part live, part virtual event didn't work? I don't think."

      "utterance": "Laura, we've got to keep those celebrities safe. The audience was safely at home as well, watching something else. There was a 60 percent decline in ratings from last year's Golden Globes, and it's no wonder since aside from \"The Crown\" or \"Mandalorian,\" most people saw none of these films and they didn't know who these actors were awkwardly reacting from home. And I've got to tell you, nothing screams elitism like getting first responders to become COVID manikins so the celebs can enjoy their couches in the hills of Hollywood."

As COVID cases and the deaths plummet, the health officials who have dominated your lives see their influence waning, maybe fewer television appearances. Could they just be getting lonely if COVID gets away? They're not ready to give it up just yet. Victor Davis Hanson is here next on the craven messaging games being played by Fauci and friends."

But instead of celebrating, even if cautiously, the Biden administration and the medical cartel supporting it, are trying to psychologically break your spirit. How else can you explain statements from Biden's CDC director like this?"

      "speaker": "DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL",
      "utterance": "I remain deeply concerned about the potential shift in the trajectory of the pandemic. The lead to CDC data continue to suggest that recent declines in cases have leveled off.

There can never be another bit of virus anywhere in the world before we get our freedom back if these people have their way. Your reaction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "I'm reminded of General George S. Patton admonition that Americans should never be captive of their fears. We can think of all sorts of bad things, but you're right, the science shows we've had a dramatic increase in vaccinations. We're going to be up to 80 million. We probably have 100 million people that haven't been tested, but modeled that they do have antibodies. We have 30 million proven cases. We're get closer and closer. And these are scientists, so they have an obligation to tell us that, because were on pretty thin ice, Laura. We've had public officials who have been hypocritical about the application of the quarantine. We've had Dr. Fauci's noble lie theory that he sort of lied about the utility of masks so we wouldn't go out and drain the supply of them, or on herd immunity so we wouldn't let down our guard. Any time you have the hypocrisies and lies, you destroy the credibility. If I was a cynic, I would say that we have a lot of functionaries and bureaucrats that have had a moment of enormous publicity and influence. And when the virus wanes, they're not going to have that opportunity. Maybe they rue that. Finally, the pessimist, Laura, is always right, because if you forecast the disaster, then it doesn't happen, he said it only didn't happen because people made the adjustments I warned about. And if it does happen, he says I told you so. Whereas the optimist, if it does happen, they say you are a murderer. And if it doesn't, they say, it didn't happen only because of my warnings. So it's a lose-lose situation for optimists, and that's why we have very few bureaucrats that want to be optimistic."

      "utterance": "Absolutely, but there's always going to be a reason to take our freedom away, whether it's climate change or racism or another health emergency. There's always a reason to have a lockdown in some way, shape, or form. But I wanted to ask you about what I started the show with in part, I asked Ted Cruz this. Given China's role in not being transparent with the virus, given everything they've done, genocide, trade, all of it, should we be sending our delegations to the Beijing Games next year for the Winter Games, Victor?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "I don't know if I'm qualified to answer that, but personally I would say no. But I think we are going to do it, and I'm a cynic here again, Laura, because so many of our elites are compromised with business academic investment interest with China, including Hunter Biden and the Biden family. So I don't want to be cynical, but I don't know that we're going to be able to stop it. There is going to be enormous pressure from Europe, and China ha their tentacles over so many governments through financial joint ventures, et cetera. It's just a matter of truth, and we should face it."

This convention over the weekend was more like a coven."
