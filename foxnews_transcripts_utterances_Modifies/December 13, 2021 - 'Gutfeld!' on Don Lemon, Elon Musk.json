The kind of incivility you see at school board meetings are over mask. I wonder who he could be talking about? Yes, all those car accidents must be caused by angry parents or conservatives upset over attacks on their civil liberties. That's a biggest stretch since Dana Perino tried to open a car door. But thank God for some experts and their mysterious data. That evidence is harder to find that a CNN viewer. So I guess the traffic fatalities couldn't have anything to do with the reduction of police on the streets or less enforcement of traffic infractions. I mean, just thinking that would make you as racist as those guys who beat up Jussie Smollett. Look, I was someone who drove during the pandemic. Actually, I was being driven. And I got to say Kilmeade looks great from behind. But one thing was obvious. There were fewer cars on the road. And like Brian Stelter with an unsupervised half gallon of mint chocolate chip, people on the road took advantage of it. It had zilch to do with civility and everything to do with opportunity. Traffic laws became polite suggestions, but expecting Lemon to understand incentives and disincentives is like expecting Tyrus to fit into my leather chaps. It's not happening without a lot of olive oil.",

And yes, it's the guns behind the violence because the pandemic has been able to cause guns to get up on their tiny little gun feet and pull their own triggers with their tiny little gun hands. I call it the Alec Baldwin effect. Sorry. As red state points out no changes to gun laws occurred during this timeframe. And the overwhelming majority of gun crimes are committed with illegally obtained weapons. So the real reason for the crime wave rests on the shoulders of jackasses like Lemon. He like his putrid peers in the media played down the crime wave as it emerged and even made fun of the people who were sounding the alarm, which allowed the wave to grow unfettered.

You should have said Chris Wallace sticks out like my belly when I do my bathrobe after dinner. And Fox is radicalized. Only weightwatchers could radicalize you, Brian. The corpulent Crump sucker also seemed to avoid Chris Cuomo scheme to smear our very own Janice Dean. Allegedly calling her that Fox weather bitch in texts after she criticized Chris's brother for transferring COVID patients to nursing homes. So we referred to Janice as that weather bitch. How stupid is that? Everyone knows that's Al Roker's nickname. When asked how she felt about being called that Janice said, hey, at least it's not Fredo. But the fact is, the media can't accurately report on anything, whether it's perversions or fatality, since they're always implicated in them. While deaths spiked, they bury them because they championed policies and ideas that contributed to that. They lauded to funding the police and then they tried to camouflage it by saying it's really just a funding shift. It's like planting a bush in front of a septic tank, they tried to hide the consequences of their destructive beliefs. They supported no cash bail while champing the shutdowns turning the city streets into a John Wick sequel minus the freedom. But as long as Lemon could have a nice evening meal outside, none of the consequences exists. You should never believe the murder rate if a CNN anchor just ate a good sirloin. Now we have record high murder rates in major cities run by liberal mayors. We have soaring traffic accidents. We have an explosion in hate crimes which forces lemon to switch from lying to blaming something vague and unprovable. But hey, it's the closest to honest that he's been in years.",

So, basically, it's not like a strip club. I should really put more effort into these analogies. A mortgage company organized the dash for cash event at a local hockey game, which saw teachers trying to grab as much money as possible in under five minutes -- I've been there. One of the organizers called it awesome and said teachers deserve whatever the heck they get. Still others on Twitter, including teachers, union boss, Randi Weingarten, are calling the event out saying it's demeaning, and teachers shouldn't have to dash for dollars for classroom supplies. Of course, it was a volunteer event. So, no one was forced to do anything like you know, joining a corrupt teachers union that cares more about preserving power than educating kids.

      "speaker": "LEMON",
      "utterance": "Thirty-eight thousand six hundred eighty deaths on U.S. roads last year, the most fatality since 2007. And that's even with pandemic precautions drastically reducing the number of drivers on the road. So what gives? Well, some experts are saying that this is due to an overall lack of civility in our society, a lack of civility that we've seen in school board meetings over mask mandates and on airplanes."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

The kind of incivility you see at school board meetings are over mask. I wonder who he could be talking about? Yes, all those car accidents must be caused by angry parents or conservatives upset over attacks on their civil liberties. That's a biggest stretch since Dana Perino tried to open a car door. But thank God for some experts and their mysterious data. That evidence is harder to find that a CNN viewer. So I guess the traffic fatalities couldn't have anything to do with the reduction of police on the streets or less enforcement of traffic infractions. I mean, just thinking that would make you as racist as those guys who beat up Jussie Smollett. Look, I was someone who drove during the pandemic. Actually, I was being driven. And I got to say Kilmeade looks great from behind. But one thing was obvious. There were fewer cars on the road. And like Brian Stelter with an unsupervised half gallon of mint chocolate chip, people on the road took advantage of it. It had zilch to do with civility and everything to do with opportunity. Traffic laws became polite suggestions, but expecting Lemon to understand incentives and disincentives is like expecting Tyrus to fit into my leather chaps. It's not happening without a lot of olive oil."

The murder rate in some cities breaking records. Experts say that stress from the COVID pandemic definitely playing a role here. But the major factor? Guns."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Kat drunk dialing makes less wrong calls. Yes, it's the pandemic causing the crime because when you're forced to wear a mask, you might as well rob somebody at gunpoint, right? And yes, it's the guns behind the violence because the pandemic has been able to cause guns to get up on their tiny little gun feet and pull their own triggers with their tiny little gun hands. I call it the Alec Baldwin effect. Sorry. As red state points out no changes to gun laws occurred during this timeframe. And the overwhelming majority of gun crimes are committed with illegally obtained weapons. So the real reason for the crime wave rests on the shoulders of jackasses like Lemon. He like his putrid peers in the media played down the crime wave as it emerged and even made fun of the people who were sounding the alarm, which allowed the wave to grow unfettered. So do we really have to play that tape again, Greg? Yes, we really have to play that tape again. Greg."

The roster has more deviants than Jeffrey Epstein's black book. Anyway, I tell Chris Wallace that maybe this is not the best time to go to CNN. Sorry. It's like being on the Patriots and asking to be traded to the Jets. But apparently he's going to their streaming platform. Let's hope streaming means what I think it means.

You should have said Chris Wallace sticks out like my belly when I do my bathrobe after dinner. And Fox is radicalized. Only weightwatchers could radicalize you, Brian. The corpulent Crump sucker also seemed to avoid Chris Cuomo scheme to smear our very own Janice Dean. Allegedly calling her that Fox weather bitch in texts after she criticized Chris's brother for transferring COVID patients to nursing homes. So we referred to Janice as that weather bitch. How stupid is that? Everyone knows that's Al Roker's nickname. When asked how she felt about being called that Janice said, hey, at least it's not Fredo. But the fact is, the media can't accurately report on anything, whether it's perversions or fatality, since they're always implicated in them. While deaths spiked, they bury them because they championed policies and ideas that contributed to that. They lauded to funding the police and then they tried to camouflage it by saying it's really just a funding shift. It's like planting a bush in front of a septic tank, they tried to hide the consequences of their destructive beliefs. They supported no cash bail while champing the shutdowns turning the city streets into a John Wick sequel minus the freedom. But as long as Lemon could have a nice evening meal outside, none of the consequences exists. You should never believe the murder rate if a CNN anchor just ate a good sirloin. Now we have record high murder rates in major cities run by liberal mayors. We have soaring traffic accidents. We have an explosion in hate crimes which forces lemon to switch from lying to blaming something vague and unprovable. But hey, it's the closest to honest that he's been in years."

So, basically, it's not like a strip club. I should really put more effort into these analogies. A mortgage company organized the dash for cash event at a local hockey game, which saw teachers trying to grab as much money as possible in under five minutes -- I've been there. One of the organizers called it awesome and said teachers deserve whatever the heck they get. Still others on Twitter, including teachers, union boss, Randi Weingarten, are calling the event out saying it's demeaning, and teachers shouldn't have to dash for dollars for classroom supplies. Of course, it was a volunteer event. So, no one was forced to do anything like you know, joining a corrupt teachers union that cares more about preserving power than educating kids.
