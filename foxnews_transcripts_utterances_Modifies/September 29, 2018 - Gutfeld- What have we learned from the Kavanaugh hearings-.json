It's that humor that - and of course all these despots in the world - in the room who got it just proving that of course the press has less of a sense of humor than despots around the world. But the other thing is that basically, the attack on Donald Trump right now is that he's not perfect. That's what upsets them. So when he goes and he talks - and meets with Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-il, the complaint is you haven't gotten peace fast enough. Absolutely, the guy can't win.

They signed a revised trade agreement with South Korea, opened trade talks with Japan. Of course going after China who no president before in 25 years has really gone after for their unfair trade practices. They said, you know. he could never have peace in certain areas, guess what?

Will an FBI investigation give us more answers? I don't know. But I believe that they believe their stories. So here's what I do know, political tribalism now includes public acts of personal destruction. it is ghoulish. The Democrats could have avoided this show trial by acting immediately when they first got the letter instead of sitting on it which led to a twisted circus that ruined reputations, humiliated victims and their families. The lesson in politics, collateral damage is now totally acceptable. Who cares if you destroy a family or two, you still blocked that seat, good for you. We looked hard to find a group of people more civil than the hearings. Here's what we found. Maybe it is not so bad, but maybe Michael Moore was right after all. Time to move to Canada.

And all we're seeing even after today when the deal was made basically we're going to pass him through, rightfully so, because we don't have enough evidence to say otherwise, and we're going to still do an FBI investigation. So the right thing to do for the Democrats is a show of good faith for meeting them meeting them halfway was to vote yes. We all agree we're going to vote him through and then we're going to investigate it. That would have been a message to the American people like these guys get it, but no, that's not what they really want. Because it is not about that. It is the Civil War in the Senate that we have to deal with. It has nothing to do with whether this woman was assaulted or not. That's why they won't commit to one side or the other. We believe both people but I have to say no. I believe both, but I have to say yes.

      "utterance": "Have you seen the movie \"Snowpiercer?\" All right, speaking of, we do have something. It's a dangerous fad when selfies go bad. That's next. Should we rescue people who put themselves in danger taking Instagram selfies? Depends. Are they liberals? That red meat joke courtesy of the red meat joke board. The quest for extreme Instagram photos has led to a rise in rescues, at least in Southern California, wherever that is. Search-and-rescue teams with the LA County Sheriff's Department conducted 681 missions last year, up 40% from five years ago. They say many of their missions happen where cliff jumping is a popular weekend - poor cliff. Anyway, with people trying to capture the stunts for social media. Personally, I think human cliff jumping is boring. It's why I only hang out with cliff jumping goats. One of the goats also edited that video by the way. A lot of good rocking music there. Charles, the county is spending thousands of dollars and hour, an hour, on those rescues. Should they? I think they have to, right?"

I know that if you get, you know, if you get stuck out in the wilderness or you get stuck, you know, canoeing down rapids and they have to come in and get you, you can get a bill for it. They should get a bill for it."

If people want to take these pictures, take them, most of the time, not all the time but in a lot of places they are being sent the bills anyway for negligence when they are getting rescued in situations like this. The advice I would have for people who want to jump off the cliffs and take pictures, go to Utah. In Utah, recently, they came out with this thing where you could buy for $20.00 to $30.00 somewhere around there, get rescued free card. If you plan on doing things like this, you buy your card, everybody pitches in and then the people who wind up having to get rescued don't have to pay the bills."

      "utterance": "Yes, I take those because I'm supposed to put things about my life. So you see I lift weights and sit on here. That's all you get. I think we should - I think the rescue teams who are great men and women in this country, they should have a little bit of fun with this. I think your rescuing should be based on the likes they get. So what you do is when the dude is hanging from the cliff, the rescue guy will come down, right next to him, where he could possibly save him, far enough away where he can't reach, and take a picture of him and be like you need 200 likes for this rescue to go down."
