If you don't fit into the Democrats assumption of what a black person should be and what Joe Biden decides who a black person should be because you remember, it was just it was just a few maybe a month ago he decided, he was the one who decided who was black and who wasn't. The fact is that Dems just assumes they don't have to do squat for blacks because they got them in the back pocket. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is actively competing for those votes, you know, he tried to get the lowest unemployment in modern history, he helped out historical black colleges, he went for prison reform. He shows that he's got he believes in competing for that vote, also the difference between Republicans and Democrats, Republicans never denied Trump's flaws. They knew that he could be crude, rude, and even offensive. But the Democrats they are in full denial of a substantial structural flaw. Their candidate may be losing his mind.  And it's not even that. It's not funny. It's kind of sad because, you know, it would be OK if you could laugh about it. But this guy, he's not going to be the nominee, Juan, and you know it.

Good job, Joe. I think it's really important to pit Latino voters against African American voters. That was really, really important and I hope every single voter regardless of race or party or geographic location, I hope they look at both candidates, both of the mainstream candidates very skeptically.  And remember that Joe Biden was the one who talked of his relationship with segregationists. He was the one who authored bills with Strom Thurmond when they were both on the Senate judiciary committee.  He was the ranking member while Strom Thurmond was the chairman and they authored that 1986 anti-drug abuse bill that created those sensing disparities that put an entire generation of black men in prison because they got a lot more time for doing crack than white offenders did for doing cocaine, which essentially it's the exact same drug. He also authored the 1994 crime bill. But it wasn't just Strom Thurmond. James Eastland. There were other members of the Senate who are avowed segregationists and Joe Biden talked up his relationship with all of them.  He's got a lot of problems and that's why Charlamagne Tha God really took a harsher tone with Joe Biden than many other favorable leftists have in media because he wants some answers to those questions.   And that's when Joe Biden made another gaffe that Greg was talking about when he said if you vote for Trump, you are not black. That is incredibly offensive.

And to Kennedy's point, I mean, it's always been a challenge to understand what Joe Biden said. Now you add the variable of what did he mean? Even if he has a moment of lucidity and you understand exactly what he said, he is a recidivist when it comes to saying racially curious things. Remember what he said, Juan, about -- about President Obama, that he was the first mainstream candidate that is clean and articulate. I mean, what does that mean? He says you're not black if you're not going to vote for him. Well, that's news to Tim Scott. He's been black his entire life. So, he has a career offender as it relates to racially curious comments.

Juan, remember I said from the beginning that as we get closer to fall, it is going to tighten up and guess what, we are closer to fall so it's tightening up because people start paying a little more attention. And the other thing is that the Trump campaign had maintained that during the coronavirus it was difficult for them to pay a lot of attention to defining Joe Biden. They were trying to figure out what would work. And I think they've alighted upon the thing that is working best which is to suggest that he would be pull this bait and switch when it comes to saying that he would be very moderate but actually be very progressive. And as the Trump campaign says, a tool for the left. I do want to mention something on timing though. And if the Trump campaign wants these numbers to tighten even more, I think they should think about something like this. Yesterday when Joe Biden said those comments that he then apologize for, and then in a video and then he tweeted about because he was having to clean it up, I think the best thing if you are the Trump campaign, if you're the president, stand back. Don't -- just let the media cover that story for the day.   When the president suggested that Joe Biden did not have religion, that he didn't believe in his faith and that he wanted to hurt God, immediately that's the story. So, you -- everyone is going to go and cover that as well. The Joe Biden comments about his thinking about blacks and how they think would have been the main story today.  So, I would just say that if they want those numbers to tighten, even make it a little closer, let Joe Biden have some time in the sun.",

If you don't fit into the Democrats assumption of what a black person should be and what Joe Biden decides who a black person should be because you remember, it was just it was just a few maybe a month ago he decided, he was the one who decided who was black and who wasn't. The fact is that Dems just assumes they don't have to do squat for blacks because they got them in the back pocket. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is actively competing for those votes, you know, he tried to get the lowest unemployment in modern history, he helped out historical black colleges, he went for prison reform. He shows that he's got he believes in competing for that vote, also the difference between Republicans and Democrats, Republicans never denied Trump's flaws. They knew that he could be crude, rude, and even offensive. But the Democrats they are in full denial of a substantial structural flaw. Their candidate may be losing his mind. And it's not even that. It's not funny. It's kind of sad because, you know, it would be OK if you could laugh about it. But this guy, he's not going to be the nominee, Juan, and you know it.

Good job, Joe. I think it's really important to pit Latino voters against African American voters. That was really, really important and I hope every single voter regardless of race or party or geographic location, I hope they look at both candidates, both of the mainstream candidates very skeptically. And remember that Joe Biden was the one who talked of his relationship with segregationists. He was the one who authored bills with Strom Thurmond when they were both on the Senate judiciary committee. He was the ranking member while Strom Thurmond was the chairman and they authored that 1986 anti-drug abuse bill that created those sensing disparities that put an entire generation of black men in prison because they got a lot more time for doing crack than white offenders did for doing cocaine, which essentially it's the exact same drug. He also authored the 1994 crime bill. But it wasn't just Strom Thurmond. James Eastland. There were other members of the Senate who are avowed segregationists and Joe Biden talked up his relationship with all of them. He's got a lot of problems and that's why Charlamagne Tha God really took a harsher tone with Joe Biden than many other favorable leftists have in media because he wants some answers to those questions. And that's when Joe Biden made another gaffe that Greg was talking about when he said if you vote for Trump, you are not black. That is incredibly offensive. And it is toxic pandering that is totally unnecessary given where we are at this point in our modern political history."

I think what Republicans ought to be talking about -- what Republicans ought to be talking about is contrasting all of the aspects of the American family and whether you're better off the last four years than you were under Biden and Obama. And to Kennedy's point, I mean, it's always been a challenge to understand what Joe Biden said. Now you add the variable of what did he mean? Even if he has a moment of lucidity and you understand exactly what he said, he is a recidivist when it comes to saying racially curious things. Remember what he said, Juan, about -- about President Obama, that he was the first mainstream candidate that is clean and articulate. I mean, what does that mean? He says you're not black if you're not going to vote for him. Well, that's news to Tim Scott. He's been black his entire life. So, he has a career offender as it relates to racially curious comments.

      "utterance": "Well, first, I would like to welcome Trey Gowdy to The Five. I mean, that was a fantastic debut of a segment. I think a couple of things. Juan, remember I said from the beginning that as we get closer to fall, it is going to tighten up and guess what, we are closer to fall so it's tightening up because people start paying a little more attention. And the other thing is that the Trump campaign had maintained that during the coronavirus it was difficult for them to pay a lot of attention to defining Joe Biden. They were trying to figure out what would work. And I think they've alighted upon the thing that is working best which is to suggest that he would be pull this bait and switch when it comes to saying that he would be very moderate but actually be very progressive. And as the Trump campaign says, a tool for the left. I do want to mention something on timing though. And if the Trump campaign wants these numbers to tighten even more, I think they should think about something like this. Yesterday when Joe Biden said those comments that he then apologize for, and then in a video and then he tweeted about because he was having to clean it up, I think the best thing if you are the Trump campaign, if you're the president, stand back. Don't -- just let the media cover that story for the day. When the president suggested that Joe Biden did not have religion, that he didn't believe in his faith and that he wanted to hurt God, immediately that's the story. So, you -- everyone is going to go and cover that as well. The Joe Biden comments about his thinking about blacks and how they think would have been the main story today. So, I would just say that if they want those numbers to tighten, even make it a little closer, let Joe Biden have some time in the sun."

And then when the public, when the public suddenly realizes that only they can protect themselves, that it falls on them because the police is being marginalized, then you're going to go after their guns. They are basically putting -- they're putting the squeeze on the American public who are now beginning to think that this is not going to end in a very good place.

And in addition to the political peril, it kind of underscores the narrative of Republicans that you're going to use the justice system as a weapon against your political enemies.

You know, if you're just following headlines, and it feels like the police have been defunded. So, what does that mean? No one really knows but the perception could be if I call 911 it's going to take a long time for someone to show up. If someone's breaking into my house, I want to be sure that I have a weapon. And when you hear that the NRA is being sued to dissolve, then people assume the government is coming after their guns. There are only a couple of issues that really get people excited and agitated and get them frothing to vote before an election. Guns is one of them. Abortion obviously. And the Supreme Court.

I think people disagree about well, he should have been tougher earlier and the like but I don't think there's much disagreement from the left or the right when it comes to people who would set a fire and trap people in a building. I just think that's illegal, it's wrong, it's immoral on so many levels. So, I just don't think it's a political divide there. I do think that he is also right when he says that the Trump campaign wants those videos and he's trying to use that to say to these people who are engaged in violent behavior hey, are you supporting Trump? Because Trump wants to undermine the power of the peaceful protests in his country. And the way to do it is to point at people who are misbehaving and engaged in illegal activity.

You know, to me, I got to say, you know, his wife says he's having mental health issues. And I just wonder, you know, is this like, really lowball dirty politics to use the guy like this?

So, you do have to wonder, OK, this a little bit of a ploy, a little bit of a Jill Stein situation, if you are the Hillary Clinton campaign and still mad at her about that.

And I think that's what Kanye is doing right now in 2020 is he's microdosing, but in 2024, he's going to go for the whole tab. And let's put it this way. Joe should welcome him on the debate stage. Because if you have Kanye West of the debate stage, it's going to take a lot of pressure off Joe. He should be going like, come on, get up here, please. I'm kind of eaten alive by Trump.

And he went missing on Saturday near Calhoun, Louisiana. But there's great news because Zach Stephens is a man from nearby Monroe and his dog Ruby found him in the woods and now he is back with his family. Ruby is a bloodhound. He sniffed Russell out on Wednesday through sniffing one of his shoes. And it took her just 34 minutes to find him, which is amazing. So a job well done to Ruby. She got a spa day from a local business for all that so, nice story."

Her mom, Erica Stubblefield put the video on social media. So far, 2.5 million people have joined in the laughter. Thanks, Emma, because I got a kick out of you. That was great. Trey, you're up."

She figured out a way to fasten a tennis ball to a tetherball setup. And Gomez just goes around and around in a circle as happy as can be. He's convinced he's going to catch that tennis ball at any moment. For those of you who know and love Boston Terriers, you know they have a lot of energy. I think this is a great set up and a lot of pet parents will be following suit."
