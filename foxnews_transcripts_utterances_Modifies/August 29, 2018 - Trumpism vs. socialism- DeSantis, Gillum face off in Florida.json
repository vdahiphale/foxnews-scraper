The late senator lying in state inside the rotunda on what would have been his 82nd birthday, it's an honor only two other citizens of Arizona have received in the past 40 years. This comes after an emotional private memorial service was held there earlier, kicking off five days of tributes. Trace Gallagher joins us now from Phoenix with the latest. Trace.",

He would go to the farthest reaches of the state where they've had towns with populations less than a hundred and he would hold town halls there. Well, what you're seeing behind me is really payback for that. We have people coming from all over the state, thousands strong, to pay their respects to John McCain. It is also about 104 degrees out here, so this is no easy task. They're waiting in line for hours. The hours were set up to be from 2 o'clock to 8 o'clock, but because there are so many people they've extended the hours until everybody gets a chance to come through.  As you said, it would have been John McCain's 82nd birthday. His casket was greeted by the honor guard, every single branch of the military along with Vietnam veterans and first responders inside the rotunda. Cindy McCain and her family greeted by the Arizona governor Doug Ducey and his wife. Ducey, along with former senator John Kyle, also spoke in honor of John McCain. Listen.",

That's where the larger ceremony will take place. Former Vice President Joe Biden will speak there, along with some athletes, like the wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, Larry Fitzgerald who was a friend of John McCain's. We know John McCain was a huge sports fan. We should note that his casket will be put onto a plane tomorrow afternoon, flown back to D.C. where he will lie in state in the nation's capital rotunda.

Because I remember going back in 2010, I was at the NRCC, so I have a front row seat for this, and I remember the left dismissed the tea party, didn't think that they're going to be dangerous, didn't think that they could win back the house.

You have new trade deals that some were skeptical about that may turn out to be pretty good, with Mexico, no less. So each one -- each variable alone is in itself powerful. When you put them together, they're a murderer's row of evidence that Trump is doing something unique and special. And so, all the left can rely on is, A, race baiting, which they're really, really good at. I mean, you've got to suspend belief to think that a guy using monkey as a verb suddenly meant to use it as a noun in order to dog whistle everybody in front of the media. Here's an idea, let's take a breath and let the guy clarify because we know -- we know this is a nonstory. We just love to push it, and push it, and push it because it's just so exciting.

The media glorifies violence because when it's based on their own beliefs, which is this naive romanticism based on the idea that you're not just wrong, you're evil. And because you are evil, I can justify my violent behavior towards you, and that is why all violent groups, if they just hang around long enough, they're going to get their New York Times profile. You know, in ten years, Manson family will be like the Walton's. Antifa will be seen as folk heroes, the same way they look at the weather underground when they make movies about them.

These new services have eased the grip cab companies have on cities bringing competition to a brutal monopoly that never saw it coming. The upside for the consumer? More choices, better services and more flexible jobs for people who can either choose to drive full or part-time. It's turned thousands of folks into small businessmen. For the first time in years, you can actually call for a ride in New York City. But the downside? Cab drivers are indeed suffering.  But I take this young socialist more seriously if her campaign hadn't spent four grand on Uber over two months or 2,500 bucks on Juno, another car service. It's the eternal hypocrisy of all socialists. Whenever they end up condemning, ultimately is something they need, because socialism doesn't create anything you can use. And when they do try to create something, it always makes things worse. What socialists could do to New York is what they've already done to Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.

Well, what you're seeing behind me is really payback for that. We have people coming from all over the state, thousands strong, to pay their respects to John McCain. It is also about 104 degrees out here, so this is no easy task. They're waiting in line for hours. The hours were set up to be from 2 o'clock to 8 o'clock, but because there are so many people they've extended the hours until everybody gets a chance to come through. As you said, it would have been John McCain's 82nd birthday. His casket was greeted by the honor guard, every single branch of the military along with Vietnam veterans and first responders inside the rotunda.

At 9 o'clock tomorrow morning, the honor guard will come back and they will retrieve the casket inside the state capital, bring it back and bring it to the North Phoenix Baptist Church. That's where the larger ceremony will take place. Former Vice President Joe Biden will speak there, along with some athletes, like the wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, Larry Fitzgerald who was a friend of John McCain's. We know John McCain was a huge sports fan. We should note that his casket will be put onto a plane tomorrow afternoon, flown back to D.C. where he will lie in state in the nation's capital rotunda.

The tea party was the response to the Republican establishment. And I would just warn for Republicans, I wouldn't underestimate some of these candidates. Because I remember going back in 2010, I was at the NRCC, so I have a front row seat for this, and I remember the left dismissed the tea party, didn't think that they're going to be dangerous, didn't think that they could win back the house. And guess what happened? Republicans picked up 63 seats in the house and six seats in the senate. So I would just say there's a lot of momentum, there's a lot of energy on the left.

He's telling you everything that I'm telling you. It's not even rhetoric. It's not even a catchphrase. I'm not even blowing out of proportion. He wants to abolish ICE. He wants to raise your taxes. He wants to up core for taxes. He wants to, which really comes in handy as governor of Florida, impeach the president. It comes up a lot. But when Tom Steyer finances you, and George Soros finances you, that's what they want done, so, to me, an unfortunate statement. What I would do is, I guess, anti-Trump like.

So he could have a unifying effect on Democrats there. It is interesting to watch the rest of the countries Democrats catch up to where the New England Democrats have been for a while, for these types of left-wing progressive type of things. I'm excited for this Florida race, on the gubernatorial side because I feel like this is the future debate that we're going to have in this country.

Trump is a hell of a racist when he's helping minorities get work. Super high optimism, like the highest in 18 years since October 2002. You have new trade deals that some were skeptical about that may turn out to be pretty good, with Mexico, no less. So each one -- each variable alone is in itself powerful. When you put them together, they're a murderer's row of evidence that Trump is doing something unique and special. And so, all the left can rely on is, A, race baiting, which they're really, really good at. I mean, you've got to suspend belief to think that a guy using monkey as a verb suddenly meant to use it as a noun in order to dog whistle everybody in front of the media. Here's an idea, let's take a breath and let the guy clarify because we know -- we know this is a nonstory. We just love to push it, and push it, and push it because it's just so exciting.

So these kinds of hits taking a toll on the credibility, and so, President Trump is labeling them fake news. It's the entire reason why they launched the facts first campaign to try to respond to that.

Then the editors say checks out with us. Then they don't feel that they have to walk it back. I don't know what the truth is. I didn't have the source. I didn't write the story.

But I think the big news here, by the way, is that the president says, oh, if the Democrats get the majority in November, they're going to be so angry there'll be violence. I'm thinking if the Democrats win, they're going to be violence -- I'm thinking, wait a minute, if the Democrats win -- when I first heard this comic brand, I thought he was saying that if the left -- if the Democrats wins, then his supporters would be violent.

The media glorifies violence because when it's based on their own beliefs, which is this naive romanticism based on the idea that you're not just wrong, you're evil. And because you are evil, I can justify my violent behavior towards you, and that is why all violent groups, if they just hang around long enough, they're going to get their New York Times profile. You know, in ten years, Manson family will be like the Walton's. Antifa will be seen as folk heroes, the same way they look at the weather underground when they make movies about them. But it's all about what Don Lemon said was basically he believes that people who disagree with him are evil. Therefore, you can justify violent behavior against them and that is the seeds of fascism.

These new services have eased the grip cab companies have on cities bringing competition to a brutal monopoly that never saw it coming. The upside for the consumer? More choices, better services and more flexible jobs for people who can either choose to drive full or part-time. It's turned thousands of folks into small businessmen. For the first time in years, you can actually call for a ride in New York City. But the downside? Cab drivers are indeed suffering. But I take this young socialist more seriously if her campaign hadn't spent four grand on Uber over two months or 2,500 bucks on Juno, another car service. It's the eternal hypocrisy of all socialists. Whenever they end up condemning, ultimately is something they need, because socialism doesn't create anything you can use. And when they do try to create something, it always makes things worse. What socialists could do to New York is what they've already done to Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.

How are my grades? Are mom and dad mad at me? Then they go to college. And I was on the board of my college, and I remember, like, people would come to us with red-zone issues. I didn't even know what this meant. I'm an NFL fan, so I thought they meant in the 20-yard line. No. Red zone is young people come to college and they're dealing with sex for the first time often.

This comes at a time when millennials are apparently becoming burned out from online dating and taking up a slower, more traditional approach to dating. So rather than swiping, they're actually trying to find a place to have meaningful conversations. And I suggest maybe just, like, buy some plane tickets and fly around."
