He's a political neophyte. He did it with a very slim majority in the Senate and with a media establishment that was content to not really be that truthful about what was in the bill. So that's really good. On foreign policy he took a new direction from what we've been accustomed to with the previous couple of presidents and actually managed to crush ISIS. It's not that he had a totally different strategy than President Obama, but he enabled his military to actually make the decisions and be accountable and do what they needed to do to get it done. He saw a lot of success there that we didn't see under the previous administration.",

      "sentences": "Certainly I think by the time we got to the tax bill, the relationship between the president and Congress had gotten a little more balanced. It was obviously a little rocky during ObamaCare. But I also think that was the issue set. I think it's a lot easier to get Republicans on the same page on tax cuts than it is on something like ObamaCare and its many different facets, including Medicaid.  Look, if you go through the list of accomplishments, many of which you included in the package here, the president fulfilled a lot of the things he said he was going to do on the campaign trail. The challenge right now for the president and his party is that voters at least at this point are not giving credit to the Republicans. They don't see him particularly positively. They don't see the Republicans in Congress in a popular light. If you look at just where voters think they want to be in the 2018 election, Democrats have a double digit lead at this point.  So given all the accomplishments and how well the economy is doing, the real question is why isn't the president or the party doing better? And a lot of that is for, as much as he's succeeding in keeping his base energized, he's double energizing the opposition. And swing voters, a lot of these things that are appealing to conservatives aren't necessarily appealing to swing voters. The big challenge I think for 2018 is Republicans selling their most major piece of legislation, which is the tax bill.",

Anybody with a 401(k) at home certainly recognizes the impact in terms of the surging Dow. We'll see if that continues into the new year or whether we see if it has a reversal. Daniel is one of the keys looking ahead perhaps that voters feel like they're getting something from the tax cut, they see that in their paycheck every week?",

Look, President Trump so far has been the most conservative president in the first year of my lifetime, which might not say that much, but it is what it is. But I think the problem is many of his accomplishments have not yet been lasting. So he has a Supreme Court justice. He has reshaped in many ways the judicial system with a lot of nominees in lower courts helped along by the Senate. And of course he's had this tax reform package. But a lot of the other changes have been basically rollbacks of President Obama, which conservatives rightfully cheer and they celebrate, but it doesn't mean that the next president has to abide by that. The next president can come back in and resign a lot of these things and go back to where president had. So unless he can get Congress, unless he can get legislative accomplishments, I think how we judge the -- in terms of substantive policy of this administration, how we judge that I think is still up in the air.",

In fact, if you look at polling where they ask people both who like him and don't like him, what it is they do or don't do about him, the number one thing that comes up are aspects of his personality and his temperament.

Dismantling the clean power plan, the Paris Accord and all that bureaucratic stuff that goes along with that, had that not happened you would have really gone down in one direction with environmental regulation overreach.
