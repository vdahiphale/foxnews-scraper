We are told that they have been taking to the president to show him who has put out denials.  Did anyone ever really think it was the Federal Trade Commission chairman? Who knows? But we do know that the first lady put out a statement specifically saying, quote, \"People with no names are writing our nation's history. Words are important and accusations can lead to severe consequences. If a person is bold enough to accuse people of negative actions, they have a responsibility to publicly stand by their words.

This is not how we do things. We believe in political accountability.
