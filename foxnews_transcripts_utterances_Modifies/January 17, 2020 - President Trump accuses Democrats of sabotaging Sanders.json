Mark Herring, argues the ban is necessary to prevent chaos and violence. The Virginia Citizens Defense League and gun owners of America said the band violates their first and second amendment rights.

And the Sierra Avalanche Center has warned of dangerous conditions. Several people tonight remain missing. And this is a live look at Kansas City Missouri from Fox Four. The big story there tonight. A plane slides off the taxiway at the Kansas City International Airport due to the icy conditions there. It happened as a sprawling winter storm hits large sections of the Midwest and beyond.

Well, Colorado, you can see it there, removing their faithless elector and replacing him. Washington State did allow them to do it but fined them. So, both those cases ended up in court and there was a split in the decision. So, now the Supreme Court is going to weigh in. In a close election, it's possible to imagine a scenario in which flipping for electoral votes could change the presidency. Critics to the effort to allow electors to vote as they wish would have a situation which they're going to face incredible pressure and coercion, while the country then, is sitting around anxiously awaiting four weeks to find out who the president is actually going to be.

Senator McConnell, knowing that he currently has the votes to acquit Trump, does not want the Senate trial to come off looking anything like the partisan brawl in the House or a typical Trumpian event. With a handful of GOP incumbents facing difficult reelections in November, McConnell wants a quick, clean, dignified trial to protect their political fortunes as well as his own.\" OK, what about all of this? Let's bring in our panel, \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters.\" We don't know all of the rules, it's going to start Tuesday, Susan, where it's battled about this resolution that McConnell will bring forward about how this is structured. Anything striking about this list on the legal team? SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I think Trump was looking for some firebreathers like Jim Jordan from the House side or Mark Meadows, people who have been his staunch allies and very vocally defending him against these impeachment charges. But this looks to represent more of a compromise. As you said, the Senate Republicans do not want this thing to devolve into anything circus-like or Trumpian. This is more of a compromise. We have media friendly faces like Ken Starr, Alan Dershowitz, who can argue on constitutional grounds. They've been out talking to him, about him and the impeachment process, and defending him on television.

He has crushing sanctions. They're going to have a $200 billion deficit in their budget next year. The Europeans have now triggered the mechanism that could snap back the U.N. sanctions, so the sanctions could get worse. He shot down a Ukrainian airliner which sparked mass protests against his regime. And he put out an American flag for people to trample on, and they walked around it.

      "speaker": "SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is big and it's actually a pair of cases involving the so-called faithless electors. These people who are chosen by their state to represent them in the Electoral College, and they're supposed to vote based on how their states popular votes went. Well back in 2016, a few electors decided to go rogue. They argued it was unconstitutional for their states to force them to match the popular vote. One in Colorado, three were in Washington State. Well, Colorado, you can see it there, removing their faithless elector and replacing him. Washington State did allow them to do it but fined them. So, both those cases ended up in court and there was a split in the decision. So, now the Supreme Court is going to weigh in. In a close election, it's possible to imagine a scenario in which flipping for electoral votes could change the presidency. Critics to the effort to allow electors to vote as they wish would have a situation which they're going to face incredible pressure and coercion, while the country then, is sitting around anxiously awaiting four weeks to find out who the president is actually going to be. We should have a decision in that case by June."

Now, this one centers on a roll from the Trump administration, which expands the class of employers who can opt-out of paying for certain kinds of birth control based on religious or moral objections. The ACLU reacting tonight, saying, \"Allowing employers and universities to use their religious beliefs to block employees' and students' birth control coverage isn't religious liberty -- it's discrimination.\" Well, the legal group representing the nun, saying tonight, \"There are plenty of ways to provide people with contraceptives without forcing Catholic nuns to participate.\" So, all these cases probably argued in March, maybe more likely in April. But again, all these decisions are due by June, early July, right in the middle of the heated presidential election."

First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. Ukraine's prime minister has submitted his resignation. That move comes just days after he was caught on tape, saying Ukraine's president, a former sitcom star with no previous political experience knows nothing about the economy. Cuba's president says he does not believe the Trump administration would drop sanctions on the island in exchange for concessions from his government. The U.S. says it has been tightening sanctions on Cuba in recent months in order to starve the islands communist government of cash and energy supplies, and force it to end support for disputed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The Louvre Museum in Paris was closed today as dozens of protesters blocked the entrance to denounce the French government's plans to overhaul the pension system. Several dozen protesters including some of the museum's employees staged the demonstration after an appeal from several hard-left trade unions against President Emmanuel Macron's plan changes to the retirement system.

      "utterance": "That raised some eyebrows today. LSU standing behind the president there at the White House. This is his legal team which will essentially have the president's argument in front of the Senate, for the Senate trial. Here's how the \"Washington Post\" looks at this, \"The biggest issue, some senators say, could come when Trump's legal team takes its allotted time to rebut the case from the House impeachment managers. Senator McConnell, knowing that he currently has the votes to acquit Trump, does not want the Senate trial to come off looking anything like the partisan brawl in the House or a typical Trumpian event. With a handful of GOP incumbents facing difficult reelections in November, McConnell wants a quick, clean, dignified trial to protect their political fortunes as well as his own.\" OK, what about all of this? Let's bring in our panel, \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters.\" We don't know all of the rules, it's going to start Tuesday, Susan, where it's battled about this resolution that McConnell will bring forward about how this is structured. Anything striking about this list on the legal team? SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I think Trump was looking for some firebreathers like Jim Jordan from the House side or Mark Meadows, people who have been his staunch allies and very vocally defending him against these impeachment charges. But this looks to represent more of a compromise. As you said, the Senate Republicans do not want this thing to devolve into anything circus-like or Trumpian. This is more of a compromise. We have media friendly faces like Ken Starr, Alan Dershowitz, who can argue on constitutional grounds. They've been out talking to him, about him and the impeachment process, and defending him on television. It's a little bit of star power that I think the president was looking for, but not quite the kind of raw that might result if you had, say, Jim Jordan on the floor of the Senate defending the president."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

Senator McConnell's plan is supposed to be the Clinton model of the impeachment, which is 24 hours for the prosecution, the House managers, 24 hours for the defense the legal team just announced, 16 hours then for written questions from the senators that the chief justice then asks the different sides, and then possible witnesses at that point, which will be debated at that point by the senators. Marc, I've been told by several people that they are trying to plow through this, and they may have big chunks at one time of this Senate trial that could go into the evening."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. And keep in mind, in 1999 when they got to that point about voting on witnesses, Chuck Schumer voted no. Chuck Schumer voted against witnesses. So he was against witnesses before he was for them. But I think Ken Starr is absolutely right. They are going to have witnesses in all likelihood, and his legal team is going to take advantage of that, because one of the key parts of the president's defense is that if Hunter Biden, if his contract with Burisma was corrupt, then his phone call with the Ukrainian president had a public purpose. It wasn't self-dealing. So they're going to put Joe Biden and Hunter Biden on trial. And it's not just Hunter Biden that will probably testify. You're probably going to have Amos Hochstein, who was the Obama Energy Czar, who, he was the one who went to Biden and told him that there's a problem here. You have a conflict of interest with your son's business dealings. What did he say? What did he say to Joe Biden? They're going to bring in legal experts to prove the case that Hunter Biden's deal was corrupt. They're going to investigate his deals in China and Romania because it shows a pattern of corruption on the part of Hunter Biden. And then finally, they will bring the vice president himself, and the vice president will not be under legal cross-examination, will not be able to get away with saying, focus on Donald Trump, and nobody says my son did anything wrong because there will be many witnesses who said that his son in fact did something wrong."

Jeff, the big question, really, is the witnesses vote, which requires 51, but then let's say the White House says it's executive privilege for John Bolton or for Mick Mulvaney. That's another vote essentially. John Roberts could rule as a presiding officer, but then he could get overruled by 51 votes in the Senate. It's a different argument on executive privilege."

Certainly, the scenario that you just sketched out is not the one Democrats are looking for, but if it gets anywhere near that, they are certainly going to want to have John Bolton. That says something that even some Republicans have indicated that they would like to hear from him. And I think the other wild card in terms of witnesses is the president himself. He has indicated, sort of gone back and forth as to whether or not he would like to have a quick trial or a longer trial. The most important thing that White House officials have told me is he just wants to be vindicated. And if the way to do that is to have witnesses, then maybe they will. And if the way to do that is to do more of a streamlined, quick get this done, maybe they will stick with that as well."

That may be one reason why there aren't witnesses. Both sides know what this is going to bring. And there's an overarching feeling in the Senate that they don't want this to be a circus.

He has crushing sanctions. They're going to have a $200 billion deficit in their budget next year.
