      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is The Ingraham Angle, not from Miami tonight. We're in Washington, where all the action is. Come on, Hannity. Well, now that they've lost their witness vote, Democrats still can't let go. Senator Mike Ron and Congressman Meadows and Jordan have reaction and Mollie Hemingway and Ari Fleischer are here tonight. They're going to explain how the Democrats stunts, these last-minute little tricks in their bag have turned the public against Washington even more if that's possible. And Raymond Arroyo brings you an impeachment themed Friday Follies. Schiff and Nadler's big crackup and Schumer's Kamala crackdown. This is a fun one. But first, the real bitter clingers. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Now remember when Obama described us conservatives as bitter people, clinging to our guns and our religion. Well now we see who the real bitter clingers really are. Schiff, Schumer, Nadler, Pelosi, Romney, Bolton, just to name a few.  Well, all of them when you think about it in their own way are very angry people. They cling reflexively to an ideology that most people just don't relate to anymore. Now the Democrats have become increasingly rabid and radical. They're turning off most sane people. Bolton though he's a poster child for the neo con Never Trump crowd, still fantasizing about the glory days of deploying 100,000 troops for nation building in Iraq. Both Left and Right have rejected his intervention as worldview. Yet somehow, he landed the NSC job at the Trump White House. Go figure.  Well fortunate for us, President Trump was too smart to fall for all that nonsense. A blank check for any country claiming to be an ally with a hand stretched out, not the Trump doctrine maybe. And as for Mitt, can I get a witness Romney. Well, he's bitter too.  He still can't believe someone of his pedigree and upbringing ever lost the presidency and that a man like Trump won it. 2012 is over Mitt. Don't punish Trump or the rest of us for your own weakness as a candidate.  Now, last night, I titled the Angle 24 hours to victory. Love that font. Well that title is correct though because Trump today triumphed over the unfair, unjust and politically motivated witch hunt. But the Democrats cannot accept defeat as we've told you time and again when they lose, they call everything that happened before illegitimate. But now even the liberal media, well they're having a hard time spinning it.",

They're bitter once again because Trump has beaten them at their own game and once again, Mitch McConnell, that's sly wily old dog in the Senate outmaneuvered all of them. And once again, some of the radicals in their party are just repelling the public and the support of key senators, they needed.   Senator Murkowski was so turned off by Elizabeth Warren stunt demeaning the Chief Justice with a question last night that she rejected witnesses because of it.

No, Chuck, it's you and Schiff and the entire Democrat gang, who are putting your fingers on the scale for the Democrat establishment. Good luck. But the American people see right through you. And that's the Angle.  All right. Joining me now is Sol Wisenberg, Former Deputy Independent Counsel. Also, with me is Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Legal Analyst. Gregg let's start with you. We thought and yet we knew there was going to be something that happened today. We all predicted it last night, even though Trump won, Toobin had to say, look, it's over. We won. They won. But what sorts of stunts could the Democrats pull between now and that Wednesday vote?  GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, they're relying on The New York Times. This is impeachment by The New York Times based on anonymous hearsay, multiple hearsay witnesses who actually haven't read Bolton's book.  Look, even if you assume that President Trump, for the sake of argument, wanted a quid pro quo to investigate the Biden's, it's still not an impeachable offense because the President had a legitimate public interest reason to ask Ukraine to look into the Biden's conduct and anybody seriously argue that Joe and Hunter Biden's conduct here isn't objectively suspicious and warranted an investigation by any reasonable standard. It did. This is a kid who's making a million bucks a year in exchange for nothing with no expertise. And then a father threatening to extort a billion dollars from Ukraine to fire the investigator in Ukraine who's investigating Hunter Biden's company in what really hurt them the most was when the Democrats own witnesses video clips were played in which they were saying they had serious concerns about what Hunter and Joe Biden were doing and reporter clips, raising questions about potential corruption by the FBI.  INGRAHAM: All right. Well, we're going to learn more about that. They're going to be having oversight hearings. This is the beginning, not the end. Lindsey Graham has had a judiciary. But you're going to see foreign relations and others involved.  Sol, the President's legal team called out this common line that we keep hearing from the Democrats throughout the trial.",

There are a number in the trial. There are no problems with that. But it's very important that the President was not invited. Remember, the President and his lawyers were not invited until it got to the House Judiciary Committee with Nadler and the game was over by then, they'd already announced no more witnesses. So, I think that particular point was outstanding.  The bigger point to me is, you know, impeachment is a serious business. If you're going to do it, don't make it a joke. Don't make it political. Don't authorize the inquiry with a press conference. Dot your eyes. Cross your T's. Be serious. It was so obviously political that people really could not focus on the substantive - the substantive complaints about him. And because of that, they had no credibility.  INGRAHAM: I think so many people tuned out on the other networks. You think that was going to be their big glory day, but their ratings kind of went like this and ours kept going like that, which is nice for us, but it's bad for the country.

I mean, he couldn't even be a fact witness in this case. And as we've talked about several times on the show, they didn't want to call John Bolton as a witness in the House. They didn't even subpoena him. And when it looked like the judge was going to make a ruling on the Kupperman case, which Bolton said, I'll follow, they withdraw, withdrew their subpoena. I'm not sure why they did it.  But I'll tell you something about whether or not it's legitimate. Just like Nancy Pelosi said, he's impeached forever. He's acquitted forever. And I want to point out one other thing that's incorrect that's being said repeatedly. The Democratic senators are saying that there's never been an impeachment without witnesses. That is not true. The very first impeachment ever in our history had no witnesses. It was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, which is what a lot of the president supporters wanted to do with this. So, even that isn't accurate.  INGRAHAM: I wanted it to be dismissed out of hand. Right off the top. But they didn't have the votes for it.",

Huge event, huge event in Des Moines. Look at these crowds. I mean, Trump maybe exaggerate some of the crowds at times. But these were massive crowds.  HEMINGWAY: Well, and just this was what was such an unforced error from Democrats. Donald Trump does well when he has a foil, when he can say that people are unfairly going after him, which dragging out an impeachment process, which just never, ever caught sway outside of the resistance just helps him completely. I love the Kavanaugh mentioned though, because I think also what the Left hasn't figured out is that by doing the Kavanaugh smear operation, they kind of ruined all future operations like that where the media and the Democrats walk hand-in-hand as they carefully deploy information and they put out supposed bombshells.   They did that with Kavanaugh. They did that for years with the Russia hoax. And people are not stupid. They woke up to it. Now, when they hear that something's going on. They almost expect to hear some bombshell that turns out not to be a bombshell. Rather than taking it seriously when the media and the Democrats work hand-in-hand for a shared political goal.  INGRAHAM: So, Ari, that's a great point. I think that people are onto this, they're pretty smart. They sense that this is all kind of a smash and grab job, smear and slash, whatever you want to call it. And it gets old and tiresome. This is Super Bowl weekend and we've got some fun events coming up. Iowa caucuses, you got the State of the Union speech. People want to get on with their lives, but they are bitter, and they are clinging, and they want to take everybody else down with them.  FLEISCHER: And they are liberal. In 1994, only 25 percent of the Democrats self-identified as liberals. Today, according to Gallup, 51 percent of Democrats self-identify as liberals. And that's why we have impeachment.  Nancy Pelosi tried to hold that storm back and then she got over flooded. She couldn't control the AOC wing of the Democrat Party. And now you're seeing in Iowa with Bernie Sanders, aren't you? You're seeing in New Hampshire; you're seeing in California. The Democratic Party is fundamentally a different party than it was even one generation ago when Bill Clinton was President. And this is the Democrats kiss of death. This is where they are turning moderates who don't necessarily like Donald Trump into Trump voters because the Democrats have gone too far, are too angry, and they're just no moderates, reasonable Democrats left.",

Well, now that they've lost their witness vote, Democrats still can't let go. Senator Mike Ron and Congressman Meadows and Jordan have reaction and Mollie Hemingway and Ari Fleischer are here tonight. They're going to explain how the Democrats stunts, these last-minute little tricks in their bag have turned the public against Washington even more if that's possible. And Raymond Arroyo brings you an impeachment themed Friday Follies. Schiff and Nadler's big crackup and Schumer's Kamala crackdown. This is a fun one. But first, the real bitter clingers. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Now remember when Obama described us conservatives as bitter people, clinging to our guns and our religion. Well now we see who the real bitter clingers really are. Schiff, Schumer, Nadler, Pelosi, Romney, Bolton, just to name a few. Well, all of them when you think about it in their own way are very angry people. They cling reflexively to an ideology that most people just don't relate to anymore. Now the Democrats have become increasingly rabid and radical. They're turning off most sane people. Bolton though he's a poster child for the neo con Never Trump crowd, still fantasizing about the glory days of deploying 100,000 troops for nation building in Iraq. Both Left and Right have rejected his intervention as worldview. Yet somehow, he landed the NSC job at the Trump White House. Go figure.  Well fortunate for us, President Trump was too smart to fall for all that nonsense. A blank check for any country claiming to be an ally with a hand stretched out, not the Trump doctrine maybe. And as for Mitt, can I get a witness Romney. Well, he's bitter too. He still can't believe someone of his pedigree and upbringing ever lost the presidency and that a man like Trump won it. 2012 is over Mitt. Don't punish Trump or the rest of us for your own weakness as a candidate. Now, last night, I titled the Angle 24 hours to victory. Love that font. Well that title is correct though because Trump today triumphed over the unfair, unjust and politically motivated witch hunt. But the Democrats cannot accept defeat as we've told you time and again when they lose, they call everything that happened before illegitimate.

Who cares about those now? Sure, the gang are deeply bitter selfish and self-aggrandizing people. They're bitter once again because Trump has beaten them at their own game and once again, Mitch McConnell, that's sly wily old dog in the Senate outmaneuvered all of them. And once again, some of the radicals in their party are just repelling the public and the support of key senators, they needed. Senator Murkowski was so turned off by Elizabeth Warren stunt demeaning the Chief Justice with a question last night that she rejected witnesses because of it. She wrote, I will not stand for nor support that effort. So, while Chuck and Adam tilt at windmills, President Trump what has he done. Well, he's chocked up some fantastic victories this week. The USMCA and a bold Middle East peace plan to name a couple and his administration as managing a global contagion that is threatening lives and international markets.

But what sorts of stunts could the Democrats pull between now and that Wednesday vote?  GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, they're relying on The New York Times. This is impeachment by The New York Times based on anonymous hearsay, multiple hearsay witnesses who actually haven't read Bolton's book. Look, even if you assume that President Trump, for the sake of argument, wanted a quid pro quo to investigate the Biden's, it's still not an impeachable offense because the President had a legitimate public interest reason to ask Ukraine to look into the Biden's conduct and anybody seriously argue that Joe and Hunter Biden's conduct here isn't objectively suspicious and warranted an investigation by any reasonable standard.

There are a number in the trial. There are no problems with that. But it's very important that the President was not invited. Remember, the President and his lawyers were not invited until it got to the House Judiciary Committee with Nadler and the game was over by then, they'd already announced no more witnesses.

And did anybody honestly believe Adam Schiff when he said on the Senate floor, Oh, I don't know the identity of the whistleblower. Of course, he did. The other amusing part was Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer saying, oh, this isn't a real trial and it's not a real acquittal because there were no witnesses. There were more than a dozen witnesses that were introduced and accepted into evidence and video clips played for the jurors, the senators of their testimony, and more than 28,000 pages of documents introduced as evidence. It is folly to argue that this is somehow an illegitimate trial. The only thing that was illegitimate was the impeachment in the House, in which fundamental due process was deprived for the president.  INGRAHAM: There was a moment tonight Sol where Jake Tapper was again dangling the shiny objects to the viewers on CNN, echoing what we've heard over the last several days and different iterations about why this acquittal that's coming up on Wednesday will not really be legitimate.

I mean, he couldn't even be a fact witness in this case. And as we've talked about several times on the show, they didn't want to call John Bolton as a witness in the House. They didn't even subpoena him. And when it looked like the judge was going to make a ruling on the Kupperman case, which Bolton said, I'll follow, they withdraw, withdrew their subpoena.

The very first impeachment ever in our history had no witnesses. It was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, which is what a lot of the president supporters wanted to do with this.

It's a political stunt to keep it going. Democrats clearly to blame here. But what's their motivation, the real motivation to not do what they could have done today and get it into the Iowa caucuses? The State of the Union, those two things are happening in Monday and Tuesday. Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at The Federalist. Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary. Both Fox News Contributors. Mollie, they don't trust their own primary voters, do they? To pick whoever they want. The Iowa caucuses, they're keeping a lot of people in town.  MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: It's a follow-up of the entire operation of not trusting voters.

Huge event, huge event in Des Moines. Look at these crowds. I mean, Trump maybe exaggerate some of the crowds at times. But these were massive crowds.  HEMINGWAY: Well, and just this was what was such an unforced error from Democrats. Donald Trump does well when he has a foil, when he can say that people are unfairly going after him, which dragging out an impeachment process, which just never, ever caught sway outside of the resistance just helps him completely. I love the Kavanaugh mentioned though, because I think also what the Left hasn't figured out is that by doing the Kavanaugh smear operation, they kind of ruined all future operations like that where the media and the Democrats walk hand-in-hand as they carefully deploy information and they put out supposed bombshells."

They sense that this is all kind of a smash and grab job, smear and slash, whatever you want to call it. And it gets old and tiresome. This is Super Bowl weekend and we've got some fun events coming up. Iowa caucuses, you got the State of the Union speech. People want to get on with their lives, but they are bitter, and they are clinging, and they want to take everybody else down with them.  FLEISCHER: And they are liberal. In 1994, only 25 percent of the Democrats self-identified as liberals. Today, according to Gallup, 51 percent of Democrats self-identify as liberals. And that's why we have impeachment. Nancy Pelosi tried to hold that storm back and then she got over flooded. She couldn't control the AOC wing of the Democrat Party. And now you're seeing in Iowa with Bernie Sanders, aren't you? You're seeing in New Hampshire; you're seeing in California. The Democratic Party is fundamentally a different party than it was even one generation ago when Bill Clinton was President. And this is the Democrats kiss of death. This is where they are turning moderates who don't necessarily like Donald Trump into Trump voters because the Democrats have gone too far, are too angry, and they're just no moderates, reasonable Democrats left."

His acquittal on Wednesday is a virtual certainty at this point. But what can we expect in the meantime? Joining us now with some ideas, Congressman Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows, both of members of Trump's defense team. Along with me is Indiana Senator Mike Braun, Senator Braun. Please explain for the audience what we might expect between now and Monday. Now, Wednesday. We know there's going to be arguments on Monday, but there seems to be this continuum with the media dropping a little shiny sparkler and the politicos running toward it and saying, bombshell, we need witnesses.  SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN): We could have had it all done in compressed other than for Chuck Schumer. So, what he wants to do in the meantime is milk the time between the vote today, which was clear he was going to lose that, and they wanted time. I think also to get their presidential candidates back to Iowa and then come back on Monday. Monday, there'll be final arguments Tuesday at time for individual senators to make a floor speech and then Wednesday, the vote.

If the facts are inconvenient, just say they are all conspiracies. Joining us now, two investigative journalists, Lee Smith, author of \"The Plot Against The President,\" and John Solomon, FOX News contributor. John, they are willing to take every leak at face value, yet ignore the rank corruption in their midst. What gives here?"

Look, this is a person who has not only injected an enormous conspiracy theory, the most destructive conspiracy theory in U.S. history, but also look at how he has attacked colleagues.

Victor Pinchuk is a very powerful oligarch in Ukraine and the man who is the single largest donor to the Clinton Foundation. So he is one of the many people that had their finger in that little money jar that is called Ukraine. A lot of politicians have dipped their fingers in that."

And there are a lot of people who are working inside the administration who seem very focused on their areas of interest, sometimes not so much on the United States. And Kellyanne Conway was on our show the other night, and she said that she was very worried that people are still inside the administration burrowed and, almost a shallow state, not even a deep state, working against the interests of this president."

I imagine that right now the same operators, including Congressman Schiff, including rogue intelligence officers, including, of course, the press, are cooking up something right now as we speak."

Move the whole thing out of the White House altogether. That is how little he trusts the people at the NSC that are working in the White House right now."

Brexit is official, or closer to an end. Britain freed itself from its 47-year membership in the E.U. Very satisfying moment. Sorry, Angela Merkel. She remarked, this is a deep cut for us all.
