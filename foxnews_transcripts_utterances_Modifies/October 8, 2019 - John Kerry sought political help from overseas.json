      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” We live, as you may have noticed, in the age of woke capital. They're not just selling products, they are selling something more than that, and you see it everywhere. You see it in every movie, every commercial every press release from the diversity division of your local HR department. The message is always the same. Companies aren't just soulless profit seekers, they are more than that. They have values. They have principles. They care. They care probably more than you do.  Once upon a time, corporate America flattered its customers. Now, they dare you to be as virtuous as they are. But is that real? Are they actually virtuous? Or is all of this a cynical pose? We will let you decide.  Consider this, last Friday, Daryl Morey, he is the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team sent what seemed like a noncontroversial tweet. He wrote this, quote, \"Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\" End quote. That's it.  Now China, as you may have seen on television is now trying to crush Hong Kong and it's not hard to pick a side. China, it is rarely noted, but it is true is a racist ethno state that bans dissent and murders its political opponents. You think every American would stand with Hong Kong without even thinking about it. But not the NBA. The NBA is on China's side. So Morey was forced to delete his tweet. He may in fact lose his job over this. The NBA issued a statement making it clear that under no circumstance do they support Hong Kong or human freedom.  Today, basketball Commissioner Adam Silver emerged to clarify. He repeated the refrain of every person who opposes free speech. Sure, you're free to say what you think, but you aren't safe from the consequences.",

On the question of American politics, Kerr, you may have noticed, has no problem speaking his mind. He embraces the hard left social policy that suddenly is so fashionable among rich people. He doesn't hesitate, for example, to demand the stricter gun laws for the rest of us. In the words of one fawning media outlet -- and there are many -- Kerr speaks truth to power. All right. So what truth was Steve Kerr ready to speak to China? Well, none, it turns out. Not a single truth to the government of China.   Choosing between freedom and fascism turns out to be a really confusing choice. Who knows what the right answer is? As Kerr pointed out, it's really above his pay grade.",

It is hard to imagine how a man like that can look himself in the mirror at night, and yet he is not alone -- hardly. There are countless Steve Kerr's in corporate America, all of them happy to sell out their country and lick the boots of their Chinese masters for pay. Activision Blizzard - that's a major video game company just banned a top player from one of its games because he gave an interview supporting the demonstrations in Hong Kong.  Just last year, right outside of Washington, the hotel company Marriott fired one of its employees. Why? For liking a tweet that recognized Taiwan as a country. That's it. That tweet offended China. So Marriott did the bidding of the fascist and fired him. That actually happened. This is common, by the way. In Hollywood, pandering to China is so common, so flagrant that the show \"South Park\" produced an entire episode mocking it.",

And Comedy Central for airing it. Most companies in America we are sad to say would never do that. Why? You know why? China has 1.4 billion people. Companies want access to that market. If it's a choice between supporting the United States, our country and our people or getting rich from China, it is no contest from any company.   For decades, neoliberals assured us that it was our duty to embrace free trade with China, as the rest of us sat passively by, they allowed China to steal our technologies, snatch up our properties in our cities, driving up rents, decreasing the rates of homeownership and destroying millions and millions of course of our manufacturing jobs. Making a communist country vastly rich would be worth it, they assured us because China inevitably -- these things are always inevitable -- would become much freer and more democratic as well. That was inexorable, because capitalism always leads to democracy.  Remember that? They would nod as they said it. They were lying. It turned out to be completely false. Instead of exporting American freedoms to China, our ruling class instead imported Chinese authoritarianism here.  Thirty years later, ordinary Americans are poor, wages haven't moved, and all of us are less free. But China and our neoliberal elite are a lot richer. It turns out that fascism, whatever you think of it is pretty good for business. That ought to worry you. FS One's Jason Whitlock will talk to us in a few moments about this, but first we're joined tonight by Michael Pillsbury. He is of course the Director of Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, and the author of the fantastic book, \"The Hundred-Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.\" No longer such a secret strategy.

Part of it comes from the power of the Chinese economy, the Chinese financed by us and stealing our technology, a lot of it we provided directly to them. Chinese have reached at least 75 percent the size of our economy. The Chinese themselves believe they surpassed our economy five years ago, by the way they measure it.  So you're talking about a very, very powerful country. This is not anything like even Japan was only 10 percent of our economic power when they bombed Pearl Harbor. This is really a major power stronger than the Soviet Union ever was in comparison to us.  So these companies are reacting to real facts, they can be punished, they can be rendered bankrupt by Chinese power. So I don't -- I don't forgive what they've done, but it is really worse how 20 or more years of neglect or even support for China have got us into this situation where President Trump is just starting to fight back. There's some interesting news today that he is going to put 28 companies that are the most advanced technology companies in China in artificial intelligence, special kinds of cameras, special kinds of surveillance. They can't buy American products anymore because of this order President Trump announced this morning.  But he said several times, that he doesn't want China to surpass us on his watch.

But they're nothing like the power of the Federal government and our Federal government now is saying, look, China is getting ahead of us in outer space. The reason for creating the Space Force is Chinese satellites now can do things we can't do in space.

Without the Chinese money and without --  Because you really have to understand the shoe companies -- Nike, Adidas -- they run American Basketball from the high school level all the way to the pros and the shoe companies are dependent on the China market and that's where all of this is coming from. You see NBA players constantly over the summer, during their offseason, running to China, to do the bidding of their shoe companies and to sell their shoes in the China market.

We can't let our corporations, our country being totally driven by China because it's driving our culture. These basketball players -- LeBron James.

We're apologizing to a communist government, and then we have athletes here and coaches like Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich that rail against our government. We're the bad guys in the minds of these NBA players and coaches and their little parade of being so woke, all of it to me is at the behest of the shoe companies. They're doing the bidding of the shoe companies and protecting China and demonizing us and our culture and dramatically changing our culture. Because these athletes are young and I'm not giving them an excuse, but they're young. Many of them didn't go to college or only spent a year or two in college. They don't understand how they are being used and played to promote a communist, a Marxist agenda. They have no idea that their actions and a lot of the things they're promoting, this victim mentality and all the identity politics and oh, everything that America is racist -- all of it.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” We live, as you may have noticed, in the age of woke capital. They're not just selling products, they are selling something more than that, and you see it everywhere. You see it in every movie, every commercial every press release from the diversity division of your local HR department. The message is always the same. Companies aren't just soulless profit seekers, they are more than that. They have values. They have principles. They care. They care probably more than you do. Once upon a time, corporate America flattered its customers. Now, they dare you to be as virtuous as they are. But is that real? Are they actually virtuous? Or is all of this a cynical pose? We will let you decide. Consider this, last Friday, Daryl Morey, he is the general manager of the Houston Rockets basketball team sent what seemed like a noncontroversial tweet. He wrote this, quote, \"Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\" End quote. That's it. Now China, as you may have seen on television is now trying to crush Hong Kong and it's not hard to pick a side. China, it is rarely noted, but it is true is a racist ethno state that bans dissent and murders its political opponents. You think every American would stand with Hong Kong without even thinking about it. But not the NBA. The NBA is on China's side. So Morey was forced to delete his tweet. He may in fact lose his job over this. The NBA issued a statement making it clear that under no circumstance do they support Hong Kong or human freedom. Today, basketball Commissioner Adam Silver emerged to clarify. He repeated the refrain of every person who opposes free speech. Sure, you're free to say what you think, but you aren't safe from the consequences."

On the question of American politics, Kerr, you may have noticed, has no problem speaking his mind. He embraces the hard left social policy that suddenly is so fashionable among rich people. He doesn't hesitate, for example, to demand the stricter gun laws for the rest of us. In the words of one fawning media outlet -- and there are many -- Kerr speaks truth to power. All right. So what truth was Steve Kerr ready to speak to China? Well, none, it turns out. Not a single truth to the government of China. Choosing between freedom and fascism turns out to be a really confusing choice. Who knows what the right answer is? As Kerr pointed out, it's really above his pay grade."

He is brave when the crowds applaud, but when money is at stake, he shuts up and obeys like the cowardly little corporate stooge that he is. It is hard to imagine how a man like that can look himself in the mirror at night, and yet he is not alone -- hardly. There are countless Steve Kerr's in corporate America, all of them happy to sell out their country and lick the boots of their Chinese masters for pay. Activision Blizzard - that's a major video game company just banned a top player from one of its games because he gave an interview supporting the demonstrations in Hong Kong. Just last year, right outside of Washington, the hotel company Marriott fired one of its employees. Why? For liking a tweet that recognized Taiwan as a country. That's it. That tweet offended China. So Marriott did the bidding of the fascist and fired him. That actually happened. This is common, by the way. In Hollywood, pandering to China is so common, so flagrant that the show \"South Park\" produced an entire episode mocking it."

      "utterance": "Maybe ridiculous, but \"South Park\" was banned in China after the episode you just saw. You've got to respect its creators for making the episode anyway. And Comedy Central for airing it. Most companies in America we are sad to say would never do that. Why? You know why? China has 1.4 billion people. Companies want access to that market. If it's a choice between supporting the United States, our country and our people or getting rich from China, it is no contest from any company. For decades, neoliberals assured us that it was our duty to embrace free trade with China, as the rest of us sat passively by, they allowed China to steal our technologies, snatch up our properties in our cities, driving up rents, decreasing the rates of homeownership and destroying millions and millions of course of our manufacturing jobs. Making a communist country vastly rich would be worth it, they assured us because China inevitably -- these things are always inevitable -- would become much freer and more democratic as well. That was inexorable, because capitalism always leads to democracy. Remember that? They would nod as they said it. They were lying. It turned out to be completely false. Instead of exporting American freedoms to China, our ruling class instead imported Chinese authoritarianism here. Thirty years later, ordinary Americans are poor, wages haven't moved, and all of us are less free. But China and our neoliberal elite are a lot richer. It turns out that fascism, whatever you think of it is pretty good for business. That ought to worry you. FS One's Jason Whitlock will talk to us in a few moments about this, but first we're joined tonight by Michael Pillsbury. He is of course the Director of Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, and the author of the fantastic book, \"The Hundred-Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.\" No longer such a secret strategy. Mr. Pillsbury joins us tonight. Thanks so much for coming on."

    {
      "speaker": "PILLSBURY",
      "utterance": "Well, as you say, it's kind of craven surrender. Part of it comes from the power of the Chinese economy, the Chinese financed by us and stealing our technology, a lot of it we provided directly to them. Chinese have reached at least 75 percent the size of our economy. The Chinese themselves believe they surpassed our economy five years ago, by the way they measure it. So you're talking about a very, very powerful country. This is not anything like even Japan was only 10 percent of our economic power when they bombed Pearl Harbor. This is really a major power stronger than the Soviet Union ever was in comparison to us. So these companies are reacting to real facts, they can be punished, they can be rendered bankrupt by Chinese power. So I don't -- I don't forgive what they've done, but it is really worse how 20 or more years of neglect or even support for China have got us into this situation where President Trump is just starting to fight back. There's some interesting news today that he is going to put 28 companies that are the most advanced technology companies in China in artificial intelligence, special kinds of cameras, special kinds of surveillance. They can't buy American products anymore because of this order President Trump announced this morning. But he said several times, that he doesn't want China to surpass us on his watch. And then he says if Hillary Clinton had been elected, China would be surpassing us right now."

It's hard to really punish the NBA for being craven. Maybe we can shame them into better conduct. But they're nothing like the power of the Federal government and our Federal government now is saying, look, China is getting ahead of us in outer space. The reason for creating the Space Force is Chinese satellites now can do things we can't do in space. They've got a thing that our Air Force calls, the kidnapper satellite, a little rogue, top opens up, a grappling hook comes out, it can grab another satellite, steal it, and go away. We can't do that. We haven't got a countermeasure for it."

Without the Chinese money and without -- Because you really have to understand the shoe companies -- Nike, Adidas -- they run American Basketball from the high school level all the way to the pros and the shoe companies are dependent on the China market and that's where all of this is coming from. You see NBA players constantly over the summer, during their offseason, running to China, to do the bidding of their shoe companies and to sell their shoes in the China market. And so the NBA is really being exposed as not nearly as much of American business, as it is a global business, with China, perhaps having more influence over it than even America."

And I think for a lot of the everyday, typical American sports fan, this is an educational experience. This is what people have been talking about. We can't let our corporations, our country being totally driven by China because it's driving our culture. These basketball players -- LeBron James. James Harden, actually apologized on behalf of Daryl Morey to the Chinese government. We're apologizing to a communist government, and then we have athletes here and coaches like Steve Kerr and Gregg Popovich that rail against our government. We're the bad guys in the minds of these NBA players and coaches and their little parade of being so woke, all of it to me is at the behest of the shoe companies. They're doing the bidding of the shoe companies and protecting China and demonizing us and our culture and dramatically changing our culture. Because these athletes are young and I'm not giving them an excuse, but they're young. Many of them didn't go to college or only spent a year or two in college. They don't understand how they are being used and played to promote a communist, a Marxist agenda. They have no idea that their actions and a lot of the things they're promoting, this victim mentality and all the identity politics and oh, everything that America is racist -- all of it. It's all a scam by the shoe companies. Look how socially aware we are, look how we fight against injustice. No, you're actually doing a marketing ploy to pretend you have a social conscience, and you're actually doing the bidding of the communist regime in China."

Here's the quote, \"Mass incarceration is a system whose logic evolved from the same lineage as Jim Crow, American apartheid and slavery. To end it, we have to change. That means we need a real conversation about decarceration and prison abolition in this country,\" end quote. Because of course, there were no prisons before racists in America thought them up.

I mean, the high crime cities around our country are all experiencing some version of the same problem, which is violent crime committed by recidivists. I mean, nationally, I think more than a third of all violent felons committed their offense, while they were either on probation, parole or awaiting trial and are pending hearings.

Is she talking about murderers or robbers are rapists, sexual assailants, aggravated assailants, burglars? Because this constitutes the vast majority of our prison population in this country. Right? Not to mention the fact that even the people who are in for sort of lower level public order or drug offenses, you have to keep in mind is that their conviction records often understate the crime that they actually committed because the vast majority of cases in criminal courts are resolved through plea bargains, which means that that the charges ultimately reflect some sort of downgrading in exchange for a guilty plea and a reduced sentence. So you know, the idea that the people who are behind bars in this country don't pose a significant danger or having gotten a second chance. It's just nonsense. I mean, 40 percent of felony convictions result in a state prison sentence, only 40 percent. That's it.

Bush, quote, \"I've met foreign leaders who can't go out and say this publicly, but boy, they look at you and say, you've got to win this. You've got to beat this guy. We need a new policy.\" Those people love John Kerry. Now, he was asked which leaders told you that, John Kerry? What did you say to them when they said that? And what new policies did you promise and how did they pledge to help you? John Kerry said he wasn't going to be specific because it was his right to keep his conversations with foreign leaders confidential. That's absolutely necessary for leadership. You see the point? Well, early today, the White House sent a letter to the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi calling the ongoing impeachment effort, quote, \"illegitimate and unconstitutional,\" and furthermore, saying it will not cooperate unless a full House vote is held to begin a formal inquiry. Congressman Devin Nunes is the Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee, its former Chairman, when the House was under Republican control. He joins us tonight. Congressman, thanks so much for coming on. So if I'm understanding this correctly, the White House is saying once you make it official, we will cooperate, but not until then."

We're not going to provide you any documents and unless the House of Representatives votes, like has been the tradition, if not, you can hold us in contempt and we'll see you in court in a matter of months, maybe important months."

But we do have tradition. Right? And you have precedents. And it's relatively recent, right? You had the impeachment of Bill Clinton, and the impeachment of Richard Nixon. So if you're really going to truly get this through the House, open up an investigation, pass it, vote to impeach a President, send it to the Senate for trial, you have to have a system of government where you have something that is fair, where both sides can actually go out and gather evidence."

So as many people know who have been on Twitter, especially if you're a conservative, it's quite often that things randomly happen to you. You lose followers, some people can't see what you post on Twitter, you get shadow banned. In my case, what was happening is, they were allowing anonymous accounts, hundreds of them to slander and defame me on a daily basis, almost a minute by minute basis. Finally, a judge said okay, Twitter, that's it, rejected all of their arguments. And now that case is going to move forward in Virginia. And you know, I think it's really important for the American people understand that, you know, Twitter is a -- Twitter is a public company. Do their Board members really know what Twitter has been up to?"

And it made a small number of people really rich, they should be ashamed of themselves. And so if nothing else, I hope that this suit calls attention to that because it deserves more attention than it gets. Congressman, thanks so much and I hope you'll come back."

Probably illegal. I stand strongly and proudly with the great police officers and law enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota. See you Thursday night.\" The Mayor responded quote, \"Someone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to help pay for the extra pay our officers will be putting in while he is in town.\" But police are already angry at the Mayor because new city policy prevents off duty officers from wearing their uniforms at political rallies.

It turns out unelected bureaucrats can prevent you from doing it if they so choose. And in this case, they so choose. The latest example, on Sunday, the White House announced that U.S. troops would be withdrawn from Northern Syria, and in Washington, people went insane immediately."
