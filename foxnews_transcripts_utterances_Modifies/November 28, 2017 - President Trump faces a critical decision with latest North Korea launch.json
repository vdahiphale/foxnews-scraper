The research and development effort on their part to continue building ballistic missiles that could threaten everywhere in the world. In response, the South Koreans have fired some pinpoint missiles into the water. The bottom line is it's a continued effort to build a ballistic missile threat that endangers world peace, regional peace, and certainly the United States.",

It landed about, as you see here on this map, 1,000 kilometers down in the Sea of Japan. This is now the 24th missile launched in 2017, 16 missile tests. And you see the rack up of the missile tests, missile launches and tests over recent years. Today, just moments ago, we got word that President Trump spoke to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan about this launch today. The two leaders, according to the White House agreeing that the North Korean regime's provocative actions are undermining its security, further isolating it from the international community. The leaders, quote, \"reaffirmed their commitment to combat the North Korean threat.\"  But how are they doing that, and what is next with this? Let's bring in our panel: Joining me here at the White House, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio; from St. Louis, Matt Schlapp, contributor with The Hill, and from our Washington bureau, Tom Rogan, commentary writer for The Washington Examiner. Tom, first to you, it seems like what has been happening has not been working. And this pause that we saw from North Korea ending today in a big fashion.",

I think there will be some shock in the White House and the Pentagon and in the intelligence community about just what has happened here. I think for President Trump now, the critical decision is, do you exert pressure on China, specifically Chinese financial entities, or do you take military action? Because what we have seen with this test is the failure of, or the unwillingness I think more likely, of the Chinese government to put the kind of pressure on to Kim Jong-un's regime that would be necessary to force him to the table.",

But the problem is with even that strategy, it just takes one to get through that system, that defense, and we are in a whole new world of chaos. I don't blame Donald Trump for this. You can say his diplomatic approach has not worked yet, but he inherited a 20-year problem, which was to kick the can down the road. And now he's faced -- this is the biggest challenge of the Trump presidency -- he is faced with terrible options, and he's got to do something that takes away this nuclear menace from reaching our allies and maybe even our own shores.",
