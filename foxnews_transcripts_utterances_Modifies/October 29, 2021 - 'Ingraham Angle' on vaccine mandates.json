Now, before flying off to Europe today, Joe Biden made a personal mission to Capitol Hill to urge Democrats to pass his so-called infrastructure plan. \"I don't think it's hyperbole to say that the White House - that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week. I need you to help me,\" he said. \"I need your votes\". Probably did that weird whisper thing. Well, Pelosi echoed his plea telling her members, \"Don't embarrass the president by voting down the infrastructure bill\".

Now, if anything, with the spike in prices coming and the dimming power of the dollar, Biden's numbers are just going to go lower. Today, the GDP numbers were released, and the news was as usual, under Biden, disappointing. The fact is, even at a reduced price of $1.5 trillion, a staggering amount still, it's still way more than we can afford. We are literally sticking our grandchildren with these bills. It is immoral.

Supposedly, this is how they're going to pretend to pay for all this. A 15 percent corporate minimum tax, also applies to foreign income for U.S. based multinationals; 1 percent excise on corporate stock buybacks; 5 percent surtax on incomes above 10 million, additional 3 percent for incomes above 25 million; 3.8 percent tax on active business income for high earners. And, well, don't think for a second that these punitive new taxes are actually going to pay for the left spending plans. They never do. It's all part of an accounting game to win over the gullible, squishy Republicans and moderate Democrats. And that's why it's important to look beyond the price tag. Again, it's a steep price tag. These numbers are just easily manipulated, because they game the CBO scoring process. What's actually more important and far more disturbing, is what's in this bill. Here's a rundown if you can read that little font there. It's a massive expansion of welfare programs for universal pre propaganda K to expanded health care subsidies. Even when funding expires, there'll be an enormous resistance to doing away with any of these plans. Government programs never die, remember. They just get fatter, and more permanent. And $550 billion ends up going to climate change programs? Oh, I'm sure there's no - no graft in there. No payoffs of the (ph) Solyndra nature to FOJs, friends of Joe. This is all just another wealth transfer to left-wing activists. They are going to take your money and give it to their Greeniac friends.

We're going to go from being an independent, energy self-sufficient, first world country, will have a - will had a reliable grid to be almost a third world nation, forced to beg others for help, when wind and sunshine can't sustain us.

Your dollars not going to go as far. Our debt and deficit will further explode. We're going to be worse off than we are now.

And I could tell you, the Republican Study Committee, which I lead, we've been sifting through the bill all afternoon. It's just as socialist as the framework that they had before. But it's not just the price tag, it's what's in the bill. This bill will shut down your kids' daycare, or according to a left leaning think tank, you'll have to pay $13,000 more per year to send your kid to daycare if this bill passes. It will increase your gas taxes to heat your home. It's going to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to presumably rifle through and spy on your bank account records.

This bill gives tax credits to illegal aliens that could amount to say, for example, an illegal alien with four young kids, who pays no taxes, who's a low income family.

It goes back to the development of the right of school choice, which goes all the way back to Governor Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, in the 1980s, and has grown and grown and grown. Jeb Bush was a great leader on it in Florida. And when DeSantis ran for governor against an African-American candidate, he got one out of every five African-American women who voted, voted for DeSantis, because they wanted school choice. And they were tired of the government unions. They were tired of the government schools that were failing their children. And now, in Virginia, you have a vivid case study of this, because at a recent debate, Governor McAuliffe, who you think that he knows better, said that he did not believe parents had a right to be involved in their children's schools. And that went over so badly to their credit. Glenn Youngkin and his campaign had an ad up the next morning, pounding this home and communicating it to Virginians. There's been a - in the poll that came out today, there's a 25-point shift among parents away from Terry McAuliffe towards Glenn Youngkin. It's also true across the whole state on issues in general. And the McAuliffe's strategy of trying to make this a national election is over U.S. Senate seat, bringing in Barack Obama, bringing in Biden, bringing in Kamala Harris, bringing in Stacey Abrams, has totally backfired. Ironically, it's the governor who should have known a lot about Virginia, trying to run a national campaign is the business leader, who's a reformer, who is stuck, very disciplined to state issues, repealing the tax on food, cutting the tax on gasoline, creating jobs, working on public safety.

They have thousands and thousands of employees who have been working throughout this entire pandemic in the state of Florida.

So they are trying to rewrite these contracts, and they are using the heavy hand of the federal government. Look, if the federal government says it ain't going to contract with you, ain't going to pay you unless you do what they say, most businesses are going to have to do what they say. That is just the reality. So we felt that it's going to be detrimental to Florida to see people lose their jobs, and that we really needed to step in and file this lawsuit.

That is totally, totally off the rails in terms of any type of legal authority. So we're standing up. This is not the only thing we are doing.

Now, before flying off to Europe today, Joe Biden made a personal mission to Capitol Hill to urge Democrats to pass his so-called infrastructure plan. \"I don't think it's hyperbole to say that the White House - that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week. I need you to help me,\" he said. \"I need your votes\". Probably did that weird whisper thing. Well, Pelosi echoed his plea telling her members, \"Don't embarrass the president by voting down the infrastructure bill\". Reportedly, some members actually began breaking out and chance, not let's go Brandon, but vote, vote, vote. But to what end?"

And yet, they're the gang who can't shoot straight. Plus, they've been wrong in their predictions on every major issue, and their confidence on that Afghan army and their insistence that inflation will be transitory. And tonight, we'll add to their newest list of failed predictions, that passing these bills even pared down, will somehow be a lifeline to boosting their popularity. Now, if anything, with the spike in prices coming and the dimming power of the dollar, Biden's numbers are just going to go lower. Today, the GDP numbers were released, and the news was as usual, under Biden, disappointing. The fact is, even at a reduced price of $1.5 trillion, a staggering amount still, it's still way more than we can afford. We are literally sticking our grandchildren with these bills. It is immoral. But the spinmeisters in the Biden cabinet, oh, they were all a happy talk today. I was howling watching them. And it's like kind of trying to sell sand in the Mojave Desert."

Supposedly, this is how they're going to pretend to pay for all this. A 15 percent corporate minimum tax, also applies to foreign income for U.S. based multinationals; 1 percent excise on corporate stock buybacks; 5 percent surtax on incomes above 10 million, additional 3 percent for incomes above 25 million; 3.8 percent tax on active business income for high earners. And, well, don't think for a second that these punitive new taxes are actually going to pay for the left spending plans. They never do. It's all part of an accounting game to win over the gullible, squishy Republicans and moderate Democrats. And that's why it's important to look beyond the price tag. Again, it's a steep price tag. These numbers are just easily manipulated, because they game the CBO scoring process. What's actually more important and far more disturbing, is what's in this bill. Here's a rundown if you can read that little font there. It's a massive expansion of welfare programs for universal pre propaganda K to expanded health care subsidies. Even when funding expires, there'll be an enormous resistance to doing away with any of these plans. Government programs never die, remember. They just get fatter, and more permanent. And $550 billion ends up going to climate change programs? Oh, I'm sure there's no - no graft in there. No payoffs of the (ph) Solyndra nature to FOJs, friends of Joe. This is all just another wealth transfer to left-wing activists. They are going to take your money and give it to their Greeniac friends. By the way, included in the climate slush fund is $320 billion for something called green energy and electric vehicle subsidies.

Because to the CCP, it's like taking candy from a Biden. It's easy. Even if Biden passes his massive bill, all that climate spending will have zero impact on future warming. China's going to make sure that. In the meantime, it will be full throttle backward for the United States. We're going to go from being an independent, energy self-sufficient, first world country, will have a - will had a reliable grid to be almost a third world nation, forced to beg others for help, when wind and sunshine can't sustain us. Meanwhile, our economy is just going to continue to stagnate or even contract. And Americans are going to see their savings and their income just eroded by the rising tide of inflation. Your dollars not going to go as far. Our debt and deficit will further explode. We're going to be worse off than we are now. That's why Democrats pinning their reelection hopes on this bill, oh, my gosh, they're in for a big surprise. When Americans go to the polls in a year, do Democrats really believe that voters are going to be pulling a lever for a standard of living that's now lower than it was a year or two earlier? I don't think so. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Indiana Congressman Jim banks, Republican Study Committee Chair; Stephen Miller, founder of America First Legal and former Trump senior advisor; as well as Mollie Hemingway, Fox News contributor, and author of the new best seller \"Rigged\". Congressman Banks, this is turning out to be a - just a lose lose for the Democrats. If they don't pass the bill, it's a failure. But if either of these bills passes, it's an economic disaster."

Today, Joe Biden wanted so badly to go to Europe and brag to his foreign leader buddies that he passed a Green New Deal bill today. But the Democrats didn't give him that victory, and thank God. But it's too premature to declare victory, because at 2 o'clock today, they came out with a framework for the new bill. And I could tell you, the Republican Study Committee, which I lead, we've been sifting through the bill all afternoon. It's just as socialist as the framework that they had before. But it's not just the price tag, it's what's in the bill. This bill will shut down your kids' daycare, or according to a left leaning think tank, you'll have to pay $13,000 more per year to send your kid to daycare if this bill passes. It will increase your gas taxes to heat your home. It's going to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to presumably rifle through and spy on your bank account records. It gives amnesty to illegals, child tax credits and tuition assistance to illegals. I could go on and on. But this bill is just as dangerous as it was before.

But the Biden administration keeps putting forth these arbitrary deadlines, or dates, by which they want something passed without dealing with the actual fundamental problem, which is not only was Biden elected not to do this type of spending. In fact, polls show that people are not looking for increased spending at a time they have such economic concern. But to handle coronavirus, that's the one thing he - COVID, he did - what he promised he would do, has failed to do that. They did not want him to tear down border policy. They did not want him to destroy foreign policy. They did not want all of these things that he's now failing to get done. And there is not momentum there, because this isn't actually what ails the country. And they're just trying to do this as distraction."

I want to, first of all, salute Congressman Jim banks for breaking down what's in this bill. You can follow the Republican Study Committee on social media and read it for yourself. But just to illustrate your point, Laura, this bill taxes American energy, American energy to make it more expensive, to heat your home, so we can become more reliant on foreign energy. This bill gives tax credits to illegal aliens that could amount to say, for example, an illegal alien with four young kids, who pays no taxes, who's a low income family. They could get over $14,000 a year in free cash from the IRS under this bill. Plus, amnesty, plus unlimited foreign workers for big tech. Plus, on the corporate tax side, it takes a sledgehammer to American manufacturers by taxing losses in their competitions with China. And by getting rid of the incredible incentives President Trump passed to bring jobs to America, that now are going to be ripped out if this bill passes. It should be called the 'Made in China' bill."

This is not in any way, what we were told would happen if we voted the way that the media wanted us to vote in the last election.

Here now is Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, author of the forthcoming book, \"Beyond Biden\", which is out this Tuesday.

It goes back to the development of the right of school choice, which goes all the way back to Governor Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, in the 1980s, and has grown and grown and grown. Jeb Bush was a great leader on it in Florida. And when DeSantis ran for governor against an African-American candidate, he got one out of every five African-American women who voted, voted for DeSantis, because they wanted school choice. And they were tired of the government unions. They were tired of the government schools that were failing their children. And now, in Virginia, you have a vivid case study of this, because at a recent debate, Governor McAuliffe, who you think that he knows better, said that he did not believe parents had a right to be involved in their children's schools. And that went over so badly to their credit. Glenn Youngkin and his campaign had an ad up the next morning, pounding this home and communicating it to Virginians. There's been a - in the poll that came out today, there's a 25-point shift among parents away from Terry McAuliffe towards Glenn Youngkin. It's also true across the whole state on issues in general. And the McAuliffe's strategy of trying to make this a national election is over U.S. Senate seat, bringing in Barack Obama, bringing in Biden, bringing in Kamala Harris, bringing in Stacey Abrams, has totally backfired. Ironically, it's the governor who should have known a lot about Virginia, trying to run a national campaign is the business leader, who's a reformer, who is stuck, very disciplined to state issues, repealing the tax on food, cutting the tax on gasoline, creating jobs, working on public safety.

And we found among African- Americans a deep resentment of this effort by the left to eliminate grades, to eliminate quality, to eliminate programs of excellence. Because they thought it was cheating their children. So I think this issue could apply everywhere in the country. And I think we'll find out next Tuesday. But right now, at least, if the Fox poll's accurate, and I'm told that it is by some people in the Youngkin campaign. This is going to be a huge shock to the Democratic Party in this country, and to the news media. Because of the margins going to be much bigger than they expect."

Jack, sorry for botching your name several times, and I should know it by now -- Ciattarelli. But thank you for being here.

It doesn't matter who he brings in. The crowds have been very, very low energy and poor turnouts for every one of those people. We've had great rallies up-and-down the state.

And I refuse to a governor of a state that has the highest property tax in the nation, the worst business climate, and according to the IRS census data, number one in our immigration.

What would you say to those who claim these vaccine requirements are illegal, and further, are necessary to help the country emerge, governor, from the pandemic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) FLORIDA",
      "utterance": "I don't think we've ever seen the federal government be this heavy-handed with vaccination mandates before. And so this is definitely uncharted waters. What they are doing with federal contractors, and of course, Laura, as you know, we've got a lot of federal contractors in Florida, people that work in aerospace, in defense. They have thousands and thousands of employees who have been working throughout this entire pandemic in the state of Florida. Now all of the sudden they are basically being put to either lose your job or a do they shot. And some of them have made the decision that that's something that they don't want to do. So they are trying to rewrite these contracts, and they are using the heavy hand of the federal government. Look, if the federal government says it ain't going to contract with you, ain't going to pay you unless you do what they say, most businesses are going to have to do what they say. That is just the reality. So we felt that it's going to be detrimental to Florida to see people lose their jobs, and that we really needed to step in and file this lawsuit. So I think we've got a really, really good case. But I will say, the federal contractor is going to be a tougher case than the OSHA mandate, which has not yet come out. That is totally, totally off the rails in terms of any type of legal authority. So we're standing up. This is not the only thing we are doing. We are going to have a special session of the Florida legislature to provide protections for people and will very likely be litigating against the OSHA rule, if that ever actually comes out."

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Look, Laura, I would draw a distinction between a state mandate and a federal mandate. I'm not necessarily -- I don't think the state should require COVID shots either. In fact, I said very clearly today that will not happen with the school children. That's a parent's decision. That is what Florida law says, and we will vigorously enforce that. But states do have residual powers, and they are able to do certain things that the founders didn't want to entrust in the federal government. The federal government is a limited enumerated power. It's supposed to be. I know in this day and age, it runs roughshod over everything. But I think that it really is important that we stand up for the order. And I think we'll be successful. I think we'll be successful in the 11th Circuit eventually. I think Texas will be successful, whatever they do in the Fifth Circuit. So yes, the Supreme Court may resolve it, but I think at that point, look, as long as we save the jobs, by the time that decision would come down, I think we'd probably be in pretty good shape no matter what. So let's just save people's jobs. They should not have their livelihood tied to these mandates."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

He was very dismissive, and he said, well, look, they are working, 98 percent of blah-di, blah-di, blah-di, got the vaccine, got the jab. And so these are successful in getting our economy moving and getting the workplace humming again. Were you surprised by that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "So here's what I would say, Laura. Just look at September. The economy underperformed. It was about 194,000 jobs nationwide, way below what you would want. But of those 194,000, Florida created 84,500. And so we are a state that has resisted mandates. We've resisted lockdowns and restrictions, and empowered people to be able to make their own decisions. And we are growing jobs and our GDP much faster than states that have embraced the lockdown mentality or have embraced the mandates and vaccine passports. So that is just what we are seen so far. So I think if you want to get the economy going, you would want to do policies that are more in line with what Florida is doing, not what some of the states that are using the heavy hand of the government in this regard."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "As health officials rush to vaccinate kids and shame those who do not want to do so, what about the actual numbers of child deaths? Statistician Emma Woodhouse, she took a look under the hood of the CDC data, and noticed something fishy. So while the CDC claims there have been nearly 750 deaths among the zero to 17 cohort, the National Center for Health Statistics shows just 558. Now, while every single one of these fatalities is tragic, of course, inflating the stats by 37 percent, why are they doing that? It could have major policy consequences. Here now is Phil Kerpen, president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, and Dr. Peter McCullough, internist, cardiologist, epidemiologist based in Dallas. Phil, why is the risk to kids being inflated? What point does this serve?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHIL KERPEN, PRESIDENT, THE COMMITTEE TO UNLEASH PROSPERITY",
      "utterance": "I think it does two things. One, it keeps the fear narrative and the control from the government alive a little bit longer. But two, I think, which is much more important at this point, it justifies the otherwise indefensible bad decisions that are politicians and our public health officials have made over the last year-and-a-half, two years. Rather than acknowledge error, they are trying to overstate the risk and the dangers to children to justify the massive disruptions to their lives, the educational harms, the mental health harms, everything else that they've imposed to this point. And the director of the CDC should know that the verified death certificate-based count from the National Center for Health Statistics is the official count, and that the tracker is just whatever the states have submitted, that it gets revised all the time, that it has frequent errors. So the fact that she would pull that tracker number -- if it wasn't deliberate deception, then she doesn't know her own data really at all, which I think would be even worse."

      "utterance": "It's what I call vaccine hubris. None of the vaccines work well enough or safe enough to be taken up in such a hubris. They are certainly not good enough to be mandated in any way, shape, or form. And parents should be aware that Tracy Hoeg from the University of California at Davis has published that a child is more likely to be hospitalized with myocarditis then be hospitalized with COVID-19 respiratory illness. So taking the vaccine is not a favorable trade-off. And Ron Kostoff has published an analysis, and these have both been presented to the FDA, that a child unfortunately is more likely to die after the vaccine then actually die with COVID-19, the respiratory illness. So it's not a favorable trade-off to have children vaccinated. The American College of Pediatrics has that number you just mentioned. It's actually at 499 in their report."

We've just had a randomized child come with monoclonal antibody, there was an 85 percent risk reduction in hospitalization and death.
