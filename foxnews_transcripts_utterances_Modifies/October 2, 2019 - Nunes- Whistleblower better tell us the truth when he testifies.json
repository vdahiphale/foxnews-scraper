This is a very significant question in understanding this whole picture. It is not to be overlooked here.  We learned today in a New York Times report that the whistleblower had a colleague, first convey his concerns to the CIA's top lawyer. But then, had reservations about how that, avenue was unfolding, for him or her. And then, took the complaint to an aide who worked with Adam Schiff.  Now, Schiff's office says that they did not receive the actual content of the complaint. Only the quote, outlines. And that they advised that the whistleblower should get a lawyer and should go to the inspector general.  But watch what Adam Schiff says about this when asked directly back on the day this whole story started to unfold on September 17th.",

We got that on -- you know, Republicans received that press release and we said, what on earth is going on here? All of you and the press got this. Why is this being pumped up this big? A few days later after a briefing, Schiff briefs us a little bit on this and claims he doesn't know exactly what this is but it must be really important. I mean, those are just two sets of facts that clearly he is trying to pump up and promote this story. And now we find out that yes because his staff knew about it ahead of time.

And very -- he took those charges very seriously because they were very serious charges and so they waited for Mueller to come out with this report. And lo and behold, the Mueller report comes out and it was all a conspiracy theory. So Americans sitting here are saying, OK, our government was completely hamstrung for two years, frozen, and nothing was getting done in Washington while we spend tens of millions of our tax dollars chasing a conspiracy theory. How did that happen?

Amber Guyger is sentenced to 10 years in prison. Now throughout the day, there was heart wrenching testimony from those who were close to both Guyger and the victim Botham Jean. Amber Guyger's mom said her daughter told her on multiple occasions that she wished she had died instead of Botham Jean. And the victim's father called his son a sweet boy who tried to live an honest life. The most surprising testimony came from Jean's brother Brant, who recommended that Amber Guyger devote her life to Christ and then said this. Watch.",

The defense said Amber Guyger was not a racist, not a dangerous criminal and the shooting was so unique we may never see another like it. Remember, Guyger was still in her police uniform when she entered the wrong apartment and opened fire on who she thought was a burglar. Guyger was facing between five and 99 years in prison but the jury was told they could also consider the sudden passion defense, meaning she felt provoked, which carries a sentence of two to 20 years. When she was given the higher sentence of 10 years, it was met with boos and cheers by a crowd outside the courtroom with one woman calling it a slap in the face.

This is a very significant question in understanding this whole picture. It is not to be overlooked here. We learned today in a New York Times report that the whistleblower had a colleague, first convey his concerns to the CIA's top lawyer. But then, had reservations about how that, avenue was unfolding, for him or her. And then, took the complaint to an aide who worked with Adam Schiff. Now, Schiff's office says that they did not receive the actual content of the complaint. Only the quote, outlines. And that they advised that the whistleblower should get a lawyer and should go to the inspector general. But watch what Adam Schiff says about this when asked directly back on the day this whole story started to unfold on September 17th."

We first learned about this about three weeks ago on a -- on a late Friday night press release that was -- that was multiple pages long, multiple paragraphs long. We got that on -- you know, Republicans received that press release and we said, what on earth is going on here? All of you and the press got this. Why is this being pumped up this big? A few days later after a briefing, Schiff briefs us a little bit on this and claims he doesn't know exactly what this is but it must be really important. I mean, those are just two sets of facts that clearly he is trying to pump up and promote this story. And now we find out that yes because his staff knew about it ahead of time. And look, the thing that's still not clear is when did they actually find out about it? But we still don't have a date when did this whistleblower actually start talking to the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee."

So, obviously, it would have been easier, I think, to say, yes, they contacted us, we told them exactly what to do. That's what they're saying now. But it raises the question because it was asked several times. So, why did he say no so many times when that -- you know, turns out to not be the case here? I want to ask you a little bit about what's going on."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "No. But look, it's looked like from, at least, the stories that were written early about this. OK? That are from knowing Russia hoax writers, OK? Journalists, OK? Then, retweeted out by Democrats on the committee. Now, we learned the Democrats on the committee knew about it. So, it has all the markings of the Russia hoax."

And I think we deserve to know what's going on in the building, and the American people do as well. And I have to say, this whole process has been completely ridiculous and propped up by a complicit and compliant mainstream media to the -- to the Democrat Party without facts. Listen, Adam Schiff lied about having stone-cold evidence about Russia collusion -- it wasn't called the task for it. He lied when he passed his own words off as President Trumps to Congress and the American people in the transcript, and he lied about this whistleblower. As you played the video on September 17th, saying, he didn't know anything about it."

But the part of the transcript where he specifically talks about Joe Biden and wanting the Ukrainians to look into Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, and that he should talk to Rudy Giuliani about that.

I don't speak on behalf of Rudy Giuliani, but I can tell you that Rudy Giuliani has been the president's personal attorney for a long time. And Donald Trump when he was just a citizen, not elected to office yet, was the center of Russian which hoax -- witch hunt hoax scam, perpetrated on him as a private citizen."

I mean, I know about the server and about Hillary Clinton. All of that stuff that people are concerned about with regard to the origins. But the link with Rudy Giuliani and Joe Biden is what has obviously raised this impeachment question. And that is one that the president was asked to address today.

And if you'll remember it was President Zelensky of Ukraine on that call who talked about draining the swamp.

But what enhances that is the fact that Schiff had multiple opportunities to say that this has occurred. Indeed, he was asked about it directly, as you pointed out earlier, and he skated around it. He, you know, he dissembled you know, depending on how you look at it, he might even allied. Now look, it may well be, Martha, that the procedures that that Schiff's people urge this whistleblower to pursue, were the proper ones and that might have been all there was to it. But if that's the case, there was nothing to stop Adam Schiff from coming clean about this in the first place --"

      "speaker": "HUME",

I was just briefed about it by staff but I thought I would let it be known that this occurred. That would have been the normal way to do it. And Schiff is -- Schiff is in a particularly difficult position in this sense, Martha, that he made all these extravagant claims, as you -- I guess you pointed out earlier, about what was -- you know, about the Russia collusion matter, and they all turned out not to be true. So he carries a certain weight in terms of his credibility, a certain burden in terms of his credibility, and I don't think this helps it at all and I don't think it helps the case against President Trump even if the actual procedures and actions were on the up and up."

What about Jeff Mason's question. It seemed to touch a nerve with the president."

And I don't think they have a good answer to that. And that's why it was improper for the President to bring Biden into a conversation that was supposedly about the 2016 investigation origins matter that is being looked at by the Attorney General and others. So that's the problem. And then, of course, he -- the President launched into this harshly worded attack. He attacked Jeff Mason, you know, accused him of being fake news and all that when he asked a perfectly valid question. I don't think this sort of freak out that we're seeing from the President over this stuff, angry, though he may legitimately be, helps his cause, because it's not what people like about him. And if you're going to get into an impeachment fight with a Congress, you want as many people to like you as possible and I don't think this helps."

We directed them in the other way. You just wonder what would be the reaction of the President said, you know what, in hindsight, I wish I hadn't brought that up with him in that phone call. It really wasn't relevant to the larger issue that I wanted to discuss with him. And I don't think I would do it if I had to do it again. What would be the reaction?"

So why is Barr getting brought into the impeachment story and all of this getting co-mingled? My next guest says Ukraine is a scandal, Barr's investigation of Mueller's report is not.

That is not the same thing as the issue with the Bidens and the conversation with Ukraine. With Ukraine, I mean, this is well known that there is a current probe by U.S. attorney Durham and the Attorney General Barr as well as the Justice Department inspector general to look at the overall investigation of the Trump campaign both in 2016 and then later, I think when he's president and all the decisions that were made. Those I think are pretty fair game and they are very important questions that should be answered. And there is no reason to say that it's improper for the president to say, you know, I'd like you to work with the attorney general on that. It's a completely different thing than having the president bring up with a foreign head of state to look into or investigate potential corruption of his likely rival in the 2020 election."

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, wherever he's going to take it where it leads. And look, I mean, the American people actually support this investigation because for two years during the Mueller probe they were told that the president of the United States was a traitor, that he was working on behalf of the Russians, and in Adam Schiff's words that he had committed crimes beyond the scope of Watergate. And very -- he took those charges very seriously because they were very serious charges and so they waited for Mueller to come out with this report. And lo and behold, the Mueller report comes out and it was all a conspiracy theory. So Americans sitting here are saying, OK, our government was completely hamstrung for two years, frozen, and nothing was getting done in Washington while we spend tens of millions of our tax dollars chasing a conspiracy theory. How did that happen? And there were polls right after the end of the Mueller investigation 55 percent of Americans said there was bias against Trump in the FBI, and 61 percent wanted to appoint a special counsel to investigate the investigators."

She claims to have mistaken his apartment for her own and said that she thought he was an intruder after getting -- after she got home from a long shift. Breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher joins us now with the back story here tonight. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. Breaking news right now. Amber Guyger is sentenced to 10 years in prison. Now throughout the day, there was heart wrenching testimony from those who were close to both Guyger and the victim Botham Jean. Amber Guyger's mom said her daughter told her on multiple occasions that she wished she had died instead of Botham Jean. And the victim's father called his son a sweet boy who tried to live an honest life. The most surprising testimony came from Jean's brother Brant, who recommended that Amber Guyger devote her life to Christ and then said this. Watch."

The lead prosecutors ask the jury to sentence Amber Guyger to 28 years because this week Botham Jean would have been 28. The defense said Amber Guyger was not a racist, not a dangerous criminal and the shooting was so unique we may never see another like it. Remember, Guyger was still in her police uniform when she entered the wrong apartment and opened fire on who she thought was a burglar. Guyger was facing between five and 99 years in prison but the jury was told they could also consider the sudden passion defense, meaning she felt provoked, which carries a sentence of two to 20 years. When she was given the higher sentence of 10 years, it was met with boos and cheers by a crowd outside the courtroom with one woman calling it a slap in the face. Texas state prisoners serve an average of 60 percent of their sentences, meaning Guyger could be out as early as 2025. Martha?"

      "utterance": "Terrible story tonight. We just learned that at least seven people died after a World War II airplane crashed shortly after takeoff at Connecticut's Bradley International Airport. Thirteen people were on board the B-17 bomber when it reported getting problem gaining altitude. Six of them were transported to Hartford hospital. The plane was nicknamed 909 and had been repaired after previously crashing at a Pennsylvania air show back in 1987. An investigation is underway. And President Xi Jinping of China had people working around the clock to make the celebration of 70 years of communist China a huge success and a showcase for Chinese military might showing up a hypersonic missile that they claim could reach the United States in 30 minutes. But it was marred by the rising chaos in Hong Kong, now in its 18th week. Police there are shooting a teenage protester in the chest. Meanwhile, uncertainties surrounding the trade war between the two countries filling a big drop in the global markets today. Chinese and U.S. officials are said to get back to those talks in Washington next week. Dr. Michael Pillsbury decades of experiencing U.S.-China relations has advised several presidents including President Trump and wrote \"The Hundred-Year Marathon: China's Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower.\" Thank you very much, Dr. Pillsbury. Good to have you here tonight. So, several things to get to here. This Hong Kong violence, how much of a catalyst is the shooting of this young man?"

But it could increase the use of violence in Hong Kong because the police are frankly so angry. The police have been taunted by the demonstrators. There's lots of high school kids who come out on what they called flash mobs in various shopping centers and all over the airport area sometime."

The Pentagon had thought this was the case. The rapid increase is what's a great concern. They used to be happy with 20 ICBMs. The Chinese would tell everybody over the last 30 years or so, 20 ICBMs is enough. Now they suddenly go to 90, they said it's 10 H bombs per missile, that's 900 H bombs that could the U.S. in 30 minutes. After the Chinese have been saying well, we need to cut off all nuclear weapons production in the world, and they are continuing to produce atom bombs and H bombs. So, this is a surprise to a lot of people. That wasn't the only new weapon that they revealed at this parade yesterday."

Some people I heard Steve Bannon say that this is the reason that President Trump was elected. And they've developed a 150-page draft agreement, this is where things were as of May 1st. That's the foundation. That's was called by Steve Mnuchin and others 90 percent of the way there. So, we're close. But I think the problem has been where Hong Kong and the trade talks are related. Everybody knows that Chinese agree to things they won't really abided by later on. They're not only abiding by their agreement in Hong Kong either. So, the enforcement mechanisms which will have kind of a judicial nature to them, appeals and then punishment. They haven't only agreed to that, and they reneged on some key things back in May. So next Thursday and Friday, Martha, we're going to find out when the Chinese delegation gets --"

They've accused him of being corrupt, of extorting, of colluding, that's all the things they have done. And she has been now the queen of the resistance.

Let's just say Donald Trump put a secret server in Trump tower, OK? Adam Schiff slaps him with a bunch of subpoenas and then he acid washes 30,000 e-mails and said the e-mails were just about golf. And then some crooked FBI agents come in, they gave Rudy immunity, and then they let Trump off the hook. And then they started spying on the Biden campaign. That's not a scandal?
