But it makes perfect sense coming from a leftist because to them talk is more important than action. And Lightfoot much prefers the race conversation over the crime one. She's the Andrew Cuomo of Chicago, only her bodies aren't piling up in nursing homes. They're piling up in the streets, and they're brown and they're black. And they're young.

The loudest voices shouting about racial inequality are often a weak need virtue signaling Caucasians. Yet what have they done to correct the injustice and the inequality? Besides putting a BLM sign in their front yard and a rainbow coexist bumper sticker on their Tesla? Isn't the time they resign their jobs to make room and correct this injustice every lily white leftist in a comfy editorial position at a magazine or a T.V. show or college. It's time to move on and fix your privilege. Anna Wintour Say hello to Vanessa Bush. Jimmy Kimmel say hello to Chris Tucker.

And she's saying, OK, like, you know, punching up, don't punch downs. Like how about a more important question is, is this supposed to be a punch? Are you trying to make people laugh? I think that is a very important distinction. Because intention matters in everything else in life. It matters when a person kills another person.

The whole point is that the things so you'd go in and and, you know, I feel for but you know, in my case, like I woke up this morning, I knew, I felt awful, I knew I wouldn't be funny, but I said, you know, just go to GUTFELD show.

They are putting their mental health first not just about the Olympics and winning medals and putting others first taking that into consideration. I think that's so important. And as far as that picture from China, I mean, come on, this is not a beauty pageant. They're supposed to be showcasing their talent and their strength and their skills, not what you look like. I mean, she does, or he does, she does look a little constipated but -- at the end of the day, it's what you bring home."

And Linda Blair who portrayed the demon possessed Reagan in the original says she hasn't been asked to be involved. That's outrageous. And that decision has head spinning. You writers! This is much to the dismay of the film's fans who insist the power of Christ should compel them to give Blair a cameo. Still, Blair says she doesn't expect anything will change but a maybe the producers are worried Blair will be too expensive, especially when they could just go to Kats place and film her waking up from a tequila Tuesday. Kat, you like me grew up Catholic? This movie terrified me."

My mom didn't want me out in Los Angeles at the blessing salt. So, yes, it terrifies me. And I'm agnostic. And so, I also feel like the fact that this terrifies me, is that like an acknowledgment that maybe I do think God is real if I think maybe demons are real. I don't know. Makes you think."

I wish this movie was real because I would love -- imagine if to be demonic possession was like an added variable in our lives. Like, it was like, oh, did you hear what happened to Steve? Yes, possessed by the devil. We would have so many fewer problems. If that was a, if that was like it's like having a Land Shark could happen at any time."
