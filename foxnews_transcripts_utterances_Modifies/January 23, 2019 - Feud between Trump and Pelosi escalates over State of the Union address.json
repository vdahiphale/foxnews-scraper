So, we just found out that she's canceled it I think that's a great blotch on the incredible country that we all love. But she blames security, but she knew it wasn't a security problem. I just got back from Iraq. I was very safe in Iraq, and I felt very safe. We had great, great security. If we can handle Iraq, we can handle the middle of Washington. We'll do something in the alternative. We'll be talking to you about that at a later date. But what she's doing to the American people, what she's doing to our constitution is a disgrace.",

No, we don't want relief for TPS and DACA recipients just because Trump proposed it? I mean, I agree that having all these things stagnant is bad. But what he put forward was something that was completely palatable. And, you know, I think Nancy Pelosi, she's a spiteful one sometimes. She is and -- she is. And she didn't want Trump to come out. I don't love the State of the Union. I agree with Greg. I think it's boring. I think they somehow make presidents to -- for some reason, look like monarchs in that moment. It's painful to watch.

But, he's on video saying when he returned from Vietnam he was called a baby killer and spit on. You never went to Vietnam. So, Phillips also gave an interview and no one has even talked about this. He was talking about what he was thinking. This guy, Phillips, said these white students were in the process of attacking the black individuals, didn't happen. They were, quote, \"beasts preying on the black individuals.\" And he called the students racist. And he said the looks on the kids' faces were similar to the faces during lynching in the south.

And she's afraid of the truth. We were planning on doing a really very important speech in front of the House and the Senate and the Supreme Court. So, we just found out that she's canceled it I think that's a great blotch on the incredible country that we all love. But she blames security, but she knew it wasn't a security problem. I just got back from Iraq. I was very safe in Iraq, and I felt very safe. We had great, great security. If we can handle Iraq, we can handle the middle of Washington. We'll do something in the alternative. We'll be talking to you about that at a later date. But what she's doing to the American people, what she's doing to our constitution is a disgrace."

But her first -- well, her first letter said please come, give a State of the Union on January 29. The second one said, I think it would not be a good idea because of security concerns. And he's right, like that was lame. The security concerns are not real. I think she would be even stronger at that point to be able to say, no, we're not doing this until the government is reopened.

FBI says child trafficking, terror investigations are being impeded, according to the FBI union. The airports, we know about. The coast guard we know about. You know, to me, this is a real problem. Even the State Department says they're going to have a conference on border security, they can't have that. So -- I mean, this is -- you know, Senator Mark Warner said stop stupidity, stop inflicting shutdown, transferring unnecessary pain and inflicting damage. And you see this in the polls, 71 percent of Americans say this wall is not worth this shutdown. This is hurting the country.

I mean, they're all are on record as having supported not only the border security measures, but now they're having to say no, to no we don't want humanitarian aid. No, we don't want relief for TPS and DACA recipients just because Trump proposed it? I mean, I agree that having all these things stagnant is bad. But what he put forward was something that was completely palatable. And, you know, I think Nancy Pelosi, she's a spiteful one sometimes. She is and -- she is. And she didn't want Trump to come out. I don't love the State of the Union. I agree with Greg. I think it's boring. I think they somehow make presidents to -- for some reason, look like monarchs in that moment. It's painful to watch. But it is an opportunity to get out there and have a lot of people tune in to something who typically wouldn't tune in. And I don't think she wanted President Trump talking about the aspects of crime and the fact that he put forth something that had the DACA relief, that had the TPS relief so that voters in the middle could say, wait a minute, he did put something forth that could have been palatable, as why isn't she biting?"

There has to be a way of breaking out of this prison because you can't be pro-refugee, but also, I think, maybe you should limit -- you should limit merit based immigration. I'm actually more inclined to go with refugees then merit-based because refugees are more grateful. So -- but you can actually have a compromise. Get out of this prison. When refugees come here, they make great citizens, but you have to extreme vet. See, the compromise here is having a number of tools in that shed. It's not just this or this. That's the prison.

He tried with a bunch of people, 20 of them, to go bang drums, invade the National Shrine during mass on this day, and they had to have security block him and locked the doors as he attempted to gain entry. It's also come to our attention this guy never served in Vietnam. He was a marine, but a lot of reports are saying he went AWOL four times and actually had to be put in the brig. But, he's on video saying when he returned from Vietnam he was called a baby killer and spit on. You never went to Vietnam. So, Phillips also gave an interview and no one has even talked about this. He was talking about what he was thinking. This guy, Phillips, said these white students were in the process of attacking the black individuals, didn't happen. They were, quote, \"beasts preying on the black individuals.\" And he called the students racist. And he said the looks on the kids' faces were similar to the faces during lynching in the south.

I see he smirked. I see that. I see -- maybe he was confused. He didn't know what was going on. He didn't assault anybody. He didn't even shout back. How many people can say that, as a teenager, their first instinct wouldn't have been to say something back? To say, no, you're this. They didn't even do that. These kids were on their best behavior, frankly, given what was going on if you the before and after.
