Plus, Tom Brokaw facing a backlash for his on-air comments about Hispanics. The former NBC anchor apologizes for the media's PC police piling on.  I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\"  The pundits were a bit cautious at first when Big League Politics published a 1984 yearbook photo showing Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's page with photos of men in black face and in a KKK outfit, and the Virginian-Pilot confirmed it. The Democratic governor apologized, saying he was deeply sorry for the hurt he has caused by posing for one of the pictures. But as much as Virginia's Democratic establishment urged Northam to quit and the party's presidential candidates demanded his resignation as well, the media turns sharply against his staying in office.  Northam vowed not to resign at a long and painfully awkward news conference yesterday, insisting that while he had not been in the black face photo as a 25-year-old medical student, there was another time that year that he did just that.",

By the way, Sarah Sanders, the press secretary, gave an interview this week and said that about the reduced briefings schedule that she sees a bunch of angry faces in the crowd.

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But the president after scolding the officials for their testimony blames the controversy now on fake news. We'll take a closer look. Liberal pundits and a tidal wave of Democrats slamming Howard Schultz as the former Starbucks chief explores an independent run for the White House, but getting a bit over-caffeinated in trying to protect the Democrats who are trying to ousts Donald Trump. Plus, Tom Brokaw facing a backlash for his on-air comments about Hispanics. The former NBC anchor apologizes for the media's PC police piling on. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" The pundits were a bit cautious at first when Big League Politics published a 1984 yearbook photo showing Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's page with photos of men in black face and in a KKK outfit, and the Virginian-Pilot confirmed it. The Democratic governor apologized, saying he was deeply sorry for the hurt he has caused by posing for one of the pictures. But as much as Virginia's Democratic establishment urged Northam to quit and the party's presidential candidates demanded his resignation as well, the media turns sharply against his staying in office. Northam vowed not to resign at a long and painfully awkward news conference yesterday, insisting that while he had not been in the black face photo as a 25-year-old medical student, there was another time that year that he did just that."

Kristina, Northam took plenty of questions from reporters yesterday. It was a bit of a fiasco in my view. He now says it wasn't him in the photo. But with so many Democrats calling him to resign in Virginia across the country, is there a media drumbeat that is essentially saying it's time for him to go?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK",
      "utterance": "I think it's the first time you have all media outlets that are running a story and agreeing on something literally. I checked this morning and last night. Every single newscast led with this story, so there is a consensus that he should step down. Being in a position of leadership is a privilege and that can be taken away. The fact that he reversed his story shows a lack of trust amongst the people, shows that you don't deserve to be there. If you want to just come out and apologize for it because race is such an important issue especially right now, let's bring to the forefront and let's discuss it. And so yes, you have all outlet's that are essentially, I think, agreeing on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",

But the coverage is all about Democrats like his predecessor Terry McAuliffe, like all these 2020 candidates, saying he should resign immediately. By the way, he's a one-term governor, so there's no --"

      "speaker": "CAPRI CAFARO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER",

      "speaker": "CAFARO",
      "utterance": "You know, I think that obviously this is an issue that is very important to Democrats particularly going into 2020 where race and diversity is playing a huge part in the Democratic platform. So, obviously Democrats are going to come out and say we want him to resign, even though it is a Democrat that is the person that is offending for lack of a better term. So, I mean, I think that this is less about the media coverage and more about the fact that this is so egregious that Democrats and Republicans are agreeing and therefore the media coverage is consistent --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "No, I think it's very much about the media because often ou have liberal pundits defending a Democrat or saying he was bad but he apologized, you don't have that race issue, as you pointed out, Kristina. Even President Trump going on Twitter says how did the media not discover this, how did this not get leaked when he ran for governor in 2017, and why did it get leaked now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARTSINEVELOS",
      "utterance": "There are all kinds of conspiracy theories around that. I don't really think that we should focus too much on that. I think we should focus on wouldn't we be having a different conversation right now had he come out, admitted it, apologized, saying that was somebody from the past, he is no longer like that. I think we forgive. We forgive Charlottesville. We forgive even President Trump when he was -- during his campaign, he said my African-American to a supporter in the crowd. So there are -- has happened before. Race has come up. It's a question of do we forgive as a society."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "By the way, this was broken by a guy named Patrick Healy, 29-year- old former Breitbart journalist, who said a concerned citizen gave him this. I think it is related to the abortion controversy that we are about to talk about. Somebody wanted to retaliate against Ralph Northam. So on that point, earlier in the week, Ralph Northam was doing a radio interview talking about a bill that he supported that would lift restrictions on late-term abortion in Virginia, either health of the mother or the fetus wasn't deemed viable. He came out and said this. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NORTHAM",
      "utterance": "If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That's a remarkable statement. There was plenty of coverage on Fox. But, first two days, nothing on NBC, nothing on MSNBC, nothing on ABC. Two minutes total on CNN and one story on the CBS Evening News. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. So this is actually a case study that should be held up in journalism schools as how not to handle a serious story like this because he is talking about a very extreme law that is outside (INAUDIBLE) belief. So what you get is basically some outlets running (ph) with Associated Press story that focus very heavily on conservative reaction. And what happens so often in these situations is the media waits until conservatives reacts and then writes these stories about conservative seizing and pouncing on extreme Democrat positions in order to cover it that way and to feed this narrative. So that is completely inappropriate. It was really, really bad in this particular case. Again, this should be studied by journalism students for how the media should not handle this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The CBS even did get credit for covering it. But look at the way the lead was. It wasn't that Virginia was considering doing this or that Ralph Northam had made this very controversial comments in radio interview. Here is what it looked like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFF GLOR, CBS NEWS",
      "utterance": "Virginia's governor today responded to critics after a move by Democrats to ease restrictions on late-term abortion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Responded to critics. Republicans pounced. CBS said and only showed the least controversial part of the soundbite. Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",
      "utterance": "Look, I mean, as a former state legislator, I can say that, you know, I need to sit down and read the statute. This is not a place for an abortion debate. But this is what happens when you have very complex laws that are happening at the state level or the federal level and they get like boil down to a 30-second soundbite. There is no question in my mind though that there is a significant difference in the way that conservative-leaning media and mainstream media are covering this issue by the words they choose, by not covering it all, whether they talk about it as infanticide on the right or fake news and try to downplay it on the left. We are getting past the facts and the core aspects of the bill which I think is a disservice in a journalist's standpoint."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Kristina, this is how the big papers covered it. New York Times' headline, Republicans seize on late-term abortion as a potent 2020 issue. So it is a Republican reaction. Washington Post, While acknowledging some Democratic missteps, Virginia Republicans double down on their effort to paint Governor Ralph Northam and other Democrats as radicals who favor infanticide. So, isn't this a story even without the partisan criticism was portrayed as partisan criticism?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARTSINEVELOS",
      "utterance": "This is going to be a partisan issue no matter what. So you have -- you just listed headlines, right? They are going to fulfil the narratives of those organizations. You just mentioned the word \"mainstream media.\" I think that more and more, we have to stop using that term because we are on media. There are lot of viewers that watch Fox. I think it's -- we are part of the media so let's stop with that dialogue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARTSINEVELOS",
      "utterance": "But regarding to just the headlines that you're mentioning right now, now matter what when it comes to abortion, you will have Democrats that maybe wouldn't want to bring it up because it is too sensitive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "You have the Republicans that are calling the Democrats baby killers essentially and then the Democrats that are saying that you're painting people as essentially anti-feminist. So I think that no matter what, you're going to get the soundbites to paint the narrative. KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What I would say is whether you are pro-life or whether you are pro-choice or pro-choice with reservation, a lot of people would be -- who even support abortion rights would be uncomfortable with third trimester abortions. Abortion is done, as the governor says, up until the day the baby is about to be born or in labor --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes. It was a two-minute clip that went viral. It wasn't edited at all. I mean, CBS when they played it on air played a tiny portion of it. But the clip that went viral that caught everyone's attention was two minutes long. It was not edited. Northam defended his position the next day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Always happens. Policies (ph) aren't problem in and of themselves. It is when they are not coupled with serious stories on the policy in question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. I think we have a rough consensus on that covering the policy. Unfortunately, the politics often dominates. By the way, in one poll, 15 percent support abortion at any time during pregnancy. When we come back, President Trump calls out his own intel chief, blames the whole thing on media misquotation. And later, why are all the liberal pundits out to stop Starbucks' Howard Schultz from running as an independent?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It began with a flood of headlines about President Trump's top intel chiefs rebuking his stance on key foreign policy issues from ISIS to North Korea based on congressional testimony from FBI Director Christopher Wray, CIA Director Gina Haspel, and National Intelligence Director Dan Coats. The president fired back with his own rebuke on Twitter. \"The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school.\" And yet after meeting with his appointees, Trump blamed it on the media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I said that they were totally misquoted and they were totally -- it was taken out of context. What I do is I suggest that you call them. They said it was fake news."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Emily, the testimony of Trump's top appointees on the Hill was widely covered. And here the president is saying misquoted, misinterpreted, fake news. Does he have a case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "So I think when he says misquoted, no, he doesn't have a case. Maybe misinterpreted or framed as it shouldn't be. I mean, I don't know. I think there is room between Trump's position and the position you played earlier in the broadcast, what Joe Scarborough was talking about, which is that Trump is wildly out of line with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Doing Moscow's bidding."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, exactly. So I think he was more frustrated with the narrative that the media created after he met with Gina Haspel and other people in the Intelligence Community and seemed to feel they are on the same page. I think there is frustration. He even used the word \"narrative.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right, but frustration with narrative, Kristina, doesn't equal fake news. And sure, the press enjoys exaggerating these rifts within the administration, but these aren't shadowy sources. These people testified. There were cameras. There were spotlights. We have the video. We have the transcripts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARTSINEVELOS",
      "utterance": "Exactly. So then it makes it a very hard defense for the president to come out and blame the media. I think it is unfortunate that it is constantly the media including Fox as well that is being put to blame for a lot of these situations. You have even dialogue between the president and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, constantly putting the blame there if the market is going down or something is wrong there too. So I think that if you are in a power of leadership position, you need to take control -- not control but you need to take, I guess, take the blame every once in a while when things don't go your way or if you have leaders within your own organization like Gina Haspel that are saying North Korea could still be a threat, ISIS could still be a threat, and accept that and work together. I don't see that. There is a lot of divide going on."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, wherever they are going to meet, yeah. OK, so, let me play a soundbite here having to do -- I want to get into sort of tribal quality of these debates over Intelligence. So, one of president's strongest media supporters is Lou Dobbs. And he said this after Dan Coats, the DNI or Director of National Intelligence, testified on the Hill."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOU DOBBS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK",
      "utterance": "What the hell is wrong with the DNI? He has no political judgement. He has no sense of proportion. I mean, what in hell is he thinking about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Wasn't Dan Coats doing his job like getting an honest assessment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",
      "utterance": "It's not for the director of DNI to have a political instinct in all of this. I mean, what really strikes me about this issue, first of all, let us remember that this is not the first time that President Trump and his administration have publicly disagreed. This is not the first and probably won't be the last. But what strikes me about this is the fact that because this coverage was so on the record, on tape, transcripts, that President Trump thinks he can go out and say fake news. The concept of fake news has taken such hold in our debate and our collective consciousness that you can actually do that in contrary, in juxtaposition to physically being on record is amazing to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Kristina, the president made this point in the Super Bowl interview today that was aired this morning with CBS' Margaret Brennan, that Intelligence chiefs are not always right. He invoked Iraq when obviously the Bush administration got bad information or was misled or misrepresented, whatever you want to say about the Iraq war. But what fueled this particular media fire was the president's own tweet, passive, naive, about people who he appointed. And it is reminiscent to some degree about -- we are used to president fighting the Justice Department when Jeff Sessions was there, fighting with the FBI, saying the FBI is doing a lousy job. But now you have these serious foreign policy questions and apparently differing views between the president and the people he named."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARTSINEVELOS",
      "utterance": "Exactly. So, he named them. He is not taking responsibility. So let's just put the blame on the media. I think that's the most concerning part in the past two years that we are seeing this fake news, the media is always wrong. We need journalists across the board on all networks, every single organization to do the digging and hold people accountable. I will just give a brief example. I was covering midterm elections in Florida. I went to a Ron Desantis rally. I was like the only silly one to be standing next to the cameraman. The other reporters have gone to the side. Rudy Giuliani took the stage, booed the media, Everybody turned in such venom. The same thing, camera guy working for Fox got spat on because it is the media, fake press. I don't think that's the attitude we should take towards journalists."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAFARO",
      "utterance": "This is my point about the fake news concept taking hold so much. I think it's dangerous to the institution of journalists and the fact that the American public basically have totally lost trust rightfully so but --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "It was not a good month for the press. There is a lot of very fair and very legitimate concerns about BuzzFeed, probably Covington more than --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It's been a lousy month for the press and the press sometimes gets involved. The press can be very, very negative toward this president more than I've ever seen. I do want to throw that in there. I'm not supporting the booing and the viciousness and all that. But you also had a split to some degree between the president and Senate Republicans. Mitch McConnell, the present's probably key ally on Capitol Hill, supporting an amendment which passed the Senate with majority of Senate Republicans expressing disapproval of the quick withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan. It's purely symbolic but I don't think it's fake news to report on how this now looks after the shutdown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "No, not at all. I actually think that's a split that a lot of the president's supporters are glad, that that would open up between the president and some of the foreign policy establishment in Washington."

And yet, in this year, this is a situation where the left, which is represented -- overrepresented in our media nationally, feels they have the right to every anti-Donald Trump vote. And that's what they view Howard Schultz as disrupting, that he could potentially take away 3 to 5 percent, or potentially more of that anti-Donald Trump vote. And ultimately, reelect him. That's what makes him inconvenient from their perspective. I actually think it's very interesting.

Anderson who was a guest on your program occasionally has a great piece on the Washington Post, in which she outlines the fact that the real way to go after Donald Trump is with someone who is a populist when it comes to economic policy and is actually more traditionalist when it comes to social policy. That's where the actual sort of the underrepresented center of the country really is when you look at the poll data. That's not where Schultz is.

They do not like the messy conversation that happens when you look at this issue in a hard way. You remember the Washington Post dismissing the Kermit Gosnell Story as a local crime story. You know the fact that the way that these stories are often framed is that Conservatives are pouncing on the remarks of people in various positions that could be depicted as extreme, when the positions they hold are out of step with what the vast majority of Americans want. You and I both know that the polls consistently say that Americans want more restrictions on abortions, particularly late-term abortions. They're more moderate on the subject than the vast majority members of the media. And I think in this context, when you look at what Ralph Northam has gone through this past week, you know, it's a bold move to try to distract from your comments on infanticide with a sort of racist scandal from your college years."

But if I was a major donor to the Democratic Party in Virginia, I would be looking at Ralph Northam right now the same way I look at someone like Maduro. I need to give him a golden parachute to go somewhere. I need to give him a board to go and sit on, So that he could pay for private school and things. Give him a parachute to get out of that office. Because frankly, what he has done here, as embarrassing as it is, it's not necessarily an impeachable offense or something that can drive him off out of office for.

They want to be a part of the community, they want to understand what is happening, when they go to the grocery store and buy something. So what he was saying was completely inaccurate.

      "utterance": "It's because they're so good. It's because we constantly see them. And New England has such a diehard fan base. It's like we want our team to be in it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And it could also be that the owner of the team, Rob Kraft, is friends with the president. And Tom Brady is friendly with the president. They wouldn't like to talk it much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I found it funny this week, it made national headlines, Kraft was dancing Cardi B. Cardi B is very anti-President Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCHENRY",
      "utterance": "Does she know he donated a million dollars to get him elected?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I admire you're here -- your ability to work Cardi B into the program, the Super Bowl Sunday."

      "utterance": "Anytime, Howard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Britt McHenry, thanks so much. Enjoy the game. Still to come, President Trump sits down with the New York Times and rips the New York Times."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "President Trump once again sat down with the New York Times and complained in the interview that the paper treats me so unbelievably terribly. Now, Trump had asked A.G. Sulzberger for an off-the-record dinner. And the publisher whose last private conversation with the president blew up into a public spat, declined asking instead for an on- the-record interview, which he attended with two top reporters, Maggie Haberman and Peter Baker. Sulzberger said Trump's rhetoric is endangering journalists worldwide."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "A.G. SULZBERGER, NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHER",
      "utterance": "They say that they are increasingly of belief that your rhetoric is creating a climate in which dictators and tyrants are able to employ your words in suppressing a free press."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "I don't like that. I mean, I don't like that. I don't like though -- I do think it's very bad for a country when the news is not accurately portrayed. I really do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The president said he was a victim of negative coverage, like nobody has ever had before. And this part was very revealing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I came from Jamaica Queens -- Jamaica Estates and became president of the United States. I am sort of entitled to a great story. I mean, just one, from my newspaper."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Heard that, my newspaper? That's why the president cares about the New York Times. He's from Queens, went to Manhattan, and tried to make it. And he still wants that recognition from the Times. He constantly bashes a failing New York Times, but really wants the approval. By the way, Sarah Sanders, the press secretary, gave an interview this week and said that about the reduced briefings schedule that she sees a bunch of angry faces in the crowd. But she wasn't talking about everybody in White House press corps. That's it for the Super Bowl Sunday Edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz.
