      "sentences": "Hello there. You look adorable. And I don't just say that to anyone. Well, to anyone who doesn't look like me. So, let's get Will Smith is due. He did a great service for the Oscars because if he hadn't slept Chris Rock, the talk would have been how crappy and boring the show was yet again. I was slapping myself to stay awake, without Will turning it into Palm Sunday, the rest of the show was one long In Memoriam. You also didn't hear about their goodie bags. Not to be confused with the D-bags in the seats. Each swag bag contains more than 140 grand worth of crap, including free liposuction. Yes. Free liposuction because Hollywood stars can't afford to get their own fat sucked out of their bodies. Hell, I do it for free. I'll bring my own straw. I don't know what that means. The gifts also included in all expenses paid trip to Scotland with a three- night stay at a fancy castle. Free construction for a home renovation. A four-night visit to a luxury spa and a plot of land in the U.K. with a noble title. Great. How does sir and lady do Shallotte sound? And here you thought celebrities are a bunch of elitist, really they're just like you and me. I mean who doesn't get offer free plots of land for films that are worse than the one on my tongue when I wake up in the morning? But I don't mind them getting free trips around the world. I just rather they didn't come back. But even though the stars can pay for all that crap, they still need the free stuff. It's for their ego. It's an offering to the gods, except these gods have lip implants. And of course, thanks to Will Smith. We also didn't get to talk about how truly lame this was.",

      "sentences": "Only the Oscars can make gay boring and tedious because the Oscars are no longer about entertainment, but diversity for the sake of diversity. But then they make diversity truly boring by making it painfully contrived. Their propaganda films with famous actors and music score lights, makeup and wardrobe are worse. There is heavy handed as Big Ben. The virtue signaling -- thank you. Some people didn't get that joke. The virtue signaling has descended into the purely infantile, like a juice box with a rainbow on it. As wokeism spreads, the movies shrink and splinter into morose attempts at identity politic fantasy. They aren't movies, just messages with all the depth of a coexist bumper sticker. It's no wonder they had the second worst rating ever and it would have been the worst if everyone hadn't immediately texted their friends about the slap. You know, if they're smart next year, they'll have Kanye West and Pete Davidson co-host. Help make fisticuffs a regular part of the show. At least give us a steel cage match for the Best Supporting Actor. But like my hairline, it's only going to get worse. According to L.A. Magazine, starting in 2024, producers must submit a list of the race, gender, sexual orientation and disability status of members of their cast and crew. If a movie does not have enough of the right people on set, that movie won't be eligible for an Oscar. Now, put aside that this is already a tremendous invasion of privacy. The criteria for winning Best Picture no longer includes being the best picture, it means checking off items from a menu. Imagine if that existed before and what it would do to our classics. The Godfather is now the godmother because Vito is transitioning. Jaws would have been an evil white man instead of a shark. And don't get me started with three men who identify as a baby. It's pathetic, you scream racism at the Oscars, and you can get them to do anything including ditching quality for quotas. You wouldn't want that process to decide who fixed your car or who removed your spleen. But the folks who run Hollywood would. Imagine how this is going to play out in a couple of years.",

But now that the Oscars are dead, maybe Hollywood could go back to making movies for people and not award shows. Although like Kilmeade's dog collection, it does make me sad. Because growing up I love the Oscars. It was my favorite thing to watch. Besides, at Quora changing. The movie stars were huge. Some literally. Remember Orson Welles? And you'd see Frank Sinatra, Sophia Leron, Charlton Heston, Jimmy Stewart, real stars who had presence. They rarely have ever spilled their guts or sold candles that smelled like they're junk. Today, you look at the stars, you just see dresses and tuxes, but no stature. They're no bigger than the actual Oscar and with the same charisma. Wokeism choke the golden goose. I bet you've never heard of the movies that one because the box office receipts prove it. That's because we want entertainment and not a lecture. If you want to lecture, do what I do. Spend the weekend with Geraldo. So yes, Will Smith was a jerk. But the Oscars should thank their lucky forgettable stars that he showed up and made it memorable. Maybe let him keep the gift bag. He could put it over his head the next time he goes out in public.",

I was slapping myself to stay awake, without Will turning it into Palm Sunday, the rest of the show was one long In Memoriam. You also didn't hear about their goodie bags. Not to be confused with the D-bags in the seats. Each swag bag contains more than 140 grand worth of crap, including free liposuction. Yes. Free liposuction because Hollywood stars can't afford to get their own fat sucked out of their bodies. Hell, I do it for free. I'll bring my own straw. I don't know what that means. The gifts also included in all expenses paid trip to Scotland with a three- night stay at a fancy castle. Free construction for a home renovation. A four-night visit to a luxury spa and a plot of land in the U.K. with a noble title. Great. How does sir and lady do Shallotte sound? And here you thought celebrities are a bunch of elitist, really they're just like you and me. I mean who doesn't get offer free plots of land for films that are worse than the one on my tongue when I wake up in the morning? But I don't mind them getting free trips around the world. I just rather they didn't come back. But even though the stars can pay for all that crap, they still need the free stuff. It's for their ego. It's an offering to the gods, except these gods have lip implants. And of course, thanks to Will Smith. We also didn't get to talk about how truly lame this was."

But then they make diversity truly boring by making it painfully contrived. Their propaganda films with famous actors and music score lights, makeup and wardrobe are worse. There is heavy handed as Big Ben. The virtue signaling -- thank you. Some people didn't get that joke. The virtue signaling has descended into the purely infantile, like a juice box with a rainbow on it. As wokeism spreads, the movies shrink and splinter into morose attempts at identity politic fantasy. They aren't movies, just messages with all the depth of a coexist bumper sticker. It's no wonder they had the second worst rating ever and it would have been the worst if everyone hadn't immediately texted their friends about the slap. You know, if they're smart next year, they'll have Kanye West and Pete Davidson co-host. Help make fisticuffs a regular part of the show. At least give us a steel cage match for the Best Supporting Actor. But like my hairline, it's only going to get worse. According to L.A. Magazine, starting in 2024, producers must submit a list of the race, gender, sexual orientation and disability status of members of their cast and crew. If a movie does not have enough of the right people on set, that movie won't be eligible for an Oscar. Now, put aside that this is already a tremendous invasion of privacy. The criteria for winning Best Picture no longer includes being the best picture, it means checking off items from a menu. Imagine if that existed before and what it would do to our classics. The Godfather is now the godmother because Vito is transitioning. Jaws would have been an evil white man instead of a shark. And don't get me started with three men who identify as a baby. It's pathetic, you scream racism at the Oscars, and you can get them to do anything including ditching quality for quotas. You wouldn't want that process to decide who fixed your car or who removed your spleen. But the folks who run Hollywood would. Imagine how this is going to play out in a couple of years."

But now that the Oscars are dead, maybe Hollywood could go back to making movies for people and not award shows. Although like Kilmeade's dog collection, it does make me sad. Because growing up I love the Oscars. It was my favorite thing to watch. Besides, at Quora changing. The movie stars were huge. Some literally. Remember Orson Welles? And you'd see Frank Sinatra, Sophia Leron, Charlton Heston, Jimmy Stewart, real stars who had presence. They rarely have ever spilled their guts or sold candles that smelled like they're junk. Today, you look at the stars, you just see dresses and tuxes, but no stature. They're no bigger than the actual Oscar and with the same charisma. Wokeism choke the golden goose. I bet you've never heard of the movies that one because the box office receipts prove it. That's because we want entertainment and not a lecture. If you want to lecture, do what I do. Spend the weekend with Geraldo. So yes, Will Smith was a jerk. But the Oscars should thank their lucky forgettable stars that he showed up and made it memorable. Maybe let him keep the gift bag.
