President Trump heads to Puerto Rico to survey hurricane damage on Tuesday and the Trump administration looks for a replacement for former Health Secretary Tom Price. Good morning I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks so much for joining me this morning, this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  With health care in the rearview mirror now, for the time being, President Trump and Republicans are turning their attention to tax reform. How will it affect you, the American taxpayer? The Director of the President's National Economic Council, Gary Cohn will join me live in studio coming up.  Also, could tax reform be used to help peel back the Dodd-Frank financial regulation? I'll talk with House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas coming up. Then an emotional scene on Capitol Hill this past week. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise returning to Congress for the first time since being shot in June, at a baseball practice game. What was the mood like inside that chamber? I'll talk with his fellow Congressman Louie Gohmert as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And Republicans are making their push on tax reform after the latest health care failure, the stakes are high.  This new plan tries to simplify our complicated tax code consolidated the number of tax brackets from seven down to three, sitting individual tax rates at 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. The President describing it as a \"rocket fuel\" for the economy saying, it will de live a \"middle- class miracle.\" Joining me right now is President Trump's chief economic adviser and the director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn. Director Cohn, good to see you.",

You then kick into the 12 percent rate, then you go to the 25 percent rate, then you go to the 35 percent rate. We have not determined the breakpoints for that. We have given the ability to determine the breakpoints to the Senate and the House as they write the legislation. The reason we've done that is because one of the two big bright line tests in our tax plan is that we must -- an the keyword is there -- we must have a middle-income tax cut when we're done.

The American Farm Bureau and small businesses, they're the ones that come out and really advocate the repeal of the estate tax. They are the people that get caught in the estate tax. We want America to be a place where you can have multi-generational family businesses, where you can build a family business and pass it from generation to generation and not be forced to sell your business upon death. Death should not become a taxable event if you're in a small business. Death should not become a taxable benefit if you're a farmer. If you're a farmer, you should be able to pass it on to your family. We know the statistics. Wealthy people can use estate planning and get around the estate tax. So look, when you're looking at the estate tax as a whole, it really affects (AUDIO GAP) more than anyone. On the alternative minimum tax, again, it's something that's even the IRS tax advocate and a bunch of non-partisan groups that come out and said, look, this has not worked. What happens with the alternative minimum tax is it was a pretty good concept. It was a good concept to say that everyone should pay their fair share. Again, wealthier (AUDIO GAP) figure out how to not pay the alternative minimum tax, where middle-income taxpayers end up paying the vast majority of alternative minimum tax. Good concept failed execution. So let's get rid of it and simplify the tax code. One of our core principles is to simplify the tax code.",

Well you know, been 13 hours so looks like this is a good sign and the doctor said I've put a tremendous amount of blood in him today, I'm going to put a tremendous amount of blood in him tomorrow if he makes it through the night, but we don't know. I'm going to be on pins and needles. To pray so fervently for his recovery and then see him back in the chamber was just overwhelming. And Steve is such a modest guy, but one of the hardest working guys. It's just a triumph of answered prayers and of someone really -- it's been tremendous amount of work. People don't realize to get to that point where he is was taking enormous work in addition to the answered prayers. And a lot of people don't know, I haven't heard this in the media because it was told to me privately. Barry Loudermilk Congressman from Georgia was in a position behind the fence, behind the home plate as the shooter was moving from the third base dugout around toward first where he was going to be able to shoot fish in a barrel. They were lying on the ground in the dugout, the first base dugout and Barry says, he's about -- I'm about to be exposed and I'm looking around there's no place for me to run, no place to go and he saw Crystal Griner, that Capitol Police firing shot in the ankle and she was trying through tremendous pain to shoot, and he realized that I'm about to be wide open exposed, he says a prayer and he sees David Bailey, Capitol Policeman at that moment come out from behind his cover, the suburban. He's completely exposed, yells twice, drop your weapon, drop your weapon and the guy shoots at him twice. And as soon as he says drop your weapon, the second time, he fires twice and takes him out. David Bailey as Steve said in the chamber saved his life. He is the ultimate hero and between the efforts of Crystal and David, they saved lots of lives, probably two dozen or so of the Republicans out there. And I was also gratified to hear Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Democrat, honorable man say that this was a hate-filled shooter and that you only hear people from the left normally say that we had a leftist full of hate shooting but the President knew that the very night, the very day he said there are problems on both sides after Charlottesville because he had been there when he knew Steve Scalise nearly didn't make it because of the hate of someone on the left.

You know, Maria, we've essentially come out of a lost decade from the years of Obamanomics.

Good morning I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks so much for joining me this morning, this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" With health care in the rearview mirror now, for the time being, President Trump and Republicans are turning their attention to tax reform. How will it affect you, the American taxpayer? The Director of the President's National Economic Council, Gary Cohn will join me live in studio coming up. Also, could tax reform be used to help peel back the Dodd-Frank financial regulation? I'll talk with House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas coming up. Then an emotional scene on Capitol Hill this past week. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise returning to Congress for the first time since being shot in June, at a baseball practice game. What was the mood like inside that chamber? I'll talk with his fellow Congressman Louie Gohmert as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And Republicans are making their push on tax reform after the latest health care failure, the stakes are high. This new plan tries to simplify our complicated tax code consolidated the number of tax brackets from seven down to three, sitting individual tax rates at 12 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent. The President describing it as a \"rocket fuel\" for the economy saying, it will de live a \"middle- class miracle.\" Joining me right now is President Trump's chief economic adviser and the director of the National Economic Council Gary Cohn.

Let me ask you about taxes now because you released a very important plan and it's been a detailed plan but we still don't understand who falls where. So12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent of the rates, if I make $200,000 where does that fall? Am I getting taxed 25 percent or 35 percent?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COHN",

What people are forgetting is we really enlarged the zero rate. We doubled the zero rate. So if you're a family today, you now get the first $24,000 of your income at a zero rate. You then kick into the 12 percent rate, then you go to the 25 percent rate, then you go to the 35 percent rate. We have not determined the breakpoints for that. We have given the ability to determine the breakpoints to the Senate and the House as they write the legislation. The reason we've done that is because one of the two big bright line tests in our tax plan is that we must -- an the keyword is there -- we must have a middle-income tax cut when we're done. So we have told the tax writers, set the brakes where you need to set the brakes to make sure that we end up with a middle-income tax cut."

We're going to increase credit quite dramatically, the child care credits, where they phase out is going to dramatically change. The size of the child care credit is going to change quite dramatically. We keep talking about the deductibility of state and local taxes and how important that is. Let me give you -- let me give you something that is an absolute and is a fact. Under the old tax system, 25 percent of families actually itemized and took advantage of the state and local tax deduction. So 75 percent of the families in America did not use the itemized deduction to deduct the state and local taxes."

We are very negotiable on a lot of factors in the tax plan. What we're not negotiable on is two points. We're not negotiable on whether we end up with a middle- income tax cut, not negotiable.

We will charge you one rate if you have liquid assets offshore, we will charge you a different rate if you've got bricks and mortar and you've turned that -- those earnings into bricks and mortar or investments offshore.

The American Farm Bureau and small businesses, they're the ones that come out and really advocate the repeal of the estate tax. They are the people that get caught in the estate tax. We want America to be a place where you can have multi-generational family businesses, where you can build a family business and pass it from generation to generation and not be forced to sell your business upon death. Death should not become a taxable event if you're in a small business. Death should not become a taxable benefit if you're a farmer. If you're a farmer, you should be able to pass it on to your family. We know the statistics. Wealthy people can use estate planning and get around the estate tax. So look, when you're looking at the estate tax as a whole, it really affects (AUDIO GAP) more than anyone. On the alternative minimum tax, again, it's something that's even the IRS tax advocate and a bunch of non-partisan groups that come out and said, look, this has not worked. What happens with the alternative minimum tax is it was a pretty good concept. It was a good concept to say that everyone should pay their fair share. Again, wealthier (AUDIO GAP) figure out how to not pay the alternative minimum tax, where middle-income taxpayers end up paying the vast majority of alternative minimum tax. Good concept failed execution. So let's get rid of it and simplify the tax code. One of our core principles is to simplify the tax code."

Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert was there to welcome back his colleague and he joins me now. Congressman, it's good to see you. Wow, that must have been really emotional.

It was such a moving event because so many of us had prayed so fervently and I didn't know the President was coming to the hospital that first night. I was there about 10minutes before he got there, but to stand beside the President and First Lady as the doctor said that night, President was trying to put a happy spin on it. Well you know, been 13 hours so looks like this is a good sign and the doctor said I've put a tremendous amount of blood in him today, I'm going to put a tremendous amount of blood in him tomorrow if he makes it through the night, but we don't know. I'm going to be on pins and needles. To pray so fervently for his recovery and then see him back in the chamber was just overwhelming. And Steve is such a modest guy, but one of the hardest working guys. It's just a triumph of answered prayers and of someone really -- it's been tremendous amount of work. People don't realize to get to that point where he is was taking enormous work in addition to the answered prayers. And a lot of people don't know, I haven't heard this in the media because it was told to me privately. Barry Loudermilk Congressman from Georgia was in a position behind the fence, behind the home plate as the shooter was moving from the third base dugout around toward first where he was going to be able to shoot fish in a barrel. They were lying on the ground in the dugout, the first base dugout and Barry says, he's about -- I'm about to be exposed and I'm looking around there's no place for me to run, no place to go and he saw Crystal Griner, that Capitol Police firing shot in the ankle and she was trying through tremendous pain to shoot, and he realized that I'm about to be wide open exposed, he says a prayer and he sees David Bailey, Capitol Policeman at that moment come out from behind his cover, the suburban. He's completely exposed, yells twice, drop your weapon, drop your weapon and the guy shoots at him twice. And as soon as he says drop your weapon, the second time, he fires twice and takes him out. David Bailey as Steve said in the chamber saved his life. He is the ultimate hero and between the efforts of Crystal and David, they saved lots of lives, probably two dozen or so of the Republicans out there. And I was also gratified to hear Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Democrat, honorable man say that this was a hate-filled shooter and that you only hear people from the left normally say that we had a leftist full of hate shooting but the President knew that the very night, the very day he said there are problems on both sides after Charlottesville because he had been there when he knew Steve Scalise nearly didn't make it because of the hate of someone on the left. But it's just been an emotional ride. Thank God and Jennifer, Steve's wife has been amazing. She has been really a testimony of what people ought to be going through such things."

We placed the highest tariff of any industrialized nation on our own products. That's the corporate tax. It's also an insidious tax because who pays the biggest percentage of their income for the corporate tax? Corporations don't pay that. They pass it on to their purchasers, to their customers, and who buys a bigger percent or pays a bigger percentage of their income? It's the poor and the middle class. So they're the ones that are paying this. It a straight pass-through tax. When you lowered the corporate tax, you're lowering the tariff we put on our goods."

So we passed it in the House with only one dissenting Republican vote. Unfortunately, we're still awaiting action in the Senate. But I look for any opportunity to advance both tax reform and regulatory reform. We're going to look at the appropriations process, we're looking at what the Senate can do.

So this President really is poised to be the deregulation President since -- the most regulation since President Reagan with respect to the tax reform plan. I cannot envision a plan that I would not end up supporting. I'm very excited as it is all Republicans if this prospect of having a fair, flatter, simpler, more competitive tax code. And by reducing both the C Corp and the pass-through rates on businesses, I think this economy is poised yet again for three maybe 3.5 percent economic growth. So again, this is a framework, this is an outline but I think they are off to a great, great start."

      "utterance": "Well the Committee for Responsible Budget says that these tax cuts are going to cost $2.2 trillion, so the question then becomes, how do you pay for it? Do you need this to be revenue neutral? Gary Cohn who was just with us and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have said many times that they are expecting growth to pay for this in a big way. Do you think that's achievable?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENSARLING",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. I mean, I'm not sure there's any time in America's history in the last century where we haven't had fundamental long-term tax reform that hasn't generated both economic growth and more revenues. You can go back to the Reagan tax cuts. There were three different tax cuts and we had 4 percent sustained economic growth in 1984, I think it was seven percent economic growth. And when President Reagan left office, revenues were 19 percent higher. You can go back to the Kennedy tax really. You can go all the way back to the Coolidge tax. And so what we see is revenue feedback. It's not just theory that I have, it's economic history."

      "utterance": "It's a great point. I was talking with Senator Ted Cruz about this last week and he points out that in 1984, the GDP was 7.3 percent which is like China numbers. I mean, you know, we haven't seen that in so long, we forgot that that's actually achievable living in this one in two percent growth world. Infrastructure package, Gary Cohn just told me during the commercial break actually that an infrastructure package is ready now and you can also attach that to a tax plan should you need to do so to get the votes required to pass this thing. Is -- what would you like to see? Do you want to just do a clean tax reform package like the framework says now or do you want to have this unraveling of Dodd-Frank or an infrastructure package attached to it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENSARLING",
      "utterance": "Well the most important thing right now is to get the votes to get the tax reform package done. That's --"

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well you don't have the votes though on the state income tax deduction though, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENSARLING",
      "utterance": "Well I don't know -- I don't know that. What I hope is that people will look at what is the difference in take-home pay between a 1.7 percent GDP economy and a three to 3.5 percent GDP economy. And so, I hope that people will look at that a generous doubling of the standard deduction. There are all types of provisions in this outline. They're going to help working families, middle-income families, but the most important aspect of this is, this is a tax reform plan built for economic growth. I hope in some respects, people look at the entire painting and not a few brush strokes in the corner. If you look at the entirety of the plan, I have no doubt. Again, based upon economic history that we are once -- again, capable of three percent plus economic growth. You know, Maria, we've essentially come out of a lost decade from the years of Obamanomics. And so the average middle-income family is probably $14,000 achieving $14,000 less in income than they otherwise would have had had we had sustained three percent economic growth. That's what I hope all my colleagues will focus on and that is the tax plan built for economic growth that will bring jobs back to America, capital back to America and lead to not just more jobs but bigger paychecks and greater take-home pay."

The Chinese are absolutely cracking down on smuggling from North Korea into China and also on joint ventures with the North Koreans giving a lot of money. And now Tillerson is also working with the Chinese to try to develop more direct diplomatic negotiations with the North Koreans as well and has admitted that the Trump administration is in direct contact with the foreign ministry around Kim Jong-un. In other words, despite all the headlines, there's more been accomplished on North Korea by this administration largely because Kim Jong-un has been escalating so much than the prospect of military strikes, which you know--"

We haven't done that yet and you've had people like Gary Cohn who you just had on, Wilbur Ross who have been saying, you know what, let's -- we should -- we need to be careful before we start putting a lot of tariffs directly on the Chinese.

Most people who wanted to vote voted any way but now the secessionist, the people that want independence in Catalonia have a much stronger case and it's one more place in Europe where you're seeing the center not hold.

He already is in the worst possible spot on this, tweeting and taking on the NFL as opposed to Puerto Rico, when everyone was saying, come on you've got to do something about Puerto Rico because this is the problem. So the optics couldn't be worse and he doubled down on it by attacking the Mayor who's facing all this. Now, I'm not -- I have no interest in saying the Mayor is the most wonderful mayor or the worst mayor, it doesn't matter. You don't go after the first responders. You're above it, you have to lead by example. This is the (INAUDIBLE) of leading by example here and I think this trip on Tuesday frankly, I mean, never mind that it's a distraction and it's going to be hard for people.
