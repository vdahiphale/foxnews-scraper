It involves some, oh, but tough love, so stay right there. But also tonight, we got a huge response to a question I posed last night in THE ANGLE. I was wondering what Martin Luther King Jr. would think about some of the stoking of racial division that we see from the modern day left and some of the hatred as well? His niece Alveda King is here with some of her thoughts.  Plus, something only going to see here a former ACLU Director saying that the 2020 Dems are falling for Al Sharpton's reparations scam. And he's calling it a scam tonight, don't want to miss it. And Raymond Arroyo is here with your \"Friday Follies\". Is that we're calling it's night follies.  Joe Biden finds humor and his hugging scandal and people have lost all sense of humor, we're going to get into that.  But first, as we look ahead to 2020, there are two inescapable political realities. #1, the Democratic Party is as far as I can tell, almost completely devoid of any clear or unifying policy message for the American people. Now, we have known this to be true, though, for some time. Though, at Al Sharpton's National Action Network Conference this week, well, they all swept in to remind us anew.",

And that leads us to the second inescapable reality, and a more troubling one perhaps for the White House.   I'm concerned tonight that President Trump could be in some ways squandering an opportunity to seize on the Democrats complete ineffectiveness by lacking a clear vision as it relates to the issue of immigration. Now Mr. President sometimes - sometimes your rhetoric doesn't match the policy and we're getting a - sometimes mixed messages. And mixed messages do not help an already deficient Congress, let's face it. Never wanted to solve this issue in the first place, I'm talking Republicans and Democrats. And you were right, to veto the rejection of your National Emergency - look what's happening in border today, of course, it's an emergency. Anyone with two eyes can see it. But the push cannot just stop there. It's got to be pedal to the metal right now.  In addition to all the raucous rallies and even the trips to the border, and they're great, it's time to give big specific policy speeches about what's happening specifically with illegal immigration.   So I'd go to one of these outrageous - and mention the issue of these outrageous birthing centers in the United States. It's a real scam that's going on with this birthright citizenship selling whether to Chinese or Russians and we have a big story on this. Next week we're going to bring you. But you talked about birthright citizenship during the campaign, most Americans are completely outraged by how the system is being game. Insist that we enforce eVerify, so that businesses can no longer game the system and push American wages lower, just as we're seeing them start to rise.  Demand and enforce more deportations - not fewer. Now remember Mr. President this is an easy sell. Just 23 percent of Americans actually want more illegal immigration. And to reaffirm our sovereignty, another thing we can do, catch-and-release needs to be replaced with immediate border turn backs if anyone crossing illegally. I know the law has to be changed to do that, because right now because of one federal judge, and Dianne Feinstein's Wilberforce Trafficking Act, we can't turn people to Central America. And you took, though, a good first step in this direction earlier today from Calexico, California.",

We had a big takedown - 15 out of 24 of the subjects arrested on a major Jalisco Cartel case, they were illegally here. The lab that they hid 400 pounds of methamphetamine, six out of seven arrested were all illegal. They're causing chaos in our country and kids are dying everywhere. So they need to really start supporting these people immediately. And it can't be just President Trump alone. I mean he wanted to shut down the border, then he backed off, and all these media people came out and said, \"Well, he's in retreat. He talks a good game, but then in Mexico didn't pay for the wall and you didn't close the border and now you're given Mexico a year to figure it out\".   I don't think we have a year, Hector.

That Dr. King was anti-war, anti- capitalism and pro socialism. He saw capitalism as exploitative by nature, an economic structure that bred poverty and injustice. He spoke of his desire to fundamentally change society several times into a democratic form of socialism which the workers collectively owned and direct profit from the businesses in which they work. He saw capitalism as a method of organization that produced an extremely wealthy upper class, but left huge numbers in dire poverty. And that was Garrett Griffin.

      "utterance": "Happy Friday night. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington. We're going to get to my message to the President in moments. It involves some, oh, but tough love, so stay right there. But also tonight, we got a huge response to a question I posed last night in THE ANGLE. I was wondering what Martin Luther King Jr. would think about some of the stoking of racial division that we see from the modern day left and some of the hatred as well? His niece Alveda King is here with some of her thoughts. Plus, something only going to see here a former ACLU Director saying that the 2020 Dems are falling for Al Sharpton's reparations scam. And he's calling it a scam tonight, don't want to miss it. And Raymond Arroyo is here with your \"Friday Follies\". Is that we're calling it's night follies. Joe Biden finds humor and his hugging scandal and people have lost all sense of humor, we're going to get into that. But first, as we look ahead to 2020, there are two inescapable political realities. #1, the Democratic Party is as far as I can tell, almost completely devoid of any clear or unifying policy message for the American people. Now, we have known this to be true, though, for some time. Though, at Al Sharpton's National Action Network Conference this week, well, they all swept in to remind us anew."

      "utterance": "Now for the left grievance has become a more animating principle than addressing a couple of key issues, like, how can we actually improve the lives of all Americans and how do we maybe keep them safe - security on our streets. And that leads us to the second inescapable reality, and a more troubling one perhaps for the White House. I'm concerned tonight that President Trump could be in some ways squandering an opportunity to seize on the Democrats complete ineffectiveness by lacking a clear vision as it relates to the issue of immigration. Now Mr. President sometimes - sometimes your rhetoric doesn't match the policy and we're getting a - sometimes mixed messages. And mixed messages do not help an already deficient Congress, let's face it. Never wanted to solve this issue in the first place, I'm talking Republicans and Democrats. And you were right, to veto the rejection of your National Emergency - look what's happening in border today, of course, it's an emergency. Anyone with two eyes can see it. But the push cannot just stop there. It's got to be pedal to the metal right now. In addition to all the raucous rallies and even the trips to the border, and they're great, it's time to give big specific policy speeches about what's happening specifically with illegal immigration. So I'd go to one of these outrageous - and mention the issue of these outrageous birthing centers in the United States. It's a real scam that's going on with this birthright citizenship selling whether to Chinese or Russians and we have a big story on this. Next week we're going to bring you. But you talked about birthright citizenship during the campaign, most Americans are completely outraged by how the system is being game. Insist that we enforce eVerify, so that businesses can no longer game the system and push American wages lower, just as we're seeing them start to rise. Demand and enforce more deportations - not fewer. Now remember Mr. President this is an easy sell. Just 23 percent of Americans actually want more illegal immigration. And to reaffirm our sovereignty, another thing we can do, catch-and-release needs to be replaced with immediate border turn backs if anyone crossing illegally. I know the law has to be changed to do that, because right now because of one federal judge, and Dianne Feinstein's Wilberforce Trafficking Act, we can't turn people to Central America. And you took, though, a good first step in this direction earlier today from Calexico, California."

But for that to happen consistent, bold policy and follow-through with the determined rhetoric, got to have the policy follow-through.

Unfortunately, we need Congress to act. We need Congress to make sure that they stop encouraging illegal immigration. When we talk about open borders and decriminalizing immigration, that's not a good move, look at the mess that we have right now. Our agents are handling situations where they're being exposed to tuberculosis, hepatitis and some very dangerous infectious diseases in the processing areas. So, definitely, it's a mayhem on the border and Congress needs to act. President Trump has been trying, and we appreciate President Trump."

But most of them just have already been adjudged illegally present or are subject to immediate deportation, but they don't show up for their hearings. I've been told by numerous ICE officials that just doing that, finding those people, sending those people out of the country will create an enormous deterrent. In fact, whatever we want to call it, Operation Send Back or whatever you want to call it. That in and of itself is due process has already been given these people and they've refused to abide even by the due process findings of a federal immigration judge. What do you think about that?"

      "speaker": "DEREK MALTZ, FORMER DEA HEAD OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS",

      "utterance": "--ICE detainee and they didn't even do anything about it. They just let him go and then he butchers the lady. So I think that these people need to be immediately removed. The law has to be updated clearly. But at the end of the day, we can't have illegals all in our country. Look at Atlanta, like, I always bring up the Atlanta DEA case. We had a big takedown - 15 out of 24 of the subjects arrested on a major Jalisco Cartel case, they were illegally here. The lab that they hid 400 pounds of methamphetamine, six out of seven arrested were all illegal. They're causing chaos in our country and kids are dying everywhere. So they need to really start supporting these people immediately. And it can't be just President Trump alone. I mean he wanted to shut down the border, then he backed off, and all these media people came out and said, \"Well, he's in retreat. He talks a good game, but then in Mexico didn't pay for the wall and you didn't close the border and now you're given Mexico a year to figure it out\". I don't think we have a year, Hector. We don't have a year for Mexico to get their act together here, OK? This has to stop. We're going to have a million and a half people having to come into the country illegally, most of them released into the country. America never voted for it. They voted for Trump, which means they want the opposite of that. Hector?"

And again that's due to catch and release, and it's only going to get worse. And unfortunately, if we don't control these caravans that are coming over here, we're no longer going to have Border Security operations of border. As it is right now, we can't even patrol enough of the border because of our new duties of babysitting kids and feeding them and transporting them, when we're supposed to be stopping terrorists on the border, stopping dangerous drugs and stopping dangerous criminals from coming across.

They all have waved the flag about how bad the border was, but no one acted. It's typical Washington. They talk about it, they don't act. Secretary Nielsen is acting. She's trying hard to educate Congress, educate the public, educate the White House with the experts like all these Border Patrol agents that are dedicating their time and their lives. They're sacrificing lies and they're on the border, not making a lot of money, and nobody's listening. That's the said - that's the really sad part. I mean this isn't anything new."

They know, but they'd rather hang out with Al Sharpton at Manhattan and talk about how the whole country is racist and that system is all rigged against everyone. Instead of saying, maybe we could work with the Republicans on something. maybe we can actually figure this out, because it would be better for all people in our country, especially disadvantaged people who need to help up, to actually have it this to be an American centered immigration solution here, focusing on the American people. That's what I can't for the life of me understand. It would be good for their communities that are dealing with the scourge of gang activity and meth and all the other problems we're seeing.

That's good news. I think we should not be worried about businesses saying, \"Oh god, we have a tight labor\". We should say good, we have a tight labor market. Wages are going up for blue-collar workers, a lot of Hispanic people. That's money in people's pockets, it's not rhetoric, it's not calling them a xenophobe, it's not saying - it's money in their pocket. And Luis, I think Democrats needs to care about that."

They're particularly in light of the things that are happening right now in Venezuela. I think that's why they're supporting, that's actually a significant part of it. And then when you look at things like what Donald Trump said about Colombian President - the new Colombian President being a problem, because he hasn't done enough on the drug trafficking fight. That creates actually a potential detriment to the growth that he might be seeing, which I think is actually smaller than this poll shows."

They're not interested in a real conversation about improving the lives of real people, the state of the economy for African Americans in this country, talking about criminal justice reform, school choice, all the things that conservatives love - the life issue. Instead, they attempt to demonize anyone who rejects divisive negative way of thinking. Well they want to shut down speech. They don't believe in open dialogue. Joining me now is a woman who does, Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr. Alveda has the type of stuff you're seeing from Jesse Jackson and all the Democrats one after the other after the other kind of bowing down to his you know his identity over the last few days. Now I just were just raised the question, because it's so negative.

I want to read part of one of his speeches. I think we have the full screen when he talked about socialism. Well this is a description of him. That Dr. King was anti-war, anti- capitalism and pro socialism. He saw capitalism as exploitative by nature, an economic structure that bred poverty and injustice. He spoke of his desire to fundamentally change society several times into a democratic form of socialism which the workers collectively owned and direct profit from the businesses in which they work. He saw capitalism as a method of organization that produced an extremely wealthy upper class, but left huge numbers in dire poverty. And that was Garrett Griffin. But his - there are actual speeches from King where he discussed the need to fundamentally restructure the economic system in the United States, so maybe the push towards socialism kind of is in the tradition of - can you make that argument."

So he would not necessarily have supported just handouts without hand up and equipping people with the fish forever rather than having a fish for a day. So that's why I say his socialism was more remindful of Christ rather than a political structural system. But as far as perpetual protest, he was sowing hope, seeds of hope. One day this will end and we'll all have something together. That's the Martin Luther King Junior that I actually know."

Martin Luther King Junior was an independent. His dad started out as a Republican, but he was an independent. And people don't remember that either. And so that's why when Sharpton just dismisses and forgets, well, we can't forget. If we forget our history we'll repeat the bad part, but then we'll forget to do the good part over again."

From Mary Tyler Moore, Bob Newhart, all the great shows, where comedy, and of course \"SNL\" where it was -- it could be tough on politicians, but that wasn't the essence of it. It was situational comedy, and it's why Seinfeld says he won't go to college campuses, because -- I actually think we have the clip. Let's play. Let's watch what he says."

Because we've got to put aside the divide. The hate has got to stop, Laura. We're all in this together and we should all make fun of each other equally like that. So I was thinking, and I was talking to your producers, Laura, we should start a conservative comedy channel where you come out and you answer all of that, because the material writes itself."
