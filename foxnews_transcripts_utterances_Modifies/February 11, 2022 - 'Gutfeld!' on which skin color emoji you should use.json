      "sentences": "So, just the other day, I was sending a text to a close friend of mine. I'm lying. I'm making up an anecdote to kick off this monologue. I don't have any close friends other than my goldfish aid. And even he hates me. But while sending the text, I wanted to end it with the right emoji. A thumbs up if you will. The problem is I'm white. I know spoiler. But usually I just use the emoji that pops up, the default thumbs up. It's kind of yellow, what's called these days Simpsons yellow. Now except for that time I caught scurvy from Kat. I'm not cartoon yellow. I'm white, really white. So white, in fact that I wear khakis to bed. Which means when I'm choosing the default thumbs up, which is canary yellow. Aren't I cloaking my whiteness? Aren't I hiding my privilege? (BLEEP) you might even call it appropriating. I'm white using a yellow thumb. So, the question plagued me. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I could barely look at myself in the mirror which could have been fatal if I were Jesse Waters. All this time as a white man, I was identifying as a Simpson and not even a hot one, like Ashley or O.J. Well, thank God for NPR because they tackle this dilemma for me. Yes, in between fun drives and profiles of trans sheep. They published an article on which skin color emoji should you use. The reply which they supplied, the answer is more complex than you think. And that's because depending on your race, they could denote white privilege, especially if you use the yellow thumbs up emoji. That means if you're white, that you're ignorant of your own advantage in life, like being able to choose any emoji you want. Some people don't have that privilege, like some minorities and also careless woodshop teachers. By the way, even though I am white, my thumb identifies as a pinky. Now the article is so important that it actually took three authors to put it together. Even my employees didn't laugh. That's two more authors than it took to write war and peace, and 20 less than it took to write how I save the world. Their beef that many people of color are exhausted. That's the word they use. They're exhausted of having to grapple with their emoji issues, while white people just ignore it subconsciously. And even though we assume the yellow thumbs up is neutral, some academics, I.E. freaks, argue that when you make that choice, you're opting out of your commitment to awareness. Which sounds interesting. Oh, who am I kidding? It's not interesting at all. I'm just sick and tired of talking about COVID and crime all the time. And I'm out of poop jokes since I started that juice cleanse. But COVID in crime are big problems. And it would be great if this emoji thing were so big an issue we could lead off the show with it. How awesome would your life be if all you had to deal with is being exhausted by emoji privilege? Hey, Joe, you look really down. Are you feeling OK? Yes, I'm fine. But I was up until 4:00 this morning trying to decide how to sign off on a text. So, you want to talk about actual privilege? The most privilege thing is the existence of this article. Imagine the sheer lack of problems you have that would allow you to spend all this time and effort wondering if your emoji might be racist. I have an inkling that this is not a concern for parents of screaming kids. It's not a concern for anyone who truly works for living. It's not a concern for anyone who has a sick relative, not a concern for any victim of crime. This kind of concern only exists in people with woke privilege. Academics, people who really don't have to do anything but write silly little articles to show how smart they are. But these are pointless people. Lucky to be alive in a really easy time to be alive. It's America 2022. Netflix, Uber, Pornhub, pot, lives a breeze for the lazy and shiftless. By comparison on this day in history, February 10, 1862, a union naval Flotilla, which I believe is a boat with salsa and cheese, destroyed the Confederate mosquito fleet in the Battle of Elizabeth City in North Carolina. By the way, how hard is it to beat a fleet named after an insect you can kill with a flyswatter? Anyway, I bet you didn't know I was a history buff. I'm not, I just really I'd like to read Wikipedia in the buff which got me removed from the public library. But that battle like so many that were waged ensured that 160 years later three losers could write an article about emojis. Back then they had real problems. Hell today we have real problems. Crime waves, inflation, COVID, Joe Biden, but in the woke world those aren't concerns. Emojis are. Joe Rogan is. Hoop earrings, remember when they were racist? It's problems like emojis and all that other crap that make academics feel important and NPR looking lightened, but in the real world, they don't accomplish a damn thing. It's stupid. So stupid I'm giving them a thumbs down. And yes, I'm using the wrong color and the wrong finger.",

We welcome the unvaxxed to the show, you just got to take a COVID test to make sure you aren't sick, which I support, and we can supply free. It's like right by the door. And like my charisma, it costs nothing. But hey, Ari, you know better. I always say the same thing. I'm double vaxxed, and aim for any vaccine mandate, and I've said it before, but I get it. You can't cover the disastrous Biden presidency, so what are you left with? Attacking me, a true American hero. Thank you. Who initiated the end of the pandemic on live TV? You know, it's amazing, I don't have a cult by now.

What a leap -- the so-called pizza and consent assignment given to students stated quote, \"When you order pizza with your friends, everyone checks in about each other's preferences, right? Well, the same goes with sex.\" Yes, exactly. And in both cases, you asked, who ordered anchovies? Then, it asked students who were in the eighth grade, mind you, to create a pizza describing what kind of sex they liked. Using various toppings to symbolize different sex acts. I bet buffalo chicken means something illegal. But I salute the kid who said a large with everything. I can't believe this story is real. The assignment was quickly deleted, and the superintendent said it was simply an error. They sent the wrong document and excuse prompting everyone who had ever been featured on To Catch a Predator to say, I wish I had thought of that. Anyway, I always said sex is a lot like pizza. It's better with a thin crust. But this assignment was, yes, I know you're going to hit me.

      "utterance": "So, just the other day, I was sending a text to a close friend of mine. I'm lying. I'm making up an anecdote to kick off this monologue. I don't have any close friends other than my goldfish aid. And even he hates me. But while sending the text, I wanted to end it with the right emoji. A thumbs up if you will. The problem is I'm white. I know spoiler. But usually I just use the emoji that pops up, the default thumbs up. It's kind of yellow, what's called these days Simpsons yellow. Now except for that time I caught scurvy from Kat. I'm not cartoon yellow. I'm white, really white. So white, in fact that I wear khakis to bed. Which means when I'm choosing the default thumbs up, which is canary yellow. Aren't I cloaking my whiteness? Aren't I hiding my privilege? (BLEEP) you might even call it appropriating. I'm white using a yellow thumb. So, the question plagued me. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I could barely look at myself in the mirror which could have been fatal if I were Jesse Waters. All this time as a white man, I was identifying as a Simpson and not even a hot one, like Ashley or O.J. Well, thank God for NPR because they tackle this dilemma for me. Yes, in between fun drives and profiles of trans sheep. They published an article on which skin color emoji should you use. The reply which they supplied, the answer is more complex than you think. And that's because depending on your race, they could denote white privilege, especially if you use the yellow thumbs up emoji. That means if you're white, that you're ignorant of your own advantage in life, like being able to choose any emoji you want. Some people don't have that privilege, like some minorities and also careless woodshop teachers. By the way, even though I am white, my thumb identifies as a pinky. Now the article is so important that it actually took three authors to put it together. Even my employees didn't laugh. That's two more authors than it took to write war and peace, and 20 less than it took to write how I save the world. Their beef that many people of color are exhausted. That's the word they use. They're exhausted of having to grapple with their emoji issues, while white people just ignore it subconsciously. And even though we assume the yellow thumbs up is neutral, some academics, I.E. freaks, argue that when you make that choice, you're opting out of your commitment to awareness. Which sounds interesting. Oh, who am I kidding? It's not interesting at all. I'm just sick and tired of talking about COVID and crime all the time. And I'm out of poop jokes since I started that juice cleanse. But COVID in crime are big problems. And it would be great if this emoji thing were so big an issue we could lead off the show with it. How awesome would your life be if all you had to deal with is being exhausted by emoji privilege? Hey, Joe, you look really down. Are you feeling OK? Yes, I'm fine. But I was up until 4:00 this morning trying to decide how to sign off on a text. So, you want to talk about actual privilege? The most privilege thing is the existence of this article. Imagine the sheer lack of problems you have that would allow you to spend all this time and effort wondering if your emoji might be racist. I have an inkling that this is not a concern for parents of screaming kids. It's not a concern for anyone who truly works for living. It's not a concern for anyone who has a sick relative, not a concern for any victim of crime. This kind of concern only exists in people with woke privilege. Academics, people who really don't have to do anything but write silly little articles to show how smart they are. But these are pointless people. Lucky to be alive in a really easy time to be alive. It's America 2022. Netflix, Uber, Pornhub, pot, lives a breeze for the lazy and shiftless. By comparison on this day in history, February 10, 1862, a union naval Flotilla, which I believe is a boat with salsa and cheese, destroyed the Confederate mosquito fleet in the Battle of Elizabeth City in North Carolina. By the way, how hard is it to beat a fleet named after an insect you can kill with a flyswatter? Anyway, I bet you didn't know I was a history buff. I'm not, I just really I'd like to read Wikipedia in the buff which got me removed from the public library. But that battle like so many that were waged ensured that 160 years later three losers could write an article about emojis. Back then they had real problems. Hell today we have real problems. Crime waves, inflation, COVID, Joe Biden, but in the woke world those aren't concerns. Emojis are. Joe Rogan is. Hoop earrings, remember when they were racist? It's problems like emojis and all that other crap that make academics feel important and NPR looking lightened, but in the real world, they don't accomplish a damn thing. It's stupid. So stupid I'm giving them a thumbs down. And yes, I'm using the wrong color and the wrong finger."

He's less approved of than the guy with the face tattoos dating your daughter. And speaking of 40s, it's my favorite after-lunch drink. Inflation is rising at its fastest rates in 40 years, with no signs of slowing down. If Joe takes us any deeper into the 1970s, we'll all be wearing bell bottoms and dating share. Meanwhile, crime is still off the charts. In 2021, the U.S. murder rate was at as high as it's -- as it's been in 25 years. We nearly -- with nearly over 19,000 people were killed nationwide.

What a leap -- the so-called pizza and consent assignment given to students stated quote, \"When you order pizza with your friends, everyone checks in about each other's preferences, right? Well, the same goes with sex.\" Yes, exactly. And in both cases, you asked, who ordered anchovies? Then, it asked students who were in the eighth grade, mind you, to create a pizza describing what kind of sex they liked. Using various toppings to symbolize different sex acts. I bet buffalo chicken means something illegal. But I salute the kid who said a large with everything. I can't believe this story is real. The assignment was quickly deleted, and the superintendent said it was simply an error. They sent the wrong document and excuse prompting everyone who had ever been featured on To Catch a Predator to say, I wish I had thought of that. Anyway, I always said sex is a lot like pizza. It's better with a thin crust. But this assignment was, yes, I know you're going to hit me.
