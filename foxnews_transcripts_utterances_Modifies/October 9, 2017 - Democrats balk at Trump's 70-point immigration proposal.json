It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A new push on immigration, President Trump is reaching across the aisle to strike a deal with Democrats on so-called dreamers. In return, the president wants funding to pay for the border wall. Some top priorities in his 70-point plan include building the wall, hiring 10,000 additional ICE agents, and 600 prosecutors. Mandatory e-verify system, which confirms an immigrant work eligibility, and a new points-based system for green cards. But don't expect a deal from the Democrats. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority leader Nancy Pelosi, already saying no thanks, quote, we told the president at our meeting that we were open to reasonable border security measures alongside the dream act. But this list go so far beyond what is reasonable, this proposal fails to represent any attempt to compromise. Meanwhile, the president's counselor has this message for critics on the left.",

One, you insert the wall and at the last minute you dial it back and then you look like you're flexible and a big leader. Or you take the wall to the limit and make the Democrats look like rigid radicals. But here he still has a Trump card. He can extend DACA if he doesn't like the terms for an extra six months, so he controls the whole debate. The issue though is the wall isn't as popular as protecting dreamers.

So I was disappointed by that. But my own political stuff aside for a second, I think the proposal that was submitted yesterday is really the administration's answer to the criticism that President Trump received in the wake of the failed health care repeal, which is that he was not invested personally. He was not involved in the process. He was not down in the nitty-gritty, figuring this stuff out, trying to help congress come up with the specifics to populate this bill. This is something that's chockablock full of specifics. No one can levy that criticism again. You know, against him in this instance.

The longer we waited, you saw it, the worse it got. But coming at them, bombing the crap out of them, killing everyone they know, it seems to work. Who would have thought? Oh, yeah, President Trump. It's something for which he gets no credit. He's literally ending ISIS. It won't be the end of jihadism, but for now the dreams of a state are over. Their terrain is shrinking. Sometimes a full frontal assault is the most strategic idea and it beats Obama's dithering. All that ever got us was the paralysis of analysis. So laugh all you want about the tired phrase, \"there's a new sheriff in town.\" I think ISIS got that message.

He said more U.S. presence there was going to bog us down into a quagmire. And he also said there needed to be a political solution before there was a military solution.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A new push on immigration, President Trump is reaching across the aisle to strike a deal with Democrats on so-called dreamers. In return, the president wants funding to pay for the border wall. Some top priorities in his 70-point plan include building the wall, hiring 10,000 additional ICE agents, and 600 prosecutors. Mandatory e-verify system, which confirms an immigrant work eligibility, and a new points-based system for green cards. But don't expect a deal from the Democrats. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority leader Nancy Pelosi, already saying no thanks, quote, we told the president at our meeting that we were open to reasonable border security measures alongside the dream act. But this list go so far beyond what is reasonable, this proposal fails to represent any attempt to compromise. Meanwhile, the president's counselor has this message for critics on the left."

I understand why though because the Republicans in congress have caved and buckled for the last eight years. So it's two-pronged strategy here. One, you insert the wall and at the last minute you dial it back and then you look like you're flexible and a big leader. Or you take the wall to the limit and make the Democrats look like rigid radicals. But here he still has a Trump card. He can extend DACA if he doesn't like the terms for an extra six months, so he controls the whole debate. The issue though is the wall isn't as popular as protecting dreamers.

We need more friction. We need to slow things down. But they can't do it with immigration. I find that very interesting. By the way, that can work both ways.

So then, when the Democrats say, ah, excuse us, that's not the deal we discussed, because they had agreed, by the way, Jesse, to added security on the border as part of their deal.

And President Trump has taken great care in many speeches, many public remarks to talk about the fact that emotionally and psychologically he connects with the idea that America should be a place to welcome these people. So I was disappointed by that. But my own political stuff aside for a second, I think the proposal that was submitted yesterday is really the administration's answer to the criticism that President Trump received in the wake of the failed health care repeal, which is that he was not invested personally. He was not involved in the process. He was not down in the nitty-gritty, figuring this stuff out, trying to help congress come up with the specifics to populate this bill. This is something that's chockablock full of specifics. No one can levy that criticism again. You know, against him in this instance. I think that was really the priority here was cobbling together a complete plan."

He's doing that even right now with Chuck Schumer as it relates to health care and saying, hey, look, I'm willing to do a deal. Like, can you guys come and sit at the table? No, but he is.

The only reason why ISIS was around so long was that we wouldn't do that. And their grisly propaganda proceeded, unabated, persuading entire cities to flee instead of fight. The longer we waited, you saw it, the worse it got. But coming at them, bombing the crap out of them, killing everyone they know, it seems to work. Who would have thought? Oh, yeah, President Trump. It's something for which he gets no credit. He's literally ending ISIS. It won't be the end of jihadism, but for now the dreams of a state are over. Their terrain is shrinking. Sometimes a full frontal assault is the most strategic idea and it beats Obama's dithering. All that ever got us was the paralysis of analysis. So laugh all you want about the tired phrase, \"there's a new sheriff in town.\" I think ISIS got that message. And while we have to careful of the \"mission accomplished\" syndrome, what is undeniable is that ISIS is off the front pages and on their last legs. One hopes Jim Jong Un is watching."

We also learned that everything President Obama said about ISIS was wrong. He said more boots on the ground was going to inflame the situation. He said more U.S. presence there was going to bog us down into a quagmire. And he also said there needed to be a political solution before there was a military solution.

So keep an eye on that. And that's, hence, the escalation and doing more -- you know, troops and stuff and forces in Afghanistan to help combat that. But where are all the ISIS guys that are surrendering going to go? Who is going to take care and control of them?

And the University Medical Center posted an image to their Facebook page, thanking Aldean for his visit and wrote \"His visit helped heal hearts and cheer those who are wounded in the tragedy.\" So I think that was really wonderful for him to go and give the time and see them and make, you know, a positive impact in that way -- Juan."
