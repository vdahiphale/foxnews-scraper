      "sentences": "Or you could just be normal. All right. After months of sputtering vacillation, the CDC says fully vaccinated Americans can ditch masks and don't have to social distance in most indoor places. Unless you're in a room with Andrew Cuomo. And that case run. Speaking of that ass, even after restrictions have been lifted, he's still being cautious, claiming to rely \"on the facts and the science.\" Yes, now he's careful. Was he relying on the facts and the science when he sent COVID patients to rest homes? That were facts in science, then his treatment of women were delightful acts of chivalry. So, the CDC says you can skip wearing masks outside. In other news, the CDC says women can vote and wear pants. So, I'm not sure I'm for either. We're going too fast. According to The New York Times, the CDC is finally catching up to the science. It's not true. They're finally catching up to you. We always knew that COVID doesn't spread outdoors. It's not like chlamydia at Coachella, which I learned sadly. We also knew that vaccination was supposed to eliminate risk of spread, which was motivation for getting it. The CDC, however, is so obsessed with the slightest risks, the kinds that are smaller than choking to death on soup, made their guidance as helpful as financial advice from Bernie Madoff. So why did they change? Is it because they've now followed the science? No, because if they had followed the science, they would have come to this conclusion a while ago. Fact is they didn't follow science. They follow you. They knew that if they kept pushing the American public too far we were going to push back. Plus, the experts knew you were right. But they couldn't admit it. And anybody married is laughing at that right now. See? All their guidance is based on fear. Fear of not being wrong, but fear of being exposed. Why is that? Well, these are not leaders. How can you tell? They played it safe. That's not a leader. That's your 75-year-old aunt Tilly backing out of her driveway. Leaders take risks. They listen to experts, but then weigh the risks against the benefits. It's like a coach who talks to his assistants and then goes for it on fourth down. That's a hockey reference, Kat. A leader must face obstacles head on and if they fail, be willing to take the fall. As for the experts in the media, their constant covering of their assets created ever worsening feedback loop. A weak politician might accept the risks of reopening but retreat, the moment someone tweets but people will die. So they told you to sit tight at home masks even if you're living with older folks. The irony that people who yell wear a mask or you're killing Grandma were supporters of the biggest grandma killers of all. Until after every time an adult publicly assessed risk. You get some media asshat asking how many people are you willing to see die? Just over a month ago, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said she had a sense of impending doom. Well, thanks for the pep talk, Doc. You must be great on a plane flight. Fact is we accept death every day. It's sad but true, insurance actuaries count the future deaths we naturally accept no one has ever been able to escape the phenomenon of death. Except Keith Richards. Leaders get that but experts don't. Experts aren't paid to lead. Like Gramps taken a leak at 3:00 a.m. They're just paid to spray their opinions all over the place. And the American people aren't experts, they're better. Think about our ancestors who came here in the opposite of a safe space. No expert was advising them to come here. Like marshmallow top sweet potatoes. It's unique to America. We're number one, because we won't take number two from anyone. So we ditch the masks. But why stop there? While we're at it, let's decide on other crap that we're tired of. Like those stupid little circles on the ground. Where you're supposed to stand in line. I just want to buy Preparation H at Wal-Mart without having to play the CDCs version of Twister. And enough with bringing your disgusting reusable bag to the store. It's got more bacteria in it than Tommy Lee's hot tub. Let's get back to paper or plastic and stop charging us for it. That Green New Deal is all about the green I'm afraid. Seriously, remember how much fun it was to shop for food and the good old days? The smells, the colors, the cereals, the checker who hates you because he wants laughed at her. I'm with her shirts? The produce section was therapeutic. Sure you never bought any vegetables, but it smelled great on your way to the freezer to grab beer and chicken nuggets. Oh man, in the deli section, being surrounded by all that meat takes me back to my wrestling days. And who needs all that meat? Turns out I need all that meat. Seriously, there are like six kinds of salami. No wonder foreigners openly weep in front of the counter. In their shops back home the meat was made of wood. And let's not forget the head cheese. Now we know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa. And let's stop wiping down everything. I've never wiped so hard since that time as a kid when I thought ex-lax was leftover Halloween candy. That's another poop joke. Let's go to the angry white male one more time.",

A car dealership in the U.K. is being forced to pay its receptionist $32,000, that's four million pounds, because her colleagues repeatedly failed to ask her what kind of food she would like to order on Pizza Fridays. Yes, the poor woman was starved for pizza and attention, allegedly. Treatment that the employment tribunal deemed a campaign of victimization, which is what we would call having to eat English food.

The dealership managers insisted the real reason she had been invited to the monthly lunches was that she was a part time employee leaving work at 1:00 pm, but the tribunal said that was no excuse. Finally, when questioned why she asked for so much dough, she said she needed the money.

      "utterance": "Or you could just be normal. All right. After months of sputtering vacillation, the CDC says fully vaccinated Americans can ditch masks and don't have to social distance in most indoor places. Unless you're in a room with Andrew Cuomo. And that case run. Speaking of that ass, even after restrictions have been lifted, he's still being cautious, claiming to rely \"on the facts and the science.\" Yes, now he's careful. Was he relying on the facts and the science when he sent COVID patients to rest homes? That were facts in science, then his treatment of women were delightful acts of chivalry. So, the CDC says you can skip wearing masks outside. In other news, the CDC says women can vote and wear pants. So, I'm not sure I'm for either. We're going too fast. According to The New York Times, the CDC is finally catching up to the science. It's not true. They're finally catching up to you. We always knew that COVID doesn't spread outdoors. It's not like chlamydia at Coachella, which I learned sadly. We also knew that vaccination was supposed to eliminate risk of spread, which was motivation for getting it. The CDC, however, is so obsessed with the slightest risks, the kinds that are smaller than choking to death on soup, made their guidance as helpful as financial advice from Bernie Madoff. So why did they change? Is it because they've now followed the science? No, because if they had followed the science, they would have come to this conclusion a while ago. Fact is they didn't follow science. They follow you. They knew that if they kept pushing the American public too far we were going to push back. Plus, the experts knew you were right. But they couldn't admit it. And anybody married is laughing at that right now. See? All their guidance is based on fear. Fear of not being wrong, but fear of being exposed. Why is that? Well, these are not leaders. How can you tell? They played it safe. That's not a leader. That's your 75-year-old aunt Tilly backing out of her driveway. Leaders take risks. They listen to experts, but then weigh the risks against the benefits. It's like a coach who talks to his assistants and then goes for it on fourth down. That's a hockey reference, Kat. A leader must face obstacles head on and if they fail, be willing to take the fall. As for the experts in the media, their constant covering of their assets created ever worsening feedback loop. A weak politician might accept the risks of reopening but retreat, the moment someone tweets but people will die. So they told you to sit tight at home masks even if you're living with older folks. The irony that people who yell wear a mask or you're killing Grandma were supporters of the biggest grandma killers of all. Until after every time an adult publicly assessed risk. You get some media asshat asking how many people are you willing to see die? Just over a month ago, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said she had a sense of impending doom. Well, thanks for the pep talk, Doc. You must be great on a plane flight. Fact is we accept death every day. It's sad but true, insurance actuaries count the future deaths we naturally accept no one has ever been able to escape the phenomenon of death. Except Keith Richards. Leaders get that but experts don't. Experts aren't paid to lead. Like Gramps taken a leak at 3:00 a.m. They're just paid to spray their opinions all over the place. And the American people aren't experts, they're better. Think about our ancestors who came here in the opposite of a safe space. No expert was advising them to come here. Like marshmallow top sweet potatoes. It's unique to America. We're number one, because we won't take number two from anyone. So we ditch the masks. But why stop there? While we're at it, let's decide on other crap that we're tired of. Like those stupid little circles on the ground. Where you're supposed to stand in line. I just want to buy Preparation H at Wal-Mart without having to play the CDCs version of Twister. And enough with bringing your disgusting reusable bag to the store. It's got more bacteria in it than Tommy Lee's hot tub. Let's get back to paper or plastic and stop charging us for it. That Green New Deal is all about the green I'm afraid. Seriously, remember how much fun it was to shop for food and the good old days? The smells, the colors, the cereals, the checker who hates you because he wants laughed at her. I'm with her shirts? The produce section was therapeutic. Sure you never bought any vegetables, but it smelled great on your way to the freezer to grab beer and chicken nuggets. Oh man, in the deli section, being surrounded by all that meat takes me back to my wrestling days. And who needs all that meat? Turns out I need all that meat. Seriously, there are like six kinds of salami. No wonder foreigners openly weep in front of the counter. In their shops back home the meat was made of wood. And let's not forget the head cheese. Now we know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa. And let's stop wiping down everything. I've never wiped so hard since that time as a kid when I thought ex-lax was leftover Halloween candy. That's another poop joke. Let's go to the angry white male one more time."

This week, four people, including a transit worker were attacked in the subway, a span -- over a span of three hours, days later, two men randomly slashed three strangers on the subway in a span of 12 minutes.

A car dealership in the U.K. is being forced to pay its receptionist $32,000, that's four million pounds, because her colleagues repeatedly failed to ask her what kind of food she would like to order on Pizza Fridays. Yes, the poor woman was starved for pizza and attention, allegedly. Treatment that the employment tribunal deemed a campaign of victimization, which is what we would call having to eat English food. The receptionist claims that the problem began after she filed a sexual harassment complaint against a colleague in March 2018. But to be fair, if someone accused you of harassment, I wouldn't ask about her choice of toppings either. She also complained about her hours and her pay, perhaps all that complaining must have left her hungry. The dealership managers insisted the real reason she had been invited to the monthly lunches was that she was a part time employee leaving work at 1:00 pm, but the tribunal said that was no excuse. Finally, when questioned why she asked for so much dough, she said she needed the money. Heather, all right, OK, so you got this book, \"The Man's Guide to Corporate Culture.\" This, this is one of those tests, problems that they have in a book at H.R., right? So, there's a dilemma. A woman has a legit charges of sexual harassment, right? I'm going to say for the record, it's legit, even though I have no idea really didn't read the story at all. But OK, here's the dilemma. If you ask her to go to lunch, do you -- are you, do you risk perhaps being involved in some kind of conflict? But if you don't ask her, then you hurt her feelings? So, if - -"
