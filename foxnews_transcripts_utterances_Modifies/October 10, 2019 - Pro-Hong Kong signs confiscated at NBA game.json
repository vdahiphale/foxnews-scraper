It's his first rally since the start of the Ukraine impeachment drama two weeks ago -- he will probably have a lot to say about that. We're going live to the President as he begins speaking.  But in the meantime, good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.  The President is deep in enemy territory. He is going to be actually inside the boundaries of Ilhan Omar's congressional district.  The President has been in a war of words with the Mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey whom he accuses of trying to sabotage tonight's rally. We will be going there as we said in just a minute. This, of all the rallies the President has had, we would say, in the last couple of years, this may be the one with the greatest potential to make news. So this was not a close call for us tonight. We are going to be taking this the moment it begins.  We want to preview what we're likely to see tonight though, with Fox's Matt Finn. He is there at the rally in Minneapolis and he joins us now. Hey, Matt.",

Well, as we see coast to coast with President Trump rallies, thousands and thousands of people started lining up earlier today, and happening right now, there are also thousands and thousands of protesters. Many of them have very vulgar, obscene posters. We're going to try not to show them on air tonight and there have been people here cursing us out telling Fox News to leave.  Many of the people are also blowing whistles. You might be able to hear some of that piercing sound. There are some protesters that tell us this represents a sea of quote, \"whistleblowers.\"   Now, Tucker, leading up into the days of this rally, the Mayor and President Trump feuding. The Trump campaign was billed $530,000.00 for security. \"The Star Tribune\" reports right now that this was the first political campaign that has ever been billed in the City of Minneapolis. The Trump campaign says they refused to pay any more and tonight, he is declaring victory. Now earlier in the week, President Trump tweeted quote, \"Radical left Dem Mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey is doing everything possible to stifle free speech despite a record sellout crowd at the Target Center. Presidents Clinton and Obama paid nothing, almost nothing.\"   The Mayor of Minneapolis responded, \"Someone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he is in town.\" The Trump campaign says it is not paying any more and tonight, he says this rally is going on with the original contract. And Mayor Frey here in Minneapolis has issued a proclamation declaring today, Love Trump's Hate Day in the City of Minneapolis -- Tucker.",

On Wednesday night, \"The Washington Wizards\" here the capital of the nation, played the Guangzhou Loong Lions in a preseason game. Several people protested the Chinese government by wearing pro-Hong Kong t-shirts and carrying signs to the same effect. They were immediately confiscated by stadium personnel.",

And then the left or the right have fought over who controls the politics, but what we're entering is an era where both the economic institutions and the cultural institutions are aligned with the left.

I'm not sure if you saw this, but last year, a Marriott employee was fired in Nebraska, I believe, middle of the country for liking a tweet that was hostile to Communist China. I think we're entering an era of American public life where we have to decide what matters more -- the free speech and expression rights of our own citizens, or the bottom line of corporations who care more about China than they do about us?

When you had Japan in the 1930s bombing the hell out of Chinese cities, America was not going to be involved. But FDR, a beloved Democrat, authorized a covert action finding allowing American Marines, Navy and Army pilots to go work for a private company, and they became the Flying Tigers and they defended Chinese cities from Japanese aggression before the United States entered the war. So now, you could do the same thing. Look, the Syrian Kurds have oil. They have 400,000 barrels a day that they could produce again, that they could sell and export that could pay for effectively a contracted peacekeeping force that would keep the ISIS guys at bay and that would deter the Iranians and the Turks from rolling in. It doesn't require U.S. forces. It doesn't require active duty forces. The Syrian Kurds could pay for their own defense, but nobody in the Pentagon, nobody in this clique of the Beltway wants to think outside of the box and give the President different options.  The same thing they've been doing in Afghanistan for 18 years, is all they've ever given them -- more money and more troops or nothing. And here in Syria, more money and more troops or nothing.

It's his first rally since the start of the Ukraine impeachment drama two weeks ago -- he will probably have a lot to say about that. We're going live to the President as he begins speaking. But in the meantime, good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The President is deep in enemy territory. He is going to be actually inside the boundaries of Ilhan Omar's congressional district. The President has been in a war of words with the Mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey whom he accuses of trying to sabotage tonight's rally. We will be going there as we said in just a minute. This, of all the rallies the President has had, we would say, in the last couple of years, this may be the one with the greatest potential to make news. So this was not a close call for us tonight. We are going to be taking this the moment it begins. We want to preview what we're likely to see tonight though, with Fox's Matt Finn. He is there at the rally in Minneapolis and he joins us now.

Many of them have very vulgar, obscene posters. We're going to try not to show them on air tonight and there have been people here cursing us out telling Fox News to leave. Many of the people are also blowing whistles. You might be able to hear some of that piercing sound. There are some protesters that tell us this represents a sea of quote, \"whistleblowers.\" Now, Tucker, leading up into the days of this rally, the Mayor and President Trump feuding. The Trump campaign was billed $530,000.00 for security. \"The Star Tribune\" reports right now that this was the first political campaign that has ever been billed in the City of Minneapolis. The Trump campaign says they refused to pay any more and tonight, he is declaring victory. Now earlier in the week, President Trump tweeted quote, \"Radical left Dem Mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey is doing everything possible to stifle free speech despite a record sellout crowd at the Target Center. Presidents Clinton and Obama paid nothing, almost nothing.\" The Mayor of Minneapolis responded, \"Someone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he is in town.\" The Trump campaign says it is not paying any more and tonight, he says this rally is going on with the original contract. And Mayor Frey here in Minneapolis has issued a proclamation declaring today, Love Trump's Hate Day in the City of Minneapolis -- Tucker."

On Wednesday night, \"The Washington Wizards\" here the capital of the nation, played the Guangzhou Loong Lions in a preseason game. Several people protested the Chinese government by wearing pro-Hong Kong t-shirts and carrying signs to the same effect. They were immediately confiscated by stadium personnel."

And when you have a country like China that's rapidly growing in part of course, because of our mistakes, what you have is an entire new customer base, where companies like the NBA, like Apple, like a lot of other folks are actually prioritizing their bottom line over the national interest of their own country. And I do think, you know, it really should challenge conservatives to think about what this means for the next 30 to 40 years of American policy, when we're no longer the sole hyper power in world economic affairs."

And if you think about the response to this particular spat between, you know, the NBA, China and the broader country, one of the things that's pretty clear is that one side of the country sees this primarily as a free speech issue as an act of moral cowardice on behalf of the NBA, and that's obviously partially true."

China has 1.4 billion rapidly, upwardly economically mobile people. Those people are going to be customers. They already are the second largest market for the NBA. And I think what we're seeing is that the NBA is not actually making a mistake. It's making a rational business judgment. The other side of this, though, is that the United States also has to make rational judgments about what's in our national interest. And if the interests of multinational corporations align with the interests of China, then we have to accept that we have to fight back."

And then the left or the right have fought over who controls the politics, but what we're entering is an era where both the economic institutions and the cultural institutions are aligned with the left. And the big question for us as conservatives is, what are we actually going to do about that New World, given how significantly different it is from the one we've been living in for the past 30 or 40 years?"

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

So we been asleep paying attention only to marginal tax rates and kind of missed the sea change, and we've been and we, meaning probably the majority of the country have been completely out flanked by people who hate us, hate our values and are more loyal to the Chinese than to America. So what do we do about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VANCE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think at a big general picture level, Tucker, we have to accept that there are more important things than the free market. The free market, as you said, on your own show is a tool. It's an important tool. But it's not the only thing that matters in American public life. I'm not sure if you saw this, but last year, a Marriott employee was fired in Nebraska, I believe, middle of the country for liking a tweet that was hostile to Communist China. I think we're entering an era of American public life where we have to decide what matters more -- the free speech and expression rights of our own citizens, or the bottom line of corporations who care more about China than they do about us? And in that world, what it means I think, is that the standard Bush- Republican approach of more free trade and more tax cuts for corporations, it's not just inadequate, it may be dangerous and stupid."

This week, incidentally, marks the 18th anniversary of American involvement in Afghanistan. The President has said repeatedly he wants out of that war.

Six months hammer, the Taliban and then the Pentagon and the conventional military rolled in, largely repeating the Soviet battle plan. And we've largely gone backwards ever since, wasting hundreds of billions of dollars, thousands of American lives, and no one has really been held accountable. All of these generals, all of these people that were in command. They write books. They are lauded for their leadership, and its failure. What kind of CEO who could run an enterprise for 18 years with that kind of failure and still be lauded? They should have been fired."

So given what you've learned, how should we apply those lessons to Syria?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRINCE",
      "utterance": "Look, the President's instincts are right -- look -- to not have American permanent presence in Eastern Syria. That's not a strategic requirement of the United States. On the flip side, abandoning the Kurds, not the best idea. But there's other ways to do this that doesn't require U.S. forces. A perfect analogy is the Flying Tigers. When you had Japan in the 1930s bombing the hell out of Chinese cities, America was not going to be involved. But FDR, a beloved Democrat, authorized a covert action finding allowing American Marines, Navy and Army pilots to go work for a private company, and they became the Flying Tigers and they defended Chinese cities from Japanese aggression before the United States entered the war. So now, you could do the same thing. Look, the Syrian Kurds have oil. They have 400,000 barrels a day that they could produce again, that they could sell and export that could pay for effectively a contracted peacekeeping force that would keep the ISIS guys at bay and that would deter the Iranians and the Turks from rolling in. It doesn't require U.S. forces. It doesn't require active duty forces. The Syrian Kurds could pay for their own defense, but nobody in the Pentagon, nobody in this clique of the Beltway wants to think outside of the box and give the President different options. The same thing they've been doing in Afghanistan for 18 years, is all they've ever given them -- more money and more troops or nothing. And here in Syria, more money and more troops or nothing. There's a lot of high hybrid ways to do this. But no one is willing to think outside of the box."

But the network has an affiliate in Turkey, too. It's called CNN Turk. We've told you about it. In fact, it's kind of an organ of the government there. CNN Turk knows its audience. So they've taken an entirely different line. They describe Turkey's military operation and serious quote, \"A peace spraying operation.\" They consistently describe the Kurds as terrorists. Just like the NBA, money is the bottom line over at CNN. Author and columnist, Mark Steyn is a connoisseur of CNN Turk and he joins us tonight. So are you surprised that in the middle -- and we've called out CNN Turk a number of times because it's an atrocity that they have CNN Turk.

So you've had situations where the Kurds are in the street protesting in Turkey, and CNN Turk cuts away and shows a cookery show. They protest again, and CNN Turk cuts away to a documentary on beekeeping. They apparently have an endless stock and personally, I'd rather they ran some of that stuff over here. I'd far rather watch a long documentary on beekeeping than Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper or any of them. Bring on the beekeeping documentaries. But what's odd about this, Tucker, when you say it's like the NBA, the NBA in the end is just like guys bouncing a ball around. This is supposed to be a journalistic operation. And the idea that what they do, CNN overseas franchises its brands to dictators, as if it's like Kentucky Fried Chicken, and oh, yes, the guy in Ankara wants to open up a KFC franchise.

Excerpts have come out from Ronan Farrow's new book, it's called \"Catch and Kill.\" It's mostly about the Harvey Weinstein case. The excerpts show how NBC News working at times with Hillary Clinton worked to protect Harvey Weinstein from being exposed as a serial and longtime abuser of women, something that they knew and hid. Well today, NBC News President, Noah Oppenheim was apparently grilled by employees, his own employees during an internal phone call. One staffer called Oppenheim's behavior, quote, \"an absolute disgrace,\" which of course, it demonstrably is though he still has his job. Mark Steyn is back with us tonight. So, Mark, I'm familiar with television PR operations, and I see this one in action over at NBC and they basically are trying to make the story all about Matt Lauer. Did Matt Lauer do this or that? And you know, he clearly did some things, he probably didn't do other things -- but whatever. It's not really the story."

But I think it's actually only because of his particular situation that he was actually dogged enough to sit with this story, because what it is, and you can see this when Hillary's guys are trying to give Ronan Farrow the brush off. Ronan Farrow is a kind of semi-celebrity journalist."

There's a whole complicated thing there. But he says, plugged in, never mind all of that. He is also dating one of Obama's former speech writers and this -- and what this whole story really is, is that at a certain level, it's understood that people have pathologies, people have fetishes, people can be psychopathic.

They're actually closer than that. And at some point, the inference of Ronan Farrow's book is that at some point, Harvey Weinstein actually called on Hillary Clinton to assist her in this matter. You played that devastating clip of Seth MacFarlane at the Oscars talking about the Oscar nominated actresses and saying, the good news is that none of you now have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein. And nobody -- the Oscars goes out around the globe. They always boast that there are three billion people watching or whatever.

In California, no city has more homeless than Los Angeles and in Los Angeles, the epicenter of that crisis appears to be in a place called Venice Beach, one of the richest pockets in LA and along a small strip of once pristine beach, has many as a thousand homeless people now live. Edward Ring is a senior fellow at the Center for American Greatness and co- founder of the California Policy Center. He's got a new piece on the Venice Beach homeless epidemic, which is fascinating. We spoke with him recently. Here's how it went."

    {
      "speaker": "EDWARD RING, SENIOR FELLOW, CENTER FOR AMERICAN GREATNESS",
      "utterance": "Well, the entire county and the entire state is welcoming, relatively speaking, to homeless not just because of the weather, but because of some so-called reforms to California's laws which make it very difficult to incarcerate people who are mentally ill. And also even worse, it's very hard now to do anything about petty theft or to do anything about public intoxication and drug possession. So what you have is kind of a magnet with the weather and this permissive environment."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "California officials -- I mean, we've interviewed a number of people from the state who are involved in responding to the homelessness epidemic crisis, whatever we're calling it, and they always tell us how much money is being spent. How much is being spent? And why isn't it obvious?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RING",
      "utterance": "Well, billions are being spent, and absolutely nothing has happened except the problem has gotten worse. And what we see in Venice, for example, is a situation where they have some publicly owned land, and in particular, they have three acres, right now it's a parking lot. Now, land in Venice Beach, California goes for -- it starts at $30 million per acre. So this is a piece of property that's worth about $100 million. And they're going to build at an additional cost -- the construction cost estimated at $105 million, an apartment building that's going to hold 140 people. So if you do the math on that, you're looking at well over a million dollars per person that you're going to put a roof over their heads and this is an absolute impossible situation to solve when you're spending that much money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But what about -- I mean, people are leaving the state in droves. I mean -- and that's not overstatement. A majority of California residents surveyed this month said they have thought about leaving. And one of the main complaints is it costs too much to live there. So if working people, middle class people can't afford to live there, what do they think of this -- of their politicians spending a million dollars per vagrant?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RING",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a situation where you have to -- you have to assume that if you're really feeling compassion towards the homeless and if you're really feeling compassion towards the citizens who are working very hard to be able to live there, then you have to solve this problem in a more cost effective way. There's opportunities to put together so-called permanent supportive housing elsewhere in Los Angeles County. I mean, in North Los Angeles County, you can buy land for $1,000.00 an acre instead of $30 million an acre."

But he has to actually say, this is what I ran on. Hunter Biden getting 50 grand a month in a country where people earn $200.00 a month. It's not a question of whether it's illegal. It's not a question of whether it's unethical. If you can't smell that, you're in the swamp. You're part of the swamp, because to everybody else, it stinks to heaven."

And now they've simply eliminated the middleman and they've made Hunter Biden the Ukrainian oligarch. So in a sense, they've streamlined the system, but he said just -- he should swamp it up on them.

      "utterance": "Well, again, I think the first time I saw him live last time round was in Burlington, Vermont, where in other words, he decided to go to the capital of Bernie's fan. So he's not Karl Rove. He's not saying oh I am fighting on this narrow, narrow, bitter turf - that will just put me over the edge in the Electoral College. And I think he does this sort of thing very well. When he goes to the heart of left wing liberal America. In this case, it's not Bernie's stand, it's Ilhan Omar's rid-out. And he's taken it to her. And I think he's -- I think that's actually what an American President should be doing. He should be campaigning in all 50 states. People keep talking about how Minnesota is turning purple. And I hope they can actually make that happen and turn it red. But you've got to be there on the ground doing it. So God bless President Trump for actually being there, and sticking it to the heart of left wing liberal Minnesota."

And he actually loves the way this like twerpy mayor has threatened to send him a half million dollar bill for security as if he is just some aging rocker doing his farewell tour. I think -- I think that actually -- he loves that. He thrives on that. But what he has to do here is he has to just have all that Ukrainian murk hanging off Joe Biden 24 hours a day."

      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he'll generally reference that it's a disgrace, which it is, and that there's no due process, which there isn't. And they're in fact trying to remove a President from office in the same stealthy underhand way in which Comey and Peter Strzok and co ran their original so- called counterintelligence operation four years ago. But I think he has actually got to go beyond just saying it's a disgrace and explain why it is and that it's not him who is being robbed. It's actually the millions of people who voted for him who are in effect, having that election nullified one way or the other by the Democrats."

We've been previewing this for 48 minutes, and he is about to take the microphone. This and we've taken a lot of Trump rallies live over the last three years. But I think this one promises anyway, to be among the most newsworthy, certainly the timing couldn't be more in the center of things. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
