For the hour, we're going to do something no other network will do. We'll actually examine the Democratic Party's mission to radically transform America into a socialist nation.  As we speak, 2020 Democrats and their colleagues in Washington are promising you the world. Free healthcare for all, free higher education for all, free housing for all, universal income for all, no more fossil fuels, no more nuclear energy, no more gas powered cars, no more airplanes and heaven forbid, no more cows.  In the end, all Democrats really want is higher taxes, more power for themselves. If they are successful, we're going to pay a very heavy price in this nation -- not only with our wallets but also with the inalienable rights that have made this country the greatest place on earth.  This week at CPAC, conservative leaders are fighting back against the Democratic Party's ongoing love affair with socialism. Watch this.",

And the thing that people have to remember is, you know, socialism it's not a platform of ideas and services and pre-stuff that they will give away. Socialism is a form of tyranny. It's a form of government so you control people's leaves all the way down to what they put in their mouths. And that is a very real thing. That's not something that's made up and you can go back over the past hundred years and you can see a hundred million people have perished, have been killed under that kind of tyranny.   And the funny thing is, when people -- when Republicans try to address this stuff seriously, and they talk about the cost of something like the New Green Deal or the green dream or whatever it is, there's no money. We underestimate the power of socialism. Socialism doesn't need money. They have prisons. They can make people work. And that's what socialism is, and you can try to dress it up any way you want, but that's undeniably what socialism is and we have to combat it at its root.",

Without a doubt, one of the loudest voices pushing the Democratic Party further and further left is socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. According to a report for \"The Washington Post\", she said -- she and other radical Democrat lawmakers said they are lashing out now at their more moderate colleagues. Ocasio-Cortes even vowed to put anyone who voices with Republicans on a list, a list to be primaried in the next election. But somebody might want to remind the socialist congresswoman about this vote that you see on your screen. A few weeks ago, she was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans on roll-call vote 46. That's right. She was the only one and she joined the Republicans and under her definition, she should be on this list. I look forward to seeing who she recruits to primary herself.  Ocasio-Cortez is not the only person feuding inside the Democratic Party. Fellow socialist Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are at odds once again. After a former Clinton aide referred to Sanders as, quote, \"his royal majesty, King Bernie Sanders,\" end quote, a former Sanders campaign aide called the Clinton camp on the record, by the way, with some of the biggest A-holes in American politics, end quote.  Joining us now is Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones and Republican strategist Brad Blakeman.  Thank you for being here. Lawrence, I believe you're at CPAC. You've got some noise in the background. It's exciting what's going on there.  But, Brad, you know, the Tea Party had to deal with these issues, right? I feel like I was on the front end of the Tea Party. I was a must have more conservative member than a lot of others and then there was a battle internally but the Democrats are going through this now. How do you see it playing out?",

The way I see it playing out is this is going to continue right up through the primaries.

That's why I think Joe Biden is one of the main candidates in the mainstream, I'm afraid that the old Joe Biden is going to go coco because the Democratic Party is going to pressure him to go so far to the left, and I think, you know, that may work for a primary but when you're talking about swing districts -- and I mean those districts that voted for then Barack Obama and then voted for President Donald Trump, that type of socialism nonsense is not going to work in those districts. And so, what the Democrats have to do is be more pragmatic and think about what issues are in the mainstream. I'm sorry, when it comes to board security, that's in the mainstream.

And as Charlie pointed out earlier, all you can look to is what's happening in Venezuela. It's a total dictatorial regime that's even preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the people and where are the Democrats? They claim to be for the working man. Where are they on calling Maduro out for what he is?   They can't do it. You know why?

There used to be a talking point from the left that would say, you know, it's not socialism what we're seeing in Venezuela. It's statism, which, of course, is not true. But now we're seeing that they are not exactly saying that. It's really hard to deny that it's socialism that's happening in Venezuela. And so, they are saying it's really not a dictatorship. It's not really our role to step in.

Look, I think that our reporting by Ramos and others showing what's going on there is absolutely essential. The country couldn't be in much worse shape than it currently is, and so what you have from the left is, well, this shouldn't be a military intervention.

As we speak, 2020 Democrats and their colleagues in Washington are promising you the world. Free healthcare for all, free higher education for all, free housing for all, universal income for all, no more fossil fuels, no more nuclear energy, no more gas powered cars, no more airplanes and heaven forbid, no more cows. In the end, all Democrats really want is higher taxes, more power for themselves. If they are successful, we're going to pay a very heavy price in this nation -- not only with our wallets but also with the inalienable rights that have made this country the greatest place on earth.

The standard that was set by Bernie Sanders two years ago in the campaign that Hillary Clinton wound up stealing from him, you know, he set the standard. Every other candidate running this s year, this time around, just about, has picked up the mantle of that Democratic socialism. And the thing that people have to remember is, you know, socialism it's not a platform of ideas and services and pre-stuff that they will give away. Socialism is a form of tyranny. It's a form of government so you control people's leaves all the way down to what they put in their mouths. And that is a very real thing. That's not something that's made up and you can go back over the past hundred years and you can see a hundred million people have perished, have been killed under that kind of tyranny. And the funny thing is, when people -- when Republicans try to address this stuff seriously, and they talk about the cost of something like the New Green Deal or the green dream or whatever it is, there's no money. We underestimate the power of socialism. Socialism doesn't need money. They have prisons. They can make people work. And that's what socialism is, and you can try to dress it up any way you want, but that's undeniably what socialism is and we have to combat it at its root."

Those are the figures. And every single person who is an official candidate for the presidency, among the Democrats, has signed on to the deal. This is the insanity. You know, your guest, Charlie, is absolutely right. Socialism is about controlling ever aspect of your life. If they control your healthcare they have got everything.

Everybody should see it and watch it. But we have to do a better job of illustrating just how terrifying and dangerous this is. And Austan, I'm so glad you're against socialism but I wish that your party would have a CPAC and you could take all the people running for president and go and talk to them and explain to them how terrible socialism is because it's really, really frightening and it's very disheartening to see, in this day and age, a party where an alarming number of its leaders or at least the people that are seeking to lead the party, have fully embraced the concept of it."

Without a doubt, one of the loudest voices pushing the Democratic Party further and further left is socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. According to a report for \"The Washington Post\", she said -- she and other radical Democrat lawmakers said they are lashing out now at their more moderate colleagues. Ocasio-Cortes even vowed to put anyone who voices with Republicans on a list, a list to be primaried in the next election. But somebody might want to remind the socialist congresswoman about this vote that you see on your screen. A few weeks ago, she was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans on roll-call vote 46. That's right. She was the only one and she joined the Republicans and under her definition, she should be on this list. I look forward to seeing who she recruits to primary herself. Ocasio-Cortez is not the only person feuding inside the Democratic Party. Fellow socialist Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are at odds once again. After a former Clinton aide referred to Sanders as, quote, \"his royal majesty, King Bernie Sanders,\" end quote, a former Sanders campaign aide called the Clinton camp on the record, by the way, with some of the biggest A-holes in American politics, end quote. Joining us now is Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones and Republican strategist Brad Blakeman. Thank you for being here. Lawrence, I believe you're at CPAC. You've got some noise in the background. It's exciting what's going on there. But, Brad, you know, the Tea Party had to deal with these issues, right? I feel like I was on the front end of the Tea Party. I was a must have more conservative member than a lot of others and then there was a battle internally but the Democrats are going through this now. How do you see it playing out?"

Now, they get angry if you don't call them that and they are out trying to out- left each other, and the party is in complete identity crisis. The way I see it playing out is this is going to continue right up through the primaries. The American people are going to see a stark contrast, probably different than any other campaign than we've ever experienced, the difference between what the Republicans stand for and the Democrats stand for and I don't think people are going to buy socialism."

How are they going to deal with that internally?"

      "utterance": "They are going to tear them apart. I mean, let's be honest here. We have a Democratic Party that's unhinged. They believe their socialism is the new way. Any type of reasonable legislation that a typical Democrat back in the day would typically support like border security, will get them crossed out from winning the primary. That's why I think Joe Biden is one of the main candidates in the mainstream, I'm afraid that the old Joe Biden is going to go coco because the Democratic Party is going to pressure him to go so far to the left, and I think, you know, that may work for a primary but when you're talking about swing districts -- and I mean those districts that voted for then Barack Obama and then voted for President Donald Trump, that type of socialism nonsense is not going to work in those districts. And so, what the Democrats have to do is be more pragmatic and think about what issues are in the mainstream. I'm sorry, when it comes to board security, that's in the mainstream. Many people across, in those flyover states, those swing districts, want border security. They may not agree with all elements of Trump's but the basic step of a border wall I think they agree with it."

They want open borders. They don't want to give more border wall, they want to tear down the existing wall. How can the Democrats thrive with a socialist agenda that includes an open borders agenda?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLAKEMAN",
      "utterance": "They cannot and that's going to be their downfall, is the fact they will swing so far left in the primaries they can't come back to the middle in a general. They couldn't even attempt it. But here's the bottom line. I think the American people are where the country is and that's just right of center. We're not a left country. And as Charlie pointed out earlier, all you can look to is what's happening in Venezuela. It's a total dictatorial regime that's even preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the people and where are the Democrats? They claim to be for the working man. Where are they on calling Maduro out for what he is? They can't do it. You know why? Because it blows a hole in their socialist agenda when they have to admit that a socialist state is in total chaos. So, I think if Republican states where the American people are on economy, on safety, on national security, we will win. Why? Because we're right."

This is a student that wasn't getting a degree there but got some type of education there at the university. What we don't know is why he was on the campus at the time. The police department has told us off the record that, you know -- on the record, I'm sorry -- that a lot of people in the area go on and off through the campus because it's a downtown area, but they don't know why he was there. What we do know also is that they plan on having a hearing on Monday to discuss what the bond is. That's where he'll see the judge but we still don't know why his ultimate reason for attacking Hayden."

Thank you all three for being here this evening. Allie, I want to start with you. When you see what's going on in Venezuela and you hear what some of those Democrats are saying about what's happening, what do you see? What's really going on there? ALLIE BETH STUCKEY, \"RELATABLE\" PODCAST HOST: Well, Ilhan Omar and Bernie Sanders are apparently perfectly fine with dictatorial totalitarian regimes as long as word socialism is by their name. There used to be a talking point from the left that would say, you know, it's not socialism what we're seeing in Venezuela. It's statism, which, of course, is not true. But now we're seeing that they are not exactly saying that. It's really hard to deny that it's socialism that's happening in Venezuela. And so, they are saying it's really not a dictatorship. It's not really our role to step in. You actually heard Ilhan Omar, maybe say that we shouldn't even be sending foreign aid which is pretty crazy to hear from someone who claims that President Trump is a dictator. And so, there's all kinds of irony and hypocrisy coming from the left."

Look, I think that our reporting by Ramos and others showing what's going on there is absolutely essential. The country couldn't be in much worse shape than it currently is, and so what you have from the left is, well, this shouldn't be a military intervention. No one is talking about a military intervention. We're talking about humanitarian aid and diplomatic relations and having a new election. So I think this is just nonsense from Sanders and Ilhan Omar and others, who quite honestly have a fondness built in for socialism. And that's what we're seeing."

He's holding it up high. Ilhan Omar, we've seen it with AOC as well and they are trying to push young people to believe that this is a system that will work. This is a system that is proven throughout history to collapse on itself. What we're seeing in Venezuela is such a tragedy, a humanitarian disaster. I mean, Jorge Ramos, I mean, he's covered this area, I've been watching Jorge Ramos my whole life. I speak Spanish fluently. What he is saying -- he's right. It's 20 years of a failed system, totally collapsing on itself. Children starving to death, eating out of garbage cans. This is what Maduro couldn't handle. So, when Ramos showed him this video and he had to see for himself what he's doing to his own people -- I mean, it set him off so much that he jailed them. Bernie Sanders, Ilhan Omar, AOC, all of the people that propagate on the left for socialism are just trying to cover up.

      "speaker": "STUCKEY",

I mean, the Bernie Sanders, for lack of a better term, is really the OG Democratic Socialist and he got more votes from Millennials than Trump or Clinton did combined. And so you see a lot of people saying, OK, that worked for him. For whatever reason these postmodern Millennials who have been shoved communism and socialism down their throats from professors for the past however many years are latching on to democratic socialism, because they think it's pathetic and compassionate. They can feel like heroes while still sitting on their couches, and so that was popular with Bernie Sanders. Other candidates are seen OK if we're going to get the Millennial vote, which is a huge voting bloc, well, we've got to latch on to this.

But then it belies the reality which is that it infringes upon our rights. And I think that increasing state ownership is not the answer for an economic ill. And in cases of a natural monopoly like telecommunications or transportation, it makes more sense -- right, that's preventing a large corporation from using their market share to dominate. But in something like this, when the majority of Americans like their health care plan, to remove that choice, and to nationalize it, just like the Attorney General said, it's unconstitutional and also is antithetical to our free-market tenants that this country was founded on."

But this is so much further than Obamacare, which of course I challenged in the courts, this is so much further. It's saying that private insurance companies are illegal and cannot operate. It just -- our system would fail. No one would have coverage, no one would be able to obtain proper medical care, it would make Canada look great compared to what we would have here in our country, and it's just not legal."

Are we regulating it? What are the ramifications what are the penalties if someone did have a car? What are the penalties our corporation that relied on trucking to get our soybeans from Iowa to California. So I think the fact that there's such a lack of thought in that entire process, not to mention how it would be paid for, to me as a constituent and as a citizen where does that deservingly lie, right?

NYPD has issued an officer safety alert, an internal bulletin saying that MS-13 gang members are planning on carrying out attacks on off-duty police officers near their homes. In fact, the alert reportedly states that gang members are conducting reconnaissance of police officers private homes, a frightening thought for them and their families. A former FBI agent told CBS2 New York \"They are going above and beyond what any other gang does\". And the scary part is that we already know that they legitimately carry out threats and are extremely violent. The warning goes on to advise the officers to take extra precaution and change up their routines whenever possible.

And one of the things importantly that Chairman Kim promised me last night, is regardless, he's not going to do testing of rockets and nuclear. Not going to do testing. So I trust him and I take him at his word. I hope that's true. But in the meantime, we'll be talking. Mike will be speaking with his people.

      "utterance": "Thank you for watching tonight. Thanks to Sean Hannity for letting me guest so tonight. If you enjoy tonight's show please feel free to pick up my new book, \"The Deep State: How an Army of Bureaucrats Protected Barack Obama and Is Working to Destroy the Trump Agenda.\" Unfortunately, that's all the time we have tonight. But Sean Hannity, he'll be back from Vietnam. I think he's in the air right now. He'll be in this chair on Monday. Can't miss another episode of “Hannity.” He does give the very best day-to-day coverage of what's happening in Washington D.C. Thanks for watching. \"The Ingraham Angle\" is up next.
