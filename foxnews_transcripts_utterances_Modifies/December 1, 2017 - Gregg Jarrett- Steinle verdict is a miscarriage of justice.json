Mike Flynn guilty plea immediately sparked mainstream media speculation that it was very bad for President Trump but that is getting a bit ahead of the facts in what we know tonight. Let's stick with what we do know.  Retired General Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI. He could have faced many more criminal charges but he is only pleading to this so far because he is now agreeing to cooperate with a Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicating Flynn may testify against former colleagues in the White House. The campaign even and the Trump family possibly even the President himself. New court records show that four days after the inaugural, Flynn met with FBI agents and mislead them about his contact with the Russian Ambassador in December during the presidential transition.  Flynn said in a statement it has been extraordinary painful to endure months on what he calls false allegations of treason, people close to him say, he is broken financially and is worried about legal jeopardy for his son as well. That is why people close to the President are telling us tonight, they believe Flynn is disparate to say anything and may not have anything on the President or others. The President's personal Attorney Ty Cobb saying in a statement, quote, \"Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn even as Democrats claim this is going to be a game changer.\"",

He is delivering on it. Breaking late today, a key swing vote in Republican Bob Corker who is basically been feuding with the president announced he is no on the cut because he is concerned about debt piling up. But in the end, his opposition is not going to matter much because other waivering Republicans, like John McCains and Susan Collins came on board. Giving Mitch McConnell a much needed victory after that colossal failure on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. In fact, right now live on the Senate floor, we have seen Mitch McConnell emerge. He is walking around right now. They are still counting the votes. But McConnell has indicated that they have at least 50. Then Vice President Mike Pence would be the tie breaking vote to push forward on tax cuts and then it heads to a conference committee to work out differences with the House version of this bill.   But the bottom-line tonight Kimberly is, whether the vote happens tonight or there is a possibility it will slide into tomorrow a rare Saturday session for the Senate. Tax cuts in the United States Senate are moving forward. Something the President promised and is now delivering on -- Kimberly.",

Zarate who had been previously deported five times was accused of shooting Steinle with a stolen weapon. Then subsequently dumping the gun in the bay and fleeing the scene of the crime. According to U.S. immigration officials, the federal government plans to immediately deport Zarate as soon as he is released from custody.   This comes after a jury found Jose Garcia Zarate not guilty of murder involuntary manslaughter and assault with a deadly weapon. Zarate was only convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm a charge that could result in time served. Following the verdict, President Trump issued a series of tweets. Quote, \"A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case. No wonder the people of our country are so angry with illegal immigration.\" The Kate Steinle killer came back and back, over the weekly protected Obama border. Always committing crimes and being violent and yet this info was not used in court. His exoneration is a complete travesty of justice. Build The Wall. The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a seven times felon.

Mike Flynn guilty plea immediately sparked mainstream media speculation that it was very bad for President Trump but that is getting a bit ahead of the facts in what we know tonight. Let's stick with what we do know. Retired General Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI. He could have faced many more criminal charges but he is only pleading to this so far because he is now agreeing to cooperate with a Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicating Flynn may testify against former colleagues in the White House. The campaign even and the Trump family possibly even the President himself. New court records show that four days after the inaugural, Flynn met with FBI agents and mislead them about his contact with the Russian Ambassador in December during the presidential transition. Flynn said in a statement it has been extraordinary painful to endure months on what he calls false allegations of treason, people close to him say, he is broken financially and is worried about legal jeopardy for his son as well. That is why people close to the President are telling us tonight, they believe Flynn is disparate to say anything and may not have anything on the President or others. The President's personal Attorney Ty Cobb saying in a statement, quote, \"Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn even as Democrats claim this is going to be a game changer.\""

But in the end, his opposition is not going to matter much because other waivering Republicans, like John McCains and Susan Collins came on board. Giving Mitch McConnell a much needed victory after that colossal failure on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. In fact, right now live on the Senate floor, we have seen Mitch McConnell emerge. He is walking around right now. They are still counting the votes. But McConnell has indicated that they have at least 50. Then Vice President Mike Pence would be the tie breaking vote to push forward on tax cuts and then it heads to a conference committee to work out differences with the House version of this bill. But the bottom-line tonight Kimberly is, whether the vote happens tonight or there is a possibility it will slide into tomorrow a rare Saturday session for the Senate.

He was convicted of manslaughter, he only did five years and was set free. I mean, there has been a consistent pattern in San Francisco of liberal juries letting people go notwithstanding the law and the facts."

The fact is, they excused the behavior and look, my heart breaks for this family. A father and a daughter walking along taking a selfie to wind up dead because someone who should not have been in this country no matter what was on the street in a city that protected him. These are not sanctuary cities. These are refuge cities. They are refuge cities. And we are in a budget time right now. And the one thing the Trump administration should do is tie conditions to the budgets to these cities, to the federal monies and if they don't comply by next Friday, the eighth when they have to get this through, they should make sure that they keep the money from them if they don't comply with federal law."

And then to add insult to injury, we saw that lawyer for this thug, this bum come out afterwards and instantly try to politicize all of it and he talked about how Donald Trump needed to respect the jury decision because he is under investigation or some nonsense like that. It was just absolutely insulting. But if he wants to politicize it, okay, let's have a political fight about this. And you know, that is what we had in the last election. And Donald Trump won. And the reason that he won is because this is not a 50/50, 55/45 issue. This is like an 80/20 issue. Americans are so sick and tired of this kind of crap out of Washington out of the federal government failing to do is most basic essential job that this is a great -- this is a great issue for Republicans if they want to -- and if Democrats want to defend sanctuary cities, defend people like this, defend lawless people from just pouring just over the border, committing acts like this and then getting protected, then fine, let's have that fight. And you know what? Republicans will win in the next election and then Donald Trump will win reelection. I'm fine with that. Let's have that. Let us continue to have this political debate if they want to."

Liberals and liberal progressives are willing to sacrifice American lives for their political goals. Pay close attention to what they do, they sacrifice each other, they sacrifice American lives and their ideology is dangerous to everyone out there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "What is inexplicable is the Department of Justice, the feds never prosecute under the laws. Twenty one years ago Congress passed a law that said, it is illegal not to cooperate with ICE and yet, you have 300 sanctuary cities and counties, San Francisco included, who abuse that law. They ignored that law. And there is another law that says, if you harbor or shield somebody who is here illegally, that is a crime five years behind bars. And if somebody dies like Kate Steinle as a result of what the city and county did in San Francisco, it is life behind bars. The sheriff who let that man walk out of the jail and killed Kate Steinle should have been prosecuted and should be doing life behind bars but the Feds won't touch it. Jeff Sessions needs to get off his duff."

Greg, I am going to double back with you. Because California Governor Jerry Brown, recently signed a bill designating Kanya Mumbin (ph), remember, California a sanctuary state."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "No. No nothing is done about it and I want to add another context to this liberal policy of open boarders not doing anything about immigration. They are in effect created an underclass in America. When you look at the numbers put out there of illegal aliens and they are illegal aliens under 18 U.S. code not undocumented immigrants and you look at the education levels. When they come in with low education levels or no education levels, don't even meet high school graduation at a minimum in America, that means that we are creating a segment of this society that is incapable of participating in this society effectively. We are importing poverty no matter where they come. Whether it's El Salvador, Estonia, Eastern Europe, Asia or wherever. We are importing poverty and that is an economically enviable way to go through and have a society be successful. These liberal policies will bring this country down and when we become the country that no one wants to come to because of these policies, where did their liberal ideologies go?"

You know, you talk about the elections coming up and that that liberals and the Democrats are going to pay for these policies that ultimately can result in loss of life like we saw with Kate Steinle gunned down. But there is a reckoning coming in 2018 and in 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "I think there is. But also, you know, let's remember how all of this insanity began in the first place. It began because the Democrats could not win any fights based on the, you know, the ideas that they were trying to propose. All of their issues they could not win all of them. And so, the only way to do it was to not change their ideas but to change the electorate. And that's why they went to this open border policy and this idea of bringing in all of the, as David says, all of these impoverished people that don't necessarily have any skills or anything. Just throw the borders open and basically treat them as indentured voters so that they could win high office again. And that's what they have done. And I am sad to say, it worked brilliantly. They've succeeded beyond I'm sure their wildest imaginations and they made up the differences for Barack Obama both times and probably made the difference in both of Bill Clinton's elections. And you know, it is really sinister but it's true. And not until Americans take back their country and -- fix all of these problems will, you know, will this mess subside."

But I saw this, the San Francisco jury sadly and I prosecute the case, in the San Francisco and Los Angeles, and it is unbelievable because you can sit there and charge the jury and read the jury instructions and they have a whole different political bent in terms of how they want to see things come out and they are thinking more about outcome than following the law."

And also with us, Agnes Gibboney, her son Ronald da Silva was shot and killed by an illegal gang member while he was standing in a driveway back in 2002. Mary Ann, as a mother, I feel for you for the loss of life, a sense of loss of life and I know this is very difficult, we do appreciate you being here with us tonight.

Look at Brian Terry, the border patrol agent who was killed and countless other border patrol agents who were killed. It spreads throughout our country and it is happening to hundreds of thousands of Americans. This is not just as awful as it is, it is not just about Kate Steinle. Your neighbors and your family and your friends are being affected by illegal alien crime in this country. And we have started as much as liberals don't like to hear this. We've started advocates for the victims of illegal alien crime which is Aviac.US (ph) to bring awareness to the American people. And I am challenging Mitch McConnell to bring Kate's law and those sanctuary for criminal's act to the Senate floor and get those two things passed prior to any discussions about DACA.

Somebody will need to be prosecuted and held accountable to actually stop the flow of blood coming from the criminal what's come in, deported, come back in again and commit more crimes and no one seems to matter, it is almost like you got to give the people an apology we are sorry we have to prosecute you or we can't let you come back in and forth to commit more crimes against innocent, law abiding people. You look at the picture of what happen here and you see this guy. Really honestly I can't believe that San Francisco did this. As bad as the things they have done in the past, how did this guy a felon in possession of a gun not be convicted of anything? I mean it is unbelievable."

There is funding for the wall that is tied up in hide it in other bills and Chuck Schumer comes along and threatens to shut down the government if that is included in the bill and the GOP backs off. Look, it is high time in this country the American people have spoken, they spoke last November and they continue to speak they want this immigration, illegal immigration crisis fixed. They want it solved. We are a sovereign nation if you will be sovereign nation, you have you to have borders and protect those boarders. That is what we expect our federal officials to do."

They are allowing people to come in the country illegally and set up residency and when they kick them out they come back. They kick them out and they come back over.

We got word from Vice President Mike Pence will head to the Capital to preside over the vote. I want to bring you updates as they happen. First the Democratic Party claims it is the Party of women and minorities. Giving a numerous sexual harassment allegation against both Senator Al Franken and Congressman John Conyers is that true. Senator Franken apologized for his inappropriate behavior, but Congressman Conyers remains adamant that he is innocent. Earlier today John Conyers attorney addressed whether he has plans to resign, take a listen."

What a panel we had indeed. All right. So Doug, they are calling for Conyers to resign do you think he should step down. You heard his attorney saying, he is an elderly. Having health problems, hospitalized for stress related issue. And you recall -- harken back to Nancy Pelosi saying that he is iconic and a champion for women and minorities where do we stand now?"

      "speaker": "DOUG SCHOEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think every Democrats, certainly this Democrat hopes that he takes the path of least resistance for himself and the party and does resign. Look, this is a no win situation, because his credibility has impaired and had to give up his chairmanship. And it is best for the party that he goes and I would say Al Franken he should go too. The Democrats have a great opportunity in 2018. The polls show a double digit lead in the generic vote. The only way to realize the full benefit of that is to get rid of the distractions and given what has happened or what has been alleged. I think the party would be best to move on without representative Conyers and Senator Franken."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "OK. So there you have the crux of the problem, which is the individual versus what is the best interest of the Party. Deneen, how do you see this? We saw a woman coming out that is herself iconic in the Democratic Party. Nancy Pelosi making a strong statement in support of John Conyers and also the Congressional black caucus. People coming out to support him, definitely somebody with tremendous amount of public service, but during that time also significant issues and problems and settlements."

      "speaker": "DENEEN BORELLI, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

Lian Sweeden had an actual photo of being groped while she was asleep. John Conyers has this settlement that is out there. There is also another woman that has come forward, we will find out more about that. Bill Clinton had his own evidence that came out about his misdoings. It is all a big fraud and a big front. It is about vote when it comes to identity politics. They play the race card and child card the woman card anything to get votes and anything for power."

      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL SYSNDICATE HOST",
      "utterance": "That is right. In the case of John Conyers I'm not a good person to ask if he should resign. Because the 47 years in my opinion he has been completely useless, this is a man whose area is Detroit. Poverty has gone up. You find the proliferation of children born without fathers in the home, 25 percent of kid were born outside of wedlock 50 years ago when Conyers first came to Congress and now 73 black kid are born outside of wedlock. They don't want vouchers, they want to jack up the minimum wage, it hurts minority woman working part time often on minimum wage, and they don't even want to think about privatizing social security which a study has shown would benefit black, because they die earlier. All the policies hurt black people under Obama for eight years, the black poverty rate got worst. The wealth gap between the average white household and black household widened. The labor force participation rate for black men got worse. Policies have not worked and they hurt the very people they claim they care about women and minorities."

Getting money from women and minority groups this is the Party that they represents best that we feel protected by, that hears our voice. And yet, now look at this, this has been an abysmal failure and Doug is saying, if the Party is to continue to prosper and go forward and actually to try and take advantage of opportunity coming up, they may have to say you got to go."

      "utterance": "Well, Larry Elder makes a great point. Look at the urban communities run by Democrat politician that had been in shambles for many years, failing public schools. High crime rates in Chicago for example. Voters need to lock how their communities have not progressed. How their communities have not turned around for many years. John Conyers is a perfect example. Has been in office way too long and done nothing really for his community to really turn it around. How do you see it?"

      "speaker": "SCHOEN",
      "utterance": "I see it differently. This next election will be a referendum on the Trump administration and failure to get a lot done even if we get the tax bill. It is an unpopular tax bill there is control of the House and Senate, both at stake. These issues are a distraction and a serious one to the parties. I was saying before as you accurately summarized. And I want the Democrats to win as a centrist Party that is inclusive to do that, they need people like Conyers and people like Al Franken to go and we need to develop a set of policies that represent all the people not just a liberal ideological block."

There is no question that the proliferation of unskilled illegal aliens pose a competition for work for inner city people and puts down with pressure on their wages. And Democrats don't want to do anything at all about this even though it is hurting."

Joining us now with reaction Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour, Fox News contributor guy Benson and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Everybody thank you so much for being with us tonight so an exciting night for Republicans working hard on this to get this vote passed. If so, what's next? Go with you, Charlie?"

      "utterance": "It is quite significant actually, I do want to say there has been so much media uproar about what senators are voting and what Senators are not voting, to take a step back and to realize the significance of what is about to happen here. This is the largest tax cut in nearly 40 years. Since really President Reagan argued for it in the early 1980s. We are going to see a doubling in the standard of deduction. Trillions of repatriation of foreign capital back to this country come and you are going to see total reconstruction in simplification of the tax code. I think they are going to get it done tonight, they have many surprises from some Senators from Arizona. This will break the ties so huge, huge win is very strong."

      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM",
      "utterance": "I just got off the phone before we came on the air with a senior source among Senate Republicans they are feeling very confident tonight. 51 votes they say are locked down. The vice President is on his way to the Senate right now to preside over a significant vote. They don't believe he is going to have to cast a tie breaking vote. Every Democrat will vote no and every Republican will vote, yes. Except for Bob Corker who says that he cannot vote on this bill. As to you first question, look, this is going to be despite so much of the misinformation and rhetoric out there on the left this is going to be a tax cut for the vast majority of American people, including the majority of middle class Americans. If you take the standard deduction which is 70 percent of you right now, you are getting a win under this bill. The other point too Kimberly, our corporate tax rate is uncompetitive internationally. It is the highest in the developed world our effective rate is near the highest in the develop world. We cannot compete ion that level, it is inefficient at the least. That is coming down. In a significant way. There are many attributes for this bill that will help a lot of people grow the economy, grow jobs and yet we hear from the left, it is a tax increase on the middle class. That is a lie."

And -- in terms of the benefits of it certainly is keeping with campaign promises of President Trump, the repatriation, et cetera, but corporate attack implication and as guy said across the board the majority of Americans will be able to feel some relief, some benefit from this."

I have been very worried about this as a national fundraiser for elections that are coming up that if we did not get anything passed, we would see trouble in the polls in the upcoming elections in the midterms. This will be really good for energizing the Republican Party and for President Trump. I actually look for President Trump's approval rating to go higher because of this. He could check this box off for one of his fulfilled promises. This will be good on so many levels for the market. For fundraising within the Republican Party and the people that voted for Trump that wanted good policies like this, they are going to get their promise and it going to be good for the American people. We will have a great economy."

    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "That is exactly right. You look at the lies of the leftists are putting against this. I think it is bad politics. You will have people filing taxes in February and March and say my deduction goes up to 20 thousand dollar a year, this phenomenal. Wait a second, I could write off this deductions, this is great. This business down the street is now hiring all the workers this is great. They will look at taxes and say, last year I was writing off 12,000 now I can write off 20 thousand dollar on my tax. It is going to be an explosion of economic growth. Kudos to President Trump. He did that deal with Pelosi back in September. It opened update budget process for this to happen and now Americans go to the Christmas season knowing they will have thousands of dollars in their pocket and businesses will have trillions of total capital to create more jobs in this country, huge win for make America great agenda."

I think it is exaggerated how much that will be the case, but conservatives outa care about the national debt. It is necessary. Also there are some Americans a small percentage of Americans, mostly richer people in blue, high tax states, who will get a tax increase under this bill. We should not make it up and not tell the truth about that. They said everyone will win under ObamaCare. That turned out to be false. It worth acknowledging there are a tiny fraction of Americans comparably who will be losers of the bill but the overwhelming vast majority of the middle class are winners."
