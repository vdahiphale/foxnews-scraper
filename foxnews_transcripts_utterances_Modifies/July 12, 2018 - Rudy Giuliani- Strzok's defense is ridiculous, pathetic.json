We are going to have full analysis of the racketeering from a top law maker Rudy Giuliani and a lot more. Also a bombshell report by The Hill's John Solomon that the FBI may have received, get this, multiple versions of that Russian dossier. Mr. Solomon will be here to explain. And across the pond President Trump, as Sean alluded to, is in England tonight and we will have exclusive footage no one's seen, of what the British folks really think about this President. Plus Michelle Malkin joins us to discuss an exclusive interview Trump just gave a to a UK newspaper. But first, when a Trump hating FBI investigator Strzok out, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Barton and Bailey would have undoubtedly been proud. They may not have been elephants though, or jugglers or trapeze artists flying through the air, but for hours and hours and hours today, former FBI investigator Peter Strzok was talking a tightrope that Republicans desperately tried to knock him off.

At a time when he was supposedly impartially overseeing the Clinton email investigation, he was pretty much actively rooting for election victory.  He agonized, when you read in the text messages, about the possibility that Trump would win and he assured his then lover that he would not let that happen.

So do the men and the women of the FBI who run really high profile investigations, do they really carry on a running commentary via text message about the subject of their investigations and what they hope happens to the key players therein? I don't think so and I certainly hope not. But that is precisely what Strzok did. Now there is no doubt of course as it's repeated over and over again today that FBI agents are like everybody else, they are entitled to their own political opinions and they have them.  But the blatant biases revealed in Strzok's texts and the specificity therein, how he discussed them with his girlfriend are troubling and they remain so. He claims to take great offense and he was sitting up very straight and looking down his nose at the thought that anyone should believe from his own writings that he meant to stop Trump's election and create that insurance policy that he referenced to guarantee Trumps' defeat. But that is what he wrote. And he wrote it, as he said today, when he thought no body was looking but his girlfriend. Strzok's continuing denials of bias are as incredible and maddening as today's hearing. And that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is former Republican Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz, with me here in the studio Richard Goodstein, a former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton and GOP Congressman Ron Desantis who attended today's hearing. Congressman I have to say that I was looking forward to this, I know he already testified behind closed doors. But I thought at times it wasn't working for the Republicans, I got to say. I think Peter Strzok did not come across particularly well, kind of priggish and to me kind of snooty and indignant, I never think that works well for a witness. I like Louie Gohmert a lot, I thought that moment, that exchange with Gohmert and Strzok, I don't think that was good. And I wouldn't want to be one of the Republicans on that committee when that went down.  REP. RON DESNATIS, R—FLA.: Well look I mean it was a day but I would say, I mean reading the text is one thing but then to have him sit there and say, \"I said I was going to stop Trump, I didn't mean the FBI, I just meant the American people would not--\" It wasn't credible just like his explanations were not credible to the inspector general, he was not a credible witness and I think his explanations did not hold water. And so the idea that he is doing this, and he did act with bias as the IG said with the Huma Abedin emails and how he was focusing on Trump-Russia collusion so I think the public got to see the bias. And here's the thing, we pressed on this and he would not answer these questions. What was the basis for the collusion case? You won't tell us about Papadopoulos. He barely talked about the dossier so that's the troubling thing is that you have the bias but then you have this investigation which we still have no there there. He even said ten months after it, \"There's nothing here, I'm worried that there's nothing here\"",

It just was for what, ten hours and you could have gotten some of these points but just the way it is, there's so many people on the committee but that was difficult. But I want to get to Richard here because through the hearing Strzok did insist that he had no bias. But the IG Report as Congressman Desantis referenced said the following, 'When one senior FBI official, Peter Strzok, was helping to lead the Russia investigation at the time conveys in a text message to another senior FBI official, Lisa Page that 'we'll stop' candidate Trump from being elected. It is not only indicative of a biased state of mind, but even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects. We concluded as the IG again, that we did not have confidence that this decision by Strzok was free from bias.' Richard.",

He agonized, when you read in the text messages, about the possibility that Trump would win and he assured his then lover that he would not let that happen. But pay no attention to that because there's no bias there."

      "utterance": "There is no act of bias so this false assertion that you're making that political personal belief must equal bias, that somehow we've merged those two words together in the dictionary is one of the triumphs that's been going on recently that I cannot disagree with more. I and the other men and women of the FBI everyday take our personal beliefs and set those aside in vigorous pursuit of the truth, wherever it lies, whatever it is."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Ok so I have a question. So do the men and the women of the FBI who run really high profile investigations, do they really carry on a running commentary via text message about the subject of their investigations and what they hope happens to the key players therein? I don't think so and I certainly hope not. But that is precisely what Strzok did. Now there is no doubt of course as it's repeated over and over again today that FBI agents are like everybody else, they are entitled to their own political opinions and they have them. But the blatant biases revealed in Strzok's texts and the specificity therein, how he discussed them with his girlfriend are troubling and they remain so. He claims to take great offense and he was sitting up very straight and looking down his nose at the thought that anyone should believe from his own writings that he meant to stop Trump's election and create that insurance policy that he referenced to guarantee Trumps' defeat. But that is what he wrote. And he wrote it, as he said today, when he thought no body was looking but his girlfriend. Strzok's continuing denials of bias are as incredible and maddening as today's hearing. And that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction is former Republican Chair of the House Oversight Committee, Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz, with me here in the studio Richard Goodstein, a former advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton and GOP Congressman Ron Desantis who attended today's hearing. Congressman I have to say that I was looking forward to this, I know he already testified behind closed doors. But I thought at times it wasn't working for the Republicans, I got to say. I think Peter Strzok did not come across particularly well, kind of priggish and to me kind of snooty and indignant, I never think that works well for a witness. I like Louie Gohmert a lot, I thought that moment, that exchange with Gohmert and Strzok, I don't think that was good. And I wouldn't want to be one of the Republicans on that committee when that went down. REP. RON DESNATIS, R—FLA.: Well look I mean it was a day but I would say, I mean reading the text is one thing but then to have him sit there and say, \"I said I was going to stop Trump, I didn't mean the FBI, I just meant the American people would not--\" It wasn't credible just like his explanations were not credible to the inspector general, he was not a credible witness and I think his explanations did not hold water. And so the idea that he is doing this, and he did act with bias as the IG said with the Huma Abedin emails and how he was focusing on Trump-Russia collusion so I think the public got to see the bias. And here's the thing, we pressed on this and he would not answer these questions. What was the basis for the collusion case? You won't tell us about Papadopoulos. He barely talked about the dossier so that's the troubling thing is that you have the bias but then you have this investigation which we still have no there there. He even said ten months after it, \"There's nothing here, I'm worried that there's nothing here\""

It just was for what, ten hours and you could have gotten some of these points but just the way it is, there's so many people on the committee but that was difficult. But I want to get to Richard here because through the hearing Strzok did insist that he had no bias. But the IG Report as Congressman Desantis referenced said the following, 'When one senior FBI official, Peter Strzok, was helping to lead the Russia investigation at the time conveys in a text message to another senior FBI official, Lisa Page that 'we'll stop' candidate Trump from being elected. It is not only indicative of a biased state of mind, but even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects. We concluded as the IG again, that we did not have confidence that this decision by Strzok was free from bias.' Richard."

I thought Jim Jordan had one of the best sets of questions where he got Peter Strzok to admit, under oath, that yes Bruce Ohr was involved. His wife, of course, Nellie was involved working at Fusion, at a company that company that had less than 20 employees and the whole triangulation does involve the DNC.

If Jim Sensenbrenner when he had that gabble in his hand, I have a feeling that that room would have been cleared if that thing kept going. But Goodlatte kind of let roll on a little while.

But it did get out of control, he did trial to gabble him down. And when you have a poor witness with a message that you don't want, that's what you do. You yell, scream, interrupt and act outside of the rules and it got away from him a little bit. But that's the way they act and that's what the Democrats do and that's what America sees.

The revelation comes from none other than FBI agent Peter Strzok who wrote an email to FBI leaders when \"Buzzfeed\" made the dossier public, remember, in early January 2017. He said \"I have the PDF via iPhone. Comparing now. The set is only identical to what McCain had. It has differences from what was given to us by Corn and Simpson,\" meaning three different versions, count them. That likely means the FBI obtained all three different versions of the dossier from different sources, John McCain, far left \"Mother Jones\" reporter David Cork, and Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS. Republican Congressman Jim Jordan asked Strzok about the email earlier today."

John, I think people here \"dossier\" they say what does that mean? It's important because, as Rudy Giuliani said, without that these surveillance, the Carter Page surveillance, the kickoff of this investigation began even though they had not interviewed any witnesses.

Mueller should be ashamed of himself. Those Democrats trying to protect that liar, Strzok, today should be ashamed of themselves. And every FBI agent I know wants to see this guy drummed out of the Bureau and they want to see him not paid. The problem with the dossier is, OK, they like the fake news. We have a deal with fake news. But it also led to a wiretap. And it led to a national intelligence wiretap. And it led to evidence that came out of that. And it led to evidence that was in the minds of Strzok and other people when they continued the investigation of Trump into Mueller. So how much of it is in infecting the investigation today?

And then much like what you have described, what I have been able to dig up is that the reporting on what went on in the summit, in the meetings, was much more collegial, much more forward leaning, and actually some pretty good results. We'll not know what the actual results are until the communiques and the official reporting comes out of NATO.

Even if the Soviet Union is gone, we still have a problem with Putin obviously, but the world was a different place. This is 69 years of our relationship with NATO. I'm glad we have NATO. I think NATO is really important. But the mere fact that Donald Trump said you have to pay your two percent and you can't wait until 2024 when you are all out of office and Donald Trump won't be in office anymore to say we'll have it done by then. He said no, no, you're going pay four percent.

I think honesty and transparency in this very complicated arena is better than just the niceties. Well, we hope you contribute more money, and then nothing happens. That's what Bush did and that's what Obama did. They both said contribute more money, and the pace of the contribution increasing somewhat, but not at the level that we need for a really vibrant and strong NATO.

And that is the United states has continued to increase its investment via the ERI, the European Reassurance Initiative, and now the EDI, European Defense Initiative.

He can't say that! He can't do that! He can't threaten that! And of course what they covet the most is an American president who serves as a doormat who speaks in dulcet tones and only the most obsequious phrases when dealing with Europe.
