He was arguing that his spending plan is a way to transform the power grid in an effort to address climate change. He's framing it as investments that they're making that to make the future better, create jobs, become competitive with China, and, yes, even bring down inflation, he says, all this without increasing the deficit or raising taxes, as we have heard him pitch before. But the massive spending plan is effectively dead in Congress. Today. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not rule out rebranding Build Back Better as lawmakers try to break it up into smaller pieces and get it passed that way. But there just has not been enough appetite for big spending to pass it as it stands. And critics say, critics of the administration say that this is because of inflation. And the White House is bracing for some tough numbers tomorrow on the inflation report. But they're saying that recent data shows a trend in the right direction. Listen.",

And I think there's a direct connection, Charles, between all of this massive debt spending that we have done in the last 18 months in this buildup of inflation, which is why almost no one no -- I don't know a single economist who actually believes that passing more trillions of dollars of debt and more money creation would make this situation better It would almost certainly make it worse.",

Well, Charles, that raises the question, why aren't we raising our own oil and gas production? And you are so right, my friend. The United States of America is more endowed with oil, gas and coal than any other country in the world.

Leaders in Ottawa, as in police leaders and city leaders, are requesting additional police officers to come here to help handle the protesters. But one thing about a potential law enforcement action that has been very concerning to the police is that there are so many kids here.

He's framing it as investments that they're making that to make the future better, create jobs, become competitive with China, and, yes, even bring down inflation, he says, all this without increasing the deficit or raising taxes, as we have heard him pitch before. But the massive spending plan is effectively dead in Congress. Today. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not rule out rebranding Build Back Better as lawmakers try to break it up into smaller pieces and get it passed that way. But there just has not been enough appetite for big spending to pass it as it stands. And critics say, critics of the administration say that this is because of inflation.

Even Democratic economists, like Larry Summers, begged the White House, warned the White House, said, listen, you're going to send us in a place we did not want to go.

And I think there's a direct connection, Charles, between all of this massive debt spending that we have done in the last 18 months in this buildup of inflation, which is why almost no one no -- I don't know a single economist who actually believes that passing more trillions of dollars of debt and more money creation would make this situation better It would almost certainly make it worse."

Why not have a smart approach to this? No matter how much you believe that we need to attack climate change, we're not in a position that we can replace every fossil fuel gasoline car overnight. We can't change homes that are heated by natural gas. Why aren't we taking advantage of what we have been blessed with?

And, by the way, that's the president's solution. Oh, I'm trying to cajole the Saudis to increase their oil production. Well, Charles, that raises the question, why aren't we raising our own oil and gas production? And you are so right, my friend. The United States of America is more endowed with oil, gas and coal than any other country in the world. We should be using it, not just as a matter of bringing inflation down and helping our economy, but also as a matter of national security, when you look at what's going on in Russia right now."

If you take a little look behind me, you can see the stage. There are lots of ways that these protesters have been making noise after a judge said you couldn't honk your horns anymore. You just missed the bagpipes. There have been bands playing and grandmothers playing the drum and shaking jingle bells. They have found plenty of ways to ensure that their voices are heard hear. Leaders in Ottawa, as in police leaders and city leaders, are requesting additional police officers to come here to help handle the protesters. But one thing about a potential law enforcement action that has been very concerning to the police is that there are so many kids here. They're estimating that about 25 percent of the trucks on site have children that are staying in them. So that's one of the concerns that police have here on site. And it's families that these truckers are so concerned about. Take a listen."

Let's get the read from Bob Cusack, editor in chief of The Hill. Bob, it's one of those things. We grew up. We remember the movie \"Convoy,\" right? I mean, I loved that movie. And it was just like regular people. And you relate to them. And I got to believe that politicians in this country have to be very nervous about just the sympathy that Americans have for those truckers."

This is -- these protests are going to happen in Washington and California and other places. And this country's very tired. It's been two years.

And I think that this is just a recognition that, when you have inflation going the way that is, when you have gas prices being up, and when the president's been unable to move his agenda, either on Build Back Better, voting rights, criminal justice reform, well, you have to grasp at straws in order to try to make the American people think that you're doing something. This is a wrongheaded idea. The gas tax is 18 cents. You would suspend it for a year, you might be cutting prices for two weeks, and they will get gobbled back up. They need to be focused on long-term goals, getting in there, passing the legislation that the American people elected them to do."

This is grasping at straws, and it's really rich coming from Hassan and Kelly, Hassan, who, as governor of New Hampshire, signed a gas tax increase, and Kelly, who believes that solar panels and electric vehicles are the way to try and handle the increase at the gas pump, when we all know that, when it comes to solar panels, the supply chain, the global supply chain goes right through China and possibly through Uyghur slave trade. So neither of these are good policies. And these are two people with deeply flawed records on both."

And just, coincidentally, I think gas prices might have dropped 50 -- five cents, 10 cents, and he took a victory lap. Here we are again going back up. So what are some of the more concrete things that you think should be done? I mean, they're not going to give up, I don't think, the climate change agenda."

      "speaker": "PERRINE",
      "utterance": "Democrats aren't going to give up on their climate change agenda. And Biden says he can't change the gas prices, but then tries to take a victory lap on the Petroleum Reserve. What we need to be looking at is going back to American energy independence. That means things like the Keystone pipeline. That means things like fracking. That means things like coal and oil here in the United States, so that we don't have to depend on any other country in the world for our energy needs here in the United States."

Because President Biden had another climate -- some energy folks over, utility operators, again, pushing the climate, maybe rebundling, repackaging Build Back Better.

    {
      "speaker": "PATILLO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's exactly where he should be going, actually, because we know the issue is less so the supply and more so the demand. I think that if you see a large American investment in green energy and electric charging stations and battery technology, that you will see gas prices going down, because now there's competition within the market. We know that, if get cars were invented today, they would be electric- powered, not gas-powered. We don't need be going back in time to the horse and buggy. We need to be going forward in time in infrastructure."

    },

      "speaker": "PATILLO",
      "utterance": "I think we're far less than a decade away. If you look at Tesla, for example, or any of the other electric car companies, the new Mustang is electric, the new Humvee is electric, for a reason, because that's the technology of the future. America needs to get on board and get -- and catch up with the rest of the industrialized world and understand that coal and gas and fossil fuels are the thing of the past. Electricity is the thing of the future. And that's how you won't have to ever worry about gas prices again."
