      "sentences": "Thank you, Bret, good evening. All right. So, we begin with a Fox News Alert. Mike Pompeo, President Trump's pick for Secretary of State barely avoiding a rare rebuke from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after some unexpected last-minute drama on both sides of the aisle. Senator Rand Paul reversed course and voted \"yes\" to recommend Pompeo for Secretary of State, but that left the vote with a 10-10 tie, which is essentially a fail. It was Democratic Senator Chris Coons who handed the Republicans a victory by changing his no vote to present, making the final tally, 11-9 -- that's how things work in the Senate committees. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul joins me now. Senator, good to have you with us tonight. You know, first question, what changed your mind when you met with Mike Pompeo? SEN. RAND PAUL, R—KENTUCKY: You know, one of the things I've always like about President Trump was that he's unequivocally said the Iraq war was a mistake. What I've been concerned about with Director Pompeo is I wasn't sure if he shared the president's vision. Because, you know, the Iraq war and regime change led to a lot of chaos in the Middle East, same thing happened in Libya when we did regime change. And so, I want whoever is to secretary of state to understand where President Trump is coming from. And so, last week, the president asked me to meet with Director Pompeo, and I have respect for the president, I did meet with him. Then, we talked again today, I talked to the president several times, and the president reiterated in strong very terms that we've been at war in too many places for too long. And I think the president's going to surprise a lot of people by really, really trying hard to get us extricated from some of these wars.",

And so, you think you'd be surprised when you see and hear the conversation between the two of us. And really, I've always been an advocate -- I mean, Trump was probably the closest to me on foreign policy of any of the other 16 running. And so, I've always been advocate and a supporter of the president on this, and I want to make sure the people around him share his vision. And over time, I'm coming to believe that, and hopeful, you know, that Director Pompeo does share that vision. But the president told me one way or another, it's his vision and he's not going to be persuaded to start more land wars and have hundreds of thousands of troops in the Middle East.",

And in moments, Senator Lindsey Graham will join us with his exclusive reaction to that, and to the big issues that are at hand with this visit. There seems to be of a surprisingly warm relationship where it had once been quite frosty with President Macron. So, we'll get Lindsey Graham's thoughts on that.

That, of course, is prompting that President Trump has been pushing for since the very early days of his presidency, and now it appears that he's walking away with the win here. Right now, Presidents Trump and Macron, and their first ladies are having dinner just across the river in Virginia at Mount Vernon -- that's the old home of George Washington. And you know, these two leaders have really a remarkable relationship. On paper, they're at odds on almost every issue, and yet in person they've formed a real friendship and they put that alliance to test with those recent strikes in Syria.

But the left has realized they're not really going to be able to hurt the president. The fantasy narrative of Russia collusion has really, obviously, collapsed. And in this case now, you're looking at a subsidiary effort trying to harm the president's support team. And it's not just, you know, the political supporters but a lot of what you see is also attacking and aimed at Mrs. Trump as well, like the Stormy Daniel stuff. Americans, we know through polls, don't care about it. But I think that there's this drumbeat where they want to just wear them down. That said, you've also, though, got, as an activist, and as a former left-wing community organizer, I look at the narratives are going to be versus what the facts of the matter is -- are. And Mr. Cohen, we've already heard from either the attorney's office and other analyst that it's it about his business dealing, and that he's been looked at for months prior to the very dramatic raid, and that it has nothing to do with President Trump. But the Fusion GPS founders a couple of weeks ago had an opinion piece in the New York Times laying out what they want the narrative to be which is -- and they admitted it that they have no evidence for this. But they're now pushing this notion that maybe there are -- with Mr. Cohen, a relationship with Mr. Trump and real estate dealings internationally where there is money laundering and where there's assisting of criminal elements. And even in the piece, they admit that there's, again, no evidence to this. But it's very similar to the dossier gossip, and rumor, and the maneuver and pushing of that. So, it's almost as though the Cohen investigation provides another opportunity for the left to make things up, to run a narrative through the media, to continue to try to hammer it at the Trumps regardless of its veracity.",

And the government had a very interesting response; the response about a third of which was redacted, so he couldn't read it. Said, look, Michael Cohen has been under investigation for a while, and we believe that much of what he's been doing is not been as a lawyer, it's been as a fixer, and Michael Cohen has some sort of a relationship with Donald Trump which leads us to believe that \"the crime, fraud exception to attorney/client privilege will apply\". So, what the heck is that? That means, the federal government told a federal judge that President Trump was involved in a crime or a fraud and was communicating to Michael Cohen about it. And therefore, those communications were not privileged. Yet, when you want to look at what they actually said happened, that's the part of the brief that they didn't reveal to the public and it was, it was redacted. She said, the federal judge, why do you know this? Where are you getting it from? Tammy just alluded to it. Well, the feds told her another federal judge signed another search warrant, this was a surveillance warrant, which enabled us to have Mr. Cohen under surveillance.

Mike Pompeo, President Trump's pick for Secretary of State barely avoiding a rare rebuke from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after some unexpected last-minute drama on both sides of the aisle. Senator Rand Paul reversed course and voted \"yes\" to recommend Pompeo for Secretary of State, but that left the vote with a 10-10 tie, which is essentially a fail. It was Democratic Senator Chris Coons who handed the Republicans a victory by changing his no vote to present, making the final tally, 11-9 -- that's how things work in the Senate committees. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul joins me now. Senator, good to have you with us tonight. You know, first question, what changed your mind when you met with Mike Pompeo? SEN. RAND PAUL, R—KENTUCKY: You know, one of the things I've always like about President Trump was that he's unequivocally said the Iraq war was a mistake. What I've been concerned about with Director Pompeo is I wasn't sure if he shared the president's vision. Because, you know, the Iraq war and regime change led to a lot of chaos in the Middle East, same thing happened in Libya when we did regime change. And so, I want whoever is to secretary of state to understand where President Trump is coming from. And so, last week, the president asked me to meet with Director Pompeo, and I have respect for the president, I did meet with him. Then, we talked again today, I talked to the president several times, and the president reiterated in strong very terms that we've been at war in too many places for too long. And I think the president's going to surprise a lot of people by really, really trying hard to get us extricated from some of these wars."

And so, you think you'd be surprised when you see and hear the conversation between the two of us. And really, I've always been an advocate -- I mean, Trump was probably the closest to me on foreign policy of any of the other 16 running. And so, I've always been advocate and a supporter of the president on this, and I want to make sure the people around him share his vision. And over time, I'm coming to believe that, and hopeful, you know, that Director Pompeo does share that vision. But the president told me one way or another, it's his vision and he's not going to be persuaded to start more land wars and have hundreds of thousands of troops in the Middle East."

And I just see that now, people are admitting, Pompeo and the president are admitting there's not a military solution in Afghanistan. I just can't send one more soldier.

I think the president does want to draw down the troops. And it's a complicated dance to figure out how and when to do that, and how fast to do it? But I don't he accepts what the neoconservatives say. The neoconservatives say, if you ever leave, it's defeat; the other side will win, and we must stay everywhere forever. And that's just plain wrong; we can't afford to do it. The president shares with me that we need to build some things at home: we need to build some bridges, and some roads at home, and we can't keep spending $50 billion a year in Afghanistan."

And in moments, Senator Lindsey Graham will join us with his exclusive reaction to that, and to the big issues that are at hand with this visit.

The White House says, President Trump has just secured from France a commitment to increase their defense spending and meet their NATO obligation over the next eight years. That, of course, is prompting that President Trump has been pushing for since the very early days of his presidency, and now it appears that he's walking away with the win here. Right now, Presidents Trump and Macron, and their first ladies are having dinner just across the river in Virginia at Mount Vernon -- that's the old home of George Washington. And you know, these two leaders have really a remarkable relationship. On paper, they're at odds on almost every issue, and yet in person they've formed a real friendship and they put that alliance to test with those recent strikes in Syria. Ahead of his visit, President Macron explained to our Chris Wallace just how important this alliance is to the French people. Listen here."

The Arabs assuming that Iranians will get a nuclear weapon. They took the $150 billion that they're going to get from sanctions relief, built up their military. They dismembered Syria, now in Yemen, they're trying to make Israel's life holy hell. The guy you just heard is not a moderate.

      "utterance": "Well, I think she's right. She's trying to be very careful. But let's look at this, it's almost like inside baseball, I think, to some degree. But the left has realized they're not really going to be able to hurt the president. The fantasy narrative of Russia collusion has really, obviously, collapsed. And in this case now, you're looking at a subsidiary effort trying to harm the president's support team. And it's not just, you know, the political supporters but a lot of what you see is also attacking and aimed at Mrs. Trump as well, like the Stormy Daniel stuff. Americans, we know through polls, don't care about it. But I think that there's this drumbeat where they want to just wear them down. That said, you've also, though, got, as an activist, and as a former left-wing community organizer, I look at the narratives are going to be versus what the facts of the matter is -- are. And Mr. Cohen, we've already heard from either the attorney's office and other analyst that it's it about his business dealing, and that he's been looked at for months prior to the very dramatic raid, and that it has nothing to do with President Trump. But the Fusion GPS founders a couple of weeks ago had an opinion piece in the New York Times laying out what they want the narrative to be which is -- and they admitted it that they have no evidence for this. But they're now pushing this notion that maybe there are -- with Mr. Cohen, a relationship with Mr. Trump and real estate dealings internationally where there is money laundering and where there's assisting of criminal elements. And even in the piece, they admit that there's, again, no evidence to this. But it's very similar to the dossier gossip, and rumor, and the maneuver and pushing of that. So, it's almost as though the Cohen investigation provides another opportunity for the left to make things up, to run a narrative through the media, to continue to try to hammer it at the Trumps regardless of its veracity."

    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Yes, and here's why: after the FBI raid, Mr. Cohen hired lawyers to bring an application in federal court for the return of everything that was seized, saying these are legal records, and they really belong to my clients. So, in the alternative, to appoint a special master to segregate what belongs to the clients and what belongs to him. And the government had a very interesting response; the response about a third of which was redacted, so he couldn't read it. Said, look, Michael Cohen has been under investigation for a while, and we believe that much of what he's been doing is not been as a lawyer, it's been as a fixer, and Michael Cohen has some sort of a relationship with Donald Trump which leads us to believe that \"the crime, fraud exception to attorney/client privilege will apply\". So, what the heck is that? That means, the federal government told a federal judge that President Trump was involved in a crime or a fraud and was communicating to Michael Cohen about it. And therefore, those communications were not privileged. Yet, when you want to look at what they actually said happened, that's the part of the brief that they didn't reveal to the public and it was, it was redacted. She said, the federal judge, why do you know this? Where are you getting it from? Tammy just alluded to it. Well, the feds told her another federal judge signed another search warrant, this was a surveillance warrant, which enabled us to have Mr. Cohen under surveillance. We've been listening to his phone calls for the past three months. Who does he talk to almost every day? The president of the United States. I believe that this is screaming Trump --"

The U.S. Attorney in New York, a Trump appointee, recused himself and the next level of career civil service prosecutors took the ball and ran with it. Whatever Mueller sent caused the judge, whose name we don't know yet, to authorize the surveillance. Whatever came out of the surveillance, caused them to go to a judge, whose name we don't know yet, and to conduct the raids. Whatever the food of the raids was is being kept on ice by the Judge Kimba Wood until she can decide whether it's attorney-client privilege or not. If Michael Cohen is charged with a crime, having nothing to with Donald Trump and having to the do with Russian, I believe they will squeeze him the way they did with Rick Gates, who is charged along with Manafort in a crime that had nothing to do with Donald Trump and nothing to do --"

They say Nassar, acted like their friend and brought them food, candy and coffee. And the girls say at the time, they didn't know these were grooming techniques. McKayla Maroney who won gold as part of the fierce five in the 2012 London games, said Nassar molested her hundreds of times, starting when she was 13.

And even if they didn't see with their own two eyes or hear with their ears. They weren't making sure that it wasn't happening. This is happening on their property.

Currently in power at USA G that I reported Nassar to and it was omitted why? Still many unanswered questions.

And so I have a feeling it is one of those people and I think that as long as they are still in power. USA Gymnastics will never really going to understand what truly the problem is and how to accept accountability for what they have enabled an abuser to do and the culture that they have created."

When you actually you look into it, I think, Candace own makes a really solid point. I am not in the position of automatically assuming that Kanye West is doing any of this stuff for the most high- minded reason. He is a brilliant marketer and he is brilliant about generating controversy, but at defense of this guy, you know, who said some terrible things about George W. Bush. When George W. Bush was president and he hasn't actually defended Candace Owen's arguments, he just say he likes the way she thinks and likes that she is an independent thinker. That is good enough, you know, but I think Owen's makes a very good point that there are people on the left. People of identity [politics generally. Wanted to reduce all sorts of vast loss of American people down to the color of their skin or a single grievance and that is a big problem on our culture."

I mean, it demonstrate to me that we live in a moment where you simply cannot disagree -- you cannot say anything politically connected without getting lambasted by the other side."

You could be persuaded and I would suggest, what about the people in Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, who had been Democrats their whole life. Who were persuaded by the argument of President Trump?"

And I am not someone who wants s sort of reduce vast swaths of people to say that they all think this way or they all think that way. But, I think, one of the things we are losing on our culture on both sides is the importance of persuasions, of making argument. The whole idea that reason and facts and logic can convince someone to switch their position or be open minded. We lived in a deliberate of democracy. And if no one can change their positions on anything, what is the point of having a deliberate of democracy and I think, there is s sort for bipartisan problem on both sides and it has to do with things that are way upstream of Washington."
