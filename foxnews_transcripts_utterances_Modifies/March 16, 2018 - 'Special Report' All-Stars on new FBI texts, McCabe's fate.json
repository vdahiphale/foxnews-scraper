July, 2016, the FBI opens its Russian investigation, and text messages indicate the FBI agent Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, they were having an affair, they were talking about a relationship Peter Strzok had with a federal judge, Judge Contreras. And in this it ends up that this is the federal judge who would later handle the prosecution of the former national security adviser Mike Flynn. And it also turns out that he sits on the secret FISA surveillance court. The text message, Lisa Page, \"Rudy is on the FISC, did you know that?\" That is they FISA court. \"I did. We talked about it before and after. I need to get together with him. He said he had gotten on a month or two ago at a graduation party we both were at.

Any espionage FISA comes before him, what should he do given his friend oversees them? Standards for recusal are quite high. I just don't think this poses an actual conflict.\" Strzok says \"He is super thoughtful and rigorous about ethics and conflicts.\" \"M,\" not sure who \"M\" is, \"suggested a social setting with others would probably be better than a one-on-one meeting. I'm sorry. I'm just going to have to invite you to that cocktail party. Have to come up with some other work people to cover for action.\" Lisa Page, \"Why more? Six is a perfectly fine dinner party.\"   We don't know where that goes, but it raises all kinds of questions about what they were trying to do with the FISA judge and motives behind all of this.
