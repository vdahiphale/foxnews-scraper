One good piece of news here is the water temperatures right along the go -- along the coast have really cooled significantly over the last couple of weeks. When you have these water temperatures here that you see into the 70s. It's not really enough to be able to sustain a significant storm. That's what we've seen some of the weakening today. Earlier today was a category three storm now down to a category two unlikely weakening pretty quickly here. You can even see that on the satellite representation here really not nearly as organized as it was. All of these things are good news for the folks in Louisiana. Now, that doesn't mean that that energy goes away anytime. Very quickly we're still going to see that storm surge, we're still going to see the moisture. But I think the worst of the winds probably not as bad. Certainly, like we saw earlier in the day to day. Bret, this is the 10th storm. 10th storm this hurricane season making landfall in the continental U.S. It could be the fifth Hurricane, the other fiber tropical storms. This incredibly active 2020 hurricane season is almost done, we have to get through this. Behind the storm, nothing that we're watching right now. And we'll also tell you, we're heading towards the end of hurricane season which is good. Right now, winds into the 40-50 mile an hour range. Probably, it's a little bit stronger as the eye wall is coming on the shore. Center of that storm should be here in a couple of hours. Then we just had a very rainy night and windy night ahead for the folks in Louisiana. Bret?",

So what does that do to the American people? It draws into question the efficacy of therapeutics that have been saving lives in the country, and if you look at since March alone, have been largely responsible for a 90 plus reduction in mortality. So you have Democrats that are actually acting recklessly in undermining American confidence in those therapeutics, which really is the same thing that Kamala Harris has been doing on the vaccine as well.

Twitter declined to comment on the investigation whether it had confirmed the hack or if it's even looking into the incident. U.S. officials have been warning for months of attempts by foreign governments with sophisticated hacking operations that are attempting to interfere in this year's election.

One good piece of news here is the water temperatures right along the go -- along the coast have really cooled significantly over the last couple of weeks. When you have these water temperatures here that you see into the 70s. It's not really enough to be able to sustain a significant storm. That's what we've seen some of the weakening today. Earlier today was a category three storm now down to a category two unlikely weakening pretty quickly here. You can even see that on the satellite representation here really not nearly as organized as it was. All of these things are good news for the folks in Louisiana. Now, that doesn't mean that that energy goes away anytime. Very quickly we're still going to see that storm surge, we're still going to see the moisture.

So I think they need to be honest with the public about that. But I think there's also questions of why Steve Scully, given the fact that he interned for Joe Biden, given the fact that he was a staffer for Ted Kennedy, given the fact that he's previously tweeted out, no, not Trump, never, in 2016, all raise questions about his impartiality, period, and why he was ever chosen as a debate moderator.

On the other hand, he needs another shot at Biden to somehow remedy the damage of the first one and restore his standing in the polls. Watching Joe Biden and his team deal with this information and this news, you get the impression that they are just throwing up their hands and figuring, look, we're ahead. We seem to be increasing our lead, we don't need to fight for more debates. We can live with doing away with this one.

We have an editorial today in \"The Journal\" saying we should get rid of the Commission on Presidential Debates and the moderators. Let the parties control -- let them negotiate themselves. I think it's absurd to have a commission announce who is going to go, when, and under what format rather than the parties negotiate themselves and come to some agreement. So I think the president is drawing attention to that, has some legitimate complaints, and he's probably calculated that he's better off going off on his own.

I think the president probably would like to see a deal get done, maybe more so than Democrats because then they can make the argument that he has denied the American people, particularly given the fact that he has tweeted out that he was in fact the one stepping away. But simultaneously, I think Republicans really need to dig in on what Nancy Pelosi has been saying this week regarding the coronavirus, and also invoking the 25th Amendment and putting that bill forward, because you have Nancy Pelosi saying that President Trump is somehow now altered because of the therapeutics that he received to fight the coronavirus. So what does that do to the American people? It draws into question the efficacy of therapeutics that have been saving lives in the country, and if you look at since March alone, have been largely responsible for a 90 plus reduction in mortality. So you have Democrats that are actually acting recklessly in undermining American confidence in those therapeutics, which really is the same thing that Kamala Harris has been doing on the vaccine as well.

      "utterance": "I hate to say it, Bret, but sometimes his negotiating position makes me think he might be not thinking all that clearly, because just in this tape you just played he said I want something bigger than either the Republicans or the Democrats, frankly. If he's serious about that, then he needs something even bigger than the $3 trillion plus bill Nancy Pelosi put through the House back in May. And that hasn't even been close to the position that Steve Mnuchin has been talking about when he's been dealing with Pelosi up till now. He has really scrambled these talks to no apparent purpose over the last week. And I think we have seen, this has rattling a lot of Republicans, especially House Republican candidates who are in the country trying to run on something constructive about the situation in the economy, and he is leaving the table, coming back to the table."

      "utterance": "Yes, I think these are both distractions. One, the 25th Amendment commission is a joke. It would be approved by Mitch McConnell's Senate, much less signed by President Trump. So it's going nowhere. It's a stunt. I think at this point even a coronavirus aid bill, I understand why politicians want to have it. I think Donald Trump would be better emphasizing the difference between the two campaigns. He belongs to the party, leads the party that is in favor of getting the economy back up and running, and Joe Biden is the guy that said if a scientific advisor told him to shut it all down, he'd shut it all down. I think that's what people have to be voting on."

      "utterance": "Maine Senator Susan Collins there. I asked each of the panelists to pick a Senate race they are following. Chuck, let's start with you. This is Maine. The incumbent, Susan Collins, is trailing Sara Gideon, the Democrat there. But recent polls, this is the average of polls, about 3.7, recent polls say it's getting pretty tight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "The drama in Maine is, is there still room in American politics for a true middle-of-the-roader, which is what Susan Collins has been throughout her career. Her unfavorable rating is now 49 in a state where she has always won election and reelection very easily. I think she may be in trouble. And this is one if the Republicans lose it, their chances of controlling the Senate are dim."

      "utterance": "The truth does matter. Cal Cunningham said that. He's founded an entire campaign on it, and now we know that these affairs were going on with the wife of a combat veteran while he was in the midst of this campaign. It's a hypocrisy that I think the North Carolina voters will reject."

And why this matters is what Senator Thom Tillis was saying, the fact that he has ran as a candidate of honor, integrity, a family man. So this directly undercuts the narrative that he has presented about himself and calls into question his authenticity. So I think that's where it matters. And you see groups like the Senate Leadership Fund up on air with attack ads against him."

The race is -- he's behind. This is an uphill struggle, but it's still tight, and there's still lots of undecideds. So this is one to watch."
