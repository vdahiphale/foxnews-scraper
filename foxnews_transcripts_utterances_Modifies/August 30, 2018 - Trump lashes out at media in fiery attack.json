It's 5 o'clock in New York City, this is \"The Five.\" Let's get after it. All right, the war of words hits a whole new level as President Trump unleashes on the media in one of his fiercest attacks yet. The president slamming much of that press on Twitter today as, quote, totally dishonest, who says -- he says don't care for the truth, writing fake books and using anonymous sources that are pure fiction. This comes after Trump blasted CNN and veteran journalist Carl Bernstein over the network's Trump Tower report, the president saying that the network has been caught in a major lie. CNN and Bernstein firing back at the president saying they stand by their reporting. Greg, lots of tweets overnight.",

He senses -- he can sense the central weakness of the pitcher. In this case, the pitcher is CNN. And he won't stop until the guy throws the mitt down and runs to the stands to fight and he's getting that. And what he's doing is he's giving CNN the CNN treatment because they made that meeting story into a relentless bombshell. Every newscaster was having a conniption about it. And now that story seems to be falling apart and Trump is giving CNN the relentless falling-apart story and he won't let go. So now, I think it's even Stevens and blast point.  Whenever I get like a little bit upset or annoyed about the tweeting, I remember that the media spent decades punching at conservatives, for decades, probably since the Vietnam War. Now, somebody is punching back and they're crying foul. So, I -- it's hard for me to sympathize with the media when they're complaining since they in the left have been, essentially, interchangeable since Vietnam. We're going to need a lot of Trump tweets to kind of even the score, I think.",

And when this becomes the story then it's totally detracting from what's really is the story to me, which is the fact that this large-scale investigation has been undertaken right now with our tax dollars, and it's either pursuing nefarious conduct or furthering nefarious conduct. And we have a ton of unanswered questions about intelligence gathering, protocol, and breaks in chain of command, and the interplay between the DOJ and FBI and congress and this administration and whether uncorroborated, unverified information is being relied upon by law enforcement and potentially the courts and then being leaked tactically by officials in the government that are rogue.

According to the U.N., Al Qaeda's chief bomb maker was killed during a U.S. drone strike late last year. Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is his name. If this is the first you've heard of this, it's because, to the media, tax returns are more important than terror. The true irony, the Trump administration has been so good at killing terrorists that the media can focus that much more on hating the Trump administration. But this progress shouldn't be much comfort. What was al-Asiri known for? The marriage of technology and terror. He was the Thomas Edison of mayhem. Bombs hidden in printer cartridges and electronics that could sneak by scanners and dogs, non-metallic suicide vest, underwear bombs -- remember those? He didn't just design them, he also trained other designers who are still alive and ticking. Meaning Al Qaeda and ISIS are still coming for you and me, but that pales in comparison to a porn star payoff. For the longest time we've heard about climate change but terror change matters more. Even when terrorists fail, they evolve, even if their goal is to return us to the seventh century. That will always be the next really big headline. So we should be thankful for the intel that we get from our allies and our national security folks who remain vigilant while we call each other racists and complained about tweets. Lucky for us, these are great people who aren't distracted by thousands of hacks who give us poop and call it a scoop.  You know, Dana, I like to rhyme, especially if I can include the word poop.",

It's making it was through the senate and I'm all for that. My second biggest issue is a waste of resources in the criminal justice system being spent pursuing this. Of drug offenders in the prison system about 10 percent are for cannabis, and their sentences are statistically the shortest, so think about how much we're wasting prosecuting, arresting, prosecuting, incarcerating these criminals. They're essentially low-level, nonviolent in that -- you know I'm not starting with the exceptions in that pot, no pun intended, to put them behind bars. And to me, the larger national conversation is, especially coming out with the White House is recent commitment to a criminal justice reform. It doesn't make sense with, A, this coming out and, B, kind of the -- as Senator Gardner said, putting the ketchup back in the bottle. It's a little bit too late for that.

Do you remember the demon weed, it's a gateway drug. A lot of this stuff had no statistics to back it up. So what we're trying to do is to reach a reasonable midpoint where we are with alcohol, where we know that it offers benefits but it can be abused. You shouldn't be smoking pot in the morning. You treat it like a martini after work. Once you're successful so you're not a dirt bag. Everything -- everything with benefits that offers relief in life comes -- and alleviates suffering. Whether it's opioids or marijuana, it can be abused. But the state should not be involved in legislating your oblivion. As a human being, you have an individual right to ease your own suffering.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, this is \"The Five.\" Let's get after it. All right, the war of words hits a whole new level as President Trump unleashes on the media in one of his fiercest attacks yet. The president slamming much of that press on Twitter today as, quote, totally dishonest, who says -- he says don't care for the truth, writing fake books and using anonymous sources that are pure fiction. This comes after Trump blasted CNN and veteran journalist Carl Bernstein over the network's Trump Tower report, the president saying that the network has been caught in a major lie. CNN and Bernstein firing back at the president saying they stand by their reporting. Greg, lots of tweets overnight."

He senses -- he can sense the central weakness of the pitcher. In this case, the pitcher is CNN. And he won't stop until the guy throws the mitt down and runs to the stands to fight and he's getting that. And what he's doing is he's giving CNN the CNN treatment because they made that meeting story into a relentless bombshell. Every newscaster was having a conniption about it. And now that story seems to be falling apart and Trump is giving CNN the relentless falling-apart story and he won't let go. So now, I think it's even Stevens and blast point. Whenever I get like a little bit upset or annoyed about the tweeting, I remember that the media spent decades punching at conservatives, for decades, probably since the Vietnam War. Now, somebody is punching back and they're crying foul. So, I -- it's hard for me to sympathize with the media when they're complaining since they in the left have been, essentially, interchangeable since Vietnam. We're going to need a lot of Trump tweets to kind of even the score, I think."

And when this becomes the story then it's totally detracting from what's really is the story to me, which is the fact that this large-scale investigation has been undertaken right now with our tax dollars, and it's either pursuing nefarious conduct or furthering nefarious conduct. And we have a ton of unanswered questions about intelligence gathering, protocol, and breaks in chain of command, and the interplay between the DOJ and FBI and congress and this administration and whether uncorroborated, unverified information is being relied upon by law enforcement and potentially the courts and then being leaked tactically by officials in the government that are rogue.

According to the U.N., Al Qaeda's chief bomb maker was killed during a U.S. drone strike late last year. Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri is his name. If this is the first you've heard of this, it's because, to the media, tax returns are more important than terror. The true irony, the Trump administration has been so good at killing terrorists that the media can focus that much more on hating the Trump administration. But this progress shouldn't be much comfort. What was al-Asiri known for? The marriage of technology and terror. He was the Thomas Edison of mayhem. Bombs hidden in printer cartridges and electronics that could sneak by scanners and dogs, non-metallic suicide vest, underwear bombs -- remember those? He didn't just design them, he also trained other designers who are still alive and ticking. Meaning Al Qaeda and ISIS are still coming for you and me, but that pales in comparison to a porn star payoff. For the longest time we've heard about climate change but terror change matters more. Even when terrorists fail, they evolve, even if their goal is to return us to the seventh century. That will always be the next really big headline. So we should be thankful for the intel that we get from our allies and our national security folks who remain vigilant while we call each other racists and complained about tweets. Lucky for us, these are great people who aren't distracted by thousands of hacks who give us poop and call it a scoop. You know, Dana, I like to rhyme, especially if I can include the word poop."

According to a BuzzFeed report, the Trump administration is starting a committee to counter pro-marijuana messaging, 14 federal agencies working on collecting data showing the negative aspects of weed in an effort to try to balance what they think is an unbalanced public debate on the drug. But some activists, some Democratic lawmakers in states where recreational pot is now illegal, they're pushing back, calling it a misguided smear squad led by President Trump. What do you say?"

And right now there's too much confusion with law enforcement, especially, and with citizens. And, obviously, we have a bipartisan bill that has been introduced. It's making it was through the senate and I'm all for that. My second biggest issue is a waste of resources in the criminal justice system being spent pursuing this. Of drug offenders in the prison system about 10 percent are for cannabis, and their sentences are statistically the shortest, so think about how much we're wasting prosecuting, arresting, prosecuting, incarcerating these criminals. They're essentially low-level, nonviolent in that -- you know I'm not starting with the exceptions in that pot, no pun intended, to put them behind bars. And to me, the larger national conversation is, especially coming out with the White House is recent commitment to a criminal justice reform. It doesn't make sense with, A, this coming out and, B, kind of the -- as Senator Gardner said, putting the ketchup back in the bottle. It's a little bit too late for that. And I just think moving forward, nationally, that it would behoove us to be as efficient as possible and to realize, again, the amount of waste and abuse that's being spent pursuing what really is a -- it's a non-ripple effect."

Number two, the White House does believe that the prevailing pro-marijuana narrative is too one-sided, but that's after 70 years of it being one-sided in the opposite direction. Do you remember the demon weed, it's a gateway drug. A lot of this stuff had no statistics to back it up. So what we're trying to do is to reach a reasonable midpoint where we are with alcohol, where we know that it offers benefits but it can be abused. You shouldn't be smoking pot in the morning. You treat it like a martini after work. Once you're successful so you're not a dirt bag. Everything -- everything with benefits that offers relief in life comes -- and alleviates suffering. Whether it's opioids or marijuana, it can be abused. But the state should not be involved in legislating your oblivion. As a human being, you have an individual right to ease your own suffering. It's a mistake. I do think -- I agree with you. This is more Sessions than Trump. I agree with you. I think -- and by the way, I don't see much evidence that the legalization has led to more violent behavior. Most of the violent behavior, the increases in the country are in Chicago and Baltimore, which is not about pot. It might be gang land drugs."

And I think, when I watch the debate, I just felt like it was like when you put your dog in a rabbit costume for Halloween. It's like it's still a dog. It's not a rabbit. And that's how I feel about Governor Cuomo and these people who are these Democratic candidates who are being pushed more progressive because of their more progressive challengers. But in reality, they're just going to go right back. I mean, within two months of Cynthia Nixon declaring, Cuomo literally reversed public positions on recreational marijuana, and plastic bags in New York, and public housing, and restoring voter rights to felons, and on all of these issues, while at the same time threatening unions and community groups if they ever gave money to anyone supporting Nixon. \"You're going to lose my number.\" It's like you're still the entrenched politician that these progressives are arguing against.

I think that he gave her a chance to have a lot of headlines. The headlines for him were terrible. She got a ton of free airtime. Debates can move votes. If you think about how -- go back to New Hampshire of 2016, when Marco rubio and Christie went at it. And that absolutely hurt Marco Rubio in that debate. So it can make a difference. Cuomo looked thin-skinned. He looked very rusty. I'll tell you something else about her. Women have -- sometimes have a hard time when they're up against a man, because their voice drives people crazy. Her voice does not drive people crazy. They're used to it from television, and also, she's got a lower register. It's an important thing for her.

And once in a while, somebody would and up with a knot on their head, because they got hit in the wrong spot or fell on their face, et cetera. So you know, I guess -- I don't know if it's because we're a more litigious society, and the school district wants to protect itself. I don't know.

It's my honor right now to direct appreciation for his exceptional, selfless and truly heroic service to our country and our presidents, regardless of party, regardless politics, for over two decades. He's protected George W. Bush, Donald Trump, Condoleezza Rice, numerous heads of state. And he's now come full circle. This is the best part. He was an English teacher before he joined the Secret Service 1996, and for his next chapter, he's been tapped by the Seneca Valley School District just north of Pittsburgh to be their head of security and safety."
