      "sentences": "Jonathan Turley on the story that broke late this afternoon. The New York Times moving this piece: \"Rod Rosenstein suggested secretly recording Trump and discussed 25th amendment.\" The deputy attorney general putting out a statement, \"The New York Times story is inaccurate and factually incorrect. I will not further comment on a story based on anonymous stories who are obviously biased against the department and are advancing their own personal agenda. But let me be clear on this. Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\" This deals with a meeting on May 16th between Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, the former deputy FBI director, and Lisa Page, as well as four other career folks from DOJ. One senior official telling us that it was heated and that McCabe was charging that Rosenstein was blocking, getting in the way of aggressively investigating the president and his administration.  Rosenstein yelled back to McCabe's that he was going overboard and in the heat of the moment said, what do you want me to do, Andy, where a wire? And this person describes it going very heated. Do you want me to wear a blanking wire? And the people in the room suggest that that's how it went down. Now, there's more to the story. This is a big deal. Let's bring in our Panel: Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen Susan Page; Washington bureau chief at USA Today, and Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com. OK, Marc, thoughts?",

      "sentences": "Rosenstein says that it's not true, the allegations are not true, and I think it's entirely possible that somebody is trying to goad President Trump into firing Rod Rosenstein because they know this would be a huge P.R. disaster for the president, giving him a pretext to be firing him over wiretapping him when in fact he'd be really firing him over Mueller and everything else that he's upset about. And so they want him to do this. Somebody's trying to get the president to, amazingly, be impulsive and do something not in his own interest.   One of the reasons is there is a CNN poll that 56 percent of Americans believe that Donald Trump has been obstructing the Mueller probe. And if you read Bob Woodward's book, it's the opposite. Bob Woodward lays out the unprecedented cooperation that President Trump has provided, something like 36 officials hundreds of hours of interviews. He didn't invoke executive privilege. Over 1.4 million documents. And so this will create an impression, again, that's already in the minds of the American people going into the midterm election that Donald Trump is obstructing the Russian investigation.",

On one side, people who don't like President Trump, that it's so chaotic that top officials are talking about the 25th Amendment.
