      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Joining me right ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" my explosive interview with ranking member of the House Intel Committee Devin Nunes is coming up. What questions does he have for William Barr when the attorney general testifies before Congress this week?  Plus, a new op-ed this morning detailing how Robert Mueller's investigation was tainted by an unprecedented political crisis.  I will also get exclusive Democratic reaction this morning from Elissa Slotkin, a member of the House Homeland Security and Armed Services Committee, her take on the crisis at our southern border this morning, her party's retreat from the Green New Deal and the controversy surrounding Joe Biden -- all coming up.  Republican House Judiciary member Mike Johnson is here to discuss the committee's vote to authorize subpoenas for the Mueller report and how his colleagues plan to get to the bottom of what happened inside the Justice Department during the 2016 election. Plus, I sat down with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday to discuss ongoing trade talks with China, concerns about Huawei and Europe and the president's decision to cut aid to Central America -- all that and a lot more, as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  And this morning, Attorney General William Barr is getting set to testify on Capitol Hill this upcoming Tuesday. His appearance comes as lawmakers eagerly await his redacted version of the Mueller report, expected in the coming weeks, this amid escalating criticism from Democrats. They are now calling Barr’s summary of the report into question, pushing for the entire report to be made public.  Joining me right now is the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee. Republican Congressman from California Devin Nunes joins us from the World Ag Expo in California this morning,. Congressman Nunes was one of the first to cast doubt on the Russian collusion narrative. He's been working two years to uncover and expose it.   He recently penned an op-ed in The Washington Examiner titled \"The Russian Collusion Hoax Meets an Unbelievable End.\" And, Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here.",

It started by dirtying up a presidential candidate, and then it went on to dirtying up a president. And you had a bunch of, I think, people within FBI and DOJ -- we don't know exactly where -- but they're like the -- want to be the next Deep Throat, the person who is leaking classified information for the betterment of all society.  But, in this case, it just got completely out of hand. And we have had unbelievable disclosures of classified information. And this is why we have been working so hard for two-and-a-half years, waiting for a real attorney general, which we have now in Attorney General Barr.

      "sentences": "So, I would say that, first of all, all of these are classified or sensitive, and so -- because a lot of them could contain sensitive or classified information.  Five of them are what I would call straight-up referrals, so just referrals that are -- that name someone and name the specific crimes. Those crimes are lying to Congress, misleading Congress, leaking classified information. So, five of them are those types.  There are three that I think are more complicated. So you mentioned conspiracy. So the question on conspiracy is what -- there's the conspiracy statute, and then what do they need to look at under that statute? So, on the first one, it's FISA abuse and other matters. We believe there is a conspiracy to lie to the FISA court, mislead the FISA court by numerous individuals that all need to be investigated and looked at that -- and we believe the statute is the conspiracy statute. The second conspiracy one is involving manipulation of intelligence. That also could ensnarl many Americans. And we are -- so that's kind of the second one. As you know, we have had a lot of concerns with the way intelligence was used. So that would be kind of the two conspiracy recommendations, referrals that we're making.   The third is what I would call a global leak referral. So there are about a dozen highly sensitive classified information leaks that were given to only a few reporters over the last two-and-a-half-plus years. So we don't know if there's actually been any leak investigations that have been opened, but we do believe that we have got pretty good information and a pretty good idea of who could be behind these leaks.  It doesn't mean we know all the people who are behind the leaks, because, when you read these, a lot of these, they're always anonymous sources, and they always say something to the effect of current and former senior officials. So we think we have got a pretty good idea of who some of the sources are behind these leaks. We don't know if the Department of Justice has been looking at these. But there's just been unprecedented things have happened.  And I will just close with this. You had conversations with the president of the United States and the prime minister of Australia leak. You had leaks of the president talking, President Trump talking to the Mexican president leak.  We all know the travesty of General Flynn. Nobody knows where those supposed transcripts came from. So those are just kind of three examples that are absolutely horrific. But there's things that are even worse that were leaked. And there is only a couple -- two or three reporters involved in this. And so it wouldn't be hard to get to the bottom of. But you have got to -- so, we're prepared to make those eight referrals this week, so the two on conspiracy, the one on global leaks, and then five that are more specific on lying, leaking, and misleading Congress.",

      "sentences": "Explain to our audience what criminal referral means, because we have been talking about this as well for two years, and our audience wants to know where the accountability is. We already know that there was a criminal referral to Andrew McCabe, the number two guy at the FBI. So where does that stand? What does that mean that he was criminally referred? He's out on a book tour. So viewers are saying, well, OK, he was criminally referred, but he is still on his book tour.   So what does that really mean for accountability?",

      "sentences": "I think it's a great question, because people get so frustrated. As I am all over -- go around the United States of America and in my district, people are frustrated. They're like, why can't you do anything? People have to understand there's three branches of government. We're the legislative branch. We don't strap on guns and bring handcuffs out to the crime scene. All we can do is investigate. We can take information from folks. We can interview people.   And, as you -- as everyone knows, that's what we have been doing for two- and-a-half years. But we don't have the power to arrest, or convict, so we have to take these criminal referrals to the Department of Justice with all of our -- all the information, all of the work that we have done, ask the Department of Justice to take these up. And, look, maybe the Department of Justice already has investigations open, and maybe they don't. But they are the investigative arm. Now, it gets more complicated because you have the top officials in the Department of Justice and the FBI that are likely involved in the referrals that we're going to make. So, with that said, this is why it's so sensitive, why we want to give this directly to the attorney general and let him decide how to take these -- these referrals.   Then, at the same time, just because we have information and the executive branch decides to look at that information, all Americans have a right to a fair trial. And that goes to the judicial branch of our government.  So I know it's frustrating, but we have three branches of government for a reason, and we have to work within those bounds of the Constitution.",

And, remember, what we were trying to get to the bottom of, that was that the Department of Justice and the FBI and the Clinton campaign were essentially taking information from Russians, the very thing they were looking at the Trump campaign for.

So, you have the leader on the team, the deputy, supposedly, and another top lawyer were both involved in the chain of custody of the Steele dossier, the Democratic oppo dirt. It is impossible for me to believe that those two lawyers, very smart lawyers, didn't know in the middle of 2016 that that information was dirt coming from the Democrats. It's impossible. The other two, you had two FBI agents, Strzok and Page, who were kicked off the Mueller team. So, I want the underlying information, because I don't believe -- I think the indictments that were made by the Mueller team, I think some are very questionable.

It started by dirtying up a presidential candidate, and then it went on to dirtying up a president. And you had a bunch of, I think, people within FBI and DOJ -- we don't know exactly where -- but they're like the -- want to be the next Deep Throat, the person who is leaking classified information for the betterment of all society. But, in this case, it just got completely out of hand. And we have had unbelievable disclosures of classified information.

We couldn't really send these criminal referrals over without an attorney general in place. So we're prepared this week to notify the attorney general that we're prepared to send those referrals over and brief him, if he wishes to be briefed. We think they're pretty clear. But, as of right now, this is -- this may not be all of them, but this cleans up quite a bit. We have eight referrals that we are prepared to send over to the attorney general this week."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

Two of them, I know, are about conspiracy. What can you tell us? Tell us as much as you can in terms of breaking this news this morning that you are prepared to send over eight criminal referrals next week. What are they, Congressman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "So, I would say that, first of all, all of these are classified or sensitive, and so -- because a lot of them could contain sensitive or classified information. Five of them are what I would call straight-up referrals, so just referrals that are -- that name someone and name the specific crimes. Those crimes are lying to Congress, misleading Congress, leaking classified information. So, five of them are those types. There are three that I think are more complicated. So you mentioned conspiracy. So the question on conspiracy is what -- there's the conspiracy statute, and then what do they need to look at under that statute? So, on the first one, it's FISA abuse and other matters. We believe there is a conspiracy to lie to the FISA court, mislead the FISA court by numerous individuals that all need to be investigated and looked at that -- and we believe the statute is the conspiracy statute. The second conspiracy one is involving manipulation of intelligence. That also could ensnarl many Americans. And we are -- so that's kind of the second one. As you know, we have had a lot of concerns with the way intelligence was used. So that would be kind of the two conspiracy recommendations, referrals that we're making. The third is what I would call a global leak referral. So there are about a dozen highly sensitive classified information leaks that were given to only a few reporters over the last two-and-a-half-plus years. So we don't know if there's actually been any leak investigations that have been opened, but we do believe that we have got pretty good information and a pretty good idea of who could be behind these leaks. It doesn't mean we know all the people who are behind the leaks, because, when you read these, a lot of these, they're always anonymous sources, and they always say something to the effect of current and former senior officials. So we think we have got a pretty good idea of who some of the sources are behind these leaks. We don't know if the Department of Justice has been looking at these. But there's just been unprecedented things have happened. And I will just close with this. You had conversations with the president of the United States and the prime minister of Australia leak. You had leaks of the president talking, President Trump talking to the Mexican president leak. We all know the travesty of General Flynn. Nobody knows where those supposed transcripts came from. So those are just kind of three examples that are absolutely horrific. But there's things that are even worse that were leaked. And there is only a couple -- two or three reporters involved in this. And so it wouldn't be hard to get to the bottom of. But you have got to -- so, we're prepared to make those eight referrals this week, so the two on conspiracy, the one on global leaks, and then five that are more specific on lying, leaking, and misleading Congress."

We already know that there was a criminal referral to Andrew McCabe, the number two guy at the FBI. So where does that stand? What does that mean that he was criminally referred? He's out on a book tour. So viewers are saying, well, OK, he was criminally referred, but he is still on his book tour. So what does that really mean for accountability?"

      "utterance": "I think it's a great question, because people get so frustrated. As I am all over -- go around the United States of America and in my district, people are frustrated. They're like, why can't you do anything? People have to understand there's three branches of government. We're the legislative branch. We don't strap on guns and bring handcuffs out to the crime scene. All we can do is investigate. We can take information from folks. We can interview people. And, as you -- as everyone knows, that's what we have been doing for two- and-a-half years. But we don't have the power to arrest, or convict, so we have to take these criminal referrals to the Department of Justice with all of our -- all the information, all of the work that we have done, ask the Department of Justice to take these up. And, look, maybe the Department of Justice already has investigations open, and maybe they don't. But they are the investigative arm. Now, it gets more complicated because you have the top officials in the Department of Justice and the FBI that are likely involved in the referrals that we're going to make. So, with that said, this is why it's so sensitive, why we want to give this directly to the attorney general and let him decide how to take these -- these referrals. Then, at the same time, just because we have information and the executive branch decides to look at that information, all Americans have a right to a fair trial. And that goes to the judicial branch of our government. So I know it's frustrating, but we have three branches of government for a reason, and we have to work within those bounds of the Constitution."

You -- if they're busting people -- if the Mueller team was busting people for lying to the FBI, I mean, there's some pretty simple times when people lied to Congress, misled Congress, you know, for the sole purpose of obstructing our investigation. And, remember, what we were trying to get to the bottom of, that was that the Department of Justice and the FBI and the Clinton campaign were essentially taking information from Russians, the very thing they were looking at the Trump campaign for. So I would be surprised if they don't take this up, some of these up that are very just cut and dry, very simple, could be prosecuted in a short amount of time."

We think there's only a few people behind these leaks, but there could be multiple people So, on the leak -- the global leak referral, there could be several individuals. When you look at the conspiracy, I mean, that could get up to a dozen, two dozen people. So, for example, we don't know all the people that are involved. Look, we know Strzok and Page. And we know their involvement because they have been interviewed. But there's other people that were above Strzok and below Strzok that have not been interviewed.

They have had the full support of the media, 90 percent of the media in this country. They all have egg on their face. And so the fact of the matter remains, is there going to be -- is justice going to be served or is justice going to be denied? And that's why we're sending over these criminal referrals. So, you know, there's so much left. Remember, the American people have only seen the pieces that have been declassified so far that we were -- luckily been able to make classified and let the American people know about how the FISA court was abused. There's still more information. I have said this before. This was their insurance policy. A lot of people think the insurance policy was just the overall investigation of the Trump campaign. It's actually much more conspiratorial than that that's left behind there. There was exculpatory information. We talked about it on your show many times. So, look, Maria, I -- if you take what the Democrats have said and throughout the last two-and-a-half years, there's only one thing that you can be certain of.

So, you have the leader on the team, the deputy, supposedly, and another top lawyer were both involved in the chain of custody of the Steele dossier, the Democratic oppo dirt. It is impossible for me to believe that those two lawyers, very smart lawyers, didn't know in the middle of 2016 that that information was dirt coming from the Democrats. It's impossible. The other two, you had two FBI agents, Strzok and Page, who were kicked off the Mueller team. So, I want the underlying information, because I don't believe -- I think the indictments that were made by the Mueller team, I think some are very questionable. And I think there's pieces of them that always read like Russian spy novels. That was done on purpose to create a narrative to make the American people think, as they were indicting these people, that somehow this had to do with collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. And so what do I want about the Mueller report? I don't care what's in the Mueller report. Matter of fact, I call it the Mueller dossier."

President Trump is addressing it. The work that's being done is about this enforcement mechanism. What is it you do if they don't live up to their word? We have seen the Chinese enter into deals before where they didn't follow through. And the mission that Secretary Mnuchin, Ambassador Lighthizer have is to get this deal done in a way that, after the deal is done, after the signing ceremony, American companies can count on the fact they can do business in China without substantial risk their I.P. will be stolen. And if it is, they will have a tool to recover for their loss."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And there's more to it. I mean, we're trying to do a deal with a country that is just absolutely the opposite of our culture, right? When you look at the human rights abuses, for example, in China, talk to us a bit about this police state that they have created in terms of, for example, rounding up Chinese Muslims. They're saying that it's for vocational training, and yet there are officers with guns and barbed wire around these vocational training centers for Muslims."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Maria, there's a long history of China not abiding by its constitution, which says people can practice their faith in China's own constitution. And yet, today, they have rounded up close to a million Muslims, Uyghurs, in one part of their country, treating them horribly. They say they're reeducation camps, but they, frankly, won't let people in to see what's truly going on there, very limited access to this. I met with four Uyghurs last week in my office. One of them..."

      "utterance": "Some of them are survivors. Some of them have family members in those camps. One of them, after our meeting, had his aunt and uncle rounded up and taken to a camp in China. This is the kind of thing that they do to impact his behavior. He's here in America. To impact his behavior here in America. It's unacceptable. They need to let this aunt and uncle -- his mother is in a camp as well. She needs to get her U.S. passport back. This kind of behavior,these human rights abuses are tragic. They are historic. And President Trump is taking on each of these challenges."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "So, the trade deal has its own conversation, its own dialogue that is taking place, but it's against the background of all these other broader issues, issues with China's use of technology and ways that will fundamentally put Americans at risk, the technology from Huawei that is now being put in place all across the world. It's a company that's very close to the Chinese government and will do what the Chinese government asks it to do. And so we have sounded the alarm, urging nations' security apparatuses from around the world not to put this technology in. The challenges with China are manifold. And we're approaching each of them, sometimes, in separate silos, but often as part of a broader conversation with China, asking them to engage in trade and conduct and human rights activities that are consistent with the values that Americans hold dear."

And when you came back from your Europe trip, which was really an important trip, when you were in Poland, we talked about this and how you were getting a little pushback from the European nations. You broke news on this program when you said, look, we will be forced to share less information with those countries that are using Huawei telecom. What's your take on what Italy has done, citing a memorandum of understanding with China? I understand that may not include technology and telecom? What's your take on China's relationship with Italy?"

I think each of the European countries, including Italy, is working its way through this problem set. I think they now have become aware of the risk to their own people, not only directly from the technology, but the risk that America won't be able to work as closely with them, something they often count on and depend upon. I think what we will see is, we will see European countries begin to take this threat very seriously. And I think we will make real progress of protecting citizens around the world from the threat of Chinese surveillance state, Chinese technology inside of these networks."

This is what President Trump's trade negotiations are about. He wants that to be fair. He wants that to be reciprocal. He wants American businesses to have a fair shake when we deal with China, not have to worry that, if they do a deal, they're going to give up the seed corn of their business."

What's your take on this? I mean, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, already very weak countries, foreign assistance programs are critical for them. Is this going to work? Is this another threat? Or how significant is this?"

      "speaker": "POMPEO",

We have been working with those countries. State Department, DHS have been working with those countries. There two pieces to their effort. One is will. Are they willing to help us? Are they willing to stop people from leaving the country? The second is capacity. We have given them hundreds of millions of dollars over the past years to create the capacity for them to do so. They have not demonstrated the will, the willingness to actually engage in stopping these caravans from coming across their border. Our mission, by telling them that this aid will be conditioned on the change in their behavior is to convince them they ought to have the will that they need to try, they need to work at it. We will work with them to build out their capacity to do so, but we have not yet seen enough demonstration of their commitment to actually preventing these folks from crossing into Mexico and making this dangerous trek across Mexico and then coming unlawfully into the United States."

But does that contradict with the USMCA deal? We had Senator Capito here earlier -- Capito, rather -- pardon me. And she said, look, I'm going to support this deal. But I know that a lot of Democrats have come on this program and said, we're not going to support. Now the president is talking about new tariffs on cars coming out of Mexico."

The president is using every tool in his kit. He's also trying to convince Congress to take this threat seriously. We're now seeing members of Congress from both sides of the aisle acknowledge the crisis, acknowledge that we're now in the thousands of people coming across that border each day, with narcotics and trafficking and persons also coming across that border. What we need, Congress, once they recognize there is a crisis, we need them to change. These are simple changes to the law. They could do them today. They need to move. It's time. This crisis, the American people aren't going to stand for this. And President Trump is using every tool in his kit to try and change the incentives, change the behavior, so that we can reduce the risk here in the United States."

If he gets that size of deal, I'm confident the president will say, that's fair. Our tariffs are equal. We're operating in a reciprocal trading arrangement. Let's go and compete and have a great relationship commercially between our two countries."

That is scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday, this as Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee vote to subpoena the actual full report, along with the underlying evidence that goes along with it. Joining me right now is a member of that committee, Republican Congressman from Louisiana Mike Johnson. He's also chairman of the Republican Study Committee and a former constitutional law attorney. Sir, it is an honor to have you here this morning. Thanks so much for talking to us. You are getting set for this testimony of William Barr on Tuesday. This is supposed to focus on the budget, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. MIKE JOHNSON, R-LA",
      "utterance": "It is. The House Judiciary Committee has oversight over DOJ. And this is a regular thing that the A.G. does, comes in and talks about the budget. But I fear that this meeting may turn into a circus. Our Democratic colleagues, as you have seen over the last several weeks, are really on a tear. They really want to dig into Attorney General Barr. And they're not giving to him, I think, the respect that is due. The subpoena that they voted to release at our meeting last week was completely unnecessary. I mean, Maria, you know the attorney general has said that he's working diligently to release the Mueller report. The House voted 420-0 to release that. But our understanding on the Republican side is that that would be done within the bounds of the law. That's the attorney general's responsibility. I think he's doing that diligently. And I hope that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee will allow him to do just that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, let's talk about that. What is in the bounds of the law? You're a former constitutional lawyer. Tell us about the law as it relates to grand jury testimony."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's -- the federal rules of criminal procedure are very specific about this. This is part of the rule of law in this country, is that we don't release grand jury matters. It's very sensitive information, for all of the obvious reasons. Now, there are exceptions to that, but you have to go to a federal court and convince a judge that certain portions of grand jury material is subject for release. The House Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Nadler, have decided to bypass all that. And in a straight party-line vote last week in our meeting, they decided to issue a subpoena to Attorney General Barr to release everything, all of the underlying information and everything else. We think that's a big mistake."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

Stay with us, Congressman. We're taking a short break. I want to talk more about this issue and what you're expecting in this upcoming week, Congressman Mike Johnson, when we come back."

      "utterance": "And we're back with Congressman Mike Johnson. And, Congressman, I don't know how this is going to go down in 2020, when you have got so many -- so much pushback of this president. They wanted the Mueller report done. They got it. No collusion, and yet we're still talking about releasing the whole report, so that they can hang on to this idea for dear life, all the while coming up with really not a lot in the way of proposals for the American people. You are the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives in Congress. And your group came out with a report on the Green New Deal. This is a 13-page pretty much takedown of the Green New Deal. Tell us about your response to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's proposal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's patently absurd. And I think most everyone recognizes that now. At the Republican Study Committee, we do a deep dive on these issues. And we put staff in our -- some of our smartest members on this. And we produced a 13-page report to combat the 14-page Green New Deal. And the findings are just extraordinary. If you look at the estimates of what this would cost the American people, it's somewhere in the negotiating of between $90 trillion and $95 trillion. And, of course, they would want to end air travel and most of our vehicles and all the rest. It's just absurd. And the sad thing is, Maria, that we're in a political climate where you have leading Democrats, people who want to run for the presidency of the United States, who sign on to these absurd ideas."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, a completely unwieldy proposal. And I think most people who are honest will tell you that it would never work. That's the problem that we have. There's two competing philosophies right now. We believe in individual freedom and limited government and the rule of law and peace through strength and fiscal responsibility, some of these ideas that are getting lost in the political debate right now. And we have got to remind the American people that those are the ideals that made America great, and we have to preserve those if we're going to continue this great republic, the greatest nation in the history of the world. We can't abandon it to these crazy ideas of socialism. Socialism is an evil. It has been responsible for the death of tens of millions of people, in Marxism at its root. All of those things are not American. And we have to take every opportunity we have to remind the American people of who we are and why we truly are the great nation that we are."
