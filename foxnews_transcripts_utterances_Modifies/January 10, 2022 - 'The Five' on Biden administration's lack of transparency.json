All right. Counting informal Q&As really does feel like a cop-out. However, there's a little bit of cost benefit analysis or risk assessment that seems to be going on in the White House. Which is, is it better to put him out there to take questions or not? Is it better to have stories like this lead THE FIVE that says he's not taking enough questions rather than have him take questions and cause perhaps additional problems? There's a calculation that you have to make which is why would we put the president out today? What message are we trying to deliver? Can he seal the deal, can he advance the legislative agenda? Can he move Joe Manchin by doing an interview in West Virginia, et cetera? And to me, I think that their answer is they ask all those questions, they do all these calculations and they decide they'd much rather start off THE FIVE with this story rather than something else.",

Dana is absolutely right. This is all about risk and cost benefit to him going out there and saying something that Jen Psaki has to clean up for an entire week. We saw this with the last summer when the infrastructure bill and the spending bill where it was being debated for the first time and Joe Biden said he wasn't going to sign either one of them unless they came together, even though he had just negotiated with Republicans that they would be separate bills and they spent an entire week trying to clean that up and paragraphs of statement. But when it comes to the press here, I don't know what they expected. This is what Joe Biden did on the campaign trail. He was in his basement. He never took questions. President Trump held press conferences for hours on end, so long that they ran out of questions and yet they spent all their energy attacking him instead of being grateful for the access.",

Some have been more successful than others. W had success. Reagan had success with Deaver and Baker. I think as you think about Biden, I think one of the things that he's having the biggest challenge with, I think you and Katie nailed it when he said others are defining his presidency. He is letting others deliver the message and deliver the message around his message. The presidency is really about developing, to your point, Jesse, a narrative, a compelling one, a constant one. Changing and adjusting as some of the circumstances and some of the press may change or facts may change around things but you have to have a compelling vision for why you want to be president. And you should be organized around it. Otherwise, people will define it for you. Take Build Back Better. All Build Back Better was, was a big heap of money in the minds of people who were really opposed to it. People really didn't understand what was in it. Those who were against it defined it as a big grab for climate change when in fact there are other things there. When you pull separately or individually that measure up and measure well with the country. So, I think they should take and learn from it, understand he has 215 or whatever that number was, 216 informal Q&As. Spend a little more time trying to define the presidency, define that narrative and allow the president's values and motives to come out as he's -- as he's explaining and as he's defending and trying to gather support within his own party and obviously with independents and Republicans alike.",

When it comes to the CDC, there's no way at this point that they can claw themselves back to credibility at this point. And this all started back when they started counting COVID cases, whether it was with or from COVID in the sense that hospitals were getting paid more money to have COVID patients in the hospital. So, they tested everybody for COVID whether you were in the hospital or whether you were there for a car accident, for example. Therefore, all the data got jumbled together.

Well, actually he died because he got in a motorcycle accident.

There's no way they can go back through all this data from all the health departments all over the country and make a determination about with or from.

In fact, Biden has done fewer news conferences and interviews than the last five presidents and it's not even close. Biden has only held nine news conferences since taking office compared to Trump's 22 and Obama's 27. He is outpacing the others with 200 informal Q&A's when he's relentlessly pounded by the media.

I mean, remember this is the campaign, the Biden campaign promised to return to normal and I have a feeling that a lot of people in the press corps don't think this is very normal, especially if you just look at those numbers. All right. Counting informal Q&As really does feel like a cop-out. However, there's a little bit of cost benefit analysis or risk assessment that seems to be going on in the White House. Which is, is it better to put him out there to take questions or not? Is it better to have stories like this lead THE FIVE that says he's not taking enough questions rather than have him take questions and cause perhaps additional problems? There's a calculation that you have to make which is why would we put the president out today? What message are we trying to deliver? Can he seal the deal, can he advance the legislative agenda? Can he move Joe Manchin by doing an interview in West Virginia, et cetera? And to me, I think that their answer is they ask all those questions, they do all these calculations and they decide they'd much rather start off THE FIVE with this story rather than something else."

But she is always on standby to clean up or to answer further questions or to clarify maybe what the president meant if he stumbled and doesn't say something that's quite accurate, which he has done a number of times. Dana is absolutely right. This is all about risk and cost benefit to him going out there and saying something that Jen Psaki has to clean up for an entire week. We saw this with the last summer when the infrastructure bill and the spending bill where it was being debated for the first time and Joe Biden said he wasn't going to sign either one of them unless they came together, even though he had just negotiated with Republicans that they would be separate bills and they spent an entire week trying to clean that up and paragraphs of statement. But when it comes to the press here, I don't know what they expected. This is what Joe Biden did on the campaign trail. He was in his basement. He never took questions. President Trump held press conferences for hours on end, so long that they ran out of questions and yet they spent all their energy attacking him instead of being grateful for the access."

He was like those loud parents were all the kids can hear all the fights. He was doing it in real time and it was just the press interviews.

Now if - - because it's Monday and I want to do an analogy. It's been a long time since I've done that analogy. If the presidency were a car, Donald Trump would be like a convertible doorless dune buggy. You know, you can see it all, as it's going up and down the dunes, just like the banana splits. Right? But Joe Biden he's like a black SUV with illegal tinted windows. You can't see in but they can see out. The whole key is you are not supposed to know who's actually driving that SUV. Every day we knew who was driving that dune buggy. It was the crazy man with the orange hair. But this, we don't know what's going on. We don't know who's in control and they want to keep it that way. Meanwhile, Joe is like the last customer at a diner, you know who was oblivious to everybody waiting around wanting to leave. You know? There's inflation. There is crime. There's school lockdowns and he's just having the best time because he's completely unaffected by these problems.

Some have been more successful than others. W had success. Reagan had success with Deaver and Baker. I think as you think about Biden, I think one of the things that he's having the biggest challenge with, I think you and Katie nailed it when he said others are defining his presidency. He is letting others deliver the message and deliver the message around his message. The presidency is really about developing, to your point, Jesse, a narrative, a compelling one, a constant one. Changing and adjusting as some of the circumstances and some of the press may change or facts may change around things but you have to have a compelling vision for why you want to be president. And you should be organized around it. Otherwise, people will define it for you. Take Build Back Better. All Build Back Better was, was a big heap of money in the minds of people who were really opposed to it. People really didn't understand what was in it. Those who were against it defined it as a big grab for climate change when in fact there are other things there. When you pull separately or individually that measure up and measure well with the country. So, I think they should take and learn from it, understand he has 215 or whatever that number was, 216 informal Q&As. Spend a little more time trying to define the presidency, define that narrative and allow the president's values and motives to come out as he's -- as he's explaining and as he's defending and trying to gather support within his own party and obviously with independents and Republicans alike."

But that's what everybody is getting. Apparently, Pfizer says that their vaccine for Omicron will be ready in March. Well, that might be helpful for next year but we are going to hit the peak of this in the middle of the month. I think that the White House would be better off withdrawing the mandates because they are going to take a loss in the Supreme Court and it would -- and for what? It might actually hurt them in the long run when it comes to agency, federal agency overreach. That might be a good thing for conservatives. But if I were in the White House and I'm fighting fires everywhere, I would take that one off the table."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, it slayed the argument. It hasn't necessarily changed the behavior of government officials like in New York, for example, or at the White House who just today continued to justify the vaccine mandates for the postal workers who have said we are having a hard time delivering mail. You want us to send out 500 million tests and we are already short-staffed because of the mandate and they said that they are not going to budge. When it comes to the CDC, there's no way at this point that they can claw themselves back to credibility at this point. And this all started back when they started counting COVID cases, whether it was with or from COVID in the sense that hospitals were getting paid more money to have COVID patients in the hospital. So, they tested everybody for COVID whether you were in the hospital or whether you were there for a car accident, for example. Therefore, all the data got jumbled together. How do they go back now and determine, you know, the guy in Florida who was counted, he was in a motorcycle accident, he was counted as a COVID death? Well, actually he died because he got in a motorcycle accident. Or the people in Colorado who died from gunshot wounds who were counted as COVID deaths but they actually died with COVID, not from COVID. There's no way they can go back through all this data from all the health departments all over the country and make a determination about with or from. As Greg said, everybody has to be able to make their own decisions about their own risk. That we know now enough now about the virus. And let everybody move on with their lives."

It's one of the first viruses we really didn't have a sense, because our virologists and epidemiologists and doctors were not able to be on the ground there in China in this regard. One thing that public health officials though have all agreed on, whether they be ones that we find agreement with or disagreement with or ones who have been around longer than others, is that everyone should be vaccinated. I think to Dana's point, the Omicron variant certainly seems to evade or elude the vaccine but I think that public health officials alike have all said that the vaccines real value is reducing hospitalizations --"

If COVID was an enemy battalion, we would've bombed to smithereens but COVID is an invisible contagion that the government for two years said we have all the answers too, but they didn't have any answers. And for some reason people still continue to believe government is holier than that when government is basically a bunch of political appointees who oversee bureaucrats who you can't fire and they just nag you and nag you until you obey them and you disobey them and they fine you. So, at this point we are wondering how wrong do you have to be before we just doubt everything you say.

Doctors right now are prescribing people Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and you don't -- you don't hear about that in the media right now. I don't know. I think the CDC was saying that schools were supposed to be opened and then they get a call from the teachers union and then they slow things down and now all of a sudden they say you know what, we are changing the guidelines because the science is fast-moving. Whoa, wait a second. You said the science was settled. You said if you question the science, you were a science denier. And that's why we don't like the government because they treated us like chumps if we just asked a question about what they were doing. We were putting lives in danger.

I mean, just in the last year, you've had a Central Park rapist, a Time Square shooting, subway slashers, tree arsonists, a Columbia student murdered, anti-Asian hate crimes. And you know, this guy is going to supercharge what's going to be happening when his policies are implemented. And he's going to be the face of the crime wave. And he seems confused as to why there's this immediate blowback. You can't hide as a public official in New York City. You can be a train conductor that pads his over time to juice his pension and you will get your face plastered all over the screen or the papers here. Reporters will show up to your doorstep and blow your career up. This guy -- he's not just some low-level guy. You have the New York Post, The Daily News, all the local channels, Fox, The New York Times. He's on our radar now. Remember what happened with De Blasio, the New York media machine shoot him up and spit him out. He left with a 25 percent approval rating. A liberal and a liberal city 25 percent. He got laughed out of the Democrat presidential primary. The guy was a joke because he was incompetent, Katie. You can't be an idealogue in New York City. You have to be competent. And we will not tolerate a crime wave in this city. If you're going to have a DA who's going to allow ex-cons to prey on innocent New Yorkers, and then just make sure they get into the therapy session that they need instead of prison.

And perhaps Mayor Adams, who apparently had a pretty good communication with the business community, has asked them to go in and try to help him try to rein this in. You know, time will tell on that. I think it's very disingenuous of Bragg to say he had no idea. He's like, shocked that anybody would be surprised. Well, first, that's a dereliction of duty because you're supposed to be aware of things are going on in your community. The media and communities across the country have been talking about this for a couple of years now. So, that's not a surprise. But I would also ask this. Why do you need all those campaign contributions then? I mean, if you're so uncontroversial, why didn't you just like walk in office without any problems? Oh, why do you have to take all that money? And also, how is it that on your first day in office, you decide that Andrew Cuomo doesn't deserve any sort of scrutiny or prosecution for what happened within nursing homes? How did you decide that on the first day? Someone had to follow the money back on that?"

No doubt, and I we talked about it including the Christmas tree arsonists, there are mentally ill people on this -- on these streets of New York City, especially. But Bragg is using that to benefit the hardened street criminal. Mentally ill people are not robbing banks. Mentally ill people who are not breaking into homes. They're not assaulting women. Some of them -- some of them are doing some pretty crazy stuff. But there are a lot of criminals that are taking advantage of, I guess, kind of like the absentee landlord-ism that's taken over our cities. You know, everything that comes out of this guy's mouth is laughing in wisdom. It's like he's never met a real criminal or he's never witnessed a violent crime."

But I don't know. I mean, like, I look around and I feel like New York City is one city like Minneapolis and others that is permanently scarred, right? If you can't stop the moderate to severe crime, then criminals, we're just going to keep seeing how further they can push it along and push it along and push along. And if we can't even stop that level of crime, then you're not going to -- then it can't actually get better. It can only get worse. We've set a new level of what we're willing to accept. It used to be down here now it's up here. You can't -- if you don't arrest this stuff, it's only going to get worse.

I think we all five would agree with that. I live in, my kids go to school in, and I vote in New York. I think if Mr. Bragg said these things during the campaign, I would not have voted for him. And I think he probably wouldn't have gotten a lot of the votes that he did get. You would think that Mayor Adams said not to say -- I think Mayor Adams and his police commissioner, they are committed to the things that we've all articulated here. I would hope and would encourage the DA to think about changes to bail reform, to think about a coalition or partnership with the city and others around making our subway safer. And to Greg's point and the points that we've made many times on this show, we need a mental health initiative, a real one, a serious one to address these issues. Addressing and starting off this way I think is an auspicious start. I don't think Mr. Bragg has thought a lot of this through. He's a smart guy and I hope he sits back and reevaluates here.

And you could hear in the background Saget say, tell him to go F himself. So, that's what -- that's what -- my point being this, is that Saget probably would hate tributes about this. Like, he would -- he's -- like, even though he played the nice guy, he was a -- he had a dirty, dirty mind. Anybody who knows him will tell you that. He was a sick, sick guy.

They did eight seasons and averaged 15 million viewers an episode. I mean, that is a lot. And then he parlays that into America's Funniest Home Videos which was the first viral video show ever. This was pre-internet. This was where it was home videos. The people shot on a camcorder of people falling down, animals falling down, or animals making people fall down. And for people with a really low-brow sense of humor, I loved it. And then the audience got to vote on who the best video was. And then he get a cash prize. And that did that nine year run. So, there was a time in like, from like the late 80s to the mid-90s where Bob Saget was watched for hours on television by tens and tens of millions of people. And that's why people love him so much.
