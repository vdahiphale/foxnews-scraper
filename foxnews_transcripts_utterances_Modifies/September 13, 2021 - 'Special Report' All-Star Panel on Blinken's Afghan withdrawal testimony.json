Moreover, the deadline was part of an agreement with that had been reached with the Trump administration a weak one, in my opinion from U.S.'s point of view, but an agreement nonetheless, that had conditions in it. And the conditions that plainly not been met to include the condition that the Taliban would have reached an agreement with the Afghan government negotiations on that ever started.  So, the idea that they were under a deadline of -- the meaningful deadline on the 1st of May is nonsense, and everything is predicated on that is, therefore, nonsense as well.",

What are our priorities? What's going to make America more competitive? What should our spending and tax policies be to support making America competitive? How do we make the tax system fairer and more incentivized for not just the rich but for every American? And what areas do we invest in? It's unclear to me if the $3.5 trillion -- I'm probably with some of them. I'm not in favor of all of those things there. But there are some of those things that we as a nation to beat China in the 21st century, to be able to compete and create jobs and opportunity and have our own medical research and supply chains here, we're going to have to make some of these investments.

The fact that we have had that much reckless spending is the worst possible argument for doing more of it. And, yet that is where we are. My guess is, yes, the debt ceiling will be raised because it has to be raised. The $3.5 trillion measure probably will not pass, the worry that Republicans who are trying to stop it have is that something like 3.4 -- I'm exaggerating, but you get the picture -- might pass. In other words, when Joe Manchin says he thinks it's more like $1.5., You are looking at compromising on that, you are getting to pretty big numbers there.

Well, obviously, they were free to extend that deadline for as long as they wanted. Moreover, the deadline was part of an agreement with that had been reached with the Trump administration a weak one, in my opinion from U.S.'s point of view, but an agreement nonetheless, that had conditions in it. And the conditions that plainly not been met to include the condition that the Taliban would have reached an agreement with the Afghan government negotiations on that ever started. So, the idea that they were under a deadline of -- the meaningful deadline on the 1st of May is nonsense, and everything is predicated on that is, therefore, nonsense as well."

That's a euphemism for murderers and torturers, and we relying on their goodwill. Look, the question of how many people, how many SIV holders, how many Americans tears at the heart. And lord knows we want them all back. But with tears at the mind, is the celebration of terrorism that is going on around the world. You know this? The Taliban's hold will be strengthened by the fact that terrorists all over the world will descend on Kabul and celebrate the victory over the Americans. This is a really frightening thing. Let's get our guys out. Let's get folks out who helped us. But goodness knows we are facing a very, very bad situation. Mike McCaul had it right -- ranking member on the committee.

      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD JR., FOX NEWS CHANNEL POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR (on camera)",
      "utterance": "Well, first, thanks for having me on. Look, I think that point there he made is one worth noting, particularly for this conversation. I would agree with Brit Hume that they -- May 31st or May 1st or August 31st state, those were things that did not have to be adhered to, maybe. Because the agreement call for 5,000 Taliban prisoners to be released, that call for the Taliban not to attack U.S. soldiers, as long as we adhere to the agreement. So, what I heard Secretary Blinken saying there was that if they didn't adhere to the agreement that perhaps, and maybe Taliban would violate their part as well. But let's be clear, they mishandled this exit. This could have been handle much better. I'm encouraged the Democratic committees in the Congress -- Democratic chairs of committees or leading oversight of this and are asking very probing, and tough, and honest questions. And I thought Secretary Blinken probably should have come down today to the House. But I thought he was very candid and honest, and frankly, lengthy with some of his answers."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Brit, the politics of this and where this goes. We're in the moment here, there are people on the ground we're trying to get out. But the impact on this administration, this president, from what both sides say was, was pretty hasty and screwed up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is not a -- this is not a foreign policy disaster that a lot of people really disagree on. They were sort of fainted attempts in that hearing today to defend the administration, and this or that way, but nobody's really arguing this is well done or wisely done, or in the end, successful to the extent the administration continues to claim that it is. I think it's a stain on this administration. It is one that will endure. And my own view is that this is placed Joe Biden in new light in the eyes of most Americans who, you know, despite the fact that he had that long career and was vice president, they didn't really know him that well. This was his first big one, and he whiffed on it. And I think it -- and I think it's left him damaged, not just because of how badly the departures there -- from there went, but also because of how poorly he handled it in the aftermath."

      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think there will be. The real resignation should be the president of United States. This was his game. Look, Ryan Crocker, former ambassador to Afghanistan said to me in an interview, he said, look, Trump made a mistake in dealing with the Taliban. But Biden owns this 100 percent. This was his decision, and it's a disaster. And a brief -- briefly, disagreement with my friend Harold Ford rare, but I don't think the Democrats were probing, I think they were really getting behind Joe Biden, attacking Republicans and tried to blame it on Donald Trump. Well, that's a new card. Blame it on Donald Trump."

And on its worst day, both incompetent and corrupt. So, there's a lot of blame to go here. And I think that as we get through some of these hearings and the accountability begins to fall, let's let the chips fall where they may. Let's learn from this era."

This is the human infrastructure bill that Democrats have been talking about in addition to the first one that had bipartisan support. There is a big list of things to do for Congress. The Senate just returned to reconvene today. A reconciliation package, what we're talking about here, is due on September 15th. The House comes back the 20th. There is a vote on the infrastructure bill on the 27th. The end of the fiscal year is the 30th and, oh, yes, the debt ceiling, there's a couple other things in there need to get done, some fiscal cliffs to come. And they are talking taxes. We are back with our panel, Brit Hume, Bill Bennett, Harold Ford Jr. Harold, you know this from being there in the House. Usually, it takes a cliff of some kind or a threat of not going home to get things done. It seems like that's where we're headed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD JR., FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "Without question. As it relates to this debt ceiling, it always amazed me, this is money that we have already spent as a country. We need a different process around how the debt ceiling is raised. But to the larger point around when Joe Manchin and Mark Warner and others are saying about this $3.5 trillion package, I think Joe Manchin has it about right about how you are thinking about this. What are our priorities? What's going to make America more competitive? What should our spending and tax policies be to support making America competitive? How do we make the tax system fairer and more incentivized for not just the rich but for every American? And what areas do we invest in? It's unclear to me if the $3.5 trillion -- I'm probably with some of them. I'm not in favor of all of those things there. But there are some of those things that we as a nation to beat China in the 21st century, to be able to compete and create jobs and opportunity and have our own medical research and supply chains here, we're going to have to make some of these investments. So I think Manchin is on the right path. I hope he is open- minded about it, and I hope the other Democrats, including some of the more liberal ones, are open-minded as well."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, We've had at least three consecutive presidencies engaged in truly reckless spending. Senator McConnell is right. That's the right word, \"reckless.\" And additions to the national debt have been staggering. And what I hear now from some on the Democratic Party is, well, Donald Trump spent recklessly and so on. The fact that we have had that much reckless spending is the worst possible argument for doing more of it. And, yet that is where we are. My guess is, yes, the debt ceiling will be raised because it has to be raised. The $3.5 trillion measure probably will not pass, the worry that Republicans who are trying to stop it have is that something like 3.4 -- I'm exaggerating, but you get the picture -- might pass. In other words, when Joe Manchin says he thinks it's more like $1.5., You are looking at compromising on that, you are getting to pretty big numbers there. So my guess is, Bret, in the end, a big chunk of this socialist spending Democrats want will pass, but certainly not $3.5 trillion."

    {
      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "One of the other arguments he makes -- I'm going to pay for that, aren't I? But one of the other arguments he makes is what about the money we have already appropriated? Has it all been spent? It has not all been spent. This $3.5 is larger than the entire federal budget of George W. Bush. It's extraordinary amount of money. It's not going to get through, and maybe that 1.2 being hostage to this may not make it either."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Harold, Bill makes a good point about Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia taking a lot of the heat from progressives and a lot of the focus in all the interviews. However, there are other moderates like Kyrsten Sinema from Arizona. You heard Mark Warner having concerns about this from Virginia. Maggie Hassan from New Hampshire. You've got others who maybe aren't the focus, but are still concerned and might not be a vote in the end."
    },

      "speaker": "FORD",
      "utterance": "There is no doubt, Senator Manchin has become the face, in many ways, some argue, and it's probably a lot of truth to it, he may be the most powerful person in Washington on domestic policy. The president is the most powerful on foreign policy, obviously. But he has an army behind him. And there are even some that don't have to be out front, including in the House, because Joe Manchin, the team are there. Look, I think there is a good thing. I said all along when President Biden was elected, he is a compromiser by nature. And he realizes there is not much he is going to get done on a significant level without some buy in from the party members. The key is if Joe Manchin votes with him, he may get a handful of Republicans to vote with him as well."
