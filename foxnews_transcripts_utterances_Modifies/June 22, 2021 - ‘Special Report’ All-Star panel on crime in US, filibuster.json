Jen Psaki keeps emphasizing we have seen this rise in crime not just in the past couple of months but in the past year-and-a-half.

If only we could look back in time, and maybe then we would be able to know why we're seeing this type of rise in crime. But of course, that's impossible. And so we're never -- it's just a mystery.

But just to speak to this issue in general terms, first, I think we all have to keep in mind that crime overall in America is down according to FBI statistics. Murder, murder is the one crime that is up markedly. So it doesn't make sense to say oh, debate about police reform in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder is the cause for the rise in only one type of crime. FBI statistics show last year crime was down about six percent in the USA, but murder was up 25 percent. Most crime in the country is property crime. That's 85 percent of all crime, and that was down. So what strikes me here is we have an effort to say if you discuss police reform, it might somehow impact crime. But it's not a clear line. And I might also add that disproportionately, in terms of that horrible rise that we've seen in murder, it's like black people are 12 percent of the population, but they're like 50 percent of the people who are impacted by this rise in murder. They are the victims. And I think that makes it very real, very personal for the black community. I think something is going on there.",

I think the president will talk about guns. I hope he talks about the perpetrators of crime because they have something to do with it. Let me just put this proposition forward. What do you suppose happens if you have a national fever about the police and lots of people saying let's defund the police, the police are pigs, fry them like bacon, and at the same time you have got a bunch of prosecutors in big cities around the country refusing to prosecute people who are guilty of crimes unless they were in Washington on January 6th.

And we are back with our panel, Bill Bennett, Ben Domenech, and Juan Williams, 50 yeas, 50 nays. And gentleman, that's the reality in Congress today. And it brings to light the argument over this filibuster. We have heard for six months now about D.C. statehood and the expansion of the U.S. Supreme Court. Kyrsten Sinema, Senator from Arizona, Democrat, said she would not vote to break the filibuster, and that matters in this Congress. She wrote this today in \"The Washington Post,\" \"My support for retaining the 60 vote threshold is not based on the importance of any particular policy. It's based on what is best for our democracy. The filibuster compels moderation and helps protect the country from wild swings between opposing policy polls. I do not accept the new standard by which important legislation can only pass on party-line votes. If we eliminate the Senate's 60 vote threshold, we will lose much more than we gain.\" To Bill Bennett on that as to where we stand tonight after that op-ed, Bill.",

And good for those two Democrats. Elections matter, and close elections matter. And this is close, it's really close, 50-50. And I agree with the assessment that if this bill, HR-1, now S-1, had gone through, you would not see a Republican elected any time in the future. And this would be unconstitutional. That would be a protection, I think, because the Supreme Court would say, no, the states do this. They control the matter of these elections, not the federal government. But good for them.

I think there are other Democrats standing aside and letting them be the point of the spear here. But my point to both you and to Bill is that what you get today is the refusal of Republicans to even have a debate over protecting voting rights in the country. And I just think that's a sad state of affairs. The reality is that the Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was able to get Joe Manchin, the man we were just talking about, to join him and say yes, we should have this debate. Joe Manchin gave Republicans their big talking points. Yes, let's have a national voter I.D. mandate. Let's not have any reform in terms of public financing of campaigns. Let's make a deal with Republicans. Republicans wouldn't even vote today to have a debate on that. I don't know what you can make of that except that Joe Manchin called their bluff, and they got called out. They were exposed as simply wanting to stop any manner of protections for voting rights in this country.",

And that's something that has been opposed in a bipartisan fashion by literally hundreds of groups out there, including ACLU, who understand the danger of an era in which we could see a type of harassment of donors based on simply the candidates they give to in a way that is really unprecedented. We've seen the poll data that talks about support for firing people, colleagues who you work with based on their political donations. This is the kind of toxic thing that we don't want to see in this country and I think that we ought to be opposed to as Americans. And the fact that so many in the Democratic Party seem willing to try to push something this extreme forward on a party line vote in order to try to attempt and eliminate the filibuster, push this thing through, that just shows you I think how desperate they are. And there is a report today in \"Politco\" which I think should really give them pause. A major Democrat counselor to one of the major Democrat donors saying that in fact, you have -- they have made a mistake as a party in investing so much effort in trying to push this through that they really ought to have put things forward that could actually pass as opposed to being such a partisan attempt.",

      "utterance": "A little bit of the sample, which was being spoken a bit earlier today on the floor of the Senate. The voting rights legislation has been stopped at 50-50. And we are back with our panel, Bill Bennett, Ben Domenech, and Juan Williams, 50 yeas, 50 nays. And gentleman, that's the reality in Congress today. And it brings to light the argument over this filibuster. We have heard for six months now about D.C. statehood and the expansion of the U.S. Supreme Court. Kyrsten Sinema, Senator from Arizona, Democrat, said she would not vote to break the filibuster, and that matters in this Congress. She wrote this today in \"The Washington Post,\" \"My support for retaining the 60 vote threshold is not based on the importance of any particular policy. It's based on what is best for our democracy. The filibuster compels moderation and helps protect the country from wild swings between opposing policy polls. I do not accept the new standard by which important legislation can only pass on party-line votes. If we eliminate the Senate's 60 vote threshold, we will lose much more than we gain.\" To Bill Bennett on that as to where we stand tonight after that op-ed, Bill."

      "utterance": "Yes, well, Senator Sinema, brilliant and beautiful. Will I get in trouble for saying that? Democrat Senator. I don't care. I want to pile as many positive adjectives as I can on a Democrat. I don't get to do it very often. But good for her. She is in the breach. She's Horatius at the bridge as is Joe Manchin. And good for those two Democrats. Elections matter, and close elections matter. And this is close, it's really close, 50-50. And I agree with the assessment that if this bill, HR-1, now S-1, had gone through, you would not see a Republican elected any time in the future. And this would be unconstitutional. That would be a protection, I think, because the Supreme Court would say, no, the states do this. They control the matter of these elections, not the federal government. But good for them. Double kudos, triple kudos."

      "utterance": "I think the filibuster is safe if that's Bill's point. I think that what we saw in the Kyrsten Sinema op-ed in \"The Post\" this morning, I think we know Joe Manchin has made his position quite close. And I don't think they're alone. I think there are other Democrats standing aside and letting them be the point of the spear here. But my point to both you and to Bill is that what you get today is the refusal of Republicans to even have a debate over protecting voting rights in the country. And I just think that's a sad state of affairs. The reality is that the Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was able to get Joe Manchin, the man we were just talking about, to join him and say yes, we should have this debate. Joe Manchin gave Republicans their big talking points. Yes, let's have a national voter I.D. mandate. Let's not have any reform in terms of public financing of campaigns. Let's make a deal with Republicans. Republicans wouldn't even vote today to have a debate on that. I don't know what you can make of that except that Joe Manchin called their bluff, and they got called out. They were exposed as simply wanting to stop any manner of protections for voting rights in this country."

      "speaker": "HEMMER",
      "utterance": "One of the things that is contained within it that we haven't really discussed is really an elimination of the kind of donor privacy that has been a goal of a lot of different leftists over the course of the past several decades. And that's something that has been opposed in a bipartisan fashion by literally hundreds of groups out there, including ACLU, who understand the danger of an era in which we could see a type of harassment of donors based on simply the candidates they give to in a way that is really unprecedented. We've seen the poll data that talks about support for firing people, colleagues who you work with based on their political donations. This is the kind of toxic thing that we don't want to see in this country and I think that we ought to be opposed to as Americans. And the fact that so many in the Democratic Party seem willing to try to push something this extreme forward on a party line vote in order to try to attempt and eliminate the filibuster, push this thing through, that just shows you I think how desperate they are. And there is a report today in \"Politco\" which I think should really give them pause. A major Democrat counselor to one of the major Democrat donors saying that in fact, you have -- they have made a mistake as a party in investing so much effort in trying to push this through that they really ought to have put things forward that could actually pass as opposed to being such a partisan attempt."
