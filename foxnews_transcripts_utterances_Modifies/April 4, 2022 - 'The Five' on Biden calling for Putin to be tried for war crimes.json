We bantered around at this table for weeks now on this matter and we've all agreed, all agreed from the very beginning. Two, I think it's now time to think about doing more. And doing more comes with risk. We know the escalation challenges or escalation caution and what that could do in terms of triggering perhaps a use of a light nuclear weapon or even a larger nuclear weapon. But the declaration of him as war criminal I think escalates what we can do and how we can do it. I think some criticism of the president in the White House will continue and I think the criticism, if people are honest about it, should focus more constructively on - are we prepared for the consequences if we do something? And meaning, if we send airplanes, I doubt we will enforce a no-fly zone. But if we send airplanes and more technology and more weaponry, are we as a nation prepared for what could come from that, be it military action from the Russians? You talk about the economics, I look at the economics more so from the standpoint, if they turn off the spigot or they do not -- they force people to pay for natural gas in rubles, this will impact NATO. So, we have to be prepared not only as a nation but even our NATO allies in what may happen. But let me be clear, I think we should do more. Those vic -- those images there suggest to me in the strongest of ways that Putin, if he is unhinged, if he is nuts, we can debate that. I think he is. One thing is clear. He is not going to stop, and we have to be willing to do something more to counter him.",

Those were internationally sanctioned. Now we don't do business with the International Criminal Court. Russia doesn't do business with them either and Russia would veto since it's on the security council, any sort of international tribunal to hold themselves accountable, so I don't know exactly where that goes, plus it's kind of hard to extradite Putin from Moscow, maybe you could nab a general in the east in the Donbas, who knows. It's very difficult. I'm glad we showed the graphic photos of the dead bodies, because when the country and the world see that, it makes people fully understand the truth and it makes people take action. And if we had only shown maybe drug overdoses in the American inter-cities, gun violence, actual dead bodies in the inner cities, maybe that would galvanize the American people to do something about violence in this country, just a thought I had. It does look like though we are escalating with tanks. So, tanks are not a defensive weapon. And we are intermediaries in moving tanks from the European countries Soviet made into Ukraine, that tells me this. That tells me the west thinks that Russia could lose this thing and that the Ukrainians aren't going to be fighting an insurgency, they might actually fight and possibly win a conventional war. So that's pretty big. I think jets are next, I think we are this close to jets if the Russians keep getting pushed back.",

I don't think the war tribunal is sufficient for this man. And let me make one thing clear. Putin is the same guy he's been for the last 20 years. He didn't just change. He didn't just start committing war crimes. But this is a guy who went into Crimea and Georgia and Syria and committed the same kinds of crimes. It's just now that we are seeing it 24/7, seven days a week, we're seeing the pain, we're hearing it, we're a part of it. And for him to say, you know, I'm not sure this is genocide, it depends on the level. Let me read you what the definition of genocide is from the war crime tribunal. It's characterized by specific intent to destroy a whole or part a national ethnic racial or religious group by killing its members or other means causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. Now, I mean, there isn't a number. There isn't a particular equation that you can use. But I can tell you this, after the war in Bosnia, I was contacted by the State Department, by the Department of Defense to interview along with prosecutors from my office, victims so that we could prepare their file to be included in the war -- war crime tribunal in The Hague. I spent weeks with my stay of interviewing victims of the most horrific crimes you could imagine. These people were isolated, the victims were horrified, they were ashamed, we used translators, the stories that we heard are horrible. This kind of thing is not new to the world, it's happened before. This guy has to be stopped. I don't like the idea of nicety of war crime tribunal, it's about time that this was taken more seriously that the United States get involved not to the point of pushing him because of his nuclear weapons. But let's make one thing clear. Putin has had nuclear weapons for a long time, he hasn't used them before and now all of a sudden, because Biden, we're afraid of them. We weren't afraid when we went into Syria, and we got rid of those chemical weapons when Russia was involved. But that was a different president.",

I mean, think about the stuff that no one films, stuff you don't see. That stuff we saw. You didn't see what happened before. So, I don't think we don't have to wonder or dwell too much on the atrocities that happened because they are going to happen every day, and we're going to be sitting here, we're going to be looking at that and we're going to have ourselves, ask how does that impact our behavior here? Right? We talked about this in the beginning. There is a three-step process, you decide who wants it more and then steal yourself for the horrific details to come and then you decide your involvement should there be any. I think where we are is at this table, and elsewhere, I think we know what we want, but it's not what we decided. Right? We want Ukraine to win, we definitely, but haven't decided to help them win.",

The president said we will increase funding for the police, he never sided with the defund the police effort. Clearly was an element in my party that espouse some of that, and I was against that and he was against it. I do think in fairness, if you look at some of the things that he's talking about, and you raise the right point, Judge, it's the ghost guns, he wants to ban them. I think we ought to have a very serious robust debate about what a ghost gun is and what steps can we take to ensure that we reduce the number of those on the streets. Look, we have not had a banned ghost gun or require on background checks for all gun sales. We've had ban -- we'd had ban on assault weapons. We've not repealed the gun folk -- gun manufacturers immune from liability. Maybe we should do these things. And if it doesn't work, repeal it. I mean, I'm honest about it. I'd be happy to say the bail reform is not working, it's letting criminals back out on the streets and it's causing danger -- increase in danger and threats in communities all across this nation, it should be repealed. We should do more of some of this gun stuff here, especially the ghost guns, if we did anything else, if you knew a gun that someone bought and got stolen and you knew a person who is buying tens, if not dozens, if not hundreds of guns and they were just disappearing. And all of a sudden, appearing in Chicago, in Memphis, in New York, in Denver, in New Orleans, in Atlanta and Baltimore. We ought to go that gun and say did you think those 250 guns you bought, did you think that maybe since they end up in hand of criminals and gang bangers, did you ever think that something was wrong? So, I didn't know. That person should be held accountable as much as anything else. And you're right. The president should have said, we got to hold those accountable who use guns and we had to prosecute people and give people the funding to put people behind bars who are using guns.",

And they'll think about that even two years from now when President Biden is up for re-election. Inflation and the economy, I think some of this is going to work itself out more. Remember, inflation and the supply chain challenge, we had started back even under President Trump. When President Trump talk about tariff and with an advantage to talking about some of those things, but it clogged up supply chains because of just the way global commerce works. And there is no doubt the spending we've done over the last two years because of COVID has created even more pressure on that and for that matter, so is, so is the fact that we're now at war, or the war that's up in Ukraine.

I think that they don't -- Joe is not going to be there for 2024, right? So that -- and they're going to tell him that. He's got to go back to home. But the tradeoff is that he gets to pardon Hunter. So, that's what -- I think I'm going to fast walk it. This is my -- this is what you would call a conspiracy. Shush, everybody. But it's going to -- they're fast- walking so that they can pardon him and then -- and then Joe leave. And then, you got -- it's all gone.",

They've been able to authenticate all the information implicating Hunter Biden, but mysteriously, they couldn't authenticate any of the e-mails that mentioned the big guy and 10 that they were holding for him or the joint bank accounts that Biden shared with Hunter, or the bills that Hunter was paying for his father, or the fact that Hunter made like, millions of dollars doing China consultant while Joe was VP.

We bantered around at this table for weeks now on this matter and we've all agreed, all agreed from the very beginning. Two, I think it's now time to think about doing more. And doing more comes with risk. We know the escalation challenges or escalation caution and what that could do in terms of triggering perhaps a use of a light nuclear weapon or even a larger nuclear weapon. But the declaration of him as war criminal I think escalates what we can do and how we can do it. I think some criticism of the president in the White House will continue and I think the criticism, if people are honest about it, should focus more constructively on - are we prepared for the consequences if we do something? And meaning, if we send airplanes, I doubt we will enforce a no-fly zone. But if we send airplanes and more technology and more weaponry, are we as a nation prepared for what could come from that, be it military action from the Russians? You talk about the economics, I look at the economics more so from the standpoint, if they turn off the spigot or they do not -- they force people to pay for natural gas in rubles, this will impact NATO. So, we have to be prepared not only as a nation but even our NATO allies in what may happen. But let me be clear, I think we should do more. Those vic -- those images there suggest to me in the strongest of ways that Putin, if he is unhinged, if he is nuts, we can debate that. I think he is. One thing is clear. He is not going to stop, and we have to be willing to do something more to counter him."

      "utterance": "Because this is a legal situation if it's a war crime situation, and we've only had what, recently too, you had Rwanda, you had a tribunal and then in Yugoslavia, the international criminal tribunal. Those were internationally sanctioned. Now we don't do business with the International Criminal Court. Russia doesn't do business with them either and Russia would veto since it's on the security council, any sort of international tribunal to hold themselves accountable, so I don't know exactly where that goes, plus it's kind of hard to extradite Putin from Moscow, maybe you could nab a general in the east in the Donbas, who knows. It's very difficult. I'm glad we showed the graphic photos of the dead bodies, because when the country and the world see that, it makes people fully understand the truth and it makes people take action. And if we had only shown maybe drug overdoses in the American inter-cities, gun violence, actual dead bodies in the inner cities, maybe that would galvanize the American people to do something about violence in this country, just a thought I had. It does look like though we are escalating with tanks. So, tanks are not a defensive weapon. And we are intermediaries in moving tanks from the European countries Soviet made into Ukraine, that tells me this. That tells me the west thinks that Russia could lose this thing and that the Ukrainians aren't going to be fighting an insurgency, they might actually fight and possibly win a conventional war. So that's pretty big. I think jets are next, I think we are this close to jets if the Russians keep getting pushed back."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we all are. I think anyone who has seen people with their hands tied behind their back and a bullet to the back of their head knows this is execution. I don't think the war tribunal is sufficient for this man. And let me make one thing clear. Putin is the same guy he's been for the last 20 years. He didn't just change. He didn't just start committing war crimes. But this is a guy who went into Crimea and Georgia and Syria and committed the same kinds of crimes. It's just now that we are seeing it 24/7, seven days a week, we're seeing the pain, we're hearing it, we're a part of it. And for him to say, you know, I'm not sure this is genocide, it depends on the level. Let me read you what the definition of genocide is from the war crime tribunal. It's characterized by specific intent to destroy a whole or part a national ethnic racial or religious group by killing its members or other means causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group. Now, I mean, there isn't a number. There isn't a particular equation that you can use. But I can tell you this, after the war in Bosnia, I was contacted by the State Department, by the Department of Defense to interview along with prosecutors from my office, victims so that we could prepare their file to be included in the war -- war crime tribunal in The Hague. I spent weeks with my stay of interviewing victims of the most horrific crimes you could imagine. These people were isolated, the victims were horrified, they were ashamed, we used translators, the stories that we heard are horrible. This kind of thing is not new to the world, it's happened before. This guy has to be stopped. I don't like the idea of nicety of war crime tribunal, it's about time that this was taken more seriously that the United States get involved not to the point of pushing him because of his nuclear weapons. But let's make one thing clear. Putin has had nuclear weapons for a long time, he hasn't used them before and now all of a sudden, because Biden, we're afraid of them. We weren't afraid when we went into Syria, and we got rid of those chemical weapons when Russia was involved. But that was a different president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Another thing that's different, Greg, is the whole, that this is like the first war that you see that is wired. Elon Musk has the satellites there that are helping the internet links stay up. You have hackers that are actually participating all around the world trying to hack into Russia's systems. So, it is very different situation, as you see the images come through but there's also this weird participation on the other side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, there is a battle over turf but there's a battle over ideas. And obviously, I mean, you cannot but be grossed out and sickened by those images, but you shouldn't be surprised. I mean, it's amazing how evil humans can be in war. I mean, think about the stuff that no one films, stuff you don't see. That stuff we saw. You didn't see what happened before. So, I don't think we don't have to wonder or dwell too much on the atrocities that happened because they are going to happen every day, and we're going to be sitting here, we're going to be looking at that and we're going to have ourselves, ask how does that impact our behavior here? Right? We talked about this in the beginning. There is a three-step process, you decide who wants it more and then steal yourself for the horrific details to come and then you decide your involvement should there be any. I think where we are is at this table, and elsewhere, I think we know what we want, but it's not what we decided. Right? We want Ukraine to win, we definitely, but haven't decided to help them win."

Or is it something that we can't reconcile between what we want and what we decide. I think Putin has decided, we haven't."

They had no interest in reducing because they already would have responded to act. What about the round of attacks on Jews and Asians? So, Biden chooses crime that could be easily satisfied with lacey platitudes about gun makers. Because that always is the end of the effort, it's like evil NRA and evil guns and then they just they move on. But it's going to be, it's pointless. Gun control is dead because of the last two years of defund rhetoric, the nationalized Ferguson effect that was caused by the riots.

We've got D.A.'s like Gascon in L.A. and you've got the other, Boudin in San Francisco, I believe it is. And you know, now he wants to go after the gun manufacturers. We'll go after the car manufacturers for drunk drivers and he wants background checks. I love it. I was a prosecutor, I did this. The background checks those are not the guns that are involved in crime. The guns that are involved in criminal behavior in my 32 years in law enforcement except for one, were guns that were sold illegally or bought on the street. These are not guns by law -abiding people who went and bought a gun, unless they are using their mother or sister's or someone else's gun.

Clearly was an element in my party that espouse some of that, and I was against that and he was against it. I do think in fairness, if you look at some of the things that he's talking about, and you raise the right point, Judge, it's the ghost guns, he wants to ban them. I think we ought to have a very serious robust debate about what a ghost gun is and what steps can we take to ensure that we reduce the number of those on the streets. Look, we have not had a banned ghost gun or require on background checks for all gun sales. We've had ban -- we'd had ban on assault weapons. We've not repealed the gun folk -- gun manufacturers immune from liability. Maybe we should do these things. And if it doesn't work, repeal it. I mean, I'm honest about it. I'd be happy to say the bail reform is not working, it's letting criminals back out on the streets and it's causing danger -- increase in danger and threats in communities all across this nation, it should be repealed. We should do more of some of this gun stuff here, especially the ghost guns, if we did anything else, if you knew a gun that someone bought and got stolen and you knew a person who is buying tens, if not dozens, if not hundreds of guns and they were just disappearing. And all of a sudden, appearing in Chicago, in Memphis, in New York, in Denver, in New Orleans, in Atlanta and Baltimore. We ought to go that gun and say did you think those 250 guns you bought, did you think that maybe since they end up in hand of criminals and gang bangers, did you ever think that something was wrong? So, I didn't know. That person should be held accountable as much as anything else. And you're right.

Two, a crime and the border are going to be big parts of what voters all across the country are going to consider as they think about whom to vote for in November. And they'll think about that even two years from now when President Biden is up for re-election. Inflation and the economy, I think some of this is going to work itself out more. Remember, inflation and the supply chain challenge, we had started back even under President Trump. When President Trump talk about tariff and with an advantage to talking about some of those things, but it clogged up supply chains because of just the way global commerce works. And there is no doubt the spending we've done over the last two years because of COVID has created even more pressure on that and for that matter, so is, so is the fact that we're now at war, or the war that's up in Ukraine.
