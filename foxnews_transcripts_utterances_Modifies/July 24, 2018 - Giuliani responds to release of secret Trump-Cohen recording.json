This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Ahead on a cannot-miss hour, if you haven't been watching television tonight, you haven't been watching \"Hannity,\" you didn't know it was released an hour ago. Rudy Giuliani will be joining us shortly with breaking news, exclusive reaction about the release of a secret recording between then candidate Donald Trump and his attorney, Michael Cohen. Also, two simple questions. Why does John Brennan still have his security clearance and should be revoked? The answers are coming up later on inside tonight's angle and other conversations -- this like always happens before the show. Newsbreak and I love it. It's like radio, it's like crazy. Everything happens at the last minute. Fine by us.  Plus, even outside the White House, he still has the president's ear. Whom am I talking about? Great night to have him on. Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus will join us for an exclusive and he'll offer insights into the president's thinking on Russia, the communication, what is going on with the chief of staff, and this current controversy about this tape being released.",

Joining us now for reaction, Alan Dershowitz, author of the book \"The Case against Impeaching Trump\", which is now a huge New York Times best seller. As well as Sol Wisenberg, former deputy, independent counsel for the Whitewater investigation. Gentlemen, thank you both for being with us. This news breaking an hour ago. Professor Dershowitz let's start with you. We're all lawyers. There's something that sends a chill down my spine, up my spine, about hearing a conversation between an attorney and a client. I don't care what the government is threatening you with, with the prosecutors are threatening you with. But to hear a private conversation played between the two on national television, it's like I have no words. But I guess they waived the privilege, right, Alan? That was a decision that the Trump legal team made.  ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AUTHOR, \"THE CASE TO IMPEACH TRUMP\": Yeah, I think you're going to have to ask Rudy. Rudy is a friend of mine, and he's a great lawyer and he rarely makes mistakes. But you have to ask him why he waived the privilege about that conversation. The conversation is a natural one. I've had it with clients dozens of times. The clients suggest something. If the tape is accurate and if Lanny what says is on it is on it, the clients suggests maybe cash and the lawyer says no other client says fine, we'll do it by check.  That's what lawyer-client conversations are supposed to be about, a back and forth where the client suggests something, the lawyer says something else, and the client generally listens to the lawyer. But the big picture is a, there is nothing on the tape that suggests any crime. B, what is strongly suggested by the prior interview by Lanny Davis is that -- he has -- Cohen has made his decision.  He's going to cooperate with the prosecutors. He's going to flip. He's going to try to get immunity, and he's going to testify against Donald Trump. Whether he has anything to say that is incriminating, it's a real question. Even if he does, whether he's allowed to say it. Because remember, Giuliani didn't waive other privileges, just that day. And even if he has something that might be incriminating, no evidence that he does, he can't reveal it unless it's a violation of the lawyer-client privilege or waived if it's lawyer-client privilege material. So those I think are the big picture items",

It's a little bit unintelligible. We're going to talk to Giuliani exclusively in just a few moments. But their impression is that what the president said is no cash. And Cohen says no, no, no, no. Then Trump then says -- you can hear him say a check? A check. So he could be again -- maybe we can you know, make this tape clearer. But right now it's unclear what he said. Could the president -- the then candidate -- saying we want a paper trail?",

Now it may end up that it establishes that president lied, which is certainly a serious matter. I understand he said he didn't know anything about the payment by the parent company of National Enquirer, but that's very different as to whether or not there was a crime.   I see nothing resembling that. I do think it's shocking, irrespective of whether it was wise or prudent to waive the privilege, really shocking for a lawyer is taping a conversation with a client, whether it is privileged or not. Certainly confidential client information. I'm not sure -- I'm not sure that Cohen has definitively made the decision to flip and the only reason I say that is because by doing -- by doing and taking the actions publicly that he has taking, it seems to me that he might be making a last-ditch effort for a pardon. I see no other reason for it, because if he wants to do a deal and flipped, typically the prosecutors don't want you going out and talking on national TV. It's a bit of a mystery to me.",

But, Professor Dershowitz, there doesn't seem to be any transaction that actually took place here, correct?

Let's not leave it up to one person. When you create a corporation, you create records. Corporations don't pay by cash. Corporations almost always paid by check or by wire and leave a paper trail. So if, in fact, the president did say, and it's hard to hear, pay cash, that seems very much out of context to the conversation. The other thing is, the tape ends very abruptly which could suggest that there's more on the tape that's exculpatory, but that Cohen has either kept it as leverage or maybe erased it because maybe he doesn't look so good on it.

They were discussing how to set up a corporation to make payments if necessary to keep it from influencing the election. That happens all the time and I don't think you can infer guilt from a payment of money. I think the tape is ambiguous. I think Rudy Giuliani today good job on your show explaining it. I think we have a better sense now after hearing Lanny Davis on CNN and hearing Rudy Giuliani on this show. And I think there are a few conclusions that we can reach. Number one, there is no crime. I think everybody now acknowledges this doesn't provide evidence of a crime. Number two, it does show that Cohen and Trump are no longer joined at the hip and Cohen would no longer take a bullet for the president. He may in fact fire a bullet at him. We don't know that. And number three, we have two extraordinary lawyers, Lanny Davis and Rudy Giuliani, both on different sides of this contentious issue as distinguished from Avenatti, who has no spirits and no background in any of these issues. These are two guys would look litigated these cases for years and years. They are worthy adversaries, and this is a very, very exciting confrontation with high, high stakes.

I thought it was striking that Mr. Giuliani did not deny the report that you talked about that basically is not going to be -- the president is not going to be talking to Mr. Mueller at all about obstruction of justice.

So my prediction here is that if Mueller, this is smart, and I think he is -- he will accept this offer and have an opportunity to put hard questions to him.

Of course, it's hyperbolic reporting and it comes from Brennan current employer, NBC. But shouldn't it concern the media that former intel officials are using their credentials to lend themselves credibility as they go off to engage in political combat with the president of the United States? The truth is former intel officials have retained their security clearances for decades, not as a bonus prize for service but to benefit the government, maybe consulting work and so forth. For instance, the CIA is working on a case involving something a former intel official had worked on. He can use his continued access to act as a reference, maybe give some insights. But has it all gotten out of hand? Roughly 4.2 million Americans had security access or were eligible for access since 2015 according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The General Accountability Office calls this a high risk for national interest. It's perfectly legitimate, though, for the president to recall the clearances of retirees in the interest of national security, isn't it? So if the government needs retired officials to help on cases, the government can insist that they go through the normal clearance process again. But when you're talking about individuals like Brennan, it's a wonder how he maintained clearance at all. Let's look at the Brennan record for just a moment. Before he became their favorite Trump basher, the Democrats in the Senate despised him. Some urged his resignation as CIA director about lying about spying, and not spying on the bad guys, but on the Senate. He has been caught lying multiple times during his government career. Senator Dianne Feinstein in March, 2014, called out the CIA under Brennan's leadership for its effort to harass and thwart an ongoing Senate investigation into the Bush era enhanced interrogation program.",

They don't understand the world of clearances. Retaining your clearance once you leave the government is your currency in Washington. There's a cottage industry here. And I'm not going to make a lot of friends by talking about this, but there's a cottage industry of keeping your clearance and moving to the commercial sector. Clearances are kept by senior officials typically up until now and in the past as a courtesy. And the idea being you can talk to the people that take your position and provide -- but what the left, with the resistance are talking about, they are suddenly the protectors of national security. I think we have reached a strange, surreal point.

This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Ahead on a cannot-miss hour, if you haven't been watching television tonight, you haven't been watching \"Hannity,\" you didn't know it was released an hour ago. Rudy Giuliani will be joining us shortly with breaking news, exclusive reaction about the release of a secret recording between then candidate Donald Trump and his attorney, Michael Cohen. Also, two simple questions. Why does John Brennan still have his security clearance and should be revoked? The answers are coming up later on inside tonight's angle and other conversations -- this like always happens before the show. Newsbreak and I love it. It's like radio, it's like crazy. Everything happens at the last minute. Fine by us. Plus, even outside the White House, he still has the president's ear. Whom am I talking about? Great night to have him on. Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus will join us for an exclusive and he'll offer insights into the president's thinking on Russia, the communication, what is going on with the chief of staff, and this current controversy about this tape being released. And later, we'll dive into two explosive cases, one involving police and race in a caught-on camera moment in Georgia. So we'll get into that and a lot more coming up here on \"The Ingraham Angle.\" And I gotta tell you something. When we got Giuliani on the phone and we got our next slate of guests, you're going to want to buckle up. Tonight, some breaking news. CNN claims to have gotten their hands on recordings between then candidate Donald Trump and his then attorney Michael Cohen. Now the tapes were provided by Cohen's now current lawyer, Lanny Davis. Remember he used to be out there and Lanny's an old friend, but he was out there defending Bill Clinton not too long ago. And long known for his vituperative and steadfast defense of all things Clinton. Here's a piece that CNN played, and it must be stressed that we had Fox News have not confirmed the authenticity of these tapes."

      "utterance": "The tape is interestly cut off at that point. Joining us now for reaction, Alan Dershowitz, author of the book \"The Case against Impeaching Trump\", which is now a huge New York Times best seller. As well as Sol Wisenberg, former deputy, independent counsel for the Whitewater investigation. Gentlemen, thank you both for being with us. This news breaking an hour ago. Professor Dershowitz let's start with you. We're all lawyers. There's something that sends a chill down my spine, up my spine, about hearing a conversation between an attorney and a client. I don't care what the government is threatening you with, with the prosecutors are threatening you with. But to hear a private conversation played between the two on national television, it's like I have no words. But I guess they waived the privilege, right, Alan? That was a decision that the Trump legal team made. ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AUTHOR, \"THE CASE TO IMPEACH TRUMP\": Yeah, I think you're going to have to ask Rudy. Rudy is a friend of mine, and he's a great lawyer and he rarely makes mistakes. But you have to ask him why he waived the privilege about that conversation. The conversation is a natural one. I've had it with clients dozens of times. The clients suggest something. If the tape is accurate and if Lanny what says is on it is on it, the clients suggests maybe cash and the lawyer says no other client says fine, we'll do it by check. That's what lawyer-client conversations are supposed to be about, a back and forth where the client suggests something, the lawyer says something else, and the client generally listens to the lawyer. But the big picture is a, there is nothing on the tape that suggests any crime. B, what is strongly suggested by the prior interview by Lanny Davis is that -- he has -- Cohen has made his decision. He's going to cooperate with the prosecutors. He's going to flip. He's going to try to get immunity, and he's going to testify against Donald Trump. Whether he has anything to say that is incriminating, it's a real question. Even if he does, whether he's allowed to say it. Because remember, Giuliani didn't waive other privileges, just that day. And even if he has something that might be incriminating, no evidence that he does, he can't reveal it unless it's a violation of the lawyer-client privilege or waived if it's lawyer-client privilege material. So those I think are the big picture items"

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Sol, what is the potential jeopardy if any, that this tape poses the president of the United States? And again, so people understand it, it's hard to hear this tape. It's a little bit unintelligible. We're going to talk to Giuliani exclusively in just a few moments. But their impression is that what the president said is no cash. And Cohen says no, no, no, no. Then Trump then says -- you can hear him say a check? A check. So he could be again -- maybe we can you know, make this tape clearer. But right now it's unclear what he said. Could the president -- the then candidate -- saying we want a paper trail?"

      "utterance": "I don't know, but it doesn't matter what he is saying, Laura, in terms of your question. I agree completely with Professor Dershowitz. There's no indication of a crime here. Now it may end up that it establishes that president lied, which is certainly a serious matter. I understand he said he didn't know anything about the payment by the parent company of National Enquirer, but that's very different as to whether or not there was a crime. I see nothing resembling that. I do think it's shocking, irrespective of whether it was wise or prudent to waive the privilege, really shocking for a lawyer is taping a conversation with a client, whether it is privileged or not. Certainly confidential client information. I'm not sure -- I'm not sure that Cohen has definitively made the decision to flip and the only reason I say that is because by doing -- by doing and taking the actions publicly that he has taking, it seems to me that he might be making a last-ditch effort for a pardon. I see no other reason for it, because if he wants to do a deal and flipped, typically the prosecutors don't want you going out and talking on national TV. It's a bit of a mystery to me."

It's like there are many tapes and everyone will see. It's all horrible stuff about to come out. That's what you get from him. But, Professor Dershowitz, there doesn't seem to be any transaction that actually took place here, correct? So whether the president misspoke or misrepresented things on Air Force One when he referenced not knowing about the transaction, there was no transaction here ultimately. Does that have any relevance?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, there is no crime, this couldn't be an attempt or a conspiracy because in the end he says pay by check. But the whole context of the conversation would seem to undercut the cash analysis. The context of the conversation is let's create a legal form, let's create a corporation. Let's not leave it up to one person. When you create a corporation, you create records. Corporations don't pay by cash. Corporations almost always paid by check or by wire and leave a paper trail. So if, in fact, the president did say, and it's hard to hear, pay cash, that seems very much out of context to the conversation. The other thing is, the tape ends very abruptly which could suggest that there's more on the tape that's exculpatory, but that Cohen has either kept it as leverage or maybe erased it because maybe he doesn't look so good on it. But ending the tape abruptly the way this one ends --"

And number two, it's also foolhardy for them to try to yell and scream and make believe what's on the tape. I agree with you the tape is a little bit hard to hear. But I assure you that we listened to it numerous, numerous times. The transcript makes it quite clear the end that President Trump says don't pay with cash. Cohen then interrupts and says no, no, no. I got it. And then you hear distinctly, if you're careful and you slow it down, check. And then Cohen followed with no, no, no. And then quickly cuts off the tape which indicates exactly Professor Dershowitz is saying, that Cohen doesn't want the rest recorded because it was too exculpatory from the point of the view of the president (ph).

This was leaked on us with a very, very scurrilous description of what was on the tape, probably by the same people who were lying on CNN. And we had to correct the record.

At least with regard to the transaction that we're talking about I mean, he may or may not have known about McDougal's claims, I don't know that. But he didn't know about this transaction. This is the conversation in which they talk about how they're going to buy the rights."

And that's the reason why we waived it. Would we have put it out if it had not been leaked? No, we would not have put it out if it had not been leaked, but it was being leaked through The New York Times under very, very false -- it was false statements being made about it, which even are worse (ph), for the ones you're hearing now."

I have been listening to tapes even longer than Alan Dershowitz, how about 4000 hours of mafia people on tape. I know how to listen to them, I know how to transcribe them.

Because it would be illegal for them to have that information. In any event, there are no other tapes with the president. We have all of the tapes in our possession. We have transcripts of all them.

And then, thinking you could cooperate with the government? You know, to cooperate with the government, you gotta have credibility.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WISENBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, what jumps out at me and one way is what is not being said. And of course I haven't heard the whole tape, as the mayor points out. But in all this conversation about did he say cash or didn't he say cash, my question is why is he even discussing buying the former playmate's story if it is not true, which he has said it isn't true? Why would you care? Why would you want to buy it? I mean let's look at the big picture. Professor's right, not a crime here, but I think that is something is an elephant in the room that needs to be mentioned."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say, Sol, businesses settle things in different ways all the time because well-known people are targeted and sued because people know you'll settle. That goes right to the settlement. They probably just wanted -- I don't know. I am just guessing, and Professor Dershowitz, you deal with this all the time. People want to get stuff off their plate. If we can put it that way, let's put it away. How do we do it? Come up with different strategies. That's what I am guessing, if I am presenting a client on this matter. Does that seem particularly odd to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "No, it sounds very plausible, especially since they did seem to use word plural. That perhaps what that president and Cohen were discussing is in the run-up to the election, there were probably going to be lots of people who will come and demand cash in order to not embarrass the president just before the election. They were discussing how to set up a corporation to make payments if necessary to keep it from influencing the election. That happens all the time and I don't think you can infer guilt from a payment of money. I think the tape is ambiguous. I think Rudy Giuliani today good job on your show explaining it. I think we have a better sense now after hearing Lanny Davis on CNN and hearing Rudy Giuliani on this show. And I think there are a few conclusions that we can reach. Number one, there is no crime. I think everybody now acknowledges this doesn't provide evidence of a crime. Number two, it does show that Cohen and Trump are no longer joined at the hip and Cohen would no longer take a bullet for the president. He may in fact fire a bullet at him. We don't know that. And number three, we have two extraordinary lawyers, Lanny Davis and Rudy Giuliani, both on different sides of this contentious issue as distinguished from Avenatti, who has no spirits and no background in any of these issues. These are two guys would look litigated these cases for years and years. They are worthy adversaries, and this is a very, very exciting confrontation with high, high stakes. This is an unfolding drama."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I mean Sol, if you are a lawyer, you want to represent one of these clients. I mean you are on television. Lanny loves to be on TV. I used to be on TV with him at another network years ago. We would debate all the time during the impeachment when you are working for Starr, Sol. So we can't blame him for wanting to do the case. Of course he wants to do the case. But my question is, what is the \"there\" there? I mean campaign finance violation or a conspiracy to thwart campaign finance laws? I mean I heard that theory floated on another network tonight. And I'm thinking OK, how are you getting to a to b to c in that analysis? Maybe you two are a lot smarter than I am and I can't get there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WISENBERG",
      "utterance": "I don't see -- based on everything I've seen so far, I don't see a campaign finance violation. Even if there was, as I said months ago, on your show I think, it's pretty small potatoes in the grand scheme of things. No president is going to be impeached for relatively minor campaign finance violation. At most, it's very embarrassing. This is the least of the president's troubles, I think. I thought it was striking that Mr. Giuliani did not deny the report that you talked about that basically is not going to be -- the president is not going to be talking to Mr. Mueller at all about obstruction of justice. If he talks to him at all, it will be about collusion, which I think as a lawyer, it's a very good position to take."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Professor Dershowitz, before we let you go, I'm glad we got that question into Rudy because that report has been floating around. He's like, they're focused on Manafort now, haven't gotten back to him. But I get the sense that, you know -- what does Mueller do at that point? Then it's a game of chicken, right? Are you going to try to subpoena me? Are we going to fight the constitutionality of that? Where do we go?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Comey would be very -- sorry -- Mueller would be very, very wise to accept this offer. Why? He's not been able to question the president about obstruction of justice. The president will claim presidential authority to have fired Comey and he will won on that issue. And so really if he is getting an opportunity to sit down with the president and discuss and ask questions about Russia and alleged collusion, he's probably getting all he would ever get after litigation. So my prediction here is that if Mueller, this is smart, and I think he is -- he will accept this offer and have an opportunity to put hard questions to him. And perhaps expect to spring a couple of perjury traps on him. Which is why if I were Giuliani, I would be a little wary about having the president sit down unless the questions were scripted and the answers could be scripted in advance, and the president wouldn't go off script. All of those are unlikely events, knowing this president and knowing the situation."

I think Sol at the end on your last segment had it sort of right. At the very worst, it might be embarrassing, but it's not illegal. One thing I have learned from being out of the spotlight on the daily grind is that when you go back to Wisconsin and Michigan and Ohio, it's not just a talking point. It is just the absolute truth. I have not found a single person who is swayed by any of these stories, which is a massive financial boon to, no offense, but the cable news, and especially a couple other networks. So it's not moving America. The president was at 37 percent on Election Day when he won. He's at, if you believe the worst poll, he's at 45 today. And so what people really focusing on is where is the economy and isn't it great that we are projected potentially four percent growth of GDP under Donald Trump? That's really what matters."

Let your own ears be the judge. He said it about 15 times. He's like listen closely. Donald Trump saying cash. Now, I didn't hear that way. Maybe some expert analysis will show something different.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Unprecedented threat. They make it sound like Trump is threatening to bomb former CIA Director John Brennan's house. Of course, it's hyperbolic reporting and it comes from Brennan current employer, NBC. But shouldn't it concern the media that former intel officials are using their credentials to lend themselves credibility as they go off to engage in political combat with the president of the United States? The truth is former intel officials have retained their security clearances for decades, not as a bonus prize for service but to benefit the government, maybe consulting work and so forth. For instance, the CIA is working on a case involving something a former intel official had worked on. He can use his continued access to act as a reference, maybe give some insights. But has it all gotten out of hand? Roughly 4.2 million Americans had security access or were eligible for access since 2015 according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The General Accountability Office calls this a high risk for national interest. It's perfectly legitimate, though, for the president to recall the clearances of retirees in the interest of national security, isn't it? So if the government needs retired officials to help on cases, the government can insist that they go through the normal clearance process again. But when you're talking about individuals like Brennan, it's a wonder how he maintained clearance at all. Let's look at the Brennan record for just a moment. Before he became their favorite Trump basher, the Democrats in the Senate despised him. Some urged his resignation as CIA director about lying about spying, and not spying on the bad guys, but on the Senate. He has been caught lying multiple times during his government career. Senator Dianne Feinstein in March, 2014, called out the CIA under Brennan's leadership for its effort to harass and thwart an ongoing Senate investigation into the Bush era enhanced interrogation program."

This is an extremely disturbing thing to see both he and James Comey supposedly impartial government officials carrying out their jobs in very important areas in intelligence gathering and law enforcement express the kind of extreme bias that they have shown now, which I think reflects quite accurately on what they were doing back in 2016."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

To do so is to allow them to further disgrace the agencies they have already tarnished through their biased actions. And that's the \"Angle.\" Joining us now with reaction is former CIA operative Mike Baker. Mike, your reaction. Brennan and his pals on the other networks are saying Trump has created an enemies list. Your reaction?"

      "utterance": "First of all, really interesting, you packed a lot of information into that \"Angle.\" Second of all, topline, what day is it of the week? It's Tuesday. We started out with Russia. We went to Iran. Then we went to the clearances issue. Then we went to tapes. The speed with which we move through things is incredible. With this, you pointed out several important issues. First of all, people are stunned and amazed that John Brennan and others would have these clearances. They don't understand the world of clearances. Retaining your clearance once you leave the government is your currency in Washington. There's a cottage industry here. And I'm not going to make a lot of friends by talking about this, but there's a cottage industry of keeping your clearance and moving to the commercial sector. Clearances are kept by senior officials typically up until now and in the past as a courtesy. And the idea being you can talk to the people that take your position and provide -- but what the left, with the resistance are talking about, they are suddenly the protectors of national security. I think we have reached a strange, surreal point. But they are saying, look, Trump is now threatening national security by talking about pulling Brennan's clearances, by talking about pulling Susan Rice's clearances because they won't be able to talk. In what world do you imagine the current administration would call Susan Rice or John Brennan and say we need to talk and get your insight on something?"

      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "Yes, the question of the clearances, it is bigger than Brennan. If the administration was smart, and I think they are, they would point out the fact that there is 4.1, 4.2 million people out there with security clearances, 1.3 or so of those million and top-secret clearances. What they should be doing is looking at the situation that has run amok. Again, it's a cottage industry. Anybody who leaves a position of authority with responsibility for classified information should lose their clearances. If you want to get them back and you're going to the commercial sector, that company can sponsor you. And if you need to go in and talk to somebody in a position of leadership, fine."
