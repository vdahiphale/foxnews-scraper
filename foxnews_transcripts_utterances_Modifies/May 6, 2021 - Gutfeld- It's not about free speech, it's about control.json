It's like what Six Flags tells Chris Christie he's not allowed back on the rides until those 37 funnel cakes are properly digested. But the way I see it, anything that gets you off Facebook is a good thing. Seriously, it's a bigger time waste than online porn, or so I've been told. I've never looked at porn in my life. And if I did, it was for a few minutes at a time. But the response from the media has been joyful. For them it's a major feeling of relief like President Biden after his fourth overnight pee.",

First, let's talk about the big lie as they call it. interesting how that phrase keeps being repeated as if they think saying it over and over again. We'll make it stick. Sorry, kids. These A-holes are the same creeps who put America through the biggest scam ever. That Russians through the 2016 election for Trump. This ongoing fraud lasted four years.

Chris Cuomo once said, show me where protests are supposed to be peaceful. I guess they only read the first few words of the First Amendment before a fake weight fell on his head. Talk about a big lie. As a crime wave sweeps the country, they pretend our biggest problem is white supremacy. Like a great magician. They have you looking at the right hand while the left hand is doing the dirty work. Don't forget that while Trump was actually doing things like blocking travel from China to prevent the COVID spread. All these turds were lawyers were busy talking about was impeachment, banning flavored vapes and outlying plastic bags by taking our eyes off the pandemic ball.

He's a woke college student. So, we decided instead to write an article about how racist white people are. \"White people came to expect the right of way in public spaces. White people taught their kids to move through the world in the same way. Many people -- many white people walk around campus having unknowingly absorbed this particular facet of white supremacy.\" So, walking is racist. So, what's his next article going to be on? How elevators were made just to help the white man ascend to the top faster? I would bring up the racist undertones of moving stairs, but I don't want to escalate things. This is such a grift.

They'll say anything to hoodwink her viewers, all 16,019 of them. And let's not forget that most of the media dismissed or outright lied about the summer of violence not only excusing it but energizing it. Chris Cuomo once said, show me where protests are supposed to be peaceful. I guess they only read the first few words of the First Amendment before a fake weight fell on his head. Talk about a big lie. As a crime wave sweeps the country, they pretend our biggest problem is white supremacy. Like a great magician. They have you looking at the right hand while the left hand is doing the dirty work. Don't forget that while Trump was actually doing things like blocking travel from China to prevent the COVID spread. All these turds were lawyers were busy talking about was impeachment, banning flavored vapes and outlying plastic bags by taking our eyes off the pandemic ball. They harmed more people than slippery bathmats. It always dry them. But the real story, the people who control most of the information now control all of it. I wonder how our angry white male feels."

Take ABC News' John Karl who was quoted saying Jen is \"one of the most well- qualified press secretaries we've ever had.\" Well, that's a great sweet comet. Peter Baker from the New York Times said she is a pro, you know. No, Peter. I don't. What does that mean?

And who could forget when he did become infected, he says he was holed up in his basement, but we know he was breaking out of quarantine, the breaking the rules put in place by his brother for essential activities like fighting with his neighbors. So, should Cuomo get his own special table? Sure. But there shouldn't be an option for people who don't want to sit next to Chris Cuomo. Maybe split the restaurant into two sections. People who don't want to be near Chris Cuomo. And Chris, is this like, if this idea came from somebody other than Chris Cuomo would you think it's a good idea?

The suspect who had five warrants in North Carolina, it's almost a band, has been arrested and both of the victims are expected to survive although one of them still has a bullet lodged in his spine. Joining us is Dr. Drew Pinsky. Why is he joining us? Because he was at the damn steak house. The reason why I want you on Dr. Pinsky is because I'm so tired of people telling us that whoa, you know, this whole violent epidemic thing, it's like, it's just overblown. What are you going to say now when that happens to you? DR. DREW PINSKY, Oh, no, it's not overblown. And Greg, Greg discovered I was at Peter Luger, because we were sitting next to each other at Kat's first wedding catching throats here, catching on. And he's he brought up the Peter Luger shooting. I said, yes, I was there. And he was like, what you're there? We were there. In fact, we were outside. My wife, Susan said, why don't we sit outside of this table we're waiting at.

Gunshots.\" And my wife was already in the corner she heard the gunshots and she led everybody there.

Kenny Allen wondered why when he'd walk on campus, he'd always bump into people even when sidewalks were relatively empty. Now, normal person might get himself to lenscrafters. Kenny is not normal. He's a woke college student. So, we decided instead to write an article about how racist white people are. \"White people came to expect the right of way in public spaces. White people taught their kids to move through the world in the same way. Many people -- many white people walk around campus having unknowingly absorbed this particular facet of white supremacy.\" So, walking is racist. So, what's his next article going to be on? How elevators were made just to help the white man ascend to the top faster? I would bring up the racist undertones of moving stairs, but I don't want to escalate things. This is such a grift. All you got to do is pick a topic link it to racism you get published. You probably get a job somewhere. I don't know where. I wouldn't hire anybody who wrote that."

So, I, this is my video, I made -- I wore a hidden camera and walked around Grand Central without moving out of the way to see who would bump into me and who wouldn't. Three times as many women bumped into me as men, OK. And that's not even to say that OK, men or women are the ones -- no, it was one hour, one day, in one area, and that's just what how it worked out. And maybe it's not attributed to gender. The thing is, if you set out to find something, you're looking for sexism, you're looking for racism, you're going to find it. Because imagine, OK, so the white people didn't move.
