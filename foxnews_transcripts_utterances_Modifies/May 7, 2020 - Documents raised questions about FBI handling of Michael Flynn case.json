I'm Bret Baier. \"BREAKING TONIGHT\", a major repudiation of the Russia collusion investigation and the huge personal victory for an elite military officer whose career and reputation were ruined.  And moments ago, Democrats on a key House committee capitulate to Republican pressure to release previously secret documents about that Russia investigation. We'll have more about those documents as they come in. We're going through them right now.  First off, the Justice Department is ceasing its prosecution of retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn on charges of lying to federal investigators. Flynn was fired by President Trump as national security advisor, and later pleaded guilty to the charges before moving to withdraw that plea.  I will speak with Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who was the last of the Justice Department and FBI for its handling of the Flynn case in just a few minutes. First, chief White House correspondent John Roberts with a lot of news tonight. Good evening, John.",

Adam Schiff and the House Intelligence Committee may have capitulated in terms of releasing the transcripts of some 57 interviews they did.  But in this press release, they certainly don't sound like they're capitulating, insisting that those transcripts show what the committee has insisted all along that the Trump campaign and Donald Trump himself invited illicit Russian help, made full use of that help, and then lied and obstructed the investigations in order to cover up his misconduct. That don't forget, the Mueller investigation found that there was no evidence of collusion to influence the election between the Trump campaign and Russia. Also in this, Adam Schiff, says that Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about his efforts to contact the Russians about sanctions. But today, the DOJ dropped that whole case.",

Smoke from the fires caused officials to close a stretch of Interstate 10 in both directions today. Fox 59 in Indianapolis, says police faced protests after officers fatally shoot two men and kill a pregnant pedestrian in three separate incidents just hours apart.

Fox 2 in San Francisco as the city health department confirms it provides nicotine and other addictive substances to those trying to recover from addiction. It says the effort is part of a plan to help the unhoused population and their words, quarantined in hotels rather than stay out on the streets.  And this is a live look at Chicago from our affiliate Fox 32. One of the big stories there tonight. The FBI offering a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of a detainee who escaped the Cook County Jail by disguising himself as another inmate. Jahquez Scott escaped the jail May 2nd after allegedly promising to pay another man $1,000 to agree to let him steal his identity.

I should note that there is one witness whose name is completely redacted in this, so it's going to be very interesting to parse through that. There are three sections that we are going to focus on right now. First of all, there was an exchange in an interview with Michael Cohen by the House Intelligence Committee by Trey Gowdy, the Republican, the former Republican congressman from South Carolina, and he says to Michael Cohen, \"Do you have any information, evidence of collusion between then presidential candidate Donald Trump and the Russian government to either interfere or influence in the GOP primary in 2016 or the general election? And Michael Cohen says \"No.\" There's a series of questions like that from Gowdy to Cohen, and he answers in a similar fashion. Then there was an exchange with the former director of national intelligence, Jim Clapper. He was President Obama's DNI, and he says, quote, that the Russians \"believed that\" Hillary Clinton \"was going to win\" and the focus seemed that they could turn on how to undermine a potential Clinton presidency. I don't think, though, that they thought the president, now President Trump, would be easier to deal with. \"He is a businessman. He would be more willing to negotiate and make deals, and I don't think it was anything more sophisticated than that, sort of guiding their objectives.\" And then the last thing I'm going to go through here right now was an exchange with Steve Bannon, the former Trump advisor on the campaign. And he was commenting on the Trump Tower meeting in Moscow from 2016, and he says, quote, this is Steve Bannon, \"I don't think it was treasonous. I think it was stupid and unpatriotic.\" So those are just three different quick takes there, slices of these 6,000 pages. There's going to be a lot to cull through tonight and into tomorrow. Again, we reported first last night on FOX that we thought that we would get these today, and here they are. But you go back, this is the initial framework for the Russia investigation, what we knew about meddling in that campaign. Back to you, Bret.",

If he thought there was a strong case for allowing Flynn to withdraw the guilty plea, he could've weighed in. But for some reason the attorney general didn't want to wait to let an independent judge have his say on it, and he decided instead to take the heat himself. Obviously, Democrats are going to just portray this as more evidence that Barr is in the pocket of the White House, and I think it's a very interesting choice by the attorney general to go ahead and in fact fall on his sword to save Michael Flynn when there was still a chance that a judge could have done it instead.",

I think that's important.

We'll have more about those documents as they come in. We're going through them right now. First off, the Justice Department is ceasing its prosecution of retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn on charges of lying to federal investigators. Flynn was fired by President Trump as national security advisor, and later pleaded guilty to the charges before moving to withdraw that plea.

That don't forget, the Mueller investigation found that there was no evidence of collusion to influence the election between the Trump campaign and Russia.

      "utterance": "Good evening, Bret. Fifty-three total witnesses. I should note that there is one witness whose name is completely redacted in this, so it's going to be very interesting to parse through that. There are three sections that we are going to focus on right now. First of all, there was an exchange in an interview with Michael Cohen by the House Intelligence Committee by Trey Gowdy, the Republican, the former Republican congressman from South Carolina, and he says to Michael Cohen, \"Do you have any information, evidence of collusion between then presidential candidate Donald Trump and the Russian government to either interfere or influence in the GOP primary in 2016 or the general election? And Michael Cohen says \"No.\" There's a series of questions like that from Gowdy to Cohen, and he answers in a similar fashion. Then there was an exchange with the former director of national intelligence, Jim Clapper. He was President Obama's DNI, and he says, quote, that the Russians \"believed that\" Hillary Clinton \"was going to win\" and the focus seemed that they could turn on how to undermine a potential Clinton presidency. I don't think, though, that they thought the president, now President Trump, would be easier to deal with. \"He is a businessman. He would be more willing to negotiate and make deals, and I don't think it was anything more sophisticated than that, sort of guiding their objectives.\" And then the last thing I'm going to go through here right now was an exchange with Steve Bannon, the former Trump advisor on the campaign. And he was commenting on the Trump Tower meeting in Moscow from 2016, and he says, quote, this is Steve Bannon, \"I don't think it was treasonous. I think it was stupid and unpatriotic.\" So those are just three different quick takes there, slices of these 6,000 pages. There's going to be a lot to cull through tonight and into tomorrow. Again, we reported first last night on FOX that we thought that we would get these today, and here they are. But you go back, this is the initial framework for the Russia investigation, what we knew about meddling in that campaign. Back to you, Bret."

BEN DOMENECH, \"THE FEDERALIST\": We've been waiting for this for a long time, and I think that we'll spend the next several days and weeks combing through what is going to be a pretty incredible story to look back in and see the different aspects of this investigation. And just as we saw today in terms of the Michael Flynn story as well, the consequences of everything that's been going on over the past several years have led us to a point that not has to be reevaluated even though it's in light of everything else that's going on around us."

They could provide no evidence. And I think that raises two really important questions. The first one is what therefore were we doing in appointing Bob Mueller as the special counsel to continue what looked like already a steaming heap of an FBI investigation? And what was Adam Schiff out there doing continuously telling us all that he had evidence of collusion when these transcripts would not seem to indicate that there was any such thing."

      "utterance": "There beginning, talking, Chuck, about Michael Flynn and the case being dropped by the DOJ. CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": On the point about Michael Flynn, definitely the latest revelation showed the FBI conduct in a less than favorable light. What's interesting to me here, if this was still before Judge Sullivan, he still had a chance, and he's the judge who throughout the prosecution of a Republican senator, Ted Stevens, when he thought there was prosecutorial abuse. If he thought there was a strong case for allowing Flynn to withdraw the guilty plea, he could've weighed in. But for some reason the attorney general didn't want to wait to let an independent judge have his say on it, and he decided instead to take the heat himself. Obviously, Democrats are going to just portray this as more evidence that Barr is in the pocket of the White House, and I think it's a very interesting choice by the attorney general to go ahead and in fact fall on his sword to save Michael Flynn when there was still a chance that a judge could have done it instead."

I think that Barr actually should be commended for having the kind of process that he did of bringing in a U.S. attorney to look at this, to spend months looking at this. And really the things that they discovered were so embarrassing in terms of the process that went into this, the notes that were exchanged, the things that were not handed over both to Michael Flynn and to the court in this case. I think this is, once again, a situation where we see Barr going through process and then coming to a conclusion that not a lot of people will like but frankly should raise all sorts of questions about the behavior under James Comey of the FBI. And, frankly, we need this kind of process to play out in a more transparent way for people to have confidence in the FBI going forward for these types of mistakes, that these types of errors in judgment are not repeated."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "We should view this as what happened today in Flynn as a piece of the Durham investigation, because just to set the record straight, it wasn't Bill Barr who did this. It was U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen who spent 10 years in the FBI and 10 years as a career prosecutor. He made the call on call on this and he did the review. That was done in consultation with Durham. I think that's important. And what he described were some real FBI abuses and their regulations and in particular interviewing a witness outside of the context of the investigation they were actually conducting. And so the DOJ made that decision that what had happened was incorrect and could not stand, which is the appropriate way to go forward. And I think we're going to see more of that from Durham as we go ahead."

And unless there is some documentary evidence to say this complaint that Ms. Reade says that she filed, unless that's found, it's hard to know what to make of this.

And then of course the Trump campaign, which is delighting in promoting this story, and I think it's along with the fact that he's kind of isolated in his house and can't really get out and campaign has contributed to his maybe losing a little momentum in the last couple of weeks. He is still ahead in all the polls, including in the swing states, but of course we know the situation right now is extremely volatile.

      "speaker": "DOMENECH",

The standard that the media set, many members of the media, I should say set, and many Democrats set during the Brett Kavanaugh hearing has in this case come back to bite them in a significant way. And until Joe Biden decides on his team decides how to handle this story or until they can achieve, I think, a better convincing of the progressive wing that Chuck just talked about, you're going to continue to see a divide in the Democratic Party and prevent the kind of coalescing that they want to see in order to be confident of winning in November."

Frank Averill, a veteran in Maine, turned 100 years old this week. He did not think he would get to celebrate his birthday, but members of the community paid him a visit for the special occasion. Frank even got his birthday wish granted. He got to have a margarita with lots of chips and salsa, lots of salsa. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid. \"The Story\" hosted by Martha MacCallum starts right now, a few seconds earlier, too, Martha."
