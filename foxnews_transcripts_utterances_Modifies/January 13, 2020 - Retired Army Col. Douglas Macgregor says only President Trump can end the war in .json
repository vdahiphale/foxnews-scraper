Believe it or not, the Iowa caucuses begin three weeks from today. Who's winning? So far nobody is winning, although many candidates have already lost.  The latest departure from the race is Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey who just dropped out. Like Julian Castro and Beto O'Rourke, Booker spent most of 2019 searching for a campaign theme, something to run on. In the end, he decided to become the wokest candidate in the wokest presidential field in history. Watch him.",

      "sentences": "An all-white debate. MSNBC can't imagine anything more offensive than that. So how did it happen, this atrocity? Well, it happened because despite claims to the contrary, the Democratic Party is racist, they're telling you. It turns out black and Hispanic voters aren't voting for enough black and Hispanic candidates. They're bigots. That's MSNBC's position. Meanwhile, in the rest of the media, this week's storyline -- and there's always a storyline -- is that Bernie Sanders is surging and in fact, in this case, there's some truth there. There's some evidence that he is.  The most recent Des Moines Register poll, for example, shows Bernie Sanders with a three-point lead in the State of Iowa. Elizabeth Warren, Sanders main rival on the left, meanwhile appears to be fading. Her fundraising has tanked. She's now in fourth place. And yet the race is far from over. Joe Biden may seem to you weak and confused and for good reason. But if you look at the numbers, he hasn't trailed in the national poll in two months.  In the State of Iowa, the latest poll from Monmouth has Biden up. A CBS poll just after the New Year showed a three-way race between Biden, Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a tie in effect.  In New Hampshire, polls had Bernie Sanders and Buttigieg battling for the lead. So what does that add up to? Well, the short answer is it adds up to chaos in the Democratic Party, which is just weeks to go before the actual votes begin. Democratic primary voters face a choice between a punch drunk mediocrity, a wild eyed political extremist and a former McKinsey consultant who lectures than like a constipated Sunday school teacher. That's not good.  Some of the party is starting to panic actually looking over the landscape, a weekend report from POLITICO describes how many House Democrats are frantically rallying behind Joe Biden as a kind of default choice. They fear that nominating Sanders or Warren would cost them reelection.   When Democrats panic, only one thing is certain to happen. Somebody is about to be called a racist. In this case that somebody is fellow Democrats, they are doing it to each other. Case in point. In an op-ed published on Sunday, Bernie Sanders's South Carolina campaign chair copied Kamala Harris and savaged Joe Biden as a bigot. Why? Because apparently he once opposed forced school busing. Now that puts him in the same category as virtually everybody in the country of all races, everybody hated school busing no matter who they were. Biden though apparently was a Klansmen for joining them and hating it. Meanwhile, candidates who aren't being called racist are being denounced as sexist. Elizabeth Warren is now claiming today that in late 2018, at some point, Bernie Sanders told her personally that a woman wasn't capable of being elected President.  Did he actually say that? Or is Warren lying and not for the first time? Who knows? It's impossible to know. It's impossible to prove. But of course in today's Democratic Party, that is hardly a barrier to saying it.  In fact, the standard operating procedure as you've noticed. As Democrats attack each other as immoral, the party discipline, meanwhile, appears to be disintegrating. And that's really a sign that things are falling apart. Case in point. Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is refusing to pay what are, in effect, her dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. She accuses them of being insufficiently woke.   So instead she struck out on her own. She is fundraising for even more left wing candidates. On Friday, she blasted her own party, America's leftwing party which has more leftwing than it's ever been is not leftwing enough for Ocasio-Cortez.",

What it is, is they give Congress people an amount. For AOC, it's $250,000.00.

Well, you know, last week, America avoided a full scale war with Iran, such a war would have been costly and a tragedy for thousands of Americans, but sadly there is another tragedy very much like that ongoing and has been, of course for decades. Over the weekend, we're sad to tell you, two American servicemen were killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. One leaves behind a wife and four children; the other was 21 years old, just a toddler when 9/11 happened and American troops first went into that country. These are the first deaths this year in Afghanistan. Sadly, though, and this is the poignant part, it is not clear what these men died for. Possibly the same thing that more than 2,300 American troops have died for since the Taliban was toppled in 2001. Not much. It hurts to say that, but it appears to be true.  The Afghan War Papers obtained by \"The Washington Post\" late last year have confirmed these suspicions. Our leaders have no strategy in Afghanistan. Our troops -- and this is their assessment -- have simply been ordered to stay in the country indefinitely until Afghanistan magically turns into Belgium. And it's not clear that will ever happen. For more than a decade, America has lost ground to the Taliban. According to the Pentagon's own estimates, 40 percent of the money the United States spent gets diverted to the Taliban, or to the pockets of corrupt officials. Billions of dollars have been blown on things like flying Burger King into the country with a goal of spending the Pentagon's budget allocations, so it is not cut the following year. For the metrics bureaucrats use, that's success. For soldiers though, it means another deployment, more days and months and years spent away from their families in the path of harm in many cases. Every year, the money we spend in Afghanistan is enough to make every soldier currently deployed there a millionaire. Imagine if we sent that money back to the communities these soldiers came from. But we're not doing that. Some are coming home in coffins, two more as we just said. It's obvious what's going on here. We don't need someone in Washington to recognize the tragedy of this unfolding. Anyone who's paid any attention at all knows that it's a tragedy. We need someone brave enough to stop what's happening there for the sake of this country. Doug Macgregor is a retired U.S. Army Colonel, author of the book, \"Margin of Victory.\" He joins us tonight. This is such a depressing topic, Doug that we're almost hesitant to bring it up. But you can't not. Two more American soldiers killed in Afghanistan. What is the Pentagon's explanation for why this is continuing?",

If you're a longtime watcher of \"The New York Times,\" it can be hard to settle on a low watermark. When exactly that newspaper abandoned its duties as a news gathering operation and become captive to its own neuroses, obsessions, and increasingly lunatic political theories? In other words, when did \"The New York Times\" become absurd? Well, theories vary on the subject. Was it when the paper intentionally hid the deaths of millions during Stalin's famines in the 1930s? Was it when its reporters hyped neocon lies to plunge us into a catastrophic occupation of Iraq? Obviously, these are serious contenders. Here's our vote. Just last week, as you remember, the United States barely avoided war with Iran. This show you may recall, opposed that war on the grounds it wasn't in America's interest. For our troubles for doing that, \"The New York Times\" attacked us in a piece over the weekend. The paper denounced the show as immoral for opposing a war in Iran. Doing that, opposing the war, it explained is a, \"direct result\" brace yourself - - \"of racism.\" Let that sink in. If you're not for killing Persians says \"The New York Times\" you're a bigot. That's their position. And to prove it the paper quoted the question that we asked on this show at the time, \"Why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire?\" And there you have it said, \"The Times,\" another crazed right winger putting the interest of his own country above more pointless wars in the Middle East. What a racist. Decent people should cheer the bombing of Tehran. That's what they wrote. Imagine writing a piece like that. Imagine editing that piece and sending it to the printer. Imagine reading that piece in your morning newspaper and continuing to subscribe. And yet, all of that actually happened. And in a way, thank God that it did happen, because 50 years from now, historians will want you to understand how America's ruling class went completely and utterly insane. And they'll have \"The New York Times\" to provide a roadmap. Well, Queen Elizabeth II has come to a decision on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's plans to transition out of the Royal family. We're covering it with Mark Steyn. Meanwhile, America doesn't have a monarchy just yet, but Chelsea Clinton is proving that being a child of a top politician is almost as lucrative as being a member of the Royal family.

      "sentences": "Well, here's the upside of the whole impeachment drama. We've learned even more about how it really works in our ruling class. It's brought attention to the lucrative jobs that Hunter Biden was able to get because he had an important father. As CNN and MSNBC and The Washington Post have all informed you repeatedly just so you don't forget, there's \"no evidence\" that Biden broke the law by taking money from people hoping to influence his father. And the sad thing is, they're technically right. In America today, there's nothing illegal about paying de facto bribes by handing fake jobs to the unqualified family members of powerful people. And since it is perfectly legal, naturally, Hunter Biden isn't the only one shamelessly cashing in on his family name -- hardly. Here's one offender. Chelsea Clinton, certified non-genius. Since 2011, Chelsea Clinton has served on the board of a company called IAC. It is a media and online investment company, a big one. When she started serving on the Board, she was barely into her 30s, which is just a few years of non-distinguished work experience, but IAC paid her like a seasoned expert. She got a $50,000.00 a year salary, plus a quarter million dollars in stock. But here's the real payoff. By the end of last year, her stake in IAC had grown to just under $9 million. And the good news for Chelsea is, sitting on the Board of the company hasn't been very demanding. At the very same time, she was collecting millions from them, she was getting $600,000.00 a year for example, from NBC to produce a handful of forgettable television segments. She also served on the Board of the Expedia Group which is believed to be paying her another quarter million dollars a year and of course, she's kept busy working as Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation, writing bad children's books and lecturing America from her perch on Twitter. Read her feed some time. It'll tell you a lot. She went to Stanford, by the way, unlike you. How much money is that? Well, the average American would have to work five lifetimes to earn the $9 million to Chelsea Clinton collected from IAC for doing nothing, but Chelsea Clinton did it in less than a decade because she had the right last name. Just in case you're wondering if the system is rigged. Well, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's announcement last week that they will step away from the British Royal Family shocked everyone, apparently, even the Queen was stunned. Nevertheless, the Royal Family reportedly held a private meeting today and afterwards, the Queen announced that she is \"entirely supportive\" of her grandson's decision to flee their country and cash in. But the drama is far from over. According to \"The Daily Mail,\" which is always true, Palace aides fear that Harry and Meghan will give an interview accusing the Royal Family of -- and you could have guessed this -- racism, if they're not happy with how things proceed. Author and columnist Mark Steyn joins us tonight to explain all of this to we, Americans. Mark Steyn, welcome, and I have to ask you this, apparently Harry was caught on tape talking to Bob Iger, head of Disney, begging him to give his wife Megan Markle voiceover work?

And there are a lot of Democratic voters that are wondering if the Democrats are going to continue to rely on African-American voters and specifically African-American women for their loyalty, how they're going to continue to make that case while not having a field that looks like the voters are trying to get."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "An all-white debate. MSNBC can't imagine anything more offensive than that. So how did it happen, this atrocity? Well, it happened because despite claims to the contrary, the Democratic Party is racist, they're telling you. It turns out black and Hispanic voters aren't voting for enough black and Hispanic candidates. They're bigots. That's MSNBC's position. Meanwhile, in the rest of the media, this week's storyline -- and there's always a storyline -- is that Bernie Sanders is surging and in fact, in this case, there's some truth there. There's some evidence that he is. The most recent Des Moines Register poll, for example, shows Bernie Sanders with a three-point lead in the State of Iowa. Elizabeth Warren, Sanders main rival on the left, meanwhile appears to be fading. Her fundraising has tanked. She's now in fourth place. And yet the race is far from over. Joe Biden may seem to you weak and confused and for good reason. But if you look at the numbers, he hasn't trailed in the national poll in two months. In the State of Iowa, the latest poll from Monmouth has Biden up. A CBS poll just after the New Year showed a three-way race between Biden, Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a tie in effect. In New Hampshire, polls had Bernie Sanders and Buttigieg battling for the lead. So what does that add up to? Well, the short answer is it adds up to chaos in the Democratic Party, which is just weeks to go before the actual votes begin. Democratic primary voters face a choice between a punch drunk mediocrity, a wild eyed political extremist and a former McKinsey consultant who lectures than like a constipated Sunday school teacher. That's not good. Some of the party is starting to panic actually looking over the landscape, a weekend report from POLITICO describes how many House Democrats are frantically rallying behind Joe Biden as a kind of default choice. They fear that nominating Sanders or Warren would cost them reelection. When Democrats panic, only one thing is certain to happen. Somebody is about to be called a racist. In this case that somebody is fellow Democrats, they are doing it to each other. Case in point. In an op-ed published on Sunday, Bernie Sanders's South Carolina campaign chair copied Kamala Harris and savaged Joe Biden as a bigot. Why? Because apparently he once opposed forced school busing. Now that puts him in the same category as virtually everybody in the country of all races, everybody hated school busing no matter who they were. Biden though apparently was a Klansmen for joining them and hating it. Meanwhile, candidates who aren't being called racist are being denounced as sexist. Elizabeth Warren is now claiming today that in late 2018, at some point, Bernie Sanders told her personally that a woman wasn't capable of being elected President. Did he actually say that? Or is Warren lying and not for the first time? Who knows? It's impossible to know. It's impossible to prove. But of course in today's Democratic Party, that is hardly a barrier to saying it. In fact, the standard operating procedure as you've noticed. As Democrats attack each other as immoral, the party discipline, meanwhile, appears to be disintegrating. And that's really a sign that things are falling apart. Case in point. Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is refusing to pay what are, in effect, her dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. She accuses them of being insufficiently woke. So instead she struck out on her own. She is fundraising for even more left wing candidates. On Friday, she blasted her own party, America's leftwing party which has more leftwing than it's ever been is not leftwing enough for Ocasio-Cortez."

He's made it clear for years that he wants to overturn the entire American system. Now, that's appalling. It's without precedent. But keep in mind, this is a country where a lot of people are suddenly fed up with the system. And because of that, Sanders's position gives him power. In fact, at this point, he is the most credible change candidate in the Democratic Party, and in 2020, that could make him the most formidable challenger.

      "speaker": "ENJETI",

I think even Jennifer Palmieri, who's worked for the Hillary Clinton Campaign came out and said that the winner of that poll have gone on to win the nomination, I think for the last six times in a row. This is a very real possibility that the Democrats are facing. You see a lot of the establishment really beginning to freak out because they don't know how to deal with somebody who's been telling, well, you know, some truths about the economy and about war. It's really analogous to President Trump's run in 2015 when you saw the exact same thing, all these people who beat the war drum for Iraq, who signed a lot of these trade deals have really no response. That's what you saw from Joe Biden. He's just -- he can't even deign to respond to it because there's no defense. He voted for the Iraq War. That's it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right. It is, I think, taking a lot of Democrats in Washington by surprise, and this is hardly an endorsement of Bernie, who I think would really hurt the country if he were elected.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ENJETI",
      "utterance": "The way it happened is that they failed. You know, they've run this country now for 40 years and all of their policies that they put into place. This is what President Trump ran on, the boiling anger in the American people. I think there was an NBC poll that came out a few months ago, 72 percent of the Americans are fed up with their political institutions, a slight majority want to burn all their institutions to the ground. They agreed with that statement, Tucker. They understand that the system is not working for them, and that's what Bernie has been able to tap into."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So Elizabeth Warren, is obviously vying for that -- the leftward pole in the party, against Bernie. Here's her latest attack on him, and I'm quoting, \"Bernie and I met for more than two hours in December 2018 to discuss the 2020 election. Among the topics that came up was what would happen if the Democrats nominate a female candidate? I thought a woman could win, he disagreed.\" So essentially, Warren is attacking Sanders as a sexist. Is this an effective attack, do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ENJETI",
      "utterance": "It's not a sexist attack. And the funny thing about this is they're collapsing under the purity tests that they set for themselves. You're not allowed to impugn or ask the character or why this attack would be forthcoming at this time. The truth is, Elizabeth Warren seems to be upset that Bernie's and other people were pointing out the obvious truth, that upper middle class white people are really the only people who support her. And so they have launched this attack against Bernie, and they've used their media allies, because anybody, like you said in your opening, they want to just cry racism and sexism. They don't understand an actual indictment of the economic system, and so this is what they resort to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I guess the one thing about Bernie that makes me think I don't understand what he is running on is his position on immigration. So if you are running as an economic populist, and you're saying that we need, you know, Scandinavian style socialism or whatever, which has some support, frankly, you can't really have that position and support open borders and the last time I was reading it, that is what he is arguing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ENJETI",
      "utterance": "No, that is what Bernie supports. He supports de facto open borders, abolishing I.C.E., decriminalizing illegal immigration. The funny thing is, he was on with Lou Dobbs, not even 12 years ago, talking about corporate amnesty. In 2015, he called open borders a Koch Brothers proposal. And in \"The New York Times\" editorial interview that just came out today, he acknowledged that illegal immigrants pushed down the wages of American workers, but Tucker you can't be a Democrat today, if you don't believe in de facto open borders. And Bernie who is actual -- who was a real economic populist maybe once in his time had to cave to the woke cultural left on immigration, and if he loses it's going to because of that. That's why."

I mean, she is very serious about money that woman, so I would be very concerned about that. What AOC is saying is basically, the dues are not compulsory. What it is, is they give Congress people an amount. For AOC, it's $250,000.00. For the big deal people who are in big committees on Ways and Means, on other things where you can extort companies for donations, those folks have to give up to a million dollars. That's people like Nancy Pelosi. AOC has gone out there and she raises small dollar donations from all across the country. But she raised the most money out of anybody in Congress last year. She raised about $5 million. And what the DCCC says is, you need to kick in of some of what you raise, when you're out there to the party so that we can support candidates who don't have the fundraising power. AOC is not a team player. We've seen that from day one. The problem is politics, especially in Congress is a team sport. If you don't have the majority, you really don't have any power.

And, you know, she says things like, well, my college loans are still $20,000.00; yet I get a bill for $250,000.00 which is totally disingenuous because she raised $5 million. That money doesn't go for her college loans, that's campaign money, and she won't kick it into the party."

And that has resulted in what appears to be Iranian Police firing live ammunition to disperse the crowd, though, we cannot verify the videos. President Trump has issued statements supporting the demonstrators and calling on the regime to stop the violence. Meantime, Democrats who heavily criticized the President for the escalation with Iran and some even faulting him for the plane crash have remained largely silent at the rage toward the regime. Of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, only Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar have spoken out in support of the people. Journalist, Yashar Ali, who is of Iranian descent, and still has family there said quoting here, \"I've gone through some of the most prominent liberal Twitter accounts and none of them mentioned the Iran protest today.\" Meantime, despite President Trump saying that Qasem Soleimani was planning imminent attacks on four of our embassies, Defense Secretary Mark Esper deny seeing that Intelligence.

Well, you know, last week, America avoided a full scale war with Iran, such a war would have been costly and a tragedy for thousands of Americans, but sadly there is another tragedy very much like that ongoing and has been, of course for decades. Over the weekend, we're sad to tell you, two American servicemen were killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. One leaves behind a wife and four children; the other was 21 years old, just a toddler when 9/11 happened and American troops first went into that country. These are the first deaths this year in Afghanistan. Sadly, though, and this is the poignant part, it is not clear what these men died for. Possibly the same thing that more than 2,300 American troops have died for since the Taliban was toppled in 2001. Not much. It hurts to say that, but it appears to be true. The Afghan War Papers obtained by \"The Washington Post\" late last year have confirmed these suspicions. Our leaders have no strategy in Afghanistan. Our troops -- and this is their assessment -- have simply been ordered to stay in the country indefinitely until Afghanistan magically turns into Belgium. And it's not clear that will ever happen. For more than a decade, America has lost ground to the Taliban. According to the Pentagon's own estimates, 40 percent of the money the United States spent gets diverted to the Taliban, or to the pockets of corrupt officials. Billions of dollars have been blown on things like flying Burger King into the country with a goal of spending the Pentagon's budget allocations, so it is not cut the following year. For the metrics bureaucrats use, that's success. For soldiers though, it means another deployment, more days and months and years spent away from their families in the path of harm in many cases. Every year, the money we spend in Afghanistan is enough to make every soldier currently deployed there a millionaire. Imagine if we sent that money back to the communities these soldiers came from. But we're not doing that. Some are coming home in coffins, two more as we just said. It's obvious what's going on here. We don't need someone in Washington to recognize the tragedy of this unfolding. Anyone who's paid any attention at all knows that it's a tragedy. We need someone brave enough to stop what's happening there for the sake of this country. Doug Macgregor is a retired U.S. Army Colonel, author of the book, \"Margin of Victory.\" He joins us tonight. This is such a depressing topic, Doug that we're almost hesitant to bring it up.

If you're a longtime watcher of \"The New York Times,\" it can be hard to settle on a low watermark. When exactly that newspaper abandoned its duties as a news gathering operation and become captive to its own neuroses, obsessions, and increasingly lunatic political theories? In other words, when did \"The New York Times\" become absurd? Well, theories vary on the subject. Was it when the paper intentionally hid the deaths of millions during Stalin's famines in the 1930s? Was it when its reporters hyped neocon lies to plunge us into a catastrophic occupation of Iraq? Obviously, these are serious contenders. Here's our vote. Just last week, as you remember, the United States barely avoided war with Iran. This show you may recall, opposed that war on the grounds it wasn't in America's interest. For our troubles for doing that, \"The New York Times\" attacked us in a piece over the weekend. The paper denounced the show as immoral for opposing a war in Iran. Doing that, opposing the war, it explained is a, \"direct result\" brace yourself - - \"of racism.\" Let that sink in. If you're not for killing Persians says \"The New York Times\" you're a bigot. That's their position. And to prove it the paper quoted the question that we asked on this show at the time, \"Why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire?\" And there you have it said, \"The Times,\" another crazed right winger putting the interest of his own country above more pointless wars in the Middle East. What a racist. Decent people should cheer the bombing of Tehran. That's what they wrote. Imagine writing a piece like that. Imagine editing that piece and sending it to the printer. Imagine reading that piece in your morning newspaper and continuing to subscribe. And yet, all of that actually happened. And in a way, thank God that it did happen, because 50 years from now, historians will want you to understand how America's ruling class went completely and utterly insane. And they'll have \"The New York Times\" to provide a roadmap. Well, Queen Elizabeth II has come to a decision on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's plans to transition out of the Royal family. We're covering it with Mark Steyn. Meanwhile, America doesn't have a monarchy just yet, but Chelsea Clinton is proving that being a child of a top politician is almost as lucrative as being a member of the Royal family. We've got details on her finances. Stay tuned."

      "utterance": "Well, here's the upside of the whole impeachment drama. We've learned even more about how it really works in our ruling class. It's brought attention to the lucrative jobs that Hunter Biden was able to get because he had an important father. As CNN and MSNBC and The Washington Post have all informed you repeatedly just so you don't forget, there's \"no evidence\" that Biden broke the law by taking money from people hoping to influence his father. And the sad thing is, they're technically right. In America today, there's nothing illegal about paying de facto bribes by handing fake jobs to the unqualified family members of powerful people. And since it is perfectly legal, naturally, Hunter Biden isn't the only one shamelessly cashing in on his family name -- hardly. Here's one offender. Chelsea Clinton, certified non-genius. Since 2011, Chelsea Clinton has served on the board of a company called IAC. It is a media and online investment company, a big one. When she started serving on the Board, she was barely into her 30s, which is just a few years of non-distinguished work experience, but IAC paid her like a seasoned expert. She got a $50,000.00 a year salary, plus a quarter million dollars in stock. But here's the real payoff. By the end of last year, her stake in IAC had grown to just under $9 million. And the good news for Chelsea is, sitting on the Board of the company hasn't been very demanding. At the very same time, she was collecting millions from them, she was getting $600,000.00 a year for example, from NBC to produce a handful of forgettable television segments. She also served on the Board of the Expedia Group which is believed to be paying her another quarter million dollars a year and of course, she's kept busy working as Vice Chair of the Clinton Foundation, writing bad children's books and lecturing America from her perch on Twitter. Read her feed some time. It'll tell you a lot. She went to Stanford, by the way, unlike you. How much money is that? Well, the average American would have to work five lifetimes to earn the $9 million to Chelsea Clinton collected from IAC for doing nothing, but Chelsea Clinton did it in less than a decade because she had the right last name. Just in case you're wondering if the system is rigged. Well, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's announcement last week that they will step away from the British Royal Family shocked everyone, apparently, even the Queen was stunned. Nevertheless, the Royal Family reportedly held a private meeting today and afterwards, the Queen announced that she is \"entirely supportive\" of her grandson's decision to flee their country and cash in. But the drama is far from over. According to \"The Daily Mail,\" which is always true, Palace aides fear that Harry and Meghan will give an interview accusing the Royal Family of -- and you could have guessed this -- racism, if they're not happy with how things proceed. Author and columnist Mark Steyn joins us tonight to explain all of this to we, Americans. Mark Steyn, welcome, and I have to ask you this, apparently Harry was caught on tape talking to Bob Iger, head of Disney, begging him to give his wife Megan Markle voiceover work?

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's the award season in Hollywood and just like in the Democratic Party, everyone is yelling at everyone else about being immoral. It was just a year ago that Hollywood was telling you about its virtue. It nominated a diverse field for several major awards. This year, some categories are a bit paler, so critics are back to claiming Hollywood is a bigoted place. When all the best director nominees turned out to be male, the announcer didn't hide her disgust."

      "speaker": "ARMOND WHITE, NATIONAL REVIEW FILM CRITIC",
      "utterance": "No, it's not about the movies. I'm happy to be here, Tucker. You know, that Issa Rae Performance there, it had nothing to do with anything except her own petulance, and she is catering to the Hollywood fashion. You know, when you talk about the issue of diversity and skin color in the Oscars, it has nothing to do with that, really, it's really about social engineering, I think, where the media -- the media is social engineering, trying to keep people at odds and separate from each other, and keeping people in a complaining mood. If the Oscars are really about excellence and quality, then race has nothing to do with it. It's just the media of fomenting separation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Making us hate each other and causing us to ignore the essential questions which are -- is it good or not? I'm wondering how long can this continue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "It can continue as long as the media people think that they can manipulate the public rather than talk about good movies, like the best films of the year, which were like Craig Zahler's \"Drives Across Concrete,\" instead of talking about good movies, get people upset about, oh, our tribe is not getting enough. It's not about art anymore. It's all about agitation and manipulation of the public."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So you watch films for a living, you review them, you've done it for decades. Is there any correlation between tribe and excellence? Does it matter, any of this stuff in the end?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "No, it really doesn't matter, not when you have excellent filmmakers like Jonathan Demme and sometimes Steven Spielberg making great movies about black people. That's what matters. It doesn't matter -- tokenism doesn't matter. Setting quotas in the Academy Awards doesn't matter to anybody except Academy members and media people again, who want to look good and feel good about themselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Is anybody finally empowered by this? Like does anybody actually see his or her life improved by this? Does it help anybody?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "I really -- I really don't think so, and especially not when movies about race like \"Harriet\" are bad films. That doesn't help anybody except the people who make them who want to feel self-righteous."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "This must be depressing for you to do this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITE",
      "utterance": "It is depressing, but except that when I see a good movie like \"Dragged Across Concrete\" or even a good film like Tarantino's \"once Upon a Time in America.\" What's depressing is when crappy movies, bad movies that push poor politics upon the public don't get discussed. That's what bothers me as a critic. I want to talk about the political aspect of movies when they're good and when they're bad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Right. No, it's such a good point. Thank you for being a rare voice for aesthetics for quality of a good film. Appreciate it. Armond White, great to see you tonight. Thank you."

Tune in every night, 8:00 p.m. to the show that is and will always be the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Good night from Los Angeles. We have snuck out to the other coast to see what it's like here. Good in some ways, not so good in others. We will be back tomorrow. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
