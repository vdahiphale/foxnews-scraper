    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, if you look at the economy as a whole, with hundreds -- with well over 100 million employees, the fact that a few companies are giving a few bonuses doesn't disguise the fact that, when we have Democratic tax policies in force, we have much higher economic growth rates than when we have Republican economic policies and tax policies in force."

      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Really, because over the last, what, eight years under President Obama, that didn't turn out so well. You had average growth of 1.5 percent. It should have been a whole lot better. But we had no economic policy out of the Obama administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "Trish, you have got to look at what tax law is in force, not who's sitting in the White House. It took several years for Obama to change his tax policies. We have had Democratic tax policies with almost 2.33 economic growth. Compare that to the low economic growth we had under George Bush's tax policies. Look at Reagans' and looks at Clinton's economic -- when their tax law was enforced and signed into law."

      "utterance": "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You know what? Go read an economics 101 textbook. You can actually chart this stuff out. When you put more money in the hands of people and more money in the hands of corporations, the people and the corporations that are actually earning it in the first place, that equals growth."

      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "And I'll tell you why. Because you run that huge deficit. You think you're putting more money in the hands of people. But then the federal government goes into the capital pool and takes the money out. We're going to be borrowing $1.7 trillion. That's taking money out of the economy, out of where it is available for factory expansion."

      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "We had higher economic growth in 2016, in terms of jobs, than 2017. But after we passed ObamaCare, after we passed Dodd-Frank, we suddenly had two million or more, almost three million in one, new jobs every year. Now, that's peeled off a little bit with Trump. And it will peel off more."

    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "You're kind of all over the place. You talk about ObamaCare, this from someone who's fiscally conservative, as you just suggested. You're so concerned about the deficit, yet you want more entitlement programs. I mean, it just doesn't make any sense."

    {
      "speaker": "SHERMAN",
      "utterance": "And bonuses are given all the time. That's why we have a Christmas and a New Year's. That's the point. Bonuses are given all the time, close -- open all the time, close all the time. You can't attribute that to a tax bill."

      "speaker": "REGAN",

And if America succeeds, everybody succeeds. But you look at this tax bill, here's what it does for factories. You can have a zero percent tax on the profits of your factory only if you move it overseas. That's the offshoring provision of this bill. Not only does it provide 85 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent. It provides a 100 percent tax break for those who move their factories overseas. Those are the facts. You can make up alternative facts if you want."

      "speaker": "REGAN",
