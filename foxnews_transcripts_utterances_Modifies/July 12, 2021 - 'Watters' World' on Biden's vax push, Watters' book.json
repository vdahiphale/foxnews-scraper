Seriously, if you haven't heard, where have you been? I've been on TV more than Fauci. I know I've been plugging it hard, but that's just because I know you're going to love it, and if you haven't bought a copy already, I'm very disappointed. Why would you disappoint me like that? I thought we had a thing here. But for those of you who bought it, thank you. Everyone is saying it lives up to the hype. And by everyone, I mean me. So, if you haven't picked it up yet, I'm going to close the sale right now. There's a study that's already been done, says reading my book will add years to your life. I'm serious. Laughter makes you live longer. It's been proven. So, buy the book, and you'll live longer. You don't want to live longer? The book has got a serious side, too. It's very political. And if you read this book, you'll never lose an argument to a liberal, I guarantee it. That's a guarantee. I'll give you your money back if you lose an argument. Maybe. So, my parents are liberals and sent me to survival camps growing up to build character.",

And in the end, we talk about saving yourself before you try saving other people, something to think about. So, thank you all for buying, \"How I Saved the World.\" Contact me on social media and tell me what you think and we'll read some of the reviews next week. Here are some of the reviews of me that I decided to slap on the back of the book. You ready? \"Jesse Watters is officially out of control.\" \"The Washington Post\". \"Does Watters have the most punchable face in America? The answer is obviously yes.\" \"Daily Beast.\" \"Keep this guy off TV.\" Mayor Bill de Blasio. Probably the only thing de Blasio got right. So, go buy the book where books are sold. I love saying that phrase. Buy it right now on Amazon. It's only 20 bucks. You guys can afford this. It's the best 20 bucks you'll ever spend. Or you just stay in a seated position and just do it with your fingers if you don't want to walk your little tired bones into a Barnes & Noble. Do you are right here. Or if you don't like Amazon because you think Jeff Bezos is a villain, go to harpercollins.com, and grab it there. No excuses. The book is timeless, and as I said it'll add years to your life. Do you really want to die early? Save yourself. Buy it now. The Biden administration is getting pretty scary. They're going to be knocking on your door and harassing you to get vaxxed.",

Of course, the N.S.A. is watching you. That's what you get. But that's hardly the point. By law, the N.S.A. is required to keep secret the identities of American citizens who have been caught up in its vast domestic spying operations. So by the law, I should have been identified internally merely as a U.S. journalist or American journalist, that's the law. But that's not how I was identified. I was identified by name. I was unmasked. I had a shouting match last week with N.S.A. officials, where I asked them point blank, they said, well, you're not a target of an investigation, which is a term of art used in the so-called Intel community. And I said, stop with your BS. Were you reading my e-mails or weren't you? Well, we're not going to respond to that. Really? You're not going to tell me whether you are reading my e-mails?

The reason is that even though the content of the e-mail might not be classified, the intercept is.

This is totally inappropriate, and it is being taught to kids as young as four and five years old, and the latest numbers, Jesse are in. I've now had whistleblowers tell me that it is being taught in 30 school districts in 15 states, and it should be taught nowhere.",

Monsignor Rossetti he has witnessed eyes turning yellow, a man hissing at him like a snake, doors banging, TVs turning on and off, dogs howling, and victims communicating in ancient languages they've never learned. But now, he says, these demons have evolved and are now possessing victims through technology and text messages. Monsignor Stephen Rossetti, the author of the new book, \"Diary of an American Exorcist\" joins me now. All right, so Monsignor, what are demons? And how do they manifest themselves? And the obvious question, how exactly do you deal with them? MONSIGNOR STEVEN ROSSETTI, CATHOLIC PRIEST AND AUTHOR, \"DIARY OF AN AMERICAN EXORCIST\": Well, start with the Bible. And as a matter of fact, it reminds me of Father Gabriele Amorth, the famous exorcist from Rome who was speaking to a Vatican Cardinal who said, he didn't believe in that sort of thing. And Father Amorth said, you know, Your Eminence, there's a book I want you to read. He said, well, what book is that? He said, the Bible. Let's start with Jesus and his exorcisms. And then what he said was, he said, I give this authority to you, my disciples and apostles to cast out demons. And so ever since then, for 2,000 years, we've been doing that, and the power to cast out evil is from Jesus. Jesus Lord, His death and resurrection crushed Satan's kingdom. And so he -- an exorcism is nothing more really than a prayer, where we're asking God and Jesus to cast out these demons. So, it's not magic, but it's really a prayer.",

Seriously, if you haven't heard, where have you been? I've been on TV more than Fauci. I know I've been plugging it hard, but that's just because I know you're going to love it, and if you haven't bought a copy already, I'm very disappointed. Why would you disappoint me like that? I thought we had a thing here. But for those of you who bought it, thank you. Everyone is saying it lives up to the hype. And by everyone, I mean me. So, if you haven't picked it up yet, I'm going to close the sale right now. There's a study that's already been done, says reading my book will add years to your life. I'm serious. Laughter makes you live longer. It's been proven. So, buy the book, and you'll live longer. You don't want to live longer? The book has got a serious side, too. It's very political. And if you read this book, you'll never lose an argument to a liberal, I guarantee it. That's a guarantee. I'll give you your money back if you lose an argument. Maybe. So, my parents are liberals and sent me to survival camps growing up to build character."

I know their insecurities and how they project their guilt onto the country for power and relevance. Their lives lack meaning. So, they invent fake movements like political correctness. Terrified of being exposed, the left polices humor because they fear the power of ridicule. Why conservatives can't be funny or likeable is explained in very good detail. It's easier to cancel someone evil and subhuman. So, I landed a seat on \"The Five.\" There's a story behind that, too, and immediately my liberal mom started watching with her Martini and hate- mailing me. We called these mom texts."

The book tells the true story of the 2016 election, and the real story behind the 2020 election. That story has never been told before, so it's very important to read. And in the end, we talk about saving yourself before you try saving other people, something to think about. So, thank you all for buying, \"How I Saved the World.\" Contact me on social media and tell me what you think and we'll read some of the reviews next week. Here are some of the reviews of me that I decided to slap on the back of the book. You ready? \"Jesse Watters is officially out of control.\" \"The Washington Post\". \"Does Watters have the most punchable face in America? The answer is obviously yes.\" \"Daily Beast.\" \"Keep this guy off TV.\" Mayor Bill de Blasio. Probably the only thing de Blasio got right. So, go buy the book where books are sold. I love saying that phrase. Buy it right now on Amazon. It's only 20 bucks. You guys can afford this. It's the best 20 bucks you'll ever spend. Or you just stay in a seated position and just do it with your fingers if you don't want to walk your little tired bones into a Barnes & Noble. Do you are right here. Or if you don't like Amazon because you think Jeff Bezos is a villain, go to harpercollins.com, and grab it there. No excuses. The book is timeless, and as I said it'll add years to your life. Do you really want to die early? Save yourself. Buy it now. The Biden administration is getting pretty scary. They're going to be knocking on your door and harassing you to get vaxxed."

I told nobody I was doing this other than my executive producer. But the Biden administration found out anyway by reading my e-mails. I learned from a whistleblower that the N.S.A. plan to leak the contents of those e-mails to media outlets. Why would they do that? Well, the point of course was to paint me as a disloyal American, a Russian operative. Some of the media are claiming that we deserve this, e-mailing with people who know Putin, are you? Of course, the N.S.A. is watching you. That's what you get. But that's hardly the point. By law, the N.S.A. is required to keep secret the identities of American citizens who have been caught up in its vast domestic spying operations. So by the law, I should have been identified internally merely as a U.S. journalist or American journalist, that's the law. But that's not how I was identified. I was identified by name. I was unmasked. I had a shouting match last week with N.S.A. officials, where I asked them point blank, they said, well, you're not a target of an investigation, which is a term of art used in the so-called Intel community. And I said, stop with your BS. Were you reading my e-mails or weren't you? Well, we're not going to respond to that. Really? You're not going to tell me whether you are reading my e-mails? Clearly, you were. Why can't you tell me? We can't respond to that. So in other words, they won't answer your questions. They won't tell you why they won't answer your questions.

AXIOS also asked the N.S.A. for comment on whether the agency would be willing to deny that they intercepted any of Carlson's communications. An N.S.A. spokesperson declined to comment and referred AXIOS back to the agency's earlier statement, which was pretty lawyerly. The N.S.A. is denying quote, \"targeting Carlson,\" but is not really denying that his communications were collected and read and leaked.

This type of intercept or surveillance could have occurred legally in a couple of ways, and maybe that Tucker Carlson was corresponding with someone who is subject to an N.S.A. surveillance order or that person may have forwarded the e- mail to another party who was subject to that type of order.

That doesn't make any sense within the law. That would constitute a crime if somebody took an intercept and leaked it to the media. The reason is that even though the content of the e-mail might not be classified, the intercept is. You know, for those of us who do national security litigation, it takes a lot to try to get your hands even as a defense counsel on a criminal case, on FISA or N.S.A. material. So, the intercept can be classified. There's no legal way to leak that to the media."

And the obvious question, how exactly do you deal with them? MONSIGNOR STEVEN ROSSETTI, CATHOLIC PRIEST AND AUTHOR, \"DIARY OF AN AMERICAN EXORCIST\": Well, start with the Bible. And as a matter of fact, it reminds me of Father Gabriele Amorth, the famous exorcist from Rome who was speaking to a Vatican Cardinal who said, he didn't believe in that sort of thing. And Father Amorth said, you know, Your Eminence, there's a book I want you to read. He said, well, what book is that? He said, the Bible. Let's start with Jesus and his exorcisms. And then what he said was, he said, I give this authority to you, my disciples and apostles to cast out demons. And so ever since then, for 2,000 years, we've been doing that, and the power to cast out evil is from Jesus. Jesus Lord, His death and resurrection crushed Satan's kingdom.

And sometimes it's rather stark. Sometimes it's very obvious. There is this evil presence manifest. As you mentioned, sometimes the eyes will change. There'll be spewing forth evil, they'll know things they should know. We call that occult knowledge. Sometimes they will speak in foreign languages. So oftentimes, I speak in Latin or Italian just to see if the person will understand it, and sometimes they do so. Or another thing for example, we had a young man, for example, woke up in the morning with this huge like a claw mark on his back. And what it look like was a beast took his claw and raked that across his back, that's exactly what happened and a demon is kind of what did that, and there was no way he could have done that to himself. So, other times, another one woman, for example, she woke up with these burned upside down crosses on her on her arm, and I get this is happening - -"
