      "sentences": "All right, we'll see you later. I am Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight. Did Trump actually let the border wall slipped through his fingers? White House advisor Stephen Miller, one of those rare public appearances for him, he is here tonight to respond to that, and new rumors about who might be the next chief of staff. Plus, liberal judges want to stop ICE from arresting illegals at courthouses. And there is a risk that could present to you, that's coming up. And later, Melania Trump hits back at the media opportunists out there. Wait until you hear what some of today's vile attacks against her. Howard Kurtz is going to weigh in on that.  Plus, polling guru, Frank Luntz, is here to break down how the Democrats are stepping on their own message. We're going to bring you the tape. But first, Trump's successes in black and white. That is the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Now, this was a scene you likely did not see on one of your local or national newscasts. The White House announcing a bold plan to change the lives in America of some of our poorest citizens, those who live in the most distressed and sometimes the most dangerous neighborhoods.  Flanked by Senator Tim Scott and BET founder Bob Johnson with Van Jones looking on, you see him there. The president signed an executive order creating something called the Opportunity and Revitalization Council. Now, if you think this is just kind of another brick in the bureaucracy here in D.C. signifying nothing, think again. Led by HUD Secretary Ben Carson, it will coordinate efforts across the entire federal government to deliver jobs, investment, and growth in underprivileged areas. By the way, it includes rural areas too. Now this means more private-sector money will flow into some of these high-risk areas or low development areas. And what will that do? In turn, that will deliver jobs.",

OK, even for the sake of argument I concede those points, the tonality, the wording, maybe wouldn't have done it that way, fine.  But I ask the following, who cares more about America in particularly the working poor? The guy who delivers results, record low unemployment, opportunity zones and decent chance for criminal justice reform or a party that is all talk and no action? I will take the former any day. Oh, and by the way, the press did find one angle on the opportunity zone that they, well, they thought this part of the story was worth covering. Jared and Trump himself are only pushing these inner-city investment incentives because they will make money off their own real estate holdings. Please.

But I'm telling you despite everything that is swirling around him the Democrat's obsession with impeachment, the indictments, et cetera, et cetera, the president continues to do work that other presidents wouldn't do.

Well, he's into prison reform, but he hates you and insulting our intelligence by speaking to us like that when the proof is on the pudding. This man, and I said it. He could be the most proactive president for black America in my lifetime, and he's proving me to be a prophet in that respect. He's doing things -- if President Obama had done this, there would be a parade down the street right now. They'd be -- Obama, he's the savior of the black community. He's prisoner reform. Oh, Obama.

White House advisor Stephen Miller, one of those rare public appearances for him, he is here tonight to respond to that, and new rumors about who might be the next chief of staff. Plus, liberal judges want to stop ICE from arresting illegals at courthouses. And there is a risk that could present to you, that's coming up. And later, Melania Trump hits back at the media opportunists out there. Wait until you hear what some of today's vile attacks against her. Howard Kurtz is going to weigh in on that. Plus, polling guru, Frank Luntz, is here to break down how the Democrats are stepping on their own message. We're going to bring you the tape. But first, Trump's successes in black and white. That is the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Now, this was a scene you likely did not see on one of your local or national newscasts. The White House announcing a bold plan to change the lives in America of some of our poorest citizens, those who live in the most distressed and sometimes the most dangerous neighborhoods. Flanked by Senator Tim Scott and BET founder Bob Johnson with Van Jones looking on, you see him there. The president signed an executive order creating something called the Opportunity and Revitalization Council. Now, if you think this is just kind of another brick in the bureaucracy here in D.C. signifying nothing, think again. Led by HUD Secretary Ben Carson, it will coordinate efforts across the entire federal government to deliver jobs, investment, and growth in underprivileged areas. By the way, it includes rural areas too. Now this means more private-sector money will flow into some of these high-risk areas or low development areas. And what will that do? In turn, that will deliver jobs."

But Laura, Obama and the Democrats care more than Donald Trump. Look, you can see it. You can feel it. They care. Then they're going to bring up Charlottesville and the s-hole comment Trump made to them drive their point's home. OK, even for the sake of argument I concede those points, the tonality, the wording, maybe wouldn't have done it that way, fine. But I ask the following, who cares more about America in particularly the working poor? The guy who delivers results, record low unemployment, opportunity zones and decent chance for criminal justice reform or a party that is all talk and no action? I will take the former any day. Oh, and by the way, the press did find one angle on the opportunity zone that they, well, they thought this part of the story was worth covering.

And not -- he didn't do this, by the way, to benefit just a few of his pals or the people who voted for him, but he is doing this to try to benefit those who have been served so poorly by politicians of both parties for decades. But I'm telling you despite everything that is swirling around him the Democrat's obsession with impeachment, the indictments, et cetera, et cetera, the president continues to do work that other presidents wouldn't do. And poor working class Americans will be better for it. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now with reaction, Pastor Darrell Scott. He was at the signing of the Opportunity Zones Executive Order and he's also the CEO of the National Diversity Coalition for Trump. And with me is Niger Innis from the Congress for Racial Equality and Chris Edwards from the Cato Institute. Great to have you all here tonight. Pastor, you were at this event yesterday.

On one side of the street, you get this giant capital gains tax break. On the other side of the street, you don't get anything. So what has happened is immediately landowners, and Ben Carson touched on this, landowners inside the zone immediately had these giant appreciations in the value of their property for doing nothing.

You know, for the first time, health indicators for white men, working class white men, was catching up negatively to those of black and Hispanic men because there was a sense of hopelessness, a sense of eternal dependency on big government. That has changed. Small businesses for the first time in our history, small businesses, more small businesses were closing than opening. What the president is doing with these opportunity zones and I want to applaud my friend, Pastor Scott. I want to applaud the president. What they are doing is they are making a bet and investment not on big government but on capitalism and I think my friend from Cato would agree that capitalism has done more to free and liberate people from poverty, not just in our country but around the world, than any other system in history.

First of all, when you elevate the value of these depressed areas, the areas adjacent to the depressed areas automatically elevate their value as well. Real estate 101 is when you look at property value, you look at the comps, comparables. And that's how you determine the value. So, if an area is depressed, it's bringing down the value of the surrounding areas. If that area increases their value, the areas around it automatically increase as well.

Nothing for the Hispanic community. Nothing for working-class, poor whites for years, so what do they do? Every two years for every four years or every three years for local election, they will drag out the racism card, which is nonsense and say that, well, you've got to keep me in power. Maxine -- Mad Maxine Waters has been in power for decades in Los Angeles. And what has she delivered for her community other than saying that that guy over there or that woman over there if they are Republican and they are white, they are racist. It's nonsense and the black community, Hispanic community is tired of it.

Here now, former assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Kelly who prosecuted immigration cases in the border county of San Diego. Eileen Blessinger is also with us, an immigration attorney.

Because many jurisdictions no longer allow ICE to take custody of aliens inside of jails, courthouses are the next safest option. As the judges acknowledged in their letter, ICE updated its courthouse policy in coordination with the Association of Chief Justices and Court Administrators to clarify that the agency target specific aliens, appearing most often as a defendant in criminal matters and not those appearing in court as victims or witnesses.\" Isn't that the case that this is being thrown out in a very emotional manner, again, to try to paint the Trump administration as well, you are going after like victims of domestic violence in a courthouse.

They are not just arresting willy-nilly crime victims and things like that. They are in fact trying to do their job in this opposition to them at every turn and is making a dangerous job even harder.

I've got to say, a lot of the reason, and we heard this from ICE tonight as well, they are doing this, Eileen, because there are sanctuary cities in jurisdictions that do not allow them to go into jails to assess the conditions, the status of particular inmates, nor are they alerted to the fact that certain inmates are released. We just had a case in New Jersey in early November where an individual, it was released and then goes on to murder three people in Missouri, from New Jersey, which is a sanctuary state. So ICE is trying to keep us safe out there and I don't understand for the life of me why people who claim to care about women and children, a lot of Democrats, are in the middle of these defending criminals from being detained by or caught up by ICE. That's going to protect women and children in the United States, and men."

If the victims don't feel safe going to court, then all of the work that the police officers, the prosecutors have done have fallen apart. When we talk about the U visas, a lot of times the prosecutors don't feel comfortable telling the witnesses about that, the existence of a U visa for fear of it becoming biased later when they are testifying and use against them."
