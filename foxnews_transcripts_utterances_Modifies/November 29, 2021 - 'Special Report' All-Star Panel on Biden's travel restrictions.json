Almost half of the patients with Omicron symptoms that she treated were not vaccinated. Jonathan, there's a lot we don't know yet, as we from Admiral Giroir earlier, but there is a concern that there will be an overreaction, that we won't have learned from the past and Delta and before that, the first iterations of coronavirus. JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Well, it's a very difficult moment right now because we really don't -- we are flying a little bit blind at the moment. You are talking about, you know, southern Africa, which has very young populations. Very limited data here. We just don't have huge numbers to go by. We don't really know if the vaccines, how effective they are against this new variant. We do know there are a huge number of mutations, which is obviously cause for concern.  But there is just so much we don't know. The travel ban in and of itself is obviously not going to be some kind of solution because it's already likely all around the world. Biden made clear that their strategy is, to the extent they have one, is going to be doubling down on vaccines and booster shots to try and boost immunity. But, again, we just don't know yet how effective these vaccines are against this new variant. We'll probably know a lot more in two weeks, according to administration officials.",

Of course, we know that science is always right and never wrong.  One of the things that we can learn, I think, from this whole experience going back to the beginning of Joe Biden's campaign is that the idea that he based his whole campaign on, that he would be able to shut down this virus, that the Trump administration was doing horrendous job handling it, and that he would make a remarkable difference if he was elected is just politically not justified and is not playing with the American people. They hear mixed messages. They hear uncertainty, as Jonathan was indicating, about the direction that we ought to go.
