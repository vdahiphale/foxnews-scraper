President Biden is headed to Europe and NATO headquarters next week as Russia launches more barbaric attacks. A missile strike hitting an apartment building in Kyiv sparking a massive fire and destroying it completely. Official saying at least three people were killed. And President Zelenskyy who is set to address Congress tomorrow is signaling a possible breakthrough about wanting to join NATO. Listen to this.",

It is to the far east of the country, very near the Russian border and it was one of the first cities hit. Last night was no different. The capital city, Kyiv, took more pounding. An apartment building was hit and this as the Russian army attempts to bring forces from the north and the east to surround the capital city of Kyiv. It is now under a 35-hour curfew as imposed by Mayor Vitaly Klitschko who said Kyiv is now the forward operating base for freedom. The siege on Mariupol is constant. The Red Cross is now accusing Russia of blocking the aid convoys that we're attempting to bring food and water to the people who have been without water, power, and heat now for at least 10 days. Some good news out of Mariupol after multiple ceasefire attempts for humanitarian purposes have fallen apart, a humanitarian convoy or civilian convoy, some 160 vehicles long, made its way to Zaporizhzhia and to safety.

They don't remember Hitler and Napoleon, how they underestimated the Russian army also. War is hell, judge, we talk about that all the time. Putin is the devil. He's a war criminal. His invasion of his neighboring sovereign nation is as barbaric as it is unjustified. And now his brutality has struck the Fox News family. A team led by our correspondent Benjamin Hall was attacked grievously wounding the correspondent, the person you see there in the foreground, Pierre Zakrzewski, his cameraman killed. Sasha Kuvshynova, their local producer and translator and guide also killed. So we lost two. Benjamin, as I mentioned, grievously injured. We pray for him. We send our condolences, our deep condolences. There you see Sasha in the background that little person, just 24 years-old, dead now as is the cameraman in this photo, Pierre Zakrzewski, dead. It's just awful. We pray for Benjamin. We send him our condolences for the loss of his colleagues, our colleagues. It's something that is deeply heartfelt. I want you to know that we are a family and we mourn this loss. War is not the romantic panorama you see in the movies. It's ugly. It's dirty. And these fine people now struck down in the prime of their lives just a child, 24 years-old. And Benjamin Hall, you know, in the fight for his life. It is, judge, something that is so appalling.

This is -- what we need is audacious diplomacy right now. Is there some kind of like a special episode of Matlock that he's watching that he's too busy? Does he want to stick around here for St. Patrick's Day? No, he should be on a plane right now meeting with the very top players, with other top players of the country, not this casual diplomacy and back padding is just disgusting. As for Ben, I spoke to him last week at length after we had our little kerfuffle. And the thing that pisses me off most about him is that he's handsome and he's funny and we joked about what went on THE FIVE. And we -- I'm not going to say we talked about it because frankly it's nobody's business, but he did say something that I agreed with a hundred percent and he said, \"Greg, you can't do my job and I can't do yours.\" And I said duh. My job is way easier. I'm not in any danger.\" I don't -- I do get death threats but they're usually from Dana on pink stationary. But we can afford to pontificate because we're here thousands of miles away. They can't afford to pontificate at all because they're always in danger and that's kind of been my lodestar. Geraldo said war is the worst thing that you can imagine. That's what we do here. We imagine. But what Ben and his co-workers do, they don't imagine it. They actually see it, which is why when I'm sitting here, for me, I must be as anti-war as possible until I can no longer be anti-war. Because it's like those TV hosts that were telling you to stay home indefinitely during COVID because they still worked. They still got their damn paychecks. They got the camera crew coming to their house. They were divorced from their consequences. That is the same thing here. It is easy to talk about war at home as Geraldo says. It's not romantic. But since I'm not going anywhere near the war, I'm sure as hell not going to tell a single person to go there and die in a foreign country. I learned that lesson with Iraq and I'm never gonna go through that again. Ben's job is to go there and delineate the truth through imagery. It is harder to do now than ever given social media, the internet, the rise of constant disinformation, but if you're sitting here at this table you must be a radical skeptic because you aren't there, Ben is. And I hope to God he makes it through. It's a horrible thing that happened to him and he's a -- to sound British, he's a lovely guy.",

And we had General Kellogg on the show last night and he said we have to send them the Patriot Missile Defense System. So these batteries, they are surface to air. You could even send them the Russian-made ones, the S300's, and you basically can take out a cruise missile. You can take out a ballistic missile. You could take out fixed- wing aircraft like that. They're very expensive, about $100 million per system. But Ukraine is running low on surface-to-air defensive missile systems and that would be -- make a huge difference because if you could get him into Kyiv now before it's encircled that would stop the shelling. And so if you have the city surrounded by these armaments that are shelling, not only could you block it with the missile defense system you could take out the Russian tank columns with the Stingers and the Javelins. And that would really be the decisive action to make Putin --basically he's blocked. If you can't take the capital and you just get your artillery destroyed and you can't even go in and kill the president, the Ukrainians win in that scenario. So that's what they need to do and they need to do it immediately. And debating over MIG's forget about it. Send them the missile system. That's a defensive system.",

Whether that changes anything, I don't know. Certainly, President Biden when he visits Brussels next week, possibly Poland. No major announcement made so far. Possibly we could hear something different from this president. Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker just made an incredibly important point about this moment saying that Vladimir Putin, Geraldo, to your point, is desperate and dangerous at this hour. He knows he is losing, he said. He's doubling down on his aggressions even as his strategic position weakens. He said this is why this is the most dangerous phase of this invasion right now and why the U.S. must manage this moment extremely carefully. He said, \"instead of saying what we won't do, in this moment, we need to say what we will do.\" And that's a big part of this moment.",

A missile strike hitting an apartment building in Kyiv sparking a massive fire and destroying it completely. Official saying at least three people were killed.

It is to the far east of the country, very near the Russian border and it was one of the first cities hit. Last night was no different. The capital city, Kyiv, took more pounding. An apartment building was hit and this as the Russian army attempts to bring forces from the north and the east to surround the capital city of Kyiv. It is now under a 35-hour curfew as imposed by Mayor Vitaly Klitschko who said Kyiv is now the forward operating base for freedom. The siege on Mariupol is constant. The Red Cross is now accusing Russia of blocking the aid convoys that we're attempting to bring food and water to the people who have been without water, power, and heat now for at least 10 days. Some good news out of Mariupol after multiple ceasefire attempts for humanitarian purposes have fallen apart, a humanitarian convoy or civilian convoy, some 160 vehicles long, made its way to Zaporizhzhia and to safety.

They don't remember Hitler and Napoleon, how they underestimated the Russian army also. War is hell, judge, we talk about that all the time. Putin is the devil. He's a war criminal. His invasion of his neighboring sovereign nation is as barbaric as it is unjustified. And now his brutality has struck the Fox News family. A team led by our correspondent Benjamin Hall was attacked grievously wounding the correspondent, the person you see there in the foreground, Pierre Zakrzewski, his cameraman killed. Sasha Kuvshynova, their local producer and translator and guide also killed. So we lost two. Benjamin, as I mentioned, grievously injured. We pray for him. We send our condolences, our deep condolences. There you see Sasha in the background that little person, just 24 years-old, dead now as is the cameraman in this photo, Pierre Zakrzewski, dead. It's just awful. We pray for Benjamin. We send him our condolences for the loss of his colleagues, our colleagues. It's something that is deeply heartfelt. I want you to know that we are a family and we mourn this loss. War is not the romantic panorama you see in the movies. It's ugly. It's dirty. And these fine people now struck down in the prime of their lives just a child, 24 years-old. And Benjamin Hall, you know, in the fight for his life. It is, judge, something that is so appalling. I'm so angry and at the same time I feel so helpless to do anything about it."

      "utterance": "Well, you know, I want to talk about Ben, but first, the fact that Joe is announcing that he's going to Europe next week. No. This is what we're talking about. This is -- what we need is audacious diplomacy right now. Is there some kind of like a special episode of Matlock that he's watching that he's too busy? Does he want to stick around here for St. Patrick's Day? No, he should be on a plane right now meeting with the very top players, with other top players of the country, not this casual diplomacy and back padding is just disgusting. As for Ben, I spoke to him last week at length after we had our little kerfuffle. And the thing that pisses me off most about him is that he's handsome and he's funny and we joked about what went on THE FIVE. And we -- I'm not going to say we talked about it because frankly it's nobody's business, but he did say something that I agreed with a hundred percent and he said, \"Greg, you can't do my job and I can't do yours.\" And I said duh. My job is way easier. I'm not in any danger.\" I don't -- I do get death threats but they're usually from Dana on pink stationary. But we can afford to pontificate because we're here thousands of miles away. They can't afford to pontificate at all because they're always in danger and that's kind of been my lodestar. Geraldo said war is the worst thing that you can imagine. That's what we do here. We imagine. But what Ben and his co-workers do, they don't imagine it. They actually see it, which is why when I'm sitting here, for me, I must be as anti-war as possible until I can no longer be anti-war. Because it's like those TV hosts that were telling you to stay home indefinitely during COVID because they still worked. They still got their damn paychecks. They got the camera crew coming to their house. They were divorced from their consequences. That is the same thing here. It is easy to talk about war at home as Geraldo says. It's not romantic. But since I'm not going anywhere near the war, I'm sure as hell not going to tell a single person to go there and die in a foreign country. I learned that lesson with Iraq and I'm never gonna go through that again. Ben's job is to go there and delineate the truth through imagery. It is harder to do now than ever given social media, the internet, the rise of constant disinformation, but if you're sitting here at this table you must be a radical skeptic because you aren't there, Ben is. And I hope to God he makes it through. It's a horrible thing that happened to him and he's a -- to sound British, he's a lovely guy."

      "speaker": "JESSE WATERS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "He could get there during a hostage crisis. That city could be completely surrounded and he has no leverage. So I would suggest you do something dramatic before then. And we had General Kellogg on the show last night and he said we have to send them the Patriot Missile Defense System. So these batteries, they are surface to air. You could even send them the Russian-made ones, the S300's, and you basically can take out a cruise missile. You can take out a ballistic missile. You could take out fixed- wing aircraft like that. They're very expensive, about $100 million per system. But Ukraine is running low on surface-to-air defensive missile systems and that would be -- make a huge difference because if you could get him into Kyiv now before it's encircled that would stop the shelling. And so if you have the city surrounded by these armaments that are shelling, not only could you block it with the missile defense system you could take out the Russian tank columns with the Stingers and the Javelins. And that would really be the decisive action to make Putin --basically he's blocked. If you can't take the capital and you just get your artillery destroyed and you can't even go in and kill the president, the Ukrainians win in that scenario. So that's what they need to do and they need to do it immediately. And debating over MIG's forget about it. Send them the missile system. That's a defensive system."

I understand that they are still in trouble. That they are closed essentially and that is the more Putin is bombing, the more Putin is shelling, the more people are getting killed. We're talking about apartment buildings now, civilian buses. I mean, he's really after the Ukrainian people. It's no more, you know, just military buildings.

Whether that changes anything, I don't know. Certainly, President Biden when he visits Brussels next week, possibly Poland. No major announcement made so far. Possibly we could hear something different from this president. Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker just made an incredibly important point about this moment saying that Vladimir Putin, Geraldo, to your point, is desperate and dangerous at this hour. He knows he is losing, he said. He's doubling down on his aggressions even as his strategic position weakens. He said this is why this is the most dangerous phase of this invasion right now and why the U.S. must manage this moment extremely carefully. He said, \"instead of saying what we won't do, in this moment, we need to say what we will do.\" And that's a big part of this moment."

TikTok might be the most effective cyber warfare in history because it's in every house. It causes kids to do really bad stuff to each other and to others. Sometimes it's self-mutilation. It's basically delivering crap to our kid's brains. Meanwhile in China, they use TikTok to educate their kids. They have rules. They go, I mean, it's like -- and yet we're polluting ourselves.

I ask them what could be done to increase and incentivize more drilling, obviously, more oil production to bring those gas prices down. If you were to think about something really reasonable to hear from this administration, the oil and gas industry, the American Petroleum Institute says just send a friendlier message that you're not out to demonize the oil companies. And now you've got these two Democrats, Sheldon Whitehouse and Ro Khanna, they want to tax the oil companies more in a moment where we actually need them. We need more oil production to bring the -- and by the way, the message to the TikTok viewer out there is green energy, in a moment where 65 percent of the American people are living paycheck to paycheck.

As far as Lindsey Graham earlier today saying why he believes that the U.S. is not getting involved and President Biden folding like a cheap suit, I think, was his exact words. I'm getting involved with the transfer of those MIG jets. He says he believes Putin got in his ear and threatened escalation if you do.

Smollett's lawyers claim being locked up is a danger to his health. Judge, should he be let out of his 100 day sentence in jail because it may risk his ability to survive?"

He only has to serve 75 of those days. But let me make one thing clear. A jury of your peers convicted you, a judge has sentenced you, and you are legitimately in a jail. And stop this act or nonsense, where you're the victim and you should be freed because you're -- you may be in trouble. So, what they did was they put you in protective custody. So, in case you think as an actor, you're more important than you really are, that you're protected. But here's the bottom line is lawyers then come out and they say we can't have him in protective custody because it's a danger to his mental health. Why don't you just shut up, get your three meals a day, and you're caught, and serve this sentence? You created a tremendous problem for this country, dividing us and putting salt in an old wound having to do with racism. Shut up, sit down, and serve your sentence."

And now, he say, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to -- it's like the boy who cried wolf except you did it last time. So, we have to make it -- we're putting you in a psych ward because you put this noose around your neck before you might put it around again.
