Now, we're already getting signs of that from Nancy Pelosi, who just a few short minutes ago, was saying, we are on scheduled for a bipartisan bill on Monday.  We're going to get in the details of what that could mean. In the meantime, we are tracking all these developments because of so many meetings that the president has had.  Just to give you an indication of who he has already met with, stands to meet in a busy day of back-and-forth to try to rally Democrats around a single approach to all of this to keep the government lights on, to delay, suspend the government ceiling deadline, also to get that reconciliation package, get a budget sort of wedged in there, get the bipartisan infrastructure measure done, move a step closer to getting the $3.5 trillion infrastructure measure done, that's not Italian sausage, my friends.

Republicans, of course, are not for linking any of this with pushing the debt ceiling further back here.

But now the wheels are coming off entirely, because House Republican leadership is now within their members, urging them to vote no on the bipartisan infrastructure deal because they think it's clear the two are linked.  And now 11 Senate Democrats are telling their colleagues in the House to hold their vote on the bipartisan deal until the budget bill gets passed first and heads to the president's desk. So there is a lot at stake for President Biden's Build Back Better agenda, with progressives and moderates at war with each other. He is trying to get everyone on the same page today.",

And, as you mentioned at the top, Neil, we did get an update from Speaker Pelosi out of that meeting with President Biden.  She says they are still on track for a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure deal on Monday. She didn't want to go into details on what that meant for a vote on the reconciliation package. But she did say that they are on track and moving forward with that.

So, interest rates were kept on hold close to zero, but hinting that they will be cutting back on stimulus pretty soon, reducing that $120 billion and monthly bond purchases. Most economists expect that to start some time in November. Now, the Fed is still predicting a pretty strong year of growth this year, with GDP at close to 6 percent. That would be the best year for the U.S. economy since the middle of the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was still in office, but that fast pace of growth will come with higher prices, so the Fed predicting inflation to hit above 4 percent this year, which is double their inflation target of 2 percent. However, it's all just temporary or transitory, with the Central Bank forecasting prices to come down next year and 2023. But not everyone thinks it will be that easy or that smooth. Jamie Dimon, J.P. Morgan's influential CEO, warning that inflation could get so high next year that the Federal Reserve might have to jam on the brakes, pull out liquidity, and then you're going to see a huge reaction, meaning a big stock market sell-off.  Now, Dimon says he's not predicting that, but it is possible that that just might happen. Now, in the meantime, the great IPO run continues with Toast soaring over 60 percent in his New York debut.

We cannot find any record of him going as president, vice president, candidate, senator, concerned citizen. She wanted to know what the deal was.

But the person of interest they are looking for has yet to be discovered. That's 23-year-old Brian Laundrie, wanted for questioning in the now- confirmed death of his fiancee, 22-year-old Gabby Petito. So far, no evidence of Laundrie has turned up. Searchers are also using ATVs and high- water vehicles, as the terrain is rough, swampy and much underwater, plenty of alligators and snakes as well, including very dangerous water moccasins. Brian Laundrie had been living in North Port with his parents and his fiancee. The Teton County, Wyoming, coroner confirmed late yesterday that the body found Sunday is in fact Petito, concluding the manner of death is homicide. She and Laundrie had been on a cross-country road trip visiting the country's national parks. In August, Moab, Utah, police questioned the young couple after someone dialed 911 to report a guy was slapping a girl in the face. But when they were pulled over, that is something that Gabby Petito denied happen, saying her fiance, Brian Laundrie, just pushed or grabbed her face. On Monday, the FBI and North Port police executed a search warrant at the Laundrie family house, taking out multiple boxes of potential evidence, things like computers, hard drives and cell phones. And keep in mind, three weeks ago, when their son returned by himself in the white van that they had left North Port a few months ago to go on that cross-country road trip, there was no Gabby Petito.

We're going to get in the details of what that could mean. In the meantime, we are tracking all these developments because of so many meetings that the president has had. Just to give you an indication of who he has already met with, stands to meet in a busy day of back-and-forth to try to rally Democrats around a single approach to all of this to keep the government lights on, to delay, suspend the government ceiling deadline, also to get that reconciliation package, get a budget sort of wedged in there, get the bipartisan infrastructure measure done, move a step closer to getting the $3.5 trillion infrastructure measure done, that's not Italian sausage, my friends.

We're also going to talk to North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis where all of this goes right now. Republicans, of course, are not for linking any of this with pushing the debt ceiling further back here. They're open to that maybe on a stand-alone case, but, as things stand out, none of the stuff that they're talking about presently.

But now the wheels are coming off entirely, because House Republican leadership is now within their members, urging them to vote no on the bipartisan infrastructure deal because they think it's clear the two are linked. And now 11 Senate Democrats are telling their colleagues in the House to hold their vote on the bipartisan deal until the budget bill gets passed first and heads to the president's desk. So there is a lot at stake for President Biden's Build Back Better agenda, with progressives and moderates at war with each other. He is trying to get everyone on the same page today."

But it is all hands on deck here on Capitol Hill as well, as White House comms director Kate Bedingfield is talking to the House Democrats as well. And, as you mentioned at the top, Neil, we did get an update from Speaker Pelosi out of that meeting with President Biden. She says they are still on track for a vote on the bipartisan infrastructure deal on Monday. She didn't want to go into details on what that meant for a vote on the reconciliation package. But she did say that they are on track and moving forward with that. And she also made a point to say that all is calm, they are good, and they are making progress in the right direction, perhaps trying to counter this narrative that there is an ongoing war raging between progressives and moderates in the Democratic Party -- Neil."

They wanted that stand-alone measure without anything linked to it or pegged to it. So, if that's what the speaker is talking about, that would probably be closer to their wishes and probably a welcome development for my next guest, the Democrat Emanuel Cleaver from Missouri.

And that is the Build Back Better concept. I mean, I think it would be really dumb if we sacked our own quarterback. And so I'm hoping that we are going to be able to get this thing worked out. I think this is going to have to be a moment of flexibility, where people are willing to fight for everything they can get, and then accept some of the things that they didn't want. And that's that -- democracy demands compromise. And I think we're going to have to certainly compromise inside the Democratic Caucus."

A Blue Dog Democrat meets with the president, of course. Then we hear from someone of that progressive caucus, who gets a chance as well.

They don't like this all delinked, as you said. But on the larger package, the $3.5 trillion package, and all the tax hikes and the initiatives, is it your sense that it has to be pared down? A lot of your moderate colleagues -- maybe you're in that camp as well -- have said, $3.5 trillion, way too much. We have indicated that Joe Manchin in the Senate similarly says, way too much, maybe half that. Where are you?"

But I think that it's in the best interests of the United States of America that we handle many of these issues, particularly these infrastructure issues that could impact the next generation of Americans. And so I'm interested in doing that. The polling data suggests that the public is with -- is behind it. And I am -- the whole -- this whole new deal of going on about the progressives and so forth is kind of interesting, because I'm not sure what credentials one needs to be progressive or to be moderate. Hopefully, everybody's just thoughtful and looking for a way to make things happen."

And now they want us to suspend the debt ceiling, so that the sky's the limit in terms of what more they're going to spend. They have got a dynamic in their conference in the House they have to deal with. They have got a dynamic of their conference in the Senate that they have to deal with. And, like -- I agree with you. This is an insult to sausage-makers to say this is making sausage. They have got serious challenges that they need to deal with."

You're -- you have been there long enough to know that there's a bit of truth to the fact that we always get to this brinksmanship, but somehow the ceiling is raised or the deadline is pushed back and we survive. Are Republicans the ones being intransigent here? How do you answer what they're saying, that you are?"

Chuck Schumer doesn't want to raise the debt ceiling, because the way he has to do it this time, he has to set a top-line number. He can't just suspend it, as the House wants to do, until December of 2022. He has to be honest with the American people and say, this is how much more money I want to spend, and, by implication, this is how much more money I'm going to tax you in the process. That's the real problem here. Chuck Schumer can do his job. I have voted for the increase in the debt limit."

      "utterance": "Right, Neil. So the Federal Reserve delivered pretty much what Wall Street had anticipated, no surprises, which is what stock markets like. So, interest rates were kept on hold close to zero, but hinting that they will be cutting back on stimulus pretty soon, reducing that $120 billion and monthly bond purchases. Most economists expect that to start some time in November. Now, the Fed is still predicting a pretty strong year of growth this year, with GDP at close to 6 percent. That would be the best year for the U.S. economy since the middle of the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was still in office, but that fast pace of growth will come with higher prices, so the Fed predicting inflation to hit above 4 percent this year, which is double their inflation target of 2 percent. However, it's all just temporary or transitory, with the Central Bank forecasting prices to come down next year and 2023. But not everyone thinks it will be that easy or that smooth. Jamie Dimon, J.P. Morgan's influential CEO, warning that inflation could get so high next year that the Federal Reserve might have to jam on the brakes, pull out liquidity, and then you're going to see a huge reaction, meaning a big stock market sell-off. Now, Dimon says he's not predicting that, but it is possible that that just might happen. Now, in the meantime, the great IPO run continues with Toast soaring over 60 percent in his New York debut. The company provides payment systems to restaurants. And also, oh, by the way, Neil, a block from here a $432 million Mega Millions winning ticket was sold. And, no, that was not me, unfortunately."

And it's not clear how much of a frame of reference President Biden actually has about what is going on in Del Rio. I asked Jen Psaki, the press secretary, at one point if President Biden has ever been to the Southern border, and she asked, \"In his life?\" And I said yes, because we did spend a couple hours this morning looking. We cannot find any record of him going as president, vice president, candidate, senator, concerned citizen. She wanted to know what the deal was. And I pointed out that the president does go to visit areas where people are in need, like after a hurricane or after a wildfire. But he has not visited Del Rio. I asked why that was going to be.

All of this in the whirlwind of these developments almost concurrently, if you think about it, certainly dinged the president's approval ratings, but no more so expressed than in a Gallup poll that's just out that shows his approval rating and said a new low as president of 43 percent. His vice president isn't doing much better, approval rating there of 49 percent for her. Kaylee McGhee White with The Washington Examiner here with us. Kaylee, much of this is just coming right after the collapse in Afghanistan, so no doubt the administration's argument will be that was the worst of it, and we're already climbing out of it.

The fact is, there are still Americans trapped in Afghanistan. We don't know if the U.S. is going to get them out. We don't know if they're in the process of getting out. We don't know what the Taliban is going to do. I mean, there are so many unanswered questions here that really are going to affect the way Americans view Biden's handling of this.

Iowa typically get that reputation, a state that Democrats have won a national level a couple of times now. And, there, his approval rating is at 31 percent. It's very low with independents as well. So something isn't resonating, and the White House obviously pivoting to other subjects, but every time it does pivot, it creates more confusion on the whole booster shot thing and what's happening at the border. It can't get out of its own way."

And the polls coming out of Iowa and other battleground states in the days ahead will really determine how the Democratic Party looks at its chances moving into 2022. But, more importantly, the Iowa poll is really an indication a larger trend that we're seeing right now, which is that, nationwide, Biden's approval ratings are collapsing. And a lot of that has to do with Afghanistan. A lot of it has to do with the border crisis, his failure to get control of the coronavirus pandemic as states continue to reimpose restrictions. Voters are looking at this and they're saying, OK, the president has not kept his promises. Is he capable of doing the job? Is this administration really up for the task?

      "utterance": "Yes, those toxicology and forensic testing still being done up there in Wyoming right now, but here down in Florida, day four is soon to wrap up of this exhaustive search, using 60 search teams -- search members of teams. And that includes dive teams, as well as technicians with side sonar, which can detect large objects underneath the water, as well as cadaver dogs all coming through thousands of acres behind me here in this nature reserve. But the person of interest they are looking for has yet to be discovered. That's 23-year-old Brian Laundrie, wanted for questioning in the now- confirmed death of his fiancee, 22-year-old Gabby Petito. So far, no evidence of Laundrie has turned up. Searchers are also using ATVs and high- water vehicles, as the terrain is rough, swampy and much underwater, plenty of alligators and snakes as well, including very dangerous water moccasins. Brian Laundrie had been living in North Port with his parents and his fiancee. The Teton County, Wyoming, coroner confirmed late yesterday that the body found Sunday is in fact Petito, concluding the manner of death is homicide. She and Laundrie had been on a cross-country road trip visiting the country's national parks. In August, Moab, Utah, police questioned the young couple after someone dialed 911 to report a guy was slapping a girl in the face. But when they were pulled over, that is something that Gabby Petito denied happen, saying her fiance, Brian Laundrie, just pushed or grabbed her face. On Monday, the FBI and North Port police executed a search warrant at the Laundrie family house, taking out multiple boxes of potential evidence, things like computers, hard drives and cell phones. And keep in mind, three weeks ago, when their son returned by himself in the white van that they had left North Port a few months ago to go on that cross-country road trip, there was no Gabby Petito. How that was explained to his parents, nobody knows. But when police wanted to ask him questions, they hired an attorney and haven't spoken since -- Neil."

Obviously, they want to get details on maybe how that happened. But it's painstaking, to put it mildly. What do you as a lawyer look at?"

But if you're asking me what his lawyers are looking for, any reasonable hypothesis of innocence, meaning, what are the damages to her body? Let's find out everything. And now let's carve some scenario that could scream innocence if the client were to advance that theory. So they have the benefit of seeing what the evidence is, assuming he's ever stripped of his liberty, found, arrested, and then see exactly what they could say happened that maybe exonerates their client."

    {
      "speaker": "EIGLARSH",

And all this presupposes that he's arrested, and all this presupposes that he didn't kill himself. And this all presupposes that he's sitting in a court of law. They can literally kick their feet up, play chess if they want. They don't have to prove anything. But you're absolutely right. The state has the burden of proof to show that he committed the offense. If nothing ties him to it, OK, he walks free. We're already hearing a lot of things that suggest that he was likely the person who did this and most likely probably the person who did this to her."

They have done a huge disservice, again, assuming they knew, and helped him in any way, to both the family of Gabby Petito, to the law enforcement community, to all of us by not being forthright.

We're still awaiting word from the CDC how it will go on this whole vaccine booster push, whether you need a third shot, a second one, if you have had J&J's, although that is not part of this booster shot possibility. This is a Pfizer booster shot. The FDA said only those who might need it, like the elderly or those with compromised immune systems. We will get the read here whether the CDC agrees with that -- after this."

The CDC is now weighing that. The FDA has already decided, really, the only folks who might need this would be those who have compromised immune systems, or the elderly, or both.

And they will also decide when these booster shots would be administered. The CDC panel of doctors and experts will also meet tomorrow and are expected to decide on the COVID-19 booster policy in this country. But the CDC has to wait for the Food and Drug Administration to sign off on its advisory committee's recommendation first. On Friday, an FDA advisory committee of experts overwhelmingly voted against booster shots for everyone over the age of 16, instead voting unanimously to recommend a third booster shot just for those over the age of 65 and for those regardless of age who are at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms like the immunocompromised."

So they're going to play with each other. And if a parent is infected and infects a child, that child will infect the other children. Vaccines and children go back to polio and influenza. And that's a population that we have always protected. And it's a myth to think that children don't get infected. They do. About 20 percent of children who get COVID wind up in the hospital.

It's a failure on their part to secure the border. And that's why the state of Texas has stepped in. Governor Abbott has stepped in. He launched Operation Lone Star, which is a initiative deploying state resources to the Southern border to secure the border. And with this current situation that took place this past week in Del Rio, we deployed hundreds, hundreds of troopers to this area.

Those are hardworking agents, and they do not need to be criticized for now, especially in this time of crisis. They need the support from the federal government. They're not getting the support. This is a clear example of why the morale is low and there's no support from the federal government, to criticize these agents for doing their job."

But they continue to work hard. And we're continuing to show support, and we're here to provide support for them. And this situation here could have been contained. It could have been under control from the beginning of this year. But the administration has failed to do its part to secure the border. So we stepped in. The state of Texas step in and we are securing the border at this time by containing this area.

So, right now, the call is not to have them dealt with in the United States, but in Mexico. But that is still happening, and where they go to the U.S. and it's settled there, ignoring this judge's order. What do you make of that?"

And if we didn't respond, if our DPS troopers did not respond, it would have been catastrophic. But that just goes to show you that the administration right now is not securing the border. And that is why Governor Abbott has launched this operation to secure the border. He has met with local officials. He has met with law enforcement to find out what the concerns are and find solutions."
