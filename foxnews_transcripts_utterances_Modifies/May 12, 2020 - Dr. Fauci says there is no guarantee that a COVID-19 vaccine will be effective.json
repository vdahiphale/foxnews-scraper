The scene right out of the White House as the president gets ready to meet with Republican senators to sort of sort out what Dr. Fauci was saying, because, late in the day, it did speed up some selling going on here, largely on concerns that maybe some states are not opening up as smoothly as they would like to see. And then we had Dr. Fauci saying that, while a vaccine would be promising down the road, it did not appear imminent.  This might have just been an excuse to sort of pounce, take some profits over what has been a nice run-up. And, again, in the scheme of things, the markets have come back enormously, but worries just the same that the course of this virus, and now a $3 trillion plan that will add to our debt in the House, that could complicate things and maybe the expense of things. There's so much to get into.  Let's go to John Roberts first at the White House on how all of this is sorting out at the White House there -- John.",

But the reopening does in some cases seem to be going slower than a lot of people would like. We're still seeing a lot of people out in the streets protesting against the slow reopening, saying that they want to get back to work. They're beginning to get worried that the job losses are not going to be temporary, they're going to become much more permanent. And now, of course, with the House looking at a stimulus package, the White House, when the president will be talking with members of the Senate this afternoon, will be looking at what could potentially go into a phase four, even though the White House says it has pushed the pause button on a fourth stimulus for now.   But the president has made it clear that any future stimulus would have to include massive infrastructure spending, tax breaks for certain industries, and a payroll tax cut for employees, so that, as they go back to work, they don't get that 6.2 percent taken off of their weekly paychecks. Here's what the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said about it just a little while ago:",

But now those numbers have been pushed back to sometime in August. The death toll continues to go up. So a lot of people, a lot of governors across the country are looking at this and saying, exactly how can we do this in a way that's safe?  But, at the same time, there's pressure building on the other side that every week you stay closed adds another crack in that dam, where the economy just starts to come apart. And nobody wants that to happen, because, as was pointed out today in that hearing, the consequences -- and again in the White House briefing, that the consequences of staying closed become more and more dire with every week that goes on.",

The average time that it takes is 10, 15, 20 years, because there are multiple steps, in addition to actually knowing that you have a vaccine that works, to getting that vaccine into the arms of people all around the world. Right now, there are multiple trials that are going on. There are multiple candidates. And I'm glad that Dr. Fauci is optimistic that at least one of them will pan out.  What we need to remember is that we don't exactly know if they're going to be 100 percent effective, meaning that, if you get vaccinated, if this actually provides full immunity or full protection. There's a lot of vaccines out there right now, including the flu shot, that does not provide 100 percent protection, as many people know. In addition, we will have to think about, do we need multiple doses? There are many vaccines that require not just one, but sometimes two or three vaccinations. That's going to make it a lot harder to ramp up and have enough so that people are protected. And, really, the biggest issue is not just the amazing feats of public health of making a vaccine, but producing it at scales that we're going to actually need. If you think about just giving it to health care providers all over the world, that's millions and millions of people already. How are we going to make sure we prioritize the most important groups, including health care providers, the elderly, people that are disproportionately impacted by this?

Certainly, there are small mutations, but none of them have been proven to do anything more than what we already know the virus does, which is infect a lot of people and kill a relatively small, but not insignificant, number of them, as we have seen here on the front lines in New York City.

Our new reality is going to be such that, even once we get this under control, we're not going to be able to have large gatherings, because we know that they're too risky. The difference between what we have seen in Wuhan and what we have seen in South Korea and what we're seeing here in a lot of states in the United States is that, there in South Korean and in China, they had basically broken transmission down to near none, meaning that there was very little community spread. We have a lot of states and communities that are reopening, despite the fact that spread is actually increasing, case numbers are actually increasing. This isn't due to just increased testing. It's due to the fact that there are just a lot of cases out there that we haven't identified. And each one of those cases that we don't identify has the potential of spreading the disease further to more people, who, again, if they don't get tested, are also likely to spread this along. Everyone wants to reopen. Public health professionals, epidemiologists, everyone wants to get back to have an economy that is that is running again.

They had set a deadline of 5:00 p.m. yesterday for Tesla to submit a safety plan. And a county official told us a short time ago -- quote -- \"The site- specific plan was submitted yesterday, and we're in the process of reviewing it.\" There has, as you might expect, been a lot of reaction Twitter. To those who support the quick reopening of America, Musk is a -- quote -- \"legend and a patriot.\" To others, seemingly more concerned about workers' health, he is -- quote -- \"another selfish billionaire.\" The president -- surprise, surprise -- weighed in too, writing -- quote -- \"California should let Tesla and Elon Musk open the plant now. It can be done fast and safely,\" to which Musk replied on Twitter: \"Thank you.\" County officials say they will update us and Tesla once they have reviewed Tesla's new safety plan, although Musk has made it abundantly clear he doesn't give a jot what they think.

And then we had Dr. Fauci saying that, while a vaccine would be promising down the road, it did not appear imminent. This might have just been an excuse to sort of pounce, take some profits over what has been a nice run-up. And, again, in the scheme of things, the markets have come back enormously, but worries just the same that the course of this virus, and now a $3 trillion plan that will add to our debt in the House, that could complicate things and maybe the expense of things.

But the reopening does in some cases seem to be going slower than a lot of people would like. We're still seeing a lot of people out in the streets protesting against the slow reopening, saying that they want to get back to work. They're beginning to get worried that the job losses are not going to be temporary, they're going to become much more permanent. And now, of course, with the House looking at a stimulus package, the White House, when the president will be talking with members of the Senate this afternoon, will be looking at what could potentially go into a phase four, even though the White House says it has pushed the pause button on a fourth stimulus for now. But the president has made it clear that any future stimulus would have to include massive infrastructure spending, tax breaks for certain industries, and a payroll tax cut for employees, so that, as they go back to work, they don't get that 6.2 percent taken off of their weekly paychecks."

But now those numbers have been pushed back to sometime in August. The death toll continues to go up. So a lot of people, a lot of governors across the country are looking at this and saying, exactly how can we do this in a way that's safe? But, at the same time, there's pressure building on the other side that every week you stay closed adds another crack in that dam, where the economy just starts to come apart.

That's going to hurt everybody, because everybody will freak out and say, oh, my God, we can't do this, close everything back down again. So, the president is watching this all very, very closely. And he is taking into account all of the advice of the scientific experts he has around him. But, then again, there's the political calculation, too, Neil, that the economy was his strongest point. It's in the dumper now. We're headed for unemployment that we haven't seen since the 1930s. And the president would like to staunch that bleeding before it gets any worse."

What we did was to use some good-old common sense. And in those locations where we needed to slow it down, people stayed home, people used masks. But we're opening it up again, probably more rapidly than the rest of the country is opening up. I think we're doing it in an appropriate fashion. Other states will have differing points of view.

They know that that's a nonstarter in the United States Senate. And they understand, at the same time, that they can't be talking about a $3 trillion bill without being able to justify it. We have already -- we have got over $2 trillion out there right now. Let's find out what's working and what's not.

Let's get the read on that from Dr. Craig Spencer, an Ebola survivor, I might add, New York City emergency physician. Doctor, very good to have you. What do you think of -- was there -- the worry that came out of those comments, was that justified, to you? I mean, the response was, on a lot of people, it was like a downer. It was a Debbie Downer. Was it?"

      "speaker": "DR. CRAIG SPENCER, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely justified. Look, the fastest that we have ever made a vaccine has been four years in the late 1960s for mumps. The average time that it takes is 10, 15, 20 years, because there are multiple steps, in addition to actually knowing that you have a vaccine that works, to getting that vaccine into the arms of people all around the world. Right now, there are multiple trials that are going on. There are multiple candidates. And I'm glad that Dr. Fauci is optimistic that at least one of them will pan out. What we need to remember is that we don't exactly know if they're going to be 100 percent effective, meaning that, if you get vaccinated, if this actually provides full immunity or full protection. There's a lot of vaccines out there right now, including the flu shot, that does not provide 100 percent protection, as many people know. In addition, we will have to think about, do we need multiple doses? There are many vaccines that require not just one, but sometimes two or three vaccinations. That's going to make it a lot harder to ramp up and have enough so that people are protected. And, really, the biggest issue is not just the amazing feats of public health of making a vaccine, but producing it at scales that we're going to actually need. If you think about just giving it to health care providers all over the world, that's millions and millions of people already. How are we going to make sure we prioritize the most important groups, including health care providers, the elderly, people that are disproportionately impacted by this? And how is everyone going to respond when they know that we have a vaccine, but we just don't have enough of it for every American and every person around the world?"

      "speaker": "SPENCER",
      "utterance": "Yes. There was that concern with Ebola. There's always this concern that keeps coming up that viruses mutate. Well, all viruses mutate all of the time. That's how viruses work. The question is, do they mutate and become something more dangerous and more infectious? We did not see that with Ebola, and we have not seen that with coronavirus. Certainly, there are small mutations, but none of them have been proven to do anything more than what we already know the virus does, which is infect a lot of people and kill a relatively small, but not insignificant, number of them, as we have seen here on the front lines in New York City. Changing viruses, mutations absolutely can make it harder to develop a treatment, depending on which type of treatment. Same for a vaccine. As of right now, what we're going to have to do is really throw all of our hats and all of our chips in the ring and hope that one of them is good, because we don't have really anything else, other than good, solid bread-and-butter public health, to tackle this outbreak, until we have a treatment, until we have a vaccine.

Where are you on this?"

Our new reality is going to be such that, even once we get this under control, we're not going to be able to have large gatherings, because we know that they're too risky. The difference between what we have seen in Wuhan and what we have seen in South Korea and what we're seeing here in a lot of states in the United States is that, there in South Korean and in China, they had basically broken transmission down to near none, meaning that there was very little community spread. We have a lot of states and communities that are reopening, despite the fact that spread is actually increasing, case numbers are actually increasing. This isn't due to just increased testing. It's due to the fact that there are just a lot of cases out there that we haven't identified. And each one of those cases that we don't identify has the potential of spreading the disease further to more people, who, again, if they don't get tested, are also likely to spread this along. Everyone wants to reopen. Public health professionals, epidemiologists, everyone wants to get back to have an economy that is that is running again. We know the impact this is having on not just COVID patients, but on non-coronavirus, non-COVID patients."

Three-and-a-quarter-percent on a 30-year, 2.75 on a 15-year. A lot of places, you can do better than that. Here's the problem, though. A lot of people can't take advantage, because, A, many of them are behind on their mortgage payments right now. And, B, a lot of them lost their jobs, hoping to get them back when, well, we all get back to work. They hope they get back to work. Jay Farner on that conundrum. He is the Quicken Loans CEO.

But it's something to be concerned about. And you referenced, why not -- why the entire population isn't taking advantage of low rates. I will throw out a third, which is capacity. So we have seen our growth occur in the last 60 days. We have gone up 200 percent. Meanwhile, in the overall market, it's down 20 percent. And I think that's a function not everybody being able to process, underwrite and close these loans.

But, to your point, right now, supply is low. We think, as you were talking about states coming back online, we get into June here, we will see supply increase and balance out. And so prices haven't dropped yet. Now, if you watch what Fannie or Freddie are saying, they think we might see a dip in mortgage applications later in the year. Of course, that could put a bit of a damper on prices. But, right now, we're not seeing a drop in home prices at all."

Where do you see it going once -- and we hope soon -- the whole country is kind of back? What do you think?"

      "speaker": "FARNER",

People are being cautious and thoughtful. But we're also seeing a strong demand for homeownership. I think that's been just based on the last 60 or 90 days of people focusing on their home, living in their home, recognizing the importance it plays in their lives. And so it'll be interesting to see how that focus and desire to be a homeowner balances out with the unemployment rate hopefully dropping as we start seeing these -- these businesses come back online, and we will see people regain their jobs. And I think that's why people continue to make their mortgage payments. Even though they're uncertain about their future, they're hopeful they will be back to work soon. In our state, of course, construction has turned back on. A lot of medical is turned back on. And so we're crossing our fingers, hoping that that will keep going, and we will have a strong low interest rate, but also a strong homebuying season."

If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.\" Arrests have not happened, and they seem unlikely to. As Tesla employees streamed into work this morning, the county sheriff said it was up to the Fremont police. The Fremont police said it was up to county health officials. They had set a deadline of 5:00 p.m. yesterday for Tesla to submit a safety plan. And a county official told us a short time ago -- quote -- \"The site- specific plan was submitted yesterday, and we're in the process of reviewing it.\" There has, as you might expect, been a lot of reaction Twitter. To those who support the quick reopening of America, Musk is a -- quote -- \"legend and a patriot.\" To others, seemingly more concerned about workers' health, he is -- quote -- \"another selfish billionaire.\" The president -- surprise, surprise -- weighed in too, writing -- quote -- \"California should let Tesla and Elon Musk open the plant now. It can be done fast and safely,\" to which Musk replied on Twitter: \"Thank you.\" County officials say they will update us and Tesla once they have reviewed Tesla's new safety plan, although Musk has made it abundantly clear he doesn't give a jot what they think.

And those companies that are open are probably at 25 percent of norm. So, this depression, as we're calling it now, is pretty deep, and it's pretty quick.

      "utterance": "Yes, unfortunately, everything -- all of these bailouts have to be much more prescriptive than just handing money out."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOLF",
      "utterance": "And we know that, right now, it's been done with a blunt instrument. The first few, you know, what I will call relief packages, we're getting money out as fast as we can. Look at the payroll protection act program. It only got to maybe 10 percent of small businesses. And, by the way, most of these businesses can't even open in time. So, we're not even sure how helpful that's going to be. So, we have to definitely change how we're handing out money. But, unfortunately, the pandemic is moving way too fast than we could have ever imagined, right? Twenty-five percent unemployment in six weeks. I mean, so just think about that. That hasn't happened since the 1930s. So I'm all for putting a few blunt instruments at work, like they did. But I think, going forward, we have to be much more thoughtful how we hand out the money, and we have to make sure that it's going to the right services."

So, we know that the bid offer is right now is zero, $3 trillion. I guarantee there will be a deal. It won't be $3 trillion, OK, but it will be a hell of a lot more than what zero is."

Robert Wolf, the former UBS Americas CEO and much, much more, certainly well-connected, actually to both parties, but particularly the Democratic Party. We have a lot more here. So many businesses are laying off. Isn't it refreshing to hear one that's bending over backwards not only to keep its workers, but hire thousands more? And times are not easy -- after this. Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers announcing plans to give back to its workers for their hard work throughout this, not laying off anyone. And now, now Todd Graves, the Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers CEO, is saying, you know what, I'm going to expand and hire some more people. Don't know how he's managing to do that in the middle of all this. Maybe he can explain. Todd, good to have you."

You could have joined all your food colleagues and just say, look, the well has run dry, my place is shut, I'd love to help you out, but that's it. You didn't do that. Why not?"

    {
      "speaker": "GRAVES",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, this is -- this is my baby. Raising Cane's, I started in 1996 after I commercial fished on Alaskan fishing boats to raise money for the first location. So, like, my crew is my family. And when we started tracking COVID spreading in China, we knew it was going to get bad and get bad in the U.S. And so I rallied the team to say, look, we don't know what to expect right now, but it's not going to be good. And our goal is to go into this, and we're going to save every crew member's job. And we rallied around the mantra of no crew left behind. And our teams went to work. And what we had to do was, using our drive-through format, we had to get really entrepreneurial and we had to get better at what we do. So our sales went down about 30 percent in the beginning, and -- once the stay-at-home mandate started. And when we have that, we're bleeding cash. We make small margins on very large volumes."

But we improved that by a minute by doing different methods, other -- other car stacks, three- car stacks, handhelds, moving through. And we also went up on order accuracy and customer satisfaction. So, boom, I'm excited for my crew. They're the ones that did it. And not only did -- were we able to save everybody's jobs by doing that. We were able to give them a $2 million bonus, because our crew actually took a little bit less hours, all of them, to save everybody's job. So I'm really proud of our team."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What I love about your team is, they're not judgmental. Like, when I go through the drive-through and say, all right, and get six large carton of chicken fingers, and they say, but there's only one person in the car, and I -- and I would always say, well, that's fine. Just load it up. But it's interesting too what you were mentioning here, because I was reading this about you, Todd. Very early on, you had an idea about this virus, that it wasn't just some limited, fleeting medical event. How did you know that? How did you get wind of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAVES",

      "utterance": "And then we also saw the Chinese government making people stay at home and doing mandates. So, when we did that, we immediately drew on our credit line and knew it was coming. And we knew it might be as bad as when the government wouldn't even let you out of your house. And that's what happened in China. And when we talked the last time after Hurricane Katrina and the levees broke, that taught me that many years ago, with only 28 locations, when 21 went down, to expect the unexpected and to really seriously prepare for the worst."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

So, it's literally from the beginning, down to me doing videos for my crew members that are going to them in text format, is, look, we have to be ready for this. But we're going to need everybody to stay safe. And, look, it started with me explaining what COVID was, what is this virus, what does it mean, how are we going to stay safe, and really being on the forefront. So I wouldn't cut commercials before the stay -- when I started hearing rumors about the stay-at-home mandates, just because we had to explain to our customers what an essential business was. Like, you can come to Raising Cane's, and we can safely serve you through our drive-throughs. And we just kind of got ahead of the curve. Look, when you're an entrepreneur and you have to scratch and fight and -- for everything you do to make your first business work, that doesn't leave you. And I think the businesses that have -- that have done well, and especially in my industry, have been very entrepreneurial. Look, Galatoire's is on..."

Of course, as you know, there are fewer flights going out there right now, but fewer flights also mean the possibility that some planes will be packed. We have seen images like this. United says it's now changing its policy because of people being outraged. They tweeted last night -- quote -- \"Starting next week, customers on flights that are expected to be closer to full capacity can rebook on a different flight or receive a travel credit. We will do our best reach out about 24 hours out.\" Now, meantime, the Department of Transportation is strongly reminding airlines that refunds for canceled flights are not an option."

All right, in the meantime, I should let you know that the airlines are now telling their crews, you don't have to force passengers to wear masks. It's required outside, getting on the plane. But, once inside, effectively, what the Americans and Deltas and Uniteds are saying is, you don't have to force the issue. Now, how that goes over on the plane with the others who do wear masks, and seeing someone else who is not wearing a mask, could be bedlam. But, anyway, that's the new policy, adding to the confusion. These are interesting times, my friends. Here comes \"THE FIVE.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.
