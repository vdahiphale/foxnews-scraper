So what we saw today was sort of a preemptive move. Now you have Jared Kushner supposedly out there trying to make a deal of some kind. We haven't seen much evidence of any progress, but what we have seen now is the president -- I think it's almost like a businessman he says, you know what, let's just shake it up.

And you've seen a very solid friendship and alliance between Netanyahu and President Trump that they work very well cooperatively. There's a lot of mutual respect there, which I think it's a healthy and good thing for the United States going forward. I take him at his word. I believe when he says that he's going to continue to try to broker a deal and work this out, but sometimes you need to broker a deal with a show of strength and a show of commitment.

I think our NATO allies and our Pacific partners have to look at this and say this is the president of the United States doing what he said he was going to do, and that has to make them feel more comfortable. And it is vintage Trump. He actually does what he says he's going to do, and then there's a bunch of hysteria. But the hysteria is not always as bad as it seems like it's going to be. I think he kind of relishes doing things that other presidents have said they're going to do or did or didn't do, whether it's the keystone pipeline, or cornering North Korea, or withdrawing from bad trade deals or treaties or something like that. I think he enjoys this. But you know what, Hamas says they're going to unleash hell and they're going to be a day of rage. If you're a terrorist, you're always raging as a terrorist.

And then you had this, I will just read it for you, Abbas said these condemned and unacceptable measures are a deliberate undermining of all efforts exerted to achieve peace and represent a declaration of the United States withdrawal from undertaking the role it has played over the past decades in sponsoring the peace process. So it could end up that the Palestinians should have taken the deals that were on the table in the last couple of decades.",

You have a Turkish spokesman saying this is a redline for the Muslims around the world, specifically in the Middle East. And so, you know, when you think about what's different here, it's not that the thought isn't -- is anything radically shifting from what Democrats and Republicans have said in the past. The difference is that you do it as separate, unilateral action apart from any larger negotiation. And so people are saying, well, what does this signal, what does this mean?  This week, I was out at the Reagan library and they had a defense forum. And so you have people like Leon Panetta, Michelle Flournoy, Mike Pompeo from CIA, even former secretary of state Schultz, and what they're saying is, look, Iran and Russia are moving into a power vacuum in the Middle East. You know you have Russia now a major ally of Syria and others. And we hear lots of talk from President Trump about, you know, we're going to be more emphatic, we're going to be more involved, but there's nothing on the ground. There's no actual policy. And so he makes this move that I think does please some part of his evangelical base, maybe some of the orthodox Jewish community in this country which votes Republican. But in terms of Israel, I don't know that all Israelis are in support of this because what they want is more security for their country.",

He hasn't talked to anybody. So basically, there's all these allegations swirling around, and they can't really defend themselves. Though I think one of the defenses that some people have pointed out is that when he found out about Strzok and his text messages, he was fired from the team. So he's probably irritated that his investigation has been tainted by somebody who did something before he even got there. But then I also think there's a question of, can you have personal opinions and still do a professional job in your career? So you said I'm the most fair and balanced person. So like, if we were talking about a pro-life issue, could I be fair and balanced, even though I have a personal point of view? I would like to try to be, but we all have these certain things that we might have texted to somebody. Like if I said to my husband how I felt about an issue, does that then become part of an investigation? I'm not sure. Here's the other thing, though. Chris Wray of the FBI, he's the new FBI director. He testifies tomorrow. So we might get more clarity on what happened if he happens to know.  But also, just remember, before he left, Comey said that the FBI is investigating ISIS in all 50 states. So having actually -- it's so irritating to me that people did this funny business that had a private email server, that Hillary Clinton did that. That Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner have to be investigated.

And let's face it, how many times have we been right versus the French? Trump expressed real leadership here. Remember, even environmentalists admit that the accord sucks. It takes $100 trillion -- funds that could wipe out global poverty, hunger and disease three times over -- to maybe affect a fraction of a degree over a century. It's murderous, callous virtue signaling. Worse, as Obama jokes, terrorist plot to kill England's prime minister. Terror, remember where there was an absence of leadership on that? That's the real lesson of 2016: a priority adjustment regarding global threats. Something France could use, too. That country has suffered from so many deadly terror attacks and yet here they chuckle with a guy who, after one attack, sent them James Taylor. But I guess in Obama's mind, ISIS was always JV and coal was always varsity. So you know, Dana, it strikes me that President Obama is kind of like one of those traveling comedians.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Today, President Trump made history with a dramatic shift of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. He forged ahead with his decision to declare Jerusalem, Israel's capital, despite objections from Arab, European, and other world leaders, and even the pope."

      "utterance": "We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. Old challenges demand new approaches. I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "President Trump stressed Israel as a sovereign nation with the right to determine its own capital. The president also ordered the state department to begin the process of moving our embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. In an attempt to ease concerns, Mr. Trump wanted Palestinians to know he still remains fully committed to helping broker a peace deal."

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",

The position of the United States now firmly ensconced in the promise that had been made for many years that the United States would make this recognition and finally today it happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Right. But, of course, part of that policy for the longest time, Dana, has been a two state solution. That we would in terms of final status, with regard to Jerusalem, have that as part of the negotiation, the ongoing negotiation. And the United States, even with people like Bill Clinton who were all about moving the capital said -- I'm sorry, the embassy, said very clearly that the reason they didn't do it was to preserve the United States as a fair and well-regarded arbiter on both sides by the Israelis and the Palestinians. So what we saw today was sort of a preemptive move. Now you have Jared Kushner supposedly out there trying to make a deal of some kind. We haven't seen much evidence of any progress, but what we have seen now is the president -- I think it's almost like a businessman he says, you know what, let's just shake it up. Let's put the Palestinians on notice. If you don't like the way things are going, well, then you better get back to the bargaining table."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "But he wasn't the only one, Kimberly, because the crown prince, now king, Salman of Saudi Arabia, called out -- the Palestinians and said - - you need to get on board with this. The president I think recognizes that in our capitals in these different countries they have to say what they're going to say for their domestic audiences. But this seems to be OK with the Saudi Arabians, and possible others for an anti-Iran alliance."

      "speaker": "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think so. And that's really, I think was, you know, behind this as well in large measure. But this is something that the president has been considering and contemplating for some time. There has been tremendous support from the Israeli community to do this, and for the president to make this move. And you've seen a very solid friendship and alliance between Netanyahu and President Trump that they work very well cooperatively. There's a lot of mutual respect there, which I think it's a healthy and good thing for the United States going forward. I take him at his word. I believe when he says that he's going to continue to try to broker a deal and work this out, but sometimes you need to broker a deal with a show of strength and a show of commitment. And like I said, he's been saying he's going to do it, and now in fact he has."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "But Jerusalem was always like that piece that was going to be the final bargaining chip, but after several decades with nothing ever happening, then maybe this is actually is a way to get there.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So I think that's probably a pretty good deal right now. It's very symbolic. We have a great relationship with Israel. Our only real partner in democracy in the Middle East, and he fulfilled a campaign promise so I think his supporters are going to be happy about that. I think our NATO allies and our Pacific partners have to look at this and say this is the president of the United States doing what he said he was going to do, and that has to make them feel more comfortable. And it is vintage Trump. He actually does what he says he's going to do, and then there's a bunch of hysteria. But the hysteria is not always as bad as it seems like it's going to be. I think he kind of relishes doing things that other presidents have said they're going to do or did or didn't do, whether it's the keystone pipeline, or cornering North Korea, or withdrawing from bad trade deals or treaties or something like that. I think he enjoys this. But you know what, Hamas says they're going to unleash hell and they're going to be a day of rage. If you're a terrorist, you're always raging as a terrorist. So I don't really see that much happening. United States and Israel will be prepared for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Speaking of an ally, I want to get your take, Juan, on Turkey because they are -- Turkey is a part of NATO, but the president there came out very strongly against it and said there will be fire and fury, basically a take on what President Trump had said about North Korea. And then you had this, I will just read it for you, Abbas said these condemned and unacceptable measures are a deliberate undermining of all efforts exerted to achieve peace and represent a declaration of the United States withdrawal from undertaking the role it has played over the past decades in sponsoring the peace process. So it could end up that the Palestinians should have taken the deals that were on the table in the last couple of decades."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's what President Trump must be thinking. Again, you shake it up. But just to go back to what you were saying Turkey is our ally. You have a Turkish spokesman saying this is a redline for the Muslims around the world, specifically in the Middle East. And so, you know, when you think about what's different here, it's not that the thought isn't -- is anything radically shifting from what Democrats and Republicans have said in the past. The difference is that you do it as separate, unilateral action apart from any larger negotiation. And so people are saying, well, what does this signal, what does this mean? This week, I was out at the Reagan library and they had a defense forum. And so you have people like Leon Panetta, Michelle Flournoy, Mike Pompeo from CIA, even former secretary of state Schultz, and what they're saying is, look, Iran and Russia are moving into a power vacuum in the Middle East. You know you have Russia now a major ally of Syria and others. And we hear lots of talk from President Trump about, you know, we're going to be more emphatic, we're going to be more involved, but there's nothing on the ground. There's no actual policy. And so he makes this move that I think does please some part of his evangelical base, maybe some of the orthodox Jewish community in this country which votes Republican. But in terms of Israel, I don't know that all Israelis are in support of this because what they want is more security for their country."
    },

      "speaker": "PERINO",

He said I cannot remain silent about my deep concern for the situation that has developed in recent days, and at the same time I wish to make a heartfelt appeal to ensure that everyone is committed to respecting the status quo of the city in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations. But everybody spoke up before the president actually gave his speech, because he said he's OK with talking about the boundaries that they were discussed for East Jerusalem."

      "utterance": "I'm trying to maintain a level of politeness about the pope. You knew this was going to set me off. You did this on purpose.

I will play this sport so I don't have to listen to what the pope says. I don't care about what the pope says. I don't think he helps in this situation. I think he should just stay out of it.

I think, again, this was a bold and decisive, it's a historic moment. And, you know, Israel is a sovereign state and they have every right to be able to decide and choose where their capital is and where they want embassies to be. So I think the United States is respecting their sovereignty and their decision and their choice and honoring that."

So I also think that this spurs the Mideast peace process, whatever that means, Greg, because everything they did before by putting this on the table, the Jerusalem issue with everything else in the negotiation hadn't worked. So I think what the president is doing is say let's try something different, aka, in your words, shake it up. And this makes everybody reengage, makes both state come back to the table with a little more urgency. And I think that's good."

Meanwhile, Al Franken do to make a big announcement tomorrow following growing calls within his own party for him to resign. That comes -- that call includes party leader Chuck Schumer who just released a statement calling for Franken to, quote, step down immediately. What do you make of this, Greg?"

But I know two people that he's personally done this too. Two people that I have known for a while. So the idea that this person that is accusing him is creating this incident with easily discernible details. She was at his radio show. She was working for a congressperson, and she was gathering her stuff and he lunged at her. And he looks at this as some kind of offensive comedic gesture that's his kind of tradition."

      "utterance": "That's his shtick, I guess. But the thing is I think he has no idea how many times he's done this. And I think tomorrow is his last day. And I think one of the strategies here is that if he's gone and Moore is elected, then the Democrats can say that only the Republicans have sex pests. That the Democrats purge and the Republicans protect. I think that's going to be their strategy. It's not a dumb one."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

This is a big shift from what we've seen in the last week. What do you make of it?"

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It was about time. I think the ladies had heard enough. They probably had enough when they saw the picture of him doing that. But the latest allegation where he goes in for the kiss, but the worst part was when she denied him. He said, I'm an entertainer. I'm entitled to do this. And that I think that sums this thing up perfectly because power is so intoxicating. And when you continue to get away with it without any consequences, you're emboldened. And when people surrounding you allow you to do it, it emboldens you even more. So that, with the me-too movement, I think -- you know, we were kind of joking around in the green room the other day about, you know, when are we going to see a backlash to this? Because people are now talking about this and, you know, we were talking about -- when women sometimes make a joke about a man, are they going to be held to the same standard men are held to? Are we now going to see next possibly a woman being accused of sexually harassing a guy?"

So to me, it's not a surprise, especially given the cover of Time, the mood, the focus on these issues right now. It's very and -- you know, I guess it's resonating in terms of the public and you've seen it across all different professions. So I think that this is something that wasn't surprising, especially with a new accuser. And I think when you see Schumer as well calling for it, so let's see what happens. Tomorrow he's making an announcement."

I think that the king, Salman, of Saudi Arabia, he won the poll. He knows how many blocks voted. But I think this movement, obviously, is a big societal changing event, so I think that made sense. I think for Franken, the only way to make this end is if he resigns, for himself, for him and his family. I mean, there might be more accusers that come out, but he's putting his family through a lot. And now, Minnesota, the voters deserve better. So if he's going to resign, he might not wait until tomorrow. With Chuck Schumer coming out saying he wants it immediately might not wait till tomorrow."

What he was making people who worked for him to in order to have -- get this done, and they called it the complicity machine. It is worth reading. It's so chilling that someone would even think of that. And then, people who brought it up to H.R., they got fired. So I think that that problem is going to continue in the entertainment industry."

He hasn't talked to anybody. So basically, there's all these allegations swirling around, and they can't really defend themselves. Though I think one of the defenses that some people have pointed out is that when he found out about Strzok and his text messages, he was fired from the team. So he's probably irritated that his investigation has been tainted by somebody who did something before he even got there. But then I also think there's a question of, can you have personal opinions and still do a professional job in your career? So you said I'm the most fair and balanced person. So like, if we were talking about a pro-life issue, could I be fair and balanced, even though I have a personal point of view? I would like to try to be, but we all have these certain things that we might have texted to somebody. Like if I said to my husband how I felt about an issue, does that then become part of an investigation? I'm not sure. Here's the other thing, though. Chris Wray of the FBI, he's the new FBI director. He testifies tomorrow. So we might get more clarity on what happened if he happens to know. But also, just remember, before he left, Comey said that the FBI is investigating ISIS in all 50 states. So having actually -- it's so irritating to me that people did this funny business that had a private email server, that Hillary Clinton did that. That Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner have to be investigated. Like, we have serious problems, and we have the -- the FBI needs to be focused on those and not necessarily on people's shenanigans on texts."

This is a situation where, I think if you want to impugn people on the basis that they were texting or tweeting -- we discussed this yesterday -- during the presidential debate and telling their -- he was involved with a woman. He was telling the woman when he thinks. I don't see how that rules out this guy as a good investigator. And hopefully, Chris Wray, the FBI director, will make that claim.

It's always a good thing when you have transparency and illumination on issues like this to be able to see. I think it would only make the FBI stronger and better. And sometimes you need some shake up at the top to be able to rework the whole dynamic of an organization. And that's what I think we're going to see here. I do call into question, as a former prosecutor, then, the you know, credibility of some aspects of this investigation. I certainly want to hear more.

Actually, it's the opposite. Knowing you'll come off as the bad guy among our more sophisticated European peers and you still do it anyway, that's cool. And let's face it, how many times have we been right versus the French? Trump expressed real leadership here. Remember, even environmentalists admit that the accord sucks. It takes $100 trillion -- funds that could wipe out global poverty, hunger and disease three times over -- to maybe affect a fraction of a degree over a century. It's murderous, callous virtue signaling. Worse, as Obama jokes, terrorist plot to kill England's prime minister. Terror, remember where there was an absence of leadership on that? That's the real lesson of 2016: a priority adjustment regarding global threats. Something France could use, too. That country has suffered from so many deadly terror attacks and yet here they chuckle with a guy who, after one attack, sent them James Taylor. But I guess in Obama's mind, ISIS was always JV and coal was always varsity. So you know, Dana, it strikes me that President Obama is kind of like one of those traveling comedians. When he shows up at a place, he finds out where he's from, and he starts saying nice things about Cleveland or whatever. He's like this. He shows up, and he knows he can get a joke."

We're also going to talk about this -- the unusual case of Sam Seder, who's lost a contract at MSNBC over an ironic tweet. And MSNBC just acted like complete jackasses and let the guy go over over a tweet that was ironic and not sincere. We talk about that, as well. They should actually give him his job back. That's it."

So she used the word phat, \"P-H-A- T,\" and -- which is slang for excellent, Greg."
