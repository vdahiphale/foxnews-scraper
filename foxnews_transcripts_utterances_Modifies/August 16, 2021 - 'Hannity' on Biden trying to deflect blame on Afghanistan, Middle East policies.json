      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY. And tonight, Joe Biden has completely and totally, frankly, just humiliated the United States in the world stage, any confidence the world had in our country is now gone. Saigon Circa 1975 steroids. Former defense secretary and CIA director, Leon Panetta, rightly calling it -- yeah, Biden's Bay of Pigs. And thanks to the ill-fated actions of our derelict, low-functioning president, if you want to even say that, that's somewhat charitable -- the absolute worst case scenario has been playing out before our eyes. Biden ignoring the advice and the counsel of his top U.S. military commanders, they wanted the slow evacuation of U.S. troops based on conditions on the ground. He ignored the warnings from our intel on the ground, and now, Afghanistan has fallen to the Islamic extremists, the Taliban, in record time Kabul, oh, they just said last week, oh, it will be 90 days -- the earliest that they'll ever take over Kabul. It was overrun in a matter of hours. Taliban fighters, they're now in control of a massive stockpile, guess what, of Joe Biden U.S. taxpayer paid for weapons, ammo, vehicles, other supplies abandoned during Biden's hasty retreat. He wasn't even smart enough to take our munitions out. Terrorists from al Qaeda and ISIS, they were freed from multiple prisons all across this country. They soon will be plotting and planning their future terrorist attacks on all of the U.S. and the rest of the world fomenting terror. The American flag lowered over our embassy beyond humiliating, as diplomats hastily were evacuated by helicopter to the airport, the very thing Biden said wouldn't happen. This viewer warning, what you're about to see is incredibly graphic, but take a look at this horrific video. Earlier today, thousands of desperate Afghan citizens fleeing certain death at the hands of the Taliban now rushing to the tarmac of the airport trying to cling to a departing C-17 military plane some crushed under the wheels planes and others fell from the plane mid-air, you know, during its ascent, hoping they might be able to hang on and get out of there. Dozens of others desperately attempting to board any and all commercial planes parked on the runway, at least seven people died in the chaos. And tonight, as we speak there are approximately ten thousand Americans that are still at Kabul's international airport desperately attempting to flee the country. Joe, what are you doing? Six thousand U.S. soldiers now are in the process of re-entering Afghanistan taken over by the Taliban to try to now secure the airport to try and save Americans. Without a doubt, a complete total failure of leadership, planning and execution, and true to form as the disaster unfolded over the weekend, Joe Biden was nowhere to be found -- aside from this bizarre photo showing Joe all alone at Camp David crouching over an empty table during a Zoom call and we got nothing from Biden all weekend while this was unfolding in real time. His press secretary wasn't available to circle back on anything. Jen Paki, she was on vacation. If you wrote her, you got an auto reply from her email account reading, I will be out of the office from August the 25th to August the 22nd. Hope you're having a great vacation. The vice president, Kamala Harris, was also MIA. But today, well, finally, Joe Biden comes out of hiding for a very brief, scripted speech by his staff before headed back to vacation where he blamed everyone for this catastrophe but himself, but says the buck stops with him -- but I blame him, him, him and him. Take a look.",

The choice I had to make as your president was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban. So what's happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometime without trying to fight. I know there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghans civilians sooner. Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier.

Same with energy independence -- yeah, he took us away from that too, has no problem changing policies on everything. To recap, Biden blamed the Afghan people, the Afghan military, the Afghan president, the Afghan government and President Trump when all else fails because laughably claiming that the buck stops with him. Pretty spineless and pretty cowardly. And, of course, Biden took zero questions following those remarks. I'm sure he was too exhausted too much work spent a whole minutes and immediately returned to his vacation at Camp David for more R and R and ice cream with sprinkles on it. But let's be honest, this speech would not have happened today if not for the immense blowback from pretty much anyone with half a brain. Even Joe's protectors and the media mob could not ignore the full disaster that this is. Take a look.",

Now many are calling Biden's ill plan retreat worse than Saigon. The Biden administration is actually begging the Taliban - please, terrorists please? Please allow Americans to safely leave the country two decades after 9/11. Make no mistake: this is about so much more than just Afghanistan. The world is watching our allies and enemies alike. They are witnessing Joe Biden's pathetic weakness on the world stage it is humiliating and embarrassing for this country. Now, one of China's top newspapers, they're predicting that America will abandon Taiwan, just like they did Afghanistan and now openly planning a total reunification. Let me interpret that for you, Joe, that means a takeover of Taiwan. And meanwhile, Russia doesn't fear us either with all their cyber attacks. They don't respect us as well, and they're now supplying all the energy for all our Western European allies because you let it happen and you granted him a waiver while simultaneously firing American Keystone XL pipeline workers. Great job, Joe. And after Joe gifted them with the new pipeline, well, the U.S. has now endured a never-ending stream of Russian cyber attacks. The -- in Iran, we have the mullahs now continuing to enrich uranium at an accelerated pace. And, of course, Joe had the South Koreans give Iran $7 billion even after Joe attempted to bribe them with more international currency. In Afghanistan, we now have -- al Qaeda's safe haven is back. Biden's steadily destroying America's standing on the world stage and now Americans everywhere are left safe and less secure as they plot plan and scheme their next 9/11 attack on America. In his book, Obama's secretary of defense, Robert Gates, wrote that Biden had been wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. Remember, he didn't want to take out bin Laden. And according to \"Politico\", Biden's former boss, President Obama, even expressed a similar level of concern, telling a fellow Democrat, quote, don't underestimate Joe's ability to bleep things up. This is the difference, by the way, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. For all the snowflakes out there that got so -- oh, they got the vapors every time Donald Trump set out a mean tweet and everything. Well, they feared Trump. The world feared Trump. When Donald Trump gave a threat, they believed him. Biden, they know, is weak and not running the show. The world sees it. They're not influenced by America's media mob and propaganda outlets. America and the world deserves better. The world needs a strong America. Sadly, under our Biden, I fear this is only the beginning and it's only going to get worse. Here with the full report, FOX News contributor, investigative journalist, she has spent a lot of time there in Afghanistan, Sara Carter. You've been working the phones now for three straight days. You've been talking to key people that were providing very important intelligence and interpreters to our troops on the ground the whole time. Their lives are now in immediate danger.

I can't begin to stress to the American people and to the viewers the terror that is reaping through Kabul right now. I've been on the phone for the past three days with my friends I consider them friends. There are some of the interpreters that worked with our troops on the ground in Afghanistan. These are the people that stood by our troops, men like my husband who was wounded in Afghanistan in and lost his eyesight. They stood by them, they worked with them and they were promised that they would be brought back to the United States if something ever happened. Now, the Taliban, according to my sources, is walking door to door, pulling people out of homes. They actually have a mass lists and I know that some people are already on these lists that they are searching for. People in the United States are actually scrambling trying to get funding raised so that they can move some of these people outside of Afghanistan if the U.S. is incapable of doing so. Kabul itself is falling apart. Kandahar has already fallen apart. People that are in Kandahar and other provinces throughout Afghanistan can't even make their way to Kabul. I've been told tonight that the airport is being secured. It was unbelievable for so many people in our military to watch those runways and to see how insecure the airport was and for ten thousand Americans, their lives are in peril as well because we don't know which direction the Taliban is going to take. Mullah Baradar, he spoke today. He's the head of the Taliban and said it was so quick, they were able to enter Kabul without even a fight that he himself couldn't even believe it. I want you to listen to this phone conversation with one of my sources. I'm going to keep their names out of this for fear that their lives are already in danger. It could be in peril.

I can only imagine what military families are feeling tonight -- those that served multiple tours. Those that lost loved ones those that came home with extensive permanent injuries. Your take on all of this? LT. COL. OLIVER NORTH (RET), CO-AUTHOR \"WE DIDN'T FIGHT FOR SOCIALISM\": Well, this is Biden's biggest blunder. It's his Saigon moment. Since 2001 - - since you're talking about those who served there, more than 780,000 U.S. troops have been deployed to Afghanistan, more than 2,300 died and nearly 20,600 were wounded and we're still counting. There's more than 50,000 Afghan military and security personnel who've been killed since October 2001. Biden saying they didn't fight, he's dead wrong. This war has cost the United States more than a trillion dollars and ending America's longest war is the right thing to do. But doing the right thing the wrong way can result in the kinds of disaster we see being played out right now. In his speech today, he said that the goal 20 years ago is counter- terrorism and he's proud to have opposed the Bush and Obama surges. He claimed that he's going to stand by his decision that the buck stops here, plagiarizing Harry Truman. Over the horizon capabilities he says with air power can take care of things in counterterrorism, dead wrong. There's no search and rescue left for a downed pilot in Afghanistan or many of the other countries where we're doing those kinds of operations. God help those pilots. This is unfolded he said faster than we expected. Think carefully about what that means, Sean. It means they expected this kind of thing to happen eventually just not as fast, and he refused to take the very sage advice from the Pentagon and the CIA don't do it this way. The Afghan military was supposedly 300,000 well-equipped, not so. They started losing troops when he set a withdrawal date, and the Taliban does not have an air force, neither of course does the Afghan military because that air force has both fled and it's been grounded because they pulled out the very first things to go with the U.S. bases that's where they were maintaining those aircraft from. So he says it's wrong to order American troops to fight if Afghan troops won't fight they did fight until he announced the date of withdrawal, which should have been based on conditions on the ground, not date driven. This whole thing is a catastrophe of his making.",

The Trump plan was based -- going to be based on conditions on the ground, factor number one. Factor number two is Donald Trump was believed if Donald Trump made a threat they believed it because he had a track record, while ISIS grew under Biden and Obama, ISIS was systematically destroyed and defeated under Donald Trump.

We -- our greatest ally in that region was the former government of Afghanistan and what really concerns me going forward is that we used to own the battle space, and we had a sizable intelligence community footprint. So when we served our mission to find and fix those terrorists so we could detect and preempt threats, we had the kinetic capability to preempt them before they were visited on our shores. We don't have that anymore and the Taliban controls the country. So what I wanted to hear today and what I hope we hear soon from the obvious administration is, what's the plan to deal with those threats? We're a few weeks out from the 20th anniversary of 9/11, and irony of ironies we are at greater risk now from Afghanistan than we ever have been before.",

They're going -- what's going to happen to women and President George W. Bush was exactly right today to say that the greatest thing he fears is what's going to happen to young girls and to women. And as you may remember when Callista was the ambassador of the Vatican, she hosted a conference on religious liberty. We had a young woman from Iraq who had been captured by ISIS and had been basically passed around as a slave. That's the kind of stuff we're going to see in Afghanistan and it's sad, that not a single women's group on the left is up in arms over what's about to happen.",

China's mouthpiece newspaper, that's the communist Chinese, now suggesting that the U.S. will, in fact, abandon Taiwan after the Afghan collapse. I don't disagree with them, sadly. How long will it be before China capitalizes on this clear American weakness and the lack of American resolve and a cognitively, you know, pathetic president? Sadly, I think the Chinese have zero fear about taking over Taiwan with Joe Biden as president. Remember, our foreign adversaries, they're not exactly influenced by the media mob and big tech mob. They know that Biden is not up to this job. They know he's a cognitive mess. He's failing on policy, failing on facts, failing to even articulate a coherent vision on keeping America safe and secure, and he's too busy to get his ass out of the chair and get back to work this weekend or stay at work today. Here with reaction, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. You're on the intel community, Senator. I read -- I went back and looked at a lot of your tweets. You had -- you warned them this would fail.

What is the plan? And they arrogantly and they smugly ignored it. They ignored everyone who was warning them because they're the experts, they know everything, and now we've seen the consequences. There are two things now to keep in mind. Number one is Joe Biden was elected promising competence, the return on normalcy, the return of expertise to foreign policy, and we see that they can't even execute on something like this and ignore the people who know something about it. That does encourage people like China -- countries like China and other adversaries not just to go out and try to undermine confidence in America, but actually test America and think they can get away with it. And the other is something that the Pentagon's already saying and we've already been saying for close to nine months, the biggest problem here is going to be now that al Qaeda is coming back to Afghanistan, let there be no doubt. They are coming back. They will reconstitute. They will pose a threat again and this administration has no plan whatsoever to prevent that from happening.",

But, you know, Sean, what I have learned something quite significant tonight that is being left out of the narrative here as the Biden administration goes down this path, I was very shocked today when I heard Biden actually say these words in his press conference. He said the Afghan political leaders gave up and fled the country. And I couldn't believe it because I have been in touch with the vice president of Afghanistan and I know that days ago, he left the capital Kabul and went to the Panjshir Valley where he joined the son of Ahmed Shah Masood the very famous northern alliance commander and they are part of a resistance. They haven't surrendered. They haven't given up. And if you've been hearing the reports today about people going door to door at the Taliban hunting down the Afghan commandos and wondering what happened to the Afghan special operations forces and, you know, all the stories about everything collapsing -- well, many of them I am told are in the Panjshir Valley as part of the resistance. A lot of them hid. A lot of them hid their equipment. Many of them fought their way there some died along the way and they are dug into the Panjshir Valley where they plan to fight. They told me this evening when I was talking to them that the resistance is very strong, the morale is strong and that they will never bow to tyranny or terrorism that is backed by Pakistan and they will not dishonor the tens of thousands of their colleagues who died fighting to defend the Afghan republic which is something that they believe in.

And tonight, Joe Biden has completely and totally, frankly, just humiliated the United States in the world stage, any confidence the world had in our country is now gone. Saigon Circa 1975 steroids. Former defense secretary and CIA director, Leon Panetta, rightly calling it -- yeah, Biden's Bay of Pigs. And thanks to the ill-fated actions of our derelict, low-functioning president, if you want to even say that, that's somewhat charitable -- the absolute worst case scenario has been playing out before our eyes. Biden ignoring the advice and the counsel of his top U.S. military commanders, they wanted the slow evacuation of U.S. troops based on conditions on the ground. He ignored the warnings from our intel on the ground, and now, Afghanistan has fallen to the Islamic extremists, the Taliban, in record time Kabul, oh, they just said last week, oh, it will be 90 days -- the earliest that they'll ever take over Kabul. It was overrun in a matter of hours. Taliban fighters, they're now in control of a massive stockpile, guess what, of Joe Biden U.S. taxpayer paid for weapons, ammo, vehicles, other supplies abandoned during Biden's hasty retreat. He wasn't even smart enough to take our munitions out. Terrorists from al Qaeda and ISIS, they were freed from multiple prisons all across this country. They soon will be plotting and planning their future terrorist attacks on all of the U.S. and the rest of the world fomenting terror. The American flag lowered over our embassy beyond humiliating, as diplomats hastily were evacuated by helicopter to the airport, the very thing Biden said wouldn't happen. This viewer warning, what you're about to see is incredibly graphic, but take a look at this horrific video. Earlier today, thousands of desperate Afghan citizens fleeing certain death at the hands of the Taliban now rushing to the tarmac of the airport trying to cling to a departing C-17 military plane some crushed under the wheels planes and others fell from the plane mid-air, you know, during its ascent, hoping they might be able to hang on and get out of there. Dozens of others desperately attempting to board any and all commercial planes parked on the runway, at least seven people died in the chaos. And tonight, as we speak there are approximately ten thousand Americans that are still at Kabul's international airport desperately attempting to flee the country. Joe, what are you doing? Six thousand U.S. soldiers now are in the process of re-entering Afghanistan taken over by the Taliban to try to now secure the airport to try and save Americans. Without a doubt, a complete total failure of leadership, planning and execution, and true to form as the disaster unfolded over the weekend, Joe Biden was nowhere to be found -- aside from this bizarre photo showing Joe all alone at Camp David crouching over an empty table during a Zoom call and we got nothing from Biden all weekend while this was unfolding in real time. His press secretary wasn't available to circle back on anything. Jen Paki, she was on vacation. If you wrote her, you got an auto reply from her email account reading, I will be out of the office from August the 25th to August the 22nd. Hope you're having a great vacation. The vice president, Kamala Harris, was also MIA. But today, well, finally, Joe Biden comes out of hiding for a very brief, scripted speech by his staff before headed back to vacation where he blamed everyone for this catastrophe but himself, but says the buck stops with him -- but I blame him, him, him and him. Take a look."

      "utterance": "When I came into office, I inherited a deal that President Trump negotiated with the Taliban. The choice I had to make as your president was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban. So what's happened? Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometime without trying to fight. I know there are concerns about why we did not begin evacuating Afghans civilians sooner. Part of the answer is some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier. I am president of the United States of America and the buck stops with me."

Trump that stopped catch and release now is Joe Biden's process and release, in the middle of a pandemic, without vaccine passports, vaccine mandates, mask mandates and just send people all over the country? Same with energy independence -- yeah, he took us away from that too, has no problem changing policies on everything. To recap, Biden blamed the Afghan people, the Afghan military, the Afghan president, the Afghan government and President Trump when all else fails because laughably claiming that the buck stops with him. Pretty spineless and pretty cowardly. And, of course, Biden took zero questions following those remarks. I'm sure he was too exhausted too much work spent a whole minutes and immediately returned to his vacation at Camp David for more R and R and ice cream with sprinkles on it. But let's be honest, this speech would not have happened today if not for the immense blowback from pretty much anyone with half a brain. Even Joe's protectors and the media mob could not ignore the full disaster that this is. Take a look."

In June, Biden's secretary of state, this guy's a total idiot, Tony Blinken, the guy that sucked up to China and took lectures on human rights from them, as the Chinese are now threatening our military bases day in and day out, they don't say a word.

They are witnessing Joe Biden's pathetic weakness on the world stage it is humiliating and embarrassing for this country. Now, one of China's top newspapers, they're predicting that America will abandon Taiwan, just like they did Afghanistan and now openly planning a total reunification. Let me interpret that for you, Joe, that means a takeover of Taiwan. And meanwhile, Russia doesn't fear us either with all their cyber attacks. They don't respect us as well, and they're now supplying all the energy for all our Western European allies because you let it happen and you granted him a waiver while simultaneously firing American Keystone XL pipeline workers. Great job, Joe. And after Joe gifted them with the new pipeline, well, the U.S. has now endured a never-ending stream of Russian cyber attacks. The -- in Iran, we have the mullahs now continuing to enrich uranium at an accelerated pace. And, of course, Joe had the South Koreans give Iran $7 billion even after Joe attempted to bribe them with more international currency. In Afghanistan, we now have -- al Qaeda's safe haven is back. Biden's steadily destroying America's standing on the world stage and now Americans everywhere are left safe and less secure as they plot plan and scheme their next 9/11 attack on America. In his book, Obama's secretary of defense, Robert Gates, wrote that Biden had been wrong on nearly every single major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. Remember, he didn't want to take out bin Laden. And according to \"Politico\", Biden's former boss, President Obama, even expressed a similar level of concern, telling a fellow Democrat, quote, don't underestimate Joe's ability to bleep things up. This is the difference, by the way, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. For all the snowflakes out there that got so -- oh, they got the vapors every time Donald Trump set out a mean tweet and everything. Well, they feared Trump. The world feared Trump. When Donald Trump gave a threat, they believed him. Biden, they know, is weak and not running the show. The world sees it. They're not influenced by America's media mob and propaganda outlets. America and the world deserves better. The world needs a strong America. Sadly, under our Biden, I fear this is only the beginning and it's only going to get worse. Here with the full report, FOX News contributor, investigative journalist, she has spent a lot of time there in Afghanistan, Sara Carter. You've been working the phones now for three straight days.

I can't begin to stress to the American people and to the viewers the terror that is reaping through Kabul right now. I've been on the phone for the past three days with my friends I consider them friends. There are some of the interpreters that worked with our troops on the ground in Afghanistan. These are the people that stood by our troops, men like my husband who was wounded in Afghanistan in and lost his eyesight. They stood by them, they worked with them and they were promised that they would be brought back to the United States if something ever happened. Now, the Taliban, according to my sources, is walking door to door, pulling people out of homes. They actually have a mass lists and I know that some people are already on these lists that they are searching for. People in the United States are actually scrambling trying to get funding raised so that they can move some of these people outside of Afghanistan if the U.S. is incapable of doing so. Kabul itself is falling apart. Kandahar has already fallen apart. People that are in Kandahar and other provinces throughout Afghanistan can't even make their way to Kabul. I've been told tonight that the airport is being secured. It was unbelievable for so many people in our military to watch those runways and to see how insecure the airport was and for ten thousand Americans, their lives are in peril as well because we don't know which direction the Taliban is going to take. Mullah Baradar, he spoke today. He's the head of the Taliban and said it was so quick, they were able to enter Kabul without even a fight that he himself couldn't even believe it. I want you to listen to this phone conversation with one of my sources. I'm going to keep their names out of this for fear that their lives are already in danger. It could be in peril. But listen to this conversation we had when the Taliban first entered."

I can only imagine what military families are feeling tonight -- those that served multiple tours. Those that lost loved ones those that came home with extensive permanent injuries. Your take on all of this? LT. COL. OLIVER NORTH (RET), CO-AUTHOR \"WE DIDN'T FIGHT FOR SOCIALISM\": Well, this is Biden's biggest blunder. It's his Saigon moment. Since 2001 - - since you're talking about those who served there, more than 780,000 U.S. troops have been deployed to Afghanistan, more than 2,300 died and nearly 20,600 were wounded and we're still counting. There's more than 50,000 Afghan military and security personnel who've been killed since October 2001. Biden saying they didn't fight, he's dead wrong. This war has cost the United States more than a trillion dollars and ending America's longest war is the right thing to do. But doing the right thing the wrong way can result in the kinds of disaster we see being played out right now. In his speech today, he said that the goal 20 years ago is counter- terrorism and he's proud to have opposed the Bush and Obama surges. He claimed that he's going to stand by his decision that the buck stops here, plagiarizing Harry Truman. Over the horizon capabilities he says with air power can take care of things in counterterrorism, dead wrong. There's no search and rescue left for a downed pilot in Afghanistan or many of the other countries where we're doing those kinds of operations. God help those pilots. This is unfolded he said faster than we expected. Think carefully about what that means, Sean. It means they expected this kind of thing to happen eventually just not as fast, and he refused to take the very sage advice from the Pentagon and the CIA don't do it this way. The Afghan military was supposedly 300,000 well-equipped, not so. They started losing troops when he set a withdrawal date, and the Taliban does not have an air force, neither of course does the Afghan military because that air force has both fled and it's been grounded because they pulled out the very first things to go with the U.S. bases that's where they were maintaining those aircraft from. So he says it's wrong to order American troops to fight if Afghan troops won't fight they did fight until he announced the date of withdrawal, which should have been based on conditions on the ground, not date driven. This whole thing is a catastrophe of his making."

And now, former CIA station chief, Dan Hoffman, former speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, both FOX News contributors. Mr. Speaker, there is a clear distinction. Ollie North touched on it. The Trump plan was based -- going to be based on conditions on the ground, factor number one. Factor number two is Donald Trump was believed if Donald Trump made a threat they believed it because he had a track record, while ISIS grew under Biden and Obama, ISIS was systematically destroyed and defeated under Donald Trump. He said it, he did it and the Taliban knew damn well what would happen if in fact they didn't abide by any agreement that went on. They wouldn't have tried this under Trump would be my argument. Your thoughts?"

I mean, I watched a speech this afternoon, and I thought, if you -- for most people, if you took what you were seeing live coming out of Afghanistan, the crowds, the fear, the takeover by the Taliban and then you looked at this speech by this guy who was clearly totally out of it, he has no idea what's going on and his number one goal in that speech was to blame anybody else. He said, you know, the buck stops here, he didn't mean that. The buck stopped with the Afghan army. The buck stopped with Donald Trump. The buck stops somewhere else. But the fact is this is a major American defeat. It's going to have huge consequences. As you pointed out earlier, it's going to embolden the Chinese, whether it's in Taiwan or the South China Sea or frankly they're going to become allies of the Taliban, because they want the minerals in which northern Afghanistan is enormously rich and they're going to be quite happy.

Well, that ignored the reality that China and Russia -- not to mention Iran and Pakistan -- are going to support the Taliban. We -- our greatest ally in that region was the former government of Afghanistan and what really concerns me going forward is that we used to own the battle space, and we had a sizable intelligence community footprint. So when we served our mission to find and fix those terrorists so we could detect and preempt threats, we had the kinetic capability to preempt them before they were visited on our shores. We don't have that anymore and the Taliban controls the country. So what I wanted to hear today and what I hope we hear soon from the obvious administration is, what's the plan to deal with those threats? We're a few weeks out from the 20th anniversary of 9/11, and irony of ironies we are at greater risk now from Afghanistan than we ever have been before."

But it's very disturbing that apparently administration announced yesterday, Americans wouldn't be automatically given any kind of priority, which is the opposite of the policy we've always had up until now. But, you know, I think there's a deeper thing here. The Taliban has been around for a long time. They've had a set of goals. They are a religious fanatic group. They're going -- what's going to happen to women and President George W. Bush was exactly right today to say that the greatest thing he fears is what's going to happen to young girls and to women. And as you may remember when Callista was the ambassador of the Vatican, she hosted a conference on religious liberty. We had a young woman from Iraq who had been captured by ISIS and had been basically passed around as a slave. That's the kind of stuff we're going to see in Afghanistan and it's sad, that not a single women's group on the left is up in arms over what's about to happen."

China's mouthpiece newspaper, that's the communist Chinese, now suggesting that the U.S. will, in fact, abandon Taiwan after the Afghan collapse. I don't disagree with them, sadly. How long will it be before China capitalizes on this clear American weakness and the lack of American resolve and a cognitively, you know, pathetic president? Sadly, I think the Chinese have zero fear about taking over Taiwan with Joe Biden as president. Remember, our foreign adversaries, they're not exactly influenced by the media mob and big tech mob. They know that Biden is not up to this job. They know he's a cognitive mess. He's failing on policy, failing on facts, failing to even articulate a coherent vision on keeping America safe and secure, and he's too busy to get his ass out of the chair and get back to work this weekend or stay at work today. Here with reaction, Florida Senator Marco Rubio. You're on the intel community, Senator. I read -- I went back and looked at a lot of your tweets. You had -- you warned them this would fail.

What is the plan? And they arrogantly and they smugly ignored it. They ignored everyone who was warning them because they're the experts, they know everything, and now we've seen the consequences. There are two things now to keep in mind. Number one is Joe Biden was elected promising competence, the return on normalcy, the return of expertise to foreign policy, and we see that they can't even execute on something like this and ignore the people who know something about it. That does encourage people like China -- countries like China and other adversaries not just to go out and try to undermine confidence in America, but actually test America and think they can get away with it. And the other is something that the Pentagon's already saying and we've already been saying for close to nine months, the biggest problem here is going to be now that al Qaeda is coming back to Afghanistan, let there be no doubt. They are coming back. They will reconstitute. They will pose a threat again and this administration has no plan whatsoever to prevent that from happening."

And the first female mayor in Afghanistan says she is a sitting duck and is just waiting for the Taliban to come and kill her. Remember under the Taliban's rule in the past, girls were prevented from going to school, prevented from appearing in public without being fully covered, meaning their face and having a male relative with them or going to work. There are also restrictions on what health care they could receive, what types of transportation they could take and they were severely limited on when and where and if they could even work and were even subjected to forced marriages abuse and rape and those who broke the rules -- well, they face public flogging and even execution. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Lara Trump, along with FOX Nation host Lara Logan, her show \"Lara Logan Has No Agenda: 21st Century Terrorism Revealed\" airs at 10:00 p.m. right here on Sunday on the FOX News Channel and on foxnation.com Well, Lara Trump, I'll start with you. We know what life was like for women under the Taliban last time. Why would we expect any different here?"

      "utterance": "Well, I don't think we should. I think it's going to be a horrible situation for women and for girls in Afghanistan going forward now. You just detailed some of the horrific things that happened in the past. Women were not able to be educated. They were not able to work. They had to be fully clothed, only their eyes being able to be seen. On public, they had to have a male escort and if not, then they were publicly beaten or executed. I saw a video earlier, Sean, of a young woman, she posted it on social media from Afghanistan hysterically crying. I think she was 12 or 13 years old saying, I know what awaits me, and I am terrified for my future. So I'd like to know where are all the Me Too folks, where are all the Hollywood elites, all the liberals who cry out and say that they support women, they're for women's rights. This is a disgusting abuse of women's rights that we are seeing happen take place before our very eyes and one person holds -- is the reason that this is happening right now. It is President Joe Biden. It is shameful what is happening over in Afghanistan and probably, sadly, what is to come for these women."

      "utterance": "Lara Logan, you've been in many a war zone. The difference I see is that the Taliban, they feared Trump and they believe Trump. They believe what he said he would do. They watched him wipe out the caliphate here. You know what life is like for women in the past under Taliban rule. Am I wrong in my descriptions in any way?"

    {
      "speaker": "LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST",
      "utterance": "No, you're not wrong in your description in any way, but you know, Trump fell into the trap. He was so much under siege that his very first national security announcement, you know, on the Afghan-Pakistan region was the first of its kind, to point the finger at Pakistan and actually detail action that they were going to take. But it was never enacted because that administration was prevented from functioning, you know, from within. It was constantly under attack and being undermined. But, you know, Sean, what I have learned something quite significant tonight that is being left out of the narrative here as the Biden administration goes down this path, I was very shocked today when I heard Biden actually say these words in his press conference. He said the Afghan political leaders gave up and fled the country. And I couldn't believe it because I have been in touch with the vice president of Afghanistan and I know that days ago, he left the capital Kabul and went to the Panjshir Valley where he joined the son of Ahmed Shah Masood the very famous northern alliance commander and they are part of a resistance. They haven't surrendered. They haven't given up. And if you've been hearing the reports today about people going door to door at the Taliban hunting down the Afghan commandos and wondering what happened to the Afghan special operations forces and, you know, all the stories about everything collapsing -- well, many of them I am told are in the Panjshir Valley as part of the resistance. A lot of them hid. A lot of them hid their equipment. Many of them fought their way there some died along the way and they are dug into the Panjshir Valley where they plan to fight. They told me this evening when I was talking to them that the resistance is very strong, the morale is strong and that they will never bow to tyranny or terrorism that is backed by Pakistan and they will not dishonor the tens of thousands of their colleagues who died fighting to defend the Afghan republic which is something that they believe in. And, you know, so it's really quite shocking that the Biden administration is pushing these ideas that no one in Afghanistan would fight and also the idea that, you know, Americans are doing the Afghans a favor."

They got an air force, that this will never happen. What we saw unfold here, even as late as last week, they were saying, well, no, no, the earliest they could even get close to Kabul you know three, four or five months down the road. How could they be that wrong?"

      "speaker": "LOGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I will tell you I was speaking to people who were in Kabul at the time. On the Afghan side, on the intelligence side, on the American side, active duty people and retired people, contractors and everybody universally said that what you're looking at now is what would happen, except for one or two, you know, who were buried deep in trying to salvage this. And why? Because the Biden administration -- you know, going back to Obama do you remember when Obama told the Taliban and everyone in the rest of the world that the U.S. was leaving, it was done it was over and you know the U.S. was gone. And so, it was really never -- it was just a question of time from that moment on. Plus, they told the Taliban the withdrawal. They told them what they were doing, where they were. I mean, there were many signs -- I don't believe for a second that U.S. intelligence didn't know that she was coming. I think that all of that is fundamentally dishonest."

Robert Gates, the Obama-Biden defense secretary, told us a long time ago, Joe Biden had been on the wrong side of every foreign policy decision he had ever made.

      "utterance": "Now, Republicans tonight, they want answers for how the Biden administration could have gotten this so wrong and embarrassed our great country so badly and what it means for the future. And just breaking moments ago, Vice President Kamala Harris, oh, she finally woke up from a weekend nap, tweeting, quote: For two decades, our courageous service members put their lives on the line in Afghanistan. We will always be grateful and proud. Ending U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan is the right decision. Here with reaction, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul and Michael Waltz, who himself served in Afghanistan. Okay, Michael Waltz, the only problem is nobody -- nobody wants these never-ending wars. There's a right way and a wrong way to get out. One right way is not to leave your munitions, not to leave, you know, multimillion dollar Humvees all over the place and other military caches, et cetera. And it would have been smart to listen to our own intel committees that told them it would happen if they did it this way."

      "utterance": "Yeah, that's right, Sean. This is one of the greatest disasters in modern American history. This is a disaster on humanitarian grounds for women and minorities. It's a disaster for our credibility. Can you imagine what people in Taiwan or Ukraine are thinking right now watching this unfold? And the biggest thing, Sean, it's a disaster for our counterterrorism. America is less safe. Al Qaeda 3.0 will come roaring back. Al Qaeda and the Taliban are absolutely married at the hip. But this time when we go back in, the Taliban are going to be better armed with taxpayer-funded equipment. We have no bases in the region and we have no local allies because they've all been hunted down. I want to see resignations. Blinken and Austin and Biden all presided over the reckless withdrawal from Iraq that led to the rise of the ISIS caliphate and attacks all over the United States. But here's the thing, Sean, I'm not going to wait for another 9/11 or Pulse nightclub. We all remember Charlie Wilson's war. We need to take a page out of his playbook. Congress had to force Biden to take care of our interpreters. We need to force him to support pockets of resistance. Lara is right. They exist. I've been in touch with them -- that are willing to continue the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda. We can't wait for another 9/11 as we roll into the 20th anniversary of 9/11/2001. And, Congressman McCaul, I -- we have 10,000 Americans there, never mind the interpreters which we actually did as Sara Carter reported promised that we would get them out if it ever came to this. Well, their lives are now in peril tonight."

      "utterance": "Right, this is a stain on the presidency. I believe he has blood on his hands. When we got to word of this decision, we kept repeatedly warning the administration, you have to get these interpreters or Afghan partners out of there. They waited until the very last minute and now this rushed to the airport to get them out and now we don't even have planes leaving the airport. Now, they're going to be left behind, Sean, and as Michael Waltz notes, they're going to be slaughtered by the Taliban. This president didn't listen to his generals. He didn't listen to the intelligence community. The IC assessment was very grim, Sean, going back to May, that, you know, within months, the Taliban was going to take it over, the conditions would deteriorate and that's exactly what happened. But yet he disregarded that, listen to the State Department, his politicos in the White House, who told him that, oh, we can get this deal with the Taliban struck in Doha. Guess what? It didn't work. He can't strike a deal with the Taliban. What I what I really despise most, Sean, is in the speech this afternoon about blaming everybody but himself, including former President Trump."
