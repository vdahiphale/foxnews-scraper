      "speaker": "KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "sentences": "Hey guys, welcome to Timpf. Yes. It's been about a month since I hosted last time and the reviews were amazing. I couldn't even walk down the street without being accosted by the fans. OK. They were vagrants who live under the bridge near my apartment. That reminds me that we should talk about fentanyl. First of all. Yes, it is the reason that Greg is out. I promised him I wouldn't say anything, but I feel like it's fine to lie to your boss who accuses you of doing drugs every day. But more importantly, I want to talk about why fentanyl is a huge problem and why the government can't be the one to solve it. Lately, there's been a lot of talk about classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction or drug cartels as terrorist organizations or any sale of fentanyl resulting in a fatal overdose as a federal crime worthy of the death penalty. But like that, Lord of the Rings prequels show, all of it is a bad idea. Oh, don't (INAUDIBLE) me nerds. You, even you know it (BLEEP) It's not that I think fentanyl poisoning is not a threat. And I do say poisoning because many of the people who have died from fentanyl didn't tend to take fentanyl at all. It's not like people are toasting with it at weddings or serving it at (INAUDIBLE) A 2015 study in the harbor reduction Journal found that 73 percent of heroin users who tested positive for fentanyl didn't even know they've been using fentanyl. It's not just heroin users. It's been found in everything from pills to cocaine to MDMA. Fentanyl poisonings are a serious widespread problem. But just because the government passes some law, that doesn't mean it's going to help. Even if they give it a magical name like the no more fentanyl ever bill or the Inflation Reduction Act. Let's go Brandon, am I right? It had nothing to do with anything I'm talking about. It's what everybody clap for me. Thank you. I needed that. You don't know how much. OK. Anyway, the CDC's 2016 guidelines that were cracking down on opiate prescriptions were actually disastrous for chronic pain patients. A 2019. FDA study found that patients who abruptly stopped opiate prescriptions were associated with an increased risk of psychological distress and even suicide. The CDC has proposed loosening some of those guidelines which is a step in the right direction. A step -- people with chronic pain can only take by the way, if they have their prescriptions. Restricted opiate prescriptions also hasn't even reduced opiate deaths. Actually, it's made it worse, as opiate prescriptions have fallen, so called overdose fatalities have gone up. And much like Greg's forehead, it keeps getting higher. The consistent trend, we saw it in 2019. We saw it in 2020. Then last year, the deaths reached an all-time high of more than 100,000. I think that every adult should have the right to put whatever they want into their own body without risking going to prison for it. Whether it's taking drugs, or worse, eating nothing but Long John Silver's. And I know people say what about the children? But prohibition is also having deadly consequences for minors too. Joe Friedman, who's a UCLA researcher notes that while the number of fatal overdoses among adolescents doubled from 2019 to 2020, \"it appears that the rise in deaths was fueled not by greater numbers of teens using drugs, substance abuse in this age group actually went down during the pandemic, but by use of dangerous and highly potent forms of fentanyl.\" And as National Institute of Drug Abuse Director Dr. Nora Volkow points out, teens are not trying to do fentanyl on purpose. It's just that now, it's so common for any drug to be poisoned with it. Plus, it's not like drugs being illegal is the only reason most people decide to stay away from them. I don't do heroin or crack, regardless of what you may have heard from Greg.",

      "sentences": "Oh, miss that guy. I don't do drugs. And the reason I don't isn't because it's illegal or because it's hard to get. Finding crack in New York City is easier than finding Shaq in a crowd of kindergarteners. It's because I know I would probably love drugs, I would get addicted to drugs. And I haven't really seen it work out too well for anyone when that happens. The best case scenario probably is Hunter Biden. And my dad is slightly less influential than his dad is. You also don't have to agree with me on complete legalization to realize why the plan to designate cartels or drug dealers as terrorists is a really bad idea. Designating a new terrorist group would just give the government more expanded surveillance powers, more excuses to violate civil liberties. And anyone who's been paying attention knows that will definitely be abused. Just like how the Patriot Act was put in place with the promise of protecting us against another 9/11 but wound up violating the rights of everyone from Muslim Americans to parents who criticize their school boards. Plus, the more the government tries to crack down on smuggling, the more you actually push the black market towards fentanyl because its potency makes it easier to smuggle because you need smaller amounts. And it's also -- it's cheaper to produce the heroin is. The black market is going to look out for itself. It's going to do the things that make the most sense for its business model. And its business model has been really successful, far more so than Mary Kay. The makeup company, not my friend Mary Kay who does sell heroin. And he was actually far less annoying than anyone who does sell Mary Kay. Look, I know I might sound crazy to some of you, but honestly, nothing can be as crazy as continuing to do the same thing and to respond to a failed war on drugs by intensifying it.",

And it's horrifying. So the fact that teenagers right now are encountering one of every three counterfeit pill being laced with fentanyl means that they just are dabbling at a party. If -- right. If they -- if they want to take recreational use of opioids. I'm not condoning that. But I'm saying that the risks of death are multiplied by literally millions. Governor Abbott pointed out that in part of -- in his executive order, more Americans have died of fentanyl poisoning this past year alone than every global terrorist attack in the last 100 years. We are crying out for help and our government at the federal level is doing nothing. So him trying to designate them as terrorist organizations to me, just screams that, man, I need help because my president and this administration is doing nothing to stymie the cartels and stymie China from poisoning Americans especially our youth.",

A lot of it is well intentioned, Tom, like, you know, wanting to, for example, you know, put the death penalty for drug dealers until you realize that, you know, anyone connected to maybe an overdose, they make me less likely to go get help because they're worried about going to jail themselves.

And we know how it's getting in here. So, I don't care what you call them. But they're poisoning Americans. And the reason why I don't look at it the same way as a drug because -- and as you pointed out in your monologue, no one is going out on a fentanyl run. So it is being used as a poison, disguised to attack the weakest part of society. So it is a poisoning and again, just call it anthrax. And imagine we had one envelope of anthrax sent to the White House, and the entire world stopped. We literally have tons of anthrax being pushed through our border. So to me, I look at like an act of war. But the problem is, it's affecting the lowest point of our society. And until unfortunately, someone in the White House goes through fentanyl poisoning or losing a loved one then maybe they'll look at it as for what it is. So I look at it as a terrorist attack.

Sure, that seems as likely as Tyrus fitting into one of my little black dresses. I'm sorry.

Many women returning to the workplace are deciding to embrace their natural gray hair as a symbol of empowerment. I prefer collecting swords. With hair salons closed for months during the pandemic, women across the country let the silver shine through, perfect timing since their faces were already covered with useless masks, boo. And now many find that keeping it natural is liberate. Men prefer the time women thought wearing no bra was liberating. Many women still feel judged for exposing their gray roots or fear they'll be passed up for professional or romantic opportunities, romantic opportunities -- I'm going to start calling it that if they don't dye their hair. And while men and women both gray at the same rate, when it comes to how the salt and peppered sexes are treated, it's very black and white. Historically, graying men are described as wise, distinguish silver foxes, while women with gray hair are known as not bang-able anymore. But the gray scales seem to be tipping at least marginally in women's favor. Younger generations have started purposely coloring their hair gray as a fashion statement, proving that as long as you have a young pretty face and a sexy tight body, you can be hot no matter your hair color. So, maybe this new movement is the push women need to finally start going gray in the workplace. I wonder how that'll go.",

      "speaker": "KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Hey guys, welcome to Timpf. Yes. It's been about a month since I hosted last time and the reviews were amazing. I couldn't even walk down the street without being accosted by the fans. OK. They were vagrants who live under the bridge near my apartment. That reminds me that we should talk about fentanyl. First of all. Yes, it is the reason that Greg is out. I promised him I wouldn't say anything, but I feel like it's fine to lie to your boss who accuses you of doing drugs every day. But more importantly, I want to talk about why fentanyl is a huge problem and why the government can't be the one to solve it. Lately, there's been a lot of talk about classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction or drug cartels as terrorist organizations or any sale of fentanyl resulting in a fatal overdose as a federal crime worthy of the death penalty. But like that, Lord of the Rings prequels show, all of it is a bad idea. Oh, don't (INAUDIBLE) me nerds. You, even you know it (BLEEP) It's not that I think fentanyl poisoning is not a threat. And I do say poisoning because many of the people who have died from fentanyl didn't tend to take fentanyl at all. It's not like people are toasting with it at weddings or serving it at (INAUDIBLE) A 2015 study in the harbor reduction Journal found that 73 percent of heroin users who tested positive for fentanyl didn't even know they've been using fentanyl. It's not just heroin users. It's been found in everything from pills to cocaine to MDMA. Fentanyl poisonings are a serious widespread problem. But just because the government passes some law, that doesn't mean it's going to help. Even if they give it a magical name like the no more fentanyl ever bill or the Inflation Reduction Act. Let's go Brandon, am I right? It had nothing to do with anything I'm talking about. It's what everybody clap for me. Thank you. I needed that. You don't know how much. OK. Anyway, the CDC's 2016 guidelines that were cracking down on opiate prescriptions were actually disastrous for chronic pain patients. A 2019. FDA study found that patients who abruptly stopped opiate prescriptions were associated with an increased risk of psychological distress and even suicide. The CDC has proposed loosening some of those guidelines which is a step in the right direction. A step -- people with chronic pain can only take by the way, if they have their prescriptions. Restricted opiate prescriptions also hasn't even reduced opiate deaths. Actually, it's made it worse, as opiate prescriptions have fallen, so called overdose fatalities have gone up. And much like Greg's forehead, it keeps getting higher. The consistent trend, we saw it in 2019. We saw it in 2020. Then last year, the deaths reached an all-time high of more than 100,000. I think that every adult should have the right to put whatever they want into their own body without risking going to prison for it. Whether it's taking drugs, or worse, eating nothing but Long John Silver's. And I know people say what about the children? But prohibition is also having deadly consequences for minors too. Joe Friedman, who's a UCLA researcher notes that while the number of fatal overdoses among adolescents doubled from 2019 to 2020, \"it appears that the rise in deaths was fueled not by greater numbers of teens using drugs, substance abuse in this age group actually went down during the pandemic, but by use of dangerous and highly potent forms of fentanyl.\" And as National Institute of Drug Abuse Director Dr. Nora Volkow points out, teens are not trying to do fentanyl on purpose. It's just that now, it's so common for any drug to be poisoned with it. Plus, it's not like drugs being illegal is the only reason most people decide to stay away from them. I don't do heroin or crack, regardless of what you may have heard from Greg."

      "utterance": "Oh, miss that guy. I don't do drugs. And the reason I don't isn't because it's illegal or because it's hard to get. Finding crack in New York City is easier than finding Shaq in a crowd of kindergarteners. It's because I know I would probably love drugs, I would get addicted to drugs. And I haven't really seen it work out too well for anyone when that happens. The best case scenario probably is Hunter Biden. And my dad is slightly less influential than his dad is. You also don't have to agree with me on complete legalization to realize why the plan to designate cartels or drug dealers as terrorists is a really bad idea. Designating a new terrorist group would just give the government more expanded surveillance powers, more excuses to violate civil liberties. And anyone who's been paying attention knows that will definitely be abused. Just like how the Patriot Act was put in place with the promise of protecting us against another 9/11 but wound up violating the rights of everyone from Muslim Americans to parents who criticize their school boards. Plus, the more the government tries to crack down on smuggling, the more you actually push the black market towards fentanyl because its potency makes it easier to smuggle because you need smaller amounts. And it's also -- it's cheaper to produce the heroin is. The black market is going to look out for itself. It's going to do the things that make the most sense for its business model. And its business model has been really successful, far more so than Mary Kay. The makeup company, not my friend Mary Kay who does sell heroin. And he was actually far less annoying than anyone who does sell Mary Kay. Look, I know I might sound crazy to some of you, but honestly, nothing can be as crazy as continuing to do the same thing and to respond to a failed war on drugs by intensifying it."

To me it speaks to a governor that feels that his president has abdicated his entire duty to safeguard the citizens of the U.S. And all of your -- all of your stats that you said it's absolutely right. And it's horrifying. So the fact that teenagers right now are encountering one of every three counterfeit pill being laced with fentanyl means that they just are dabbling at a party. If -- right. If they -- if they want to take recreational use of opioids. I'm not condoning that. But I'm saying that the risks of death are multiplied by literally millions. Governor Abbott pointed out that in part of -- in his executive order, more Americans have died of fentanyl poisoning this past year alone than every global terrorist attack in the last 100 years. We are crying out for help and our government at the federal level is doing nothing. So him trying to designate them as terrorist organizations to me, just screams that, man, I need help because my president and this administration is doing nothing to stymie the cartels and stymie China from poisoning Americans especially our youth."

And then people tell me I was right. A lot of it is well intentioned, Tom, like, you know, wanting to, for example, you know, put the death penalty for drug dealers until you realize that, you know, anyone connected to maybe an overdose, they make me less likely to go get help because they're worried about going to jail themselves.

In general, but specifically with fentanyl, the other point to consider is we're letting China get away with murder, like we always do. OK? This stuff, the raw materials come from China, pass through Mexico, and then come across the border. The open border, so I don't see why we can't do something.

If we change the name to fentanyl to anthrax, everyone would be having a heart attack right now. And what does fentanyl do that anthrax doesn't do? The same thing. You get it on your fingers, it can poison you. Gets in your food, it can poison you. You breathe it in, it can poison you. So is it a drug or is it a poisoning? And we know where it's coming from. And we know how it's getting in here. So, I don't care what you call them. But they're poisoning Americans. And the reason why I don't look at it the same way as a drug because -- and as you pointed out in your monologue, no one is going out on a fentanyl run. So it is being used as a poison, disguised to attack the weakest part of society. So it is a poisoning and again, just call it anthrax. And imagine we had one envelope of anthrax sent to the White House, and the entire world stopped. We literally have tons of anthrax being pushed through our border. So to me, I look at like an act of war. But the problem is, it's affecting the lowest point of our society. And until unfortunately, someone in the White House goes through fentanyl poisoning or losing a loved one then maybe they'll look at it as for what it is. So I look at it as a terrorist attack. I don't want people watching my house. But if that means that we're going to do something about this poisoning of America, then I'm all for it. But again just change the word for one second and think how you look at it."

He said -- he's said -- you got it, Larry. He said, \"Inflation is a terrible thing, you can't cure it and noted that rising inflation was one of the key factors that brought down the Roman Empire.\" Wow. Tough show today. At least we got Caesar -- but the good news is we got Caesar salad out of the deal. Inflation is through the roof, the Biden administration sticks it to the taxpayers. A revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office shows that the student loan forgiveness plan will cost $400 billion over a decade. 400 billion. Coincidentally, that's the same number of words Emily speaks per minute.

Sure, that seems as likely as Tyrus fitting into one of my little black dresses. I'm sorry. And finally, the Biden administration has proposed a new rule that would require airlines and travel search sites to include all fees and ticket prices that are displayed to customers. Says Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, airline passengers deserve to know the full true cost of their flights before they buy a ticket. Yes, transparency would be great. But at this rate, the only time Biden will be transparent when it -- is when he's a ghost, which I am sure is a long way away because he is the pinnacle of health and vigor. Joe, what say you?"

And that's what Democrats are doing all over the country now. Well, I'm not for defunding the police, and say that's not going to do it. If you're a Democrat, you're not law and order because they're for not enforcing laws, they're for letting criminals out. They're for, you know, they're against bail. They're for open borders.

With hair salons closed for months during the pandemic, women across the country let the silver shine through, perfect timing since their faces were already covered with useless masks, boo. And now many find that keeping it natural is liberate. Men prefer the time women thought wearing no bra was liberating. Many women still feel judged for exposing their gray roots or fear they'll be passed up for professional or romantic opportunities, romantic opportunities -- I'm going to start calling it that if they don't dye their hair. And while men and women both gray at the same rate, when it comes to how the salt and peppered sexes are treated, it's very black and white. Historically, graying men are described as wise, distinguish silver foxes, while women with gray hair are known as not bang-able anymore. But the gray scales seem to be tipping at least marginally in women's favor. Younger generations have started purposely coloring their hair gray as a fashion statement, proving that as long as you have a young pretty face and a sexy tight body, you can be hot no matter your hair color. So, maybe this new movement is the push women need to finally start going gray in the workplace. I wonder how that'll go."
