And I just saw John Cornyn. I just found a statement saying he does not agree with the president on raising the age of weapons to 21 -- of getting a weapon at 21. So you already see that peeling off in the senate. So the perspective things aren't going to work.

As you say, he's kind of got to it at the very end but as an afterthought. He was far more interested in to pick up on the steak house analogy of throwing out the chunks of red meat everywhere he turned. I was surprised that he was throwing out chunks though that had to do with things like Democrats abandon DACA. I'm the one who cares. Wait a minute, he's the one who ended DACA and set this March deadline. Now, he finds himself in a situation the deadline is approaching and he's got nothing, and the Democrats are willing to take a risk. I hope they're having a little more spine than they did last time when Schumer backed out on that budget deal. And then, this business about lock her up.

And I just saw John Cornyn. I just found a statement saying he does not agree with the president on raising the age of weapons to 21 -- of getting a weapon at 21. So you already see that peeling off in the senate. So the perspective things aren't going to work. But, telling that crowd that if the Democrats win, they're going to take away the tax cuts, they're going to try to take away the judges that you have and they're going to try to repeal the second amendment. So you better go out there and vote. The only thing about this speech, and I said this a lot, is that I feel like he could drive a news cycle better if he chose one thing to drive news on at the top of the speech, let the networks and all the reporters cover that piece, and then move on to do the rest of the speech because everything gets lost.

That's what -- I thought it was going to be and I think his staff thought it was going to be something about increasing sanctions on North Korea. As you say, he's kind of got to it at the very end but as an afterthought. He was far more interested in to pick up on the steak house analogy of throwing out the chunks of red meat everywhere he turned. I was surprised that he was throwing out chunks though that had to do with things like Democrats abandon DACA. I'm the one who cares. Wait a minute, he's the one who ended DACA and set this March deadline. Now, he finds himself in a situation the deadline is approaching and he's got nothing, and the Democrats are willing to take a risk. I hope they're having a little more spine than they did last time when Schumer backed out on that budget deal. And then, this business about lock her up. Jesse, it just seems to me like, you know, what would you say, Greg, I said a 1970's hit. Do you know what I mean? We've been through that but he still."

But when you pull back -- the reason why none of us we all go, like, we have disagreements, all of us do, is because-- almost everything he does is common sense centrism. If you look at his immigration stance he talks about a enforce border, but he's also talking about 1.7 million people.

And they've got to pick, you know, the needle out of that haystack. That can be difficult especially when you're dealing with laws in Florida. Today, a lot of discussion about this so-called Baker Act which allows you to involuntarily take somebody and commit them because you see them as a danger to themselves or danger to others. Well, apparently, psychiatric officials had contact with this young man but couldn't pass that threshold. And that threshold can be pretty tough. And I would think that conservatives would say, yeah, we don't want people just somehow bad mouthing us or saying stuff about us and taking away either our guns or our liberty."

So they're obviously receiving information showing that they're not in compliance and, therefore, these kind of actions need to be taken. But I like the fact that, look, we're being very well-represented by Ivanka Trump. She's going there. And the president was obviously very proud of her to represent the country, so I think that was nice. And I'm glad that he sent his daughter. I think that's symbolic. Send a strong woman over there.

They want to sue him about the wall and environmental reasons. They're upset because they feel that they don't like his immigration policy. This is essentially the birthplace, the capital of sanctuary cities, right, with San Francisco and the crimes that have happened. So they're a state that's very vocal and critical about the president, his policies, what he's been able to accomplish and what he is intending to accomplish, like building the wall. So, because of that, they get his focus and attention. So he says things like that that perhaps are not, you know, something that you would like to hear. But this is his personality.

And so even if the president is just spit-balling ideas, and he's later told by his chief counsel, \"Actually, sir, you're not allowed to do that,\" it doesn't necessarily matter, because from a communications standpoint he is trying to make his case. And so he can constantly go back and say, \"I would have taken them out of there. They deserved it, but I've got to keep them in.\" So it becomes a rhetorical device, in a way.

And her inspiration came from her own experiences, because she had to go four different surgeries to correct a cleft lip and palate. She has on-line crowd funding, and it's already raised about $50,000. She's very grateful for everything, because it means she can bring more smiles and comfort to young patients when they need it most, going through these procedures. So God bless her.
