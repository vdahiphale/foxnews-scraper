We're following two big breaking stories, police on the scene at an active standoff in Philadelphia where at least six police officers have been shot. And what Geoffrey Epstein's last words to his attorney could reveal about his mysterious death.  Plus, a journalist attacked by bodyguards of an award-winning White House correspondent and CNN Contributor for daring to cover her public event. That victim is here exclusively. And Portland is bracing for a battle this weekend as Antifa and right-winged groups face off in dueling protests.  Journalist Andy Ngo was hospitalized by these left-wing thugs and is here on his fight for justice.  PLUS Raymond Arroyo exposes the new pact between Jay-Z and the NFL what do the social justice warriors mean to do. And Bernie teams up with a rapper to juice his campaign. It's all in this week's \"Seen & Unseen\". But first, the Fox News Alert out of Philadelphia where a gunman is holding police at bay. Narcotics officers were serving a warrant at a home when they came under heavy gunfire. That was just about 4 o'clock this afternoon. At least six officers have been injured and the shots have not stopped.  Here's the Philadelphia Police Commissioner just a short time ago.",

      "sentences": "But first of all, it's been raining for about an hour here now Jesse, so it makes it a little tougher for the police officers who've been out here since 4:30 this afternoon some of them on this ongoing situation with a gunman who remains barricaded inside a home about two blocks from us here. We're in the middle of Broad Street right by Erie, near the North Philly Temple University campus and you can see a lot of police vehicles behind me. There's a command post set up here. And again we're about two blocks from where the shooting erupted at 4:30 when those officers were serving warrants as part of a narcotics interdiction operation. And this gunman apparently opened fire, I'm told, with an AR-15 setting many of the officers jumping out windows and trapping a couple of cops upstairs on the second floor. And we had heard throughout the afternoon that the suspect may have been firing rounds through the ceiling as those officers pinned down on the second floor, who also had some other suspects they had taken into custody as part of this ongoing operation.  So a short time ago the SWAT team was able to get in there and get those officers out and the prisoners out the - the other - they call them hostages who were stuck inside the building. But as far as we know the gunman is still inside. He did according to police wound six and three other officers were injured in car crashes, racing to this scene.   They have been talking to him over a bullhorn. They got him on the phone for a brief time. You may have heard there was a three-way call with an attorney and the suspect and the police. But he wasn't on the phone for long. We had also heard that he had been live-streaming this ongoing operation from inside that home where he had been shooting out windows and firing on police who are encouraging him to give up and so far have not been able to get him out.  The other thing when the SWAT team tried to make entrance, I'm told by a police source, he had barricaded doors and they had to retreat, Jesse, because the fire from the suspect was so heavy. So, again, at this hour as far as we know, the police and anyone else who might have been in that building has now gotten out, except for the gunman, who remains pinned down inside, refusing to give up and no one seems to know when this thing might be resolved. But there are a lot of police officers out here, ATF, FBI and others who are working to make it happen.",

And then there'll be other intelligence that they gather.  They'll set up cameras. They put pinhole cameras up there. They - there's a bunch of stuff. They may put up a drone to get a look in the windows. There's a bunch of stuff they can do to give them insight to get up into the building.

Obviously, I don't care how much drugs he has in the system or in the apartment, you're not going to be able to stay up all night, eventually the body's going to shut down. I mean, Jesse, you remember, the police officers can change shifts. The bad guy can't. He's in there by himself it's only him right now.  Now, just adding on to what Bernie said. He's right, the police officers before they do these raids, try to do their best to get a layout of what a similar type of apartment may look like. They're never really going in blind. But on the downside, the perp definitely has some kind of mastery of the terrain features. He's in the building right now, so he's obviously going to know better what the inside of the building looks like. And the problem there is you run into things called fatal funnels. In other words, when the officers come in, there's usually only one way to enter an apartment where the bad guy can obviously funnel his attention, if you understand what I mean.   The police officers don't have that luxury. And it just goes to show you again Jesse - I mean not - we can't say it enough on the network, how brave these guys and women really are.

In the 40s, 50s, 60s, and even the early 70s there were a lot of jobs there, because they had U.S. Steel, they had auto manufacturing, its shipping, they had packaging, they had good solid jobs. And all of a sudden politicians let these jobs float overseas and then there's no way to make money anymore except sell drugs and then murder anybody that gets in your way. That's what happens when you wreck these cities. You got huge spikes in homicide. Philadelphia last year had the highest homicide rate in the last 10 years. And this year in August right now, they're already on record to beat that. So something has to be done to get a hold on these cities, Dan, because whatever is happening right now is not working.",

What I'm trying to get at is, the solutions are out there. Good law and order, quality policing where mayors and political leaders who are usually that's because they don't have real jobs, they can actually support the cops, unlike they do now. Let the cops do their job. Let people like Bernie and others who understand ComStat - computer statistics and broken windows, and they'll clean up the city just like Giuliani, Bernie and Bratton did in New York.

Whereas in the past, when you have the backing of your political - good strong political leadership that backs the police department. I'm not talking about backing malfeasance. I'm a libertarian at heart, I'm not talking about out-of-control policing. I'm talking about good sound law and order policing. When they know they have their back of the political leaders, they'll engage in that traffic stop if they see some shady suspicious behavior and they have reason to do it they may ask the subject to leave the car. It may result in a pat-down if they have the information. You may find the gun. You may have in fact stopped the homicide. You know what's happening now - a lot of those traffic stops, you get a guy in a car who's mouthy with the cops, you may have the information, you may, not it's a discretionary situation. A lot of the cops are walking away, because it's - believe me it's not due to any cowardice, these are the bravest men and women I know.  It's because they know they won't be backed up by their leadership and they'll be the one on the hot seat being asked ridiculous questions, second guessing them in a moment of crisis, again by political leaders who have no idea what they're talking about.",

We're following two big breaking stories, police on the scene at an active standoff in Philadelphia where at least six police officers have been shot. And what Geoffrey Epstein's last words to his attorney could reveal about his mysterious death. Plus, a journalist attacked by bodyguards of an award-winning White House correspondent and CNN Contributor for daring to cover her public event. That victim is here exclusively. And Portland is bracing for a battle this weekend as Antifa and right-winged groups face off in dueling protests. Journalist Andy Ngo was hospitalized by these left-wing thugs and is here on his fight for justice. PLUS Raymond Arroyo exposes the new pact between Jay-Z and the NFL what do the social justice warriors mean to do. And Bernie teams up with a rapper to juice his campaign. It's all in this week's \"Seen & Unseen\". But first, the Fox News Alert out of Philadelphia where a gunman is holding police at bay. Narcotics officers were serving a warrant at a home when they came under heavy gunfire. That was just about 4 o'clock this afternoon. At least six officers have been injured and the shots have not stopped. Here's the Philadelphia Police Commissioner just a short time ago."

      "utterance": "But first of all, it's been raining for about an hour here now Jesse, so it makes it a little tougher for the police officers who've been out here since 4:30 this afternoon some of them on this ongoing situation with a gunman who remains barricaded inside a home about two blocks from us here. We're in the middle of Broad Street right by Erie, near the North Philly Temple University campus and you can see a lot of police vehicles behind me. There's a command post set up here. And again we're about two blocks from where the shooting erupted at 4:30 when those officers were serving warrants as part of a narcotics interdiction operation. And this gunman apparently opened fire, I'm told, with an AR-15 setting many of the officers jumping out windows and trapping a couple of cops upstairs on the second floor. And we had heard throughout the afternoon that the suspect may have been firing rounds through the ceiling as those officers pinned down on the second floor, who also had some other suspects they had taken into custody as part of this ongoing operation. So a short time ago the SWAT team was able to get in there and get those officers out and the prisoners out the - the other - they call them hostages who were stuck inside the building. But as far as we know the gunman is still inside. He did according to police wound six and three other officers were injured in car crashes, racing to this scene. They have been talking to him over a bullhorn. They got him on the phone for a brief time. You may have heard there was a three-way call with an attorney and the suspect and the police. But he wasn't on the phone for long. We had also heard that he had been live-streaming this ongoing operation from inside that home where he had been shooting out windows and firing on police who are encouraging him to give up and so far have not been able to get him out. The other thing when the SWAT team tried to make entrance, I'm told by a police source, he had barricaded doors and they had to retreat, Jesse, because the fire from the suspect was so heavy. So, again, at this hour as far as we know, the police and anyone else who might have been in that building has now gotten out, except for the gunman, who remains pinned down inside, refusing to give up and no one seems to know when this thing might be resolved. But there are a lot of police officers out here, ATF, FBI and others who are working to make it happen."

There's just you know windows in the front, that's pretty much about it, maybe a few in the back.

And then there'll be other intelligence that they gather. They'll set up cameras. They put pinhole cameras up there. They - there's a bunch of stuff. They may put up a drone to get a look in the windows. There's a bunch of stuff they can do to give them insight to get up into the building. And I can tell you the Philadelphia SWAT team is one of the best probably in the Northeast. And the bottom line - here's the reality.

I mean, Jesse, you remember, the police officers can change shifts. The bad guy can't. He's in there by himself it's only him right now. Now, just adding on to what Bernie said. He's right, the police officers before they do these raids, try to do their best to get a layout of what a similar type of apartment may look like. They're never really going in blind. But on the downside, the perp definitely has some kind of mastery of the terrain features. He's in the building right now, so he's obviously going to know better what the inside of the building looks like. And the problem there is you run into things called fatal funnels. In other words, when the officers come in, there's usually only one way to enter an apartment where the bad guy can obviously funnel his attention, if you understand what I mean. The police officers don't have that luxury. And it just goes to show you again Jesse - I mean not - we can't say it enough on the network, how brave these guys and women really are.

He's going to be the one who tells him look, they're not going to hurt you. He's going to be the one that says, it's not as bad as you think. Bottom line is, it's bad. It's attempted murder of six cops. But bottom line, it's - the cops have all night. They have all night. They have all day tomorrow. He has to go to sleep. He has to shut down.

They give it to the gang leaders who then distribute it in the neighborhood and then can run it up and down the East Coast corridors. And they have to have these weapons to protect the product. To blame this on guns, like this guy with the AR, the handgun, didn't go through a background check, it's crazy. And I think everybody needs to focus on what the real issue here is."

That by the way this criminal, as you just accurately stated, couldn't give a rat's ass about. I'm pretty sure this guy doesn't care about your latest background check proposal. So can we all just like focus on the cops and the tactics now, getting people out of there safely. And by the way the residents, Jesse - there's no people who live around there.

In the 40s, 50s, 60s, and even the early 70s there were a lot of jobs there, because they had U.S. Steel, they had auto manufacturing, its shipping, they had packaging, they had good solid jobs. And all of a sudden politicians let these jobs float overseas and then there's no way to make money anymore except sell drugs and then murder anybody that gets in your way. That's what happens when you wreck these cities. You got huge spikes in homicide. Philadelphia last year had the highest homicide rate in the last 10 years. And this year in August right now, they're already on record to beat that. So something has to be done to get a hold on these cities, Dan, because whatever is happening right now is not working."

They brought in police commanders and said, \"Hey, listen what's going on in your corner over there?\" \"Nothing, just some low-level drug dealing\". And what did Bernie the first Deputy Commissioner does say, \"You know what, we're not too comfortable with that, you're going to clean that up\". Jesse, I'm telling you, these police commanders were shocked. They were used to running their own little fiefdom. ComStat and broken windows changed that. What I'm trying to get at is, the solutions are out there. Good law and order, quality policing where mayors and political leaders who are usually that's because they don't have real jobs, they can actually support the cops, unlike they do now. Let the cops do their job. Let people like Bernie and others who understand ComStat - computer statistics and broken windows, and they'll clean up the city just like Giuliani, Bernie and Bratton did in New York.

Is Apple going to put a store, a business in your community if people are afraid of gunfire, if mothers are putting their babies in bathtubs at night afraid of random fire? No. So without cleaning up the city, without reading the crime, reducing the murder rate, you're not going to have business. You're not going to have good schools, you're not going to have none of that stuff. So all these Democrats, all over the country that run these cities into poverty and let the crime go rampant, it's wrong. That's why you don't have anything in the city. They say a socio-economic development. No, it's nonsense. Economic increases, real estate value increases, tourism increases, I could show you percentage points of increases for every percentage point we reduce crime in New York City and Giuliani left office with a 65% reduction in violent crime and a 70% reduction in murder --the most substantial reductions anywhere in this country."

And so I just think, some of these the politicians and their comments are just not effective to address this issue. We need cooperative law enforcement between the federal, state and locals.

You saw the rise of \"Black Lives Matter\" and justice and some of that but a lot of this stuff became anti-police the chanting about \"Fry 'Em Like Bacon!\" And you saw what happened down in Dallas, the assassin that started picking off police officers - two NYPD officers were executed.

What they'll tell you Jesse, is the Ferguson effect is very real and here's how it manifests itself in the street. Whereas in the past, when you have the backing of your political - good strong political leadership that backs the police department. I'm not talking about backing malfeasance. I'm a libertarian at heart, I'm not talking about out-of-control policing. I'm talking about good sound law and order policing. When they know they have their back of the political leaders, they'll engage in that traffic stop if they see some shady suspicious behavior and they have reason to do it they may ask the subject to leave the car. It may result in a pat-down if they have the information. You may find the gun. You may have in fact stopped the homicide. You know what's happening now - a lot of those traffic stops, you get a guy in a car who's mouthy with the cops, you may have the information, you may, not it's a discretionary situation. A lot of the cops are walking away, because it's - believe me it's not due to any cowardice, these are the bravest men and women I know. It's because they know they won't be backed up by their leadership and they'll be the one on the hot seat being asked ridiculous questions, second guessing them in a moment of crisis, again by political leaders who have no idea what they're talking about."

Watch what they're doing today. What if you were in that house? What if you were a neighbor? What if you were in that surrounding area? And you needed help. Those are the men and women that put their lives on the line every single day. Regardless of what color you are, they don't care where you came from.

I think since the president ran on a law and order campaign in 2015 and 2016, and he's been very supportive of law enforcement, and you can tell the country has changed and has accepted the bravery and the sacrifice of the men and women in blue. And the things that they do because when you spotlight these types of things it makes you think what kind of person takes the job so you know put on a tactical vest and kick down the door when you know there's a bad guy on the other side, all hopped up with an AR pointed it right at you.

And we can't say that enough - the situations that these police officers and sheriff's deputies are to have to deal with every day and it's making a difference. And I've seen that as I've traveled around the country and gone back to my home state of Iowa and I've had law enforcement say thank you for backing us. And I tell them don't thank me, thank you. You're the one and your deputies and your officers are the ones that are doing the hard work.

And like that, Jay-Z said he is willing to work with people who he disagrees with politically. That's not a bad thing. That I'll commend him for. But let's not lose sight of what the NFL is. It's football. I'm quite certain these fans are not paying these high prices to protest cops, particularly with what you covered earlier tonight in Philadelphia. I think that is the last thing on the minds of NFL fans. But they mean -- the NFL -- to embrace Jay-Z's vision of social justice. This is a guy who sold drugs, he stabbed his brother in the face. Still this partnership is being billed as a way to unify America. But as memory serves, Jay-Z had trouble unifying with his sister-in-law, Solange Knowles."

It seems like big organizations like the NFL, or like Nike is doing with Kaepernick, they are bringing on the social justice liaisons to help them navigate through tender issues, racial issues, things like that, that might give these big organizations problems. And if you bring a guy with street cred or a guy with his ear to the street or that has great credibility in the black community, that could kind of cushion any sort of negative press that that organization could face."

This is actually the third time that Andy was assaulted in Portland in the last couple of months. He was assaulted on May 1st, about a week later as well, and then on the horrific attack that you just showed. And so it isn't one incident. This is like a horror version of Groundhog Day there. The same thing keeps happening again and again and again. And the mayor, who is also the police commissioner, waves his hands around, and if you actually watch an entire press conference, which was a ludicrous P.R. stunt, you would think that the biggest problem in Portland is oppression -- colonial oppression, and white supremacism, and that sort of thing."

All hell is going to break loose if what is being predicted actually happens. The mayor has no control. The police department I guess follows the orders of the mayor, because whatever is going to happen, they are just going to spin it, because there is going to be a dozen right wing radicals, and then massive amounts of armed and masked Antifa is going to come in, and there's going to be violence, and then police are not going to do anything about it. Is that we were going to see, probably, Andy?"
