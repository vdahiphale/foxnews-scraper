Texas Senator Ted Cruz will be here in a moment to respond to his opponent, Beto O'Rourke, who spoke out in at a town hall just moments ago. Plus, his reaction to the growing caravan making its way toward our border. Congressman Devin Nunes is here, and he has details of a Democratic operative who harassed him and was later arrested for assaulting a GOP campaign worker in Nevada. Wait till you hear what this group is affiliated with and where this person comes from.  And just 18 days out from the midterm elections, Eric Trump is also here, and he's going to tell us why he says it's a good thing his father is the most important factor this election season. But first, the caravan of lies and manipulation. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  As we approach election day, here is one thing that has become patently obvious. Democrats are uninterested in the things Americans care about most. Their prosperity and their safety. Instead of policy prescriptions, Democrats poison American discourse with constant demonization and perpetual intimidation.  In the Kavanaugh saga, we saw that they are masters at producing coordinated choreographed outrage. After that backfired, Democrats began to panic. Although still favored to take the House of Representatives, things began to shift somewhat after the Kavanaugh dust settled. Stories suddenly began to pop up that Pelosi, Schumer and company were concerned that Latino voters weren't sufficiently enthusiastic in the midterms, which of course could doom Democrat chances to take the House. Then, like magic, a few days later, a story appeared out of nowhere about another caravan of central Americans headed to the U.S. from Honduras.",

      "sentences": "ICE was apparently involved from the very beginning in the story, even before the gruesome murder. Back in 2017, Garcia was arrested for DWI and a misdemeanor criminal mischief after he reportedly rammed his truck into the car of an ex-girlfriend and her family members. He got an immigration judge, though, to give him a voluntary departure order. Now, would you be surprised to hear that he did not leave the country voluntarily after that order? A few months later, he was in ICE custody a second time and a second time he was given a voluntary departure order. And now, in just 11 days, he awaits his trial for the murder of Jared Vargas.  Why aren't any of the Democrats who rail against family separation also railing about stories like this? Fifty-five illegal immigrants found stuffed in a truck ready to be shipped across the United States, undoubtedly many to unscrupulous employers.  Our open borders, as well as our immigration and asylum loopholes, are enriching the cartels, they are endangering migrants, and they are also making life worse for most Americans beyond the super rich who live in a protective bubble. How can we allow this to continue and still be a country? Now, of course, not all illegal immigrants commit violent crime and many are good and hardworking people. But that's not really the point. No American should suffer or be brutalized in order to fulfill the Democrats' fantasy of a borderless society. No American worker should see his or her wages go down because there is an illegal immigrant who just arrived in the U.S. who is willing to work for 40 percent less.   In Donald Trump, we finally have a president who wants to tackle this problem, not just pass it onto the next president the way Obama did. You don't buy for a moment what the left is selling you. Democrats are the ones using this and stoking false fear among the Latinos to try to flip Congress. Again, no ideas, just more emotional manipulation. We welcome and we treasure the Hispanic immigrants in this country who came here the legal way, like Tia from Venezuela, who called in to my radio show today.   UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): I was born in Venezuela. I am a proud American citizen now, but I am terrified of what is happening. My mother would've never thought that Venezuela, 30 years later, was going to be a socialist country, and then five to eight years after that was going to descent into a dictatorship. Because once they get in, they change the Constitution. And now they are not even waiting. They want the Supreme Court because they want to change the Constitution, and there goes our country.",

Now, we all know the negative changes that open borders and catch and release bring to America. Look no further than California's rampant homelessness, filthy streets, ballooning low fare (ph) programs, crashing regulations.   That's what a Democrat super majority sanctuary state ends up looking like. The president is standing up for you. He wants this to stop. This morning, he tweeted, \"we spend billions enforcing other countries' borders as our own has become a joke. Our laws ignored and our generation and compassion exploited\"  He said this as well. He said, \"in addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught. And if they are unable to do so, I will call up the U.S. military and close our southern border.\" That's what his tweet said. Now, the Democrats talk taking the House, will ensure that this caravan of 4,000 eventually becomes a flow of four million, four million plus before we know it. This cannot happen.  But as we told you last night, if you are still on the fence about what to do on November 6th in the midterm election, just think for a moment about who is in line to chair the important committees when it comes to these issues, like Homeland Security and the Judiciary Committee if the Democrats do take the house.

Conn Carroll, the communications director for Utah Republican senator, Mike Lee, told Fox News that during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, Stark followed, filmed and harassed Senator Lee in the basement of the Senate Building. Carroll also tweeted, quote, \"I've known Mike Stark for literally over a decade. This is who he is. American Bridge knows who he is and what he does and they hired him accordingly.\" In fact, sources tell Fox News that when Stark was arrested for assault in Vegas, he told police that this was, quote, \"his job,\" and he does this for a living. That prompted Kentucky Senator Rand Paul to question whether American Bridge was propagating this, quoting, \"Soros paid protester arrested, same group operates inside congressional office buildings. Are Democrats paying to incite violence?\" And Starks' resume highlights a violent past. He was convicted for disorderly conduct after aggressively approaching Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate, Ed Gillespie, back in 2017. And earlier, he was arrested for assaulting a female staffer for interior secretary Ryan Zinke. American Bridge has not responded to whether it knew about Stark's criminal past. Laura?",

I was told by one of the witnesses that he then, this was a very big man, six and a half feet tall at least and probably somewhere between 270 to 300 pounds, with very big hands, I might add, that he jumped down on top of me.  Apparently, he wasn't done.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz will be here in a moment to respond to his opponent, Beto O'Rourke, who spoke out in at a town hall just moments ago. Plus, his reaction to the growing caravan making its way toward our border. Congressman Devin Nunes is here, and he has details of a Democratic operative who harassed him and was later arrested for assaulting a GOP campaign worker in Nevada. Wait till you hear what this group is affiliated with and where this person comes from. And just 18 days out from the midterm elections, Eric Trump is also here, and he's going to tell us why he says it's a good thing his father is the most important factor this election season. But first, the caravan of lies and manipulation. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. As we approach election day, here is one thing that has become patently obvious. Democrats are uninterested in the things Americans care about most. Their prosperity and their safety. Instead of policy prescriptions, Democrats poison American discourse with constant demonization and perpetual intimidation. In the Kavanaugh saga, we saw that they are masters at producing coordinated choreographed outrage. After that backfired, Democrats began to panic. Although still favored to take the House of Representatives, things began to shift somewhat after the Kavanaugh dust settled. Stories suddenly began to pop up that Pelosi, Schumer and company were concerned that Latino voters weren't sufficiently enthusiastic in the midterms, which of course could doom Democrat chances to take the House. Then, like magic, a few days later, a story appeared out of nowhere about another caravan of central Americans headed to the U.S. from Honduras."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "ICE was apparently involved from the very beginning in the story, even before the gruesome murder. Back in 2017, Garcia was arrested for DWI and a misdemeanor criminal mischief after he reportedly rammed his truck into the car of an ex-girlfriend and her family members. He got an immigration judge, though, to give him a voluntary departure order. Now, would you be surprised to hear that he did not leave the country voluntarily after that order? A few months later, he was in ICE custody a second time and a second time he was given a voluntary departure order. And now, in just 11 days, he awaits his trial for the murder of Jared Vargas. Why aren't any of the Democrats who rail against family separation also railing about stories like this? Fifty-five illegal immigrants found stuffed in a truck ready to be shipped across the United States, undoubtedly many to unscrupulous employers. Our open borders, as well as our immigration and asylum loopholes, are enriching the cartels, they are endangering migrants, and they are also making life worse for most Americans beyond the super rich who live in a protective bubble. How can we allow this to continue and still be a country? Now, of course, not all illegal immigrants commit violent crime and many are good and hardworking people. But that's not really the point. No American should suffer or be brutalized in order to fulfill the Democrats' fantasy of a borderless society. No American worker should see his or her wages go down because there is an illegal immigrant who just arrived in the U.S. who is willing to work for 40 percent less. In Donald Trump, we finally have a president who wants to tackle this problem, not just pass it onto the next president the way Obama did. You don't buy for a moment what the left is selling you. Democrats are the ones using this and stoking false fear among the Latinos to try to flip Congress. Again, no ideas, just more emotional manipulation. We welcome and we treasure the Hispanic immigrants in this country who came here the legal way, like Tia from Venezuela, who called in to my radio show today."

Now, we all know the negative changes that open borders and catch and release bring to America. Look no further than California's rampant homelessness, filthy streets, ballooning low fare (ph) programs, crashing regulations. That's what a Democrat super majority sanctuary state ends up looking like. The president is standing up for you. He wants this to stop. This morning, he tweeted, \"we spend billions enforcing other countries' borders as our own has become a joke. Our laws ignored and our generation and compassion exploited\" He said this as well. He said, \"in addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught. And if they are unable to do so, I will call up the U.S. military and close our southern border.\" That's what his tweet said. Now, the Democrats talk taking the House, will ensure that this caravan of 4,000 eventually becomes a flow of four million, four million plus before we know it. This cannot happen. But as we told you last night, if you are still on the fence about what to do on November 6th in the midterm election, just think for a moment about who is in line to chair the important committees when it comes to these issues, like Homeland Security and the Judiciary Committee if the Democrats do take the house.

This individual, this illegal alien, committed multiple crimes. Our revolving door system lets criminals, drug criminals, violent criminals who are illegal aliens stay here. You've got a voluntary removal order which he ignored. It's the reason we need to pass Kate's law, which I've authored in the Senate that says aggravated felon, violent criminal illegal aliens who enter the country illegally repeatedly should face a mandatory minimum prison sentence so that violent criminals are not in our communities, they are not taking lives --"

Well, you know, facts matter, and we put up on our website, tedcruz.org, the exact text of the resolution that Congressman O'Rourke voted on. President Obama proposed a $10 a barrel tax on oil.

He was arrested in Las Vegas for assaulting Kristin Davison, the campaign manager for Nevada GOP gubernatorial nominee, Adam Laxalt. Davison says Mike Stark grabbed her and yanked her arm and refused to let go. She told authorities the attack left her traumatized and horrified. But for Mike Stark, it might have been another day to the office. He is a reporter for the American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal organization founded by David Brock, who also founded the liberal watchdog group, Media Matters, and funded by billionaire, George Soros, famous for giving money to liberal political causes. After Stark was arrested, American Bridge fired him for his bad behavior. But sources said they also hired him for his bad behavior. Conn Carroll, the communications director for Utah Republican senator, Mike Lee, told Fox News that during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings, Stark followed, filmed and harassed Senator Lee in the basement of the Senate Building. Carroll also tweeted, quote, \"I've known Mike Stark for literally over a decade. This is who he is. American Bridge knows who he is and what he does and they hired him accordingly.\" In fact, sources tell Fox News that when Stark was arrested for assault in Vegas, he told police that this was, quote, \"his job,\" and he does this for a living. That prompted Kentucky Senator Rand Paul to question whether American Bridge was propagating this, quoting, \"Soros paid protester arrested, same group operates inside congressional office buildings. Are Democrats paying to incite violence?\" And Starks' resume highlights a violent past. He was convicted for disorderly conduct after aggressively approaching Virginia GOP gubernatorial candidate, Ed Gillespie, back in 2017. And earlier, he was arrested for assaulting a female staffer for interior secretary Ryan Zinke. American Bridge has not responded to whether it knew about Stark's criminal past. Laura?"

I hope you are OK. I know you're not really able to go out campaigning now because of this injury. Shane, please feel better. Take care of yourself, get surrogates out there to campaign for you. But you need to pull out a win."

      "utterance": "No to a particularly egregious case of tech censorship.  Facebook reportedly deleted a disabled Air Force vets' conservative news page without warning. This after he says he invested over $300,000 in ads.  Earlier this month Facebook announced it was purging more than 800 accounts because of inauthentic behavior, but our next guest never imagined it could happen to him. Brian Kolfage's page had a verified checkmark and he says 3.5 million fans, but it was all taken away in an instant. Brian joins us now to tell us about it. Brian, first of all, thank you so much for your heroism and sacrifice for this country. You are amazing. And I have to ask you, has Facebook been in touch with you at all?"

I want you guys know that I sacrificed three limbs for everybody, for your freedom, my family's freedom because that's why I believe in. That's why I joined the military. If I can get everybody to go to Fightforfreespeech.com, we really need everyone to go there and sign up and sign our petition, and we're going to take this fight to Facebook. Go ahead, Laura."

      "utterance": "There is no real reason. We remained in contact in Facebook for nine months begging them since January when they rolled out the new rule changes. They would not contact us to give us the meeting to go over the rules. We wanted them to remain in contact to go over these rules, but they wouldn't. They didn't want to help us. We were begging them. I sent over 50 emails directly to our Facebook contact Katie Harvin (ph) and she was ignoring it. Any other person or any other company, they would've been helping them. They didn't want to help us. We wanted to understand the rules. We wanted to be the good part of Facebook. We always follow the rules. The Facebook page never had an issue. We were never banned from Facebook. Never had issues with false news, misinformation, or anything.  So the whole reasoning is up in the air. We don't understand why."

But you know what, on October 3rd, when that meeting was supposed to take place, they didn't give us and they canceled it two days prior. Right when they canceled it, we had raised over $600,000 with John Hopkins who founded rightwing news, and that's when it was pulled. That was in the news. I was raising all that money for Justice Kavanaugh. They pulled it. One week later, our page was gone.  And all our pages were gone. I own a coffee company called Military Grade Coffee. That company has nothing to do with politics, and they yanked it.  That was my financial support for my family. And they are attacking my family, they're attacking me, and they're attacking my rights."
