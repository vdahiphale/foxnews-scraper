We'll have more in a moment.  The hypocrisy on the left also has gone way over the top, over the boiling point. And with the midterms right around the corner, you have Democrats and, of course, their willing accomplices in the mainstream media, they're now trying to use illegal immigration to divide America. By the way, very predictable.  And meanwhile, the president is trying to fix our broken system and doing their job and undoing their mess. Democrats offered no solutions, no compromise, no cooperation. And their friends in the media they're cheering them on every step of the way.  In moments, we will uncover the deception that is arising from the American left. Their rhetoric is absolutely disgusting tonight. And plus, we have the First Lady Melania Trump making a surprise visit to the border in the facilities in Texas today. We're going to bring you her remarks and we'll also show you how absolutely apoplectic and insane the media is here, attacking her. And by the way, it's over a wardrobe choice. It's insane.  And tonight, we also have more fallout from the I.G. report that the media ignores, including new evidence that reveals some of the absolutely dirty tactics used against the Trump campaign and the biggest abuse of power. And the media is ignoring it all. And also, we have the latest from the ongoing obstruction that is at the DOJ. There is a fight abrewing.  And it's a sad day here at Fox News Channel. As we just mentioned, the brilliant Charles Krauthammer, he did pass away at the age of 68. A huge loss for the Fox News family. We'll have more on his life, his legacy and his profile in courage that was his life.   Now, we are first calling out political bias, by the way, and holding our government accountable. That is the breaking news opening monologue.",

If the media would spend their time and energy on her actions and efforts to help the kids rather than speculate and focus on her wardrobe, well, we could get so much accomplished on behalf of kids. Followed by #shecares and #itsjustajacket.   Even President Trump, he did weigh in. This tells a lot. \"I really don't care, do you\" written on the back of Melania's jacket refers to the fake news media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are and she truly no longer cares. By the way, good for her. Why should she trust them? And it's pretty unbelievable. Now, the surprise trip took place less than 24 hours after the President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively preventing the separation of families and children who cross our borders illegally.  In doing so, what did he do? He bailed out the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress who by the way this is their mess. This is their law, not his. And the people that have failed to act on the issue.  No one wants children separated from parents. The president has been saying it day one. This action now literally, literally transcends these stupid laws that are on the books, passed by Congress, signed into law by a previous president. This is not a permanent solution. In fact, it's not going to hold up in the court system. The real answer, the real long-term solution, the real answer, if you care, the correct answer, the constitutional is Congress to do their job. Pass a bill. Send it to the White House. And despite all of this, President Trump was literally demonized for days in the media for Congress' law, before the executive action.

Ninety million people in the streets on the same weekend in country, F. Peter Fonda, OK, tried to issue a tepid apology. Melania Trump, she had to contact the Secret Service because her 12-year-old son is threatened. Beyond vile, beyond disgusting. You can't imagine it. And, by the way, Fonda wasn't the only repugnant person on the left to go after a Trump child. Look at this Canadian TV writer attacking Don Jr.'s 4-year-old on Twitter, saying, quote: We're coming for you. Really? This is beyond sick. This is pathological and frankly dangerous.  This is now the type of rhetoric that one has to wonder if something happens, who is going to be blamed here?

And, by the way, what would the media be doing if this were the children of Barack Obama? You don't think there is a double standard?  Now, despite all this vile, all this hatred, all this insanity, the president is still ready, willing and able, and eager actually to address what is Congress' broken immigration system. It's not his system. It's not his laws. He wants to work with the Republicans and the Democrats alike. He wants to solve the problem. He is willing to give on DACA. He's wiling to give on separation of kids. He's already tried to clean up their mess -- by the way, caused by Obama and Clinton because they never did their jobs.

Where was the outrage when the family of immigrant detainees sued President Obama for wrongful death? Where was the outrage following a report that minor illegal, immigrant detainees were brutally abused, beaten under the Obama administration? Remember, it was Obama who prosecuted nearly a half a million illegal immigrants. It was Obama who said he must follow the laws on the books and that he had no other choice but to deport illegal immigrants. And as a matter of fact, he was just doing what other presidents did, even if the consequences were severe, Obama said. He said it over and over again. He doesn't make the laws.

We'll have more on that in a few moments. First, we do have some breaking developments surrounding the deep state. Well, anti-Trump FBI love bird Peter Strzok, who was the lead prosecutor both to Hillary Clinton server investigation and the Trump-Russia witch hunt has now reportedly finally lost his security clearance. Now, of course, Strzok is just one of five high-ranking anti-Trump FBI employees who were referred for investigation by the inspector general. Now, we know that three of the five abusively biased individuals for Trump, those who loved Hillary and worked on both investigations. And, by the way, they include Strzok, they include Page and an FBI lawyer which was outed by Chairman Meadows named Kevin Clinesmith. By the way, Clinesmith was initially working as a primary attorney in the Russia investigation. But, of course, he was removed in February because his bias was revealed. What about the rest of the Mueller team? Tonight, the Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows is sounding an alarm that possible witness statements may have been altered, what is known as 302s, by some of these bias investigators in order to clear or charge a suspect. That's a big problem. Now, Meadows is also warning that the subpoenas are, quote, forthcoming in days. Sara Carter, who will join us, now reporting this revelation could very likely apply to the prosecution of the Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. We'll talk to her shortly. Of course, we could get to the bottom of all the corruption going on in Obama's Justice Department and the FBI if DOJ would stop obstructing. Byron York now asking the important question: why did it take so long for Strzok's infamous anti-Trump texts to be released? Tonight, we're asking the same question. So, Mr. Rosenstein, what's going on? And let me be clear. The threat of impeachment for Rosenstein is very real. And look at this headline. Obama's cyber chief confirms stand-down order against Russian cyber attacks. As I said before, we are only scratching the surface. This deep state is more corrupt and this is more abuse of power than we have ever known. It's really, really dangerous. When we come back, the media insanity.

You know, the Democrats like to talk about Japanese internment camps I notice. They know a lot about Japanese internment camps, the Democrats, since they set them up. Franklin Roosevelt set them up. The Democrat Congress funded them. The FDR and the Supreme Court in the Korematsu decision upheld them. And then they took 120,000 Japanese Americans and Americans of Japanese decent and forcibly removed them from their homes and put them in these Japanese internment camps. So the Democrats know a lot about them. They also know a lot about our current detention policies and facilities since they've been funding them for the last 30 years. They've existed eight years under Bill Clinton, eight years under George W. Bush, eight years under Obama. Then the Clinton administration entered in a consent decree with a liberal overseeing at all that required the release of minors coming across the border illegally and dragged here in many cases by adults. In 1997, it requires the release of them in 20 days. So, this administration says we have got to enforce our laws. We have too many illegal aliens coming in. So they separate the adults from the kids. Just like we do when we send American adults to prison, we don't send the little toddlers with them. So Donald Trump is now Hitler. So Donald Trump says well, let's unite the families. Well, he is uniting the families and he is still Hitler. Now they are saying well the only answer is -- and they are doing that, Sean, for one simple reason. They believe in open borders, they want all those people released. They don't want to deport them. They do not want to send them home. These are not human rights advocates from the left. They are leftist who seek power at all costs. Now if these Democrats really cared about little kids and little babies and so forth, why are they so hard core on partial birth abortion? Have you ever seen those pictures of partial birth abortion? Why do they want to fund the Planned Parenthood outfit? More and more money into that organization. Remember those undercover videos where they are selling babies' organs and body parts? I believe those are babies. And I believe that reminds me I might say of the Third Reich. But they support those organizations and they call partial birth abortion right up to one second before the birth, they call that a choice and a right. They are not fooling anybody. And by the way, where have the media been in the last 30 years? Where's Jake Tapper been? Other than handgun inc, handgun control inc, and a press secretary to a left wing member of Congress. All the stuff going on before Trump ever thought about running for president. All the Nazi concentration camps and Democrat Japanese internment camps. Somehow CNN missed them and MSNBC missed them and the New York Times and the Washington Post missed them. Let me tell you something. The American people aren't fooled by this crap. This is the latest baloney that they're throwing at this president. And this president is trying to get his managed. I have a simple solution. Secure the border but the Democrats won't secure the border. That way we get fewer little kids coming across and they can stay home in their nirvana in their country that they are from, which we know is a magnificent culture because Dick Durbin told us. They are coming from magnificent cultures. So let's secure the border and then we don't have to have Democrats style Japanese internment camps.

Followed by #shecares and #itsjustajacket. Even President Trump, he did weigh in. This tells a lot. \"I really don't care, do you\" written on the back of Melania's jacket refers to the fake news media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are and she truly no longer cares. By the way, good for her. Why should she trust them? And it's pretty unbelievable. Now, the surprise trip took place less than 24 hours after the President Donald Trump signed an executive order effectively preventing the separation of families and children who cross our borders illegally. In doing so, what did he do? He bailed out the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress who by the way this is their mess. This is their law, not his. And the people that have failed to act on the issue. No one wants children separated from parents. The president has been saying it day one. This action now literally, literally transcends these stupid laws that are on the books, passed by Congress, signed into law by a previous president. This is not a permanent solution. In fact, it's not going to hold up in the court system. The real answer, the real long-term solution, the real answer, if you care, the correct answer, the constitutional is Congress to do their job. Pass a bill. Send it to the White House. And despite all of this, President Trump was literally demonized for days in the media for Congress' law, before the executive action.

Jane Fonda's brother Peter the actor. We should rip Baron Trump from his mother's arms and put him in a cage with pedophiles and see if his mother will stand against the giant blank she is married to. Ninety million people in the streets on the same weekend in country, F. Peter Fonda, OK, tried to issue a tepid apology. Melania Trump, she had to contact the Secret Service because her 12-year-old son is threatened. Beyond vile, beyond disgusting. You can't imagine it. And, by the way, Fonda wasn't the only repugnant person on the left to go after a Trump child. Look at this Canadian TV writer attacking Don Jr.'s 4-year-old on Twitter, saying, quote: We're coming for you. Really? This is beyond sick. This is pathological and frankly dangerous. This is now the type of rhetoric that one has to wonder if something happens, who is going to be blamed here? And, meanwhile, we have another horrible example of the left's new low according to an e-mail obtained by Breitbart.com. The writer for \"GQ\" asking Donald Trump Jr. if he wants to have -- I'm not making this up -- sex with his mother. That's how twisted their brains are. Remember, these are the same people that demanded compassion from President Trump. Really? Where is your example? Where is your compassion for children? A 4-year-old, a 12-year-old? And, by the way, what is it going to happen -- what's ever going to happen to Peter Fonda or the person that threatened Kirstjen Nielsen? Or Don Jr.'s son? And, by the way, what would the media be doing if this were the children of Barack Obama? You don't think there is a double standard? Now, despite all this vile, all this hatred, all this insanity, the president is still ready, willing and able, and eager actually to address what is Congress' broken immigration system. It's not his system. It's not his laws. He wants to work with the Republicans and the Democrats alike. He wants to solve the problem. He is willing to give on DACA. He's wiling to give on separation of kids. He's already tried to clean up their mess -- by the way, caused by Obama and Clinton because they never did their jobs. And just months away from the midterms -- what is this? Democrats would rather use the issue to divide you the American people, raise money and win votes.

Instead of fixing America's problems, instead of really helping people and solving problems and helping immigrants, Democrats would rather demagogue, win a midterm election and impose a horrible agenda on the American people -- which includes, by the way, four points.

Their greatest ally is the mainstream media. They are basically the press office for the Democratic Party and they are backing them up every step of the way.

Where was the outrage when the family of immigrant detainees sued President Obama for wrongful death? Where was the outrage following a report that minor illegal, immigrant detainees were brutally abused, beaten under the Obama administration?

It was Obama who said he must follow the laws on the books and that he had no other choice but to deport illegal immigrants.

Well, anti-Trump FBI love bird Peter Strzok, who was the lead prosecutor both to Hillary Clinton server investigation and the Trump-Russia witch hunt has now reportedly finally lost his security clearance. Now, of course, Strzok is just one of five high-ranking anti-Trump FBI employees who were referred for investigation by the inspector general. Now, we know that three of the five abusively biased individuals for Trump, those who loved Hillary and worked on both investigations. And, by the way, they include Strzok, they include Page and an FBI lawyer which was outed by Chairman Meadows named Kevin Clinesmith. By the way, Clinesmith was initially working as a primary attorney in the Russia investigation. But, of course, he was removed in February because his bias was revealed. What about the rest of the Mueller team? Tonight, the Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows is sounding an alarm that possible witness statements may have been altered, what is known as 302s, by some of these bias investigators in order to clear or charge a suspect. That's a big problem. Now, Meadows is also warning that the subpoenas are, quote, forthcoming in days. Sara Carter, who will join us, now reporting this revelation could very likely apply to the prosecution of the Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. We'll talk to her shortly.

      "utterance": "I never thought I'd say this, Sean, but where is Stormy Daniels and her slip-and-fall lawyer when we need them? You know, the Democrats like to talk about Japanese internment camps I notice. They know a lot about Japanese internment camps, the Democrats, since they set them up. Franklin Roosevelt set them up. The Democrat Congress funded them. The FDR and the Supreme Court in the Korematsu decision upheld them. And then they took 120,000 Japanese Americans and Americans of Japanese decent and forcibly removed them from their homes and put them in these Japanese internment camps. So the Democrats know a lot about them. They also know a lot about our current detention policies and facilities since they've been funding them for the last 30 years. They've existed eight years under Bill Clinton, eight years under George W. Bush, eight years under Obama. Then the Clinton administration entered in a consent decree with a liberal overseeing at all that required the release of minors coming across the border illegally and dragged here in many cases by adults. In 1997, it requires the release of them in 20 days. So, this administration says we have got to enforce our laws. We have too many illegal aliens coming in. So they separate the adults from the kids. Just like we do when we send American adults to prison, we don't send the little toddlers with them. So Donald Trump is now Hitler. So Donald Trump says well, let's unite the families. Well, he is uniting the families and he is still Hitler. Now they are saying well the only answer is -- and they are doing that, Sean, for one simple reason. They believe in open borders, they want all those people released. They don't want to deport them. They do not want to send them home. These are not human rights advocates from the left. They are leftist who seek power at all costs. Now if these Democrats really cared about little kids and little babies and so forth, why are they so hard core on partial birth abortion? Have you ever seen those pictures of partial birth abortion? Why do they want to fund the Planned Parenthood outfit? More and more money into that organization. Remember those undercover videos where they are selling babies' organs and body parts? I believe those are babies. And I believe that reminds me I might say of the Third Reich. But they support those organizations and they call partial birth abortion right up to one second before the birth, they call that a choice and a right. They are not fooling anybody. And by the way, where have the media been in the last 30 years? Where's Jake Tapper been? Other than handgun inc, handgun control inc, and a press secretary to a left wing member of Congress. All the stuff going on before Trump ever thought about running for president. All the Nazi concentration camps and Democrat Japanese internment camps. Somehow CNN missed them and MSNBC missed them and the New York Times and the Washington Post missed them. Let me tell you something. The American people aren't fooled by this crap. This is the latest baloney that they're throwing at this president. And this president is trying to get his managed. I have a simple solution. Secure the border but the Democrats won't secure the border. That way we get fewer little kids coming across and they can stay home in their nirvana in their country that they are from, which we know is a magnificent culture because Dick Durbin told us. They are coming from magnificent cultures. So let's secure the border and then we don't have to have Democrats style Japanese internment camps. The families can stay together and the families can live together."

And so we are at the point where the frustration has reached the level that we've got to deal with it. So, you know, issuing subpoenas to compel people to come in and testify.

Sara, this is your story about the fight and what has now, appears now to be contempt of Congress followed by an impeachment at least being filed against Rod Rosenstein. Are they going to do it?

So they should do what they do to you and Dr. Gorka and me. And that's hold them in contempt. Maybe put them in, you know, a jail cell for 10 days. To make him, let's see. They are going to put the screws to him like they do to Manafort who is now in solitaire like he is a mob killer and then maybe he'll sing so they can then, quote, \"either impeach or prosecute Trump.\" Maybe we should use the same tactic against Rosenstein that Mueller is using against the other people."
