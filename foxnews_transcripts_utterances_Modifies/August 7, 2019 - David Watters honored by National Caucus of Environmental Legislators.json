Right now he's on his way to the university medical center of El Paso. He also visited Dayton, Ohio, earlier today.

It's important to think about the mood of a country, because -- like in Times Square, yesterday, mass panic because of a back firing vehicle. Because of this mass coverage and the emotional fervor that the media built, it placed this all in our brains, and so we're always kind of like -- we need -- we need some -- we need a visit like that. And we also have to realize -- I think about the criticism is that we look at these mass shooters and we have to see the similarities, because their political beliefs were different. But the fact is they're the same person. They are the same person. One is a left-winger, one is a right-winger.  You realize the wing doesn't matter. It's actually this lone worthless human being that finds no worth in society. We have to focus on that. It may mean that we may have to give up some of our freedoms to deal with this. These red flag rules we're going to deal -- we're going to be dealing with privacy. We're going to deal with purchasing.   But if we get tied up in the emotional arguments, we're never going to solve any problems. We're just going to get into our team sport, you know, corners and yell at each other and blame each other for different things, and we're never actually going to try to solve the problem.

But you could get -- with these red flag laws which Greg brought up, they go to taking guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or others, so you're not infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners and they are temporary if they, at least, allow people to challenge them in a court of law.

It's important to think about the mood of a country, because -- like in Times Square, yesterday, mass panic because of a back firing vehicle. Because of this mass coverage and the emotional fervor that the media built, it placed this all in our brains, and so we're always kind of like -- we need -- we need some -- we need a visit like that. And we also have to realize -- I think about the criticism is that we look at these mass shooters and we have to see the similarities, because their political beliefs were different. But the fact is they're the same person. They are the same person. One is a left-winger, one is a right-winger. You realize the wing doesn't matter. It's actually this lone worthless human being that finds no worth in society. We have to focus on that. It may mean that we may have to give up some of our freedoms to deal with this. These red flag rules we're going to deal -- we're going to be dealing with privacy. We're going to deal with purchasing. But if we get tied up in the emotional arguments, we're never going to solve any problems. We're just going to get into our team sport, you know, corners and yell at each other and blame each other for different things, and we're never actually going to try to solve the problem. One more point, you don't hear much from the NRA, because they don't have to say anything because the media -- the media has found something they hate more than the NRA."

But you could get -- with these red flag laws which Greg brought up, they go to taking guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves or others, so you're not infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners and they are temporary if they, at least, allow people to challenge them in a court of law. But you could clear confusion about what information should go into the national background check database. You could extend background checks to sales at gun shows and online. That's one thing that you could see happen under President Trump. I wanted to say one thing in terms of the mood of the country. As a nation it's one thing that we do when somebody dies, we show up, and we put our disputes at the door, and you go in and you sit and pray and mourn with people. That is ultimately virtue signaling, not raging online and casting aspersion at people who you don't agree with politically."

I think it's a moral test of whether or not we can find common ground, whether is on eliminating these gun loopholes, or finding ways to bring about more civility. To give these people an opportunity to heal, to come together. I think the president can set the tone. I hope he sets the tone.

But everything in the media is just ripping us apart. I think it's disgusting what the media has done to this president, to cherry pick a manifesto and make him an accessory to a crime. To white wash another social media foot print and totally exculpate the anti-Trump rhetoric coming from one side, and they buried the truth about a lot of what happened. And I think if you point out what's actually out there, you're then called a white supremacist. If you say what's happening on the border, you're a white supremacist. If you donate to the president, you're a white supremacist. There're people that donated to President Trump that also donated to Democrats. There're blacks and Hispanics donating to President Trump. They were people that voted for Obama, and then voted for Donald Trump, and donated to him, and they're all racists, they're all white supremacists?

In some -- Trump didn't say kill all Latinos, but he meant it anyway, so it's not my fault. But she's not the only want hating for ratings.

Don't feed their hostility, because to you and me tragedies are to be mourned and not exploited. At The Five we come up with paths forward, we examined the media and the communities' role in this and how to prevent the next attack if it's possible. It's not as exciting as painting bull's eyes on half the country or your competition, but at least we can sleep at night.

But I think most normal Americans are not engaged in a vitriolic way like you see on television. They have maybe some ideas about gun control, maybe some ideas about mental health, and what you could do as a family member to intercede. But no one is out there saying, normal people, the President of the United States is leading a white supremacist terrorist movement and we need to all of a sudden call every single supporter a racist, because the same people will say that not all Muslims are terrorists, and then they will turn around and say all Trump supporters are racist.

And at a time when the country was focused on police brutality and what happened with Michael Ferguson -- Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, people -- some people felt that she didn't do enough. Well, I do believe that she has a great record to tell on crime. A great record to talk -- and in terms of her criminal justice reform, but, unfortunately, in a debate where you get less than a minute or 30 seconds to respond, you can't really defend yourself."

They're not going to be educated and they're not going to have a good future. I think one of the ways she's trying to recover if she's going up with her first TV ad in Iowa.
