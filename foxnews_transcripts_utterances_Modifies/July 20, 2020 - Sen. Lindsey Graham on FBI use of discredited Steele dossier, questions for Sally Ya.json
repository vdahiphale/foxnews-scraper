      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Thank you. Great show as always. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, we've got a busy night. Buckle up. We are tracking multiple breaking stories, including bombshell new revelations from the Durham probe. We're getting there.  We also bring you the very latest progress in a race for COVID-19 vaccine. A lot of hope again tonight in the battle against this, quote, invisible enemy.  And coming up tonight, we'll have an exclusive interview with the Missouri Governor Mike Parson. He is now vowing to pardon Mark and Patricia McCloskey. Yeah, they were just charged with felonies for illegal weapon, for trying to defend their home when no police were there.  And later, we'll have the very latest on the barely there. That's a corrupt Biden's full embrace of, let's see, Bolshevik Bernie's insane socialist agenda and AOC's insane New Green Deal and oh, yeah, confiscate your guns Beto Bozo and Pelosi and Schumer and Biden 120 years of broken promises and failure. If these insane policies are adopted in 106 days, if they win, watch the race to exit the United States. In fact, we are seeing this play out right now in real-time in America's cities. Obama-Biden, they did nothing for eight years in Obama's hometown of Chicago. They barely mentioned it. You know, wrecked by violence week in and week out, they barely talked about it.  We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden, 125 years of swamp failure. They've done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled the cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens. The only time they shine a light on someone's death, they ignore the 99.9 percent of deaths. They only talk about it, cherry-pick it if it fits their sick political agenda.  Hundreds are shot in Chicago every single week. Same with New York, now Seattle and Portland.   Guess what? You think Joe Biden knows these names? Those are our fellow Americans. Do you think Mayor Lightfoot knows those names? Because only if it helps them politically do they pay attention. So, let's be very clear tonight as we begin this week. Democrats, they have failed America's cities -- decades of rule, decades of failure. They have put ideology over law and order and security and safety. And as a result, our fellow Americans are suffering. Just look what happened this weekend. More sad, preventable, unnecessary violence, destruction and chaos. This is preventable. We can stop it.   The president is pledging now to step in and end the war zones and they are trying to kick him out saying clean up the graffiti and get the hell out of here. Take a look.",

Why, it doesn't fit their political agenda? Most violence never captured on tape.   Over the weekend in Baltimore, you know, the same Baltimore, third highest per capita spending in the industrialized world, 13 public high schools, not one child, not one American child proficient in math -- well, three were killed there. Six wounded during shootings all over the city. In the once great city of Detroit, they recorded 15 shootings, stabbing calls, including two quadruple shootings. And look at this headline from St. Louis -- shooting, stabbings, robberies, a busy night for St. Louis police.  In Chicago, wow, a whopping 70 people were shot. Somebody needs to ask Chuck and Joe and Pelosi and Bozo and AOC and Bolshevik Bernie, do they know their names? Ten were murdered this weekend in Chicago. On Sunday, a memorial service was held for a man who was shot and killed in South Side of Chicago. During that service, three more people were shot, including two more kids. One was 10 years old and was 11 years old. Two little kids shot -- sadly unacceptable acts of violence now routine in liberal cities across the country.  We see this every single weekend. It's a massive scale. The president's right. This is a war zone. This is our American treasure, our children are being murdered.  But the far left so-called protesters in Chicago, they are more interested in toppling a statue of Christopher Columbus. Look at your screen. In this incident, Eighteen police officers were injured on top of what, the 1,300 other police officers injured, the 12, 14 now dead, in this case and a gray mob started throwing frozen water bottles, rocks, brick, fireworks and other projectiles at police officers trying to do their job and keep law and order.  One local alderman is slamming the Chicago Mayor Lightfoot on Twitter for all but ignoring an attack on his office. The alderman's name, Raymond Lopez, tweeting, quote, when you, mayor, refused to call out terror attacks in our communities, elected officials, criminals, they only feel more emboldened.   Now, as Mayor Lightfoot flounders just like Rahm \"Rahmbo\" \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel before, well, President Trump, he's now vowing to take action and fix their mess. According to reports, the Department of Homeland Security is drying up lance to send around 150 federal agents to Chicago. Now, they weren't particularly welcomed in Oregon and Portland they were told by the governor, go home, but first, clean up their graffiti. Multiple federal buildings under attack during weeks and weeks of violent riots. Federal courthouse has been firebombed on multiple occasions. The building exterior now covered in graffiti. Last night in a powerful moment, several people trying to stop the anarchist and rioters from attacking this building yet again. It seems if they had their way, they'd probably do what they did in the CHOP, CHAZ spaghetti potlucks dinner summer of love zone, and that's take control of it, or burn it down like they did in New York.

Another genius idea just like defunding the police, bizarre tweet.   You got Nancy Pelosi, the speaker in the House, really speak in name only - - calling them stormtroopers.  It is now more clear than ever, Democrats seem totally fine with lawlessness is a new normal in America. In fact, many are fully supporting it. Biden, whether he likes to admit it or not, he used the words police have now become the enemy of the people they are supposed to protect. Enthusiastically agreeing that funds should be diverted away from law enforcement, reallocated is the word he uses, even saying, yes, I don't like the word define but reallocating is the same darn thing, isn't it?  Which brings us to a question that I've asked many times. In 106 days, America, you the American people, you are the ultimate jury. And if Biden and Pelosi and Schumer and AOC, Bolshevik Bernie, and Beto Bozo, they implement their plans -- let me ask you a question: who will you call when the police have been defunded and dismantled?

      "sentences": "Here with reaction, Fox News contributor Dan Bongino, host of \"The Rubin Report\", Dave Rubin.  Dave, let me start with you tonight. What's interesting -- a couple of incidents happen this weekend. I'll tell you about a case in Portland, an African-American man with an American flag stands against the protesters tearing down a fence. Then an African- American woman dumped paint on one of the Black Lives Matter, a couple of the murals in New York City. We want our police. Refund the police. Sort of like with Goya. There was the boycott and then the buy-cott that I support. I don't support boycotts. That to me tells me a lot because now this entire has pivoted.   Safety, security, radical socialism, radical environmentalism versus free market capitalism and a great economy Donald Trump created. DAVE RUBIN, \"THE RUBIN REPORT\" HOST : It's crazy to think about that that's really what this has boiled down. You know, I did a little Googling before the show and, Sean, you were born in New York city. I know Dan was born in Queens and I was born in Brooklyn, OK? So, you got the three boroughs right there. There is no panel on television that loves the great city of New York more than the three of us, right? And do we want federal troops in New York? Of course, we don't.   But if the mayor himself, de Blasio, and by the way, this goes, of course, for the mayors of Los Angeles, Chicago, a couple of other adversities you mentioned, if they won't do their job, then Trump has got to do something. And we discussed it a couple weeks ago. Maybe partly with a progressive mayors are doing here is laying a trap so that Trump puts, you know, puts law enforcement in there, federal officers, so it makes him look like the authoritarian that they want him to look like.  But I think the average person of its either my city is going to burn or were going to have to send the feds into fix it, they will choose the side of law and order. And, you know, just think back to what New York City was like before Mayor Giuliani. I'm sure many people remember David Dinkins, who is the progressive, and the entire city was a disaster of crime and drugs, and Times Square, it became a joke. Everybody knows about it. And then what did Giuliani do? He came in, he cleaned it up and New York had about 15 great years. So, it can be fixed but politicians have to have the will to do it.",

Donald Trump, the obstacle between you and the mob, or Joe Biden and total complete chaos. Does anyone with a straight face actually believe Joe Biden has the guts or the smarts to stick up with these big city mayors who have just dominated American politics right now and who have turned their cities over to the criminals in the chaos?

Instead of trying to trying to appeal to centrist voters in independence, this is something pretty spectacular, unique and I believe it's all done out of fear and weakness by the Biden campaign. Biden now has to spend all of his time and energy accommodating the most radical elements of his own party. The Bernie people don't love him, so he's had to take on Bernie's economic plan, wholeheartedly agreeing that yeah, oh, yeah, no, the police have now become the enemy and we have to reallocate the funds away. Divert them, defund. He just doesn't like the word. Literally letting Bernie write his economic policies, AOC is in charge of his environmental task force. He's pledging trillions of dollars. Bozo O'Rourke, his guns czar, the guy's going to knock on doors and take your guns. Who's going to defend you? Chuck, Nancy, ready, willing to ram anything through the socialist want through Congress.

If Biden is elected, this country and those policies are put in place. America will be unrecognizable. No more capitalism. No more energy independence. Amnesty, the united sanctuary states of America, basically confiscate most of what you were, takeover industries, not going to be good. Taxes way up, business is regulated to death. Private insurance, how did that Obamacare keep your doctor plan and save $2,500 a year work? Not well. Local police, see you, goodbye. Borders, yeah, wide open. Amnesty for anybody.

Do we want government running everything apart or lives or do we want them allowing us to be what makes America great, and that's having freedom and prosperity? I think one of the things that the president is doing right, right now, is making very clear that he's a president of law and order. What's taking place in these Democrat-run cities is absolutely tragic and shouldn't go on. And I'm glad that we have a president that's willing to stand up to the liberal mob and do his job.

Let's take him out of the investigation. That's when Strzok tells those people, no, the seventh floor wants to keep going.

Why? Because they dared to stand guard outside their home to protect their home and family, in order to ward off those making threats against them that they explained on this show.

We are tracking multiple breaking stories, including bombshell new revelations from the Durham probe. We're getting there. We also bring you the very latest progress in a race for COVID-19 vaccine. A lot of hope again tonight in the battle against this, quote, invisible enemy. And coming up tonight, we'll have an exclusive interview with the Missouri Governor Mike Parson. He is now vowing to pardon Mark and Patricia McCloskey. Yeah, they were just charged with felonies for illegal weapon, for trying to defend their home when no police were there. And later, we'll have the very latest on the barely there. That's a corrupt Biden's full embrace of, let's see, Bolshevik Bernie's insane socialist agenda and AOC's insane New Green Deal and oh, yeah, confiscate your guns Beto Bozo and Pelosi and Schumer and Biden 120 years of broken promises and failure. If these insane policies are adopted in 106 days, if they win, watch the race to exit the United States. In fact, we are seeing this play out right now in real-time in America's cities. Obama-Biden, they did nothing for eight years in Obama's hometown of Chicago. They barely mentioned it. You know, wrecked by violence week in and week out, they barely talked about it. We have Pelosi. We have Schumer. We have Biden, 125 years of swamp failure. They've done nothing to quell inner-city violent crime anywhere in America, nothing to fix the broken dilapidated disgusting and repulsive educational system. They have failed America's children. We have far left mayors. They have ruled the cities for decades. They have completely failed their citizens. The only time they shine a light on someone's death, they ignore the 99.9 percent of deaths. They only talk about it, cherry-pick it if it fits their sick political agenda. Hundreds are shot in Chicago every single week. Same with New York, now Seattle and Portland. Guess what? You think Joe Biden knows these names? Those are our fellow Americans. Do you think Mayor Lightfoot knows those names? Because only if it helps them politically do they pay attention. So, let's be very clear tonight as we begin this week. Democrats, they have failed America's cities -- decades of rule, decades of failure. They have put ideology over law and order and security and safety. And as a result, our fellow Americans are suffering. Just look what happened this weekend. More sad, preventable, unnecessary violence, destruction and chaos. This is preventable. We can stop it. The president is pledging now to step in and end the war zones and they are trying to kick him out saying clean up the graffiti and get the hell out of here. Take a look."

Why, it doesn't fit their political agenda? Most violence never captured on tape. Over the weekend in Baltimore, you know, the same Baltimore, third highest per capita spending in the industrialized world, 13 public high schools, not one child, not one American child proficient in math -- well, three were killed there. Six wounded during shootings all over the city. In the once great city of Detroit, they recorded 15 shootings, stabbing calls, including two quadruple shootings. And look at this headline from St. Louis -- shooting, stabbings, robberies, a busy night for St. Louis police. In Chicago, wow, a whopping 70 people were shot. Somebody needs to ask Chuck and Joe and Pelosi and Bozo and AOC and Bolshevik Bernie, do they know their names? Ten were murdered this weekend in Chicago. On Sunday, a memorial service was held for a man who was shot and killed in South Side of Chicago. During that service, three more people were shot, including two more kids. One was 10 years old and was 11 years old. Two little kids shot -- sadly unacceptable acts of violence now routine in liberal cities across the country. We see this every single weekend. It's a massive scale. The president's right. This is a war zone. This is our American treasure, our children are being murdered. But the far left so-called protesters in Chicago, they are more interested in toppling a statue of Christopher Columbus. Look at your screen. In this incident, Eighteen police officers were injured on top of what, the 1,300 other police officers injured, the 12, 14 now dead, in this case and a gray mob started throwing frozen water bottles, rocks, brick, fireworks and other projectiles at police officers trying to do their job and keep law and order. One local alderman is slamming the Chicago Mayor Lightfoot on Twitter for all but ignoring an attack on his office. The alderman's name, Raymond Lopez, tweeting, quote, when you, mayor, refused to call out terror attacks in our communities, elected officials, criminals, they only feel more emboldened. Now, as Mayor Lightfoot flounders just like Rahm \"Rahmbo\" \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel before, well, President Trump, he's now vowing to take action and fix their mess. According to reports, the Department of Homeland Security is drying up lance to send around 150 federal agents to Chicago. Now, they weren't particularly welcomed in Oregon and Portland they were told by the governor, go home, but first, clean up their graffiti. Multiple federal buildings under attack during weeks and weeks of violent riots. Federal courthouse has been firebombed on multiple occasions. The building exterior now covered in graffiti. Last night in a powerful moment, several people trying to stop the anarchist and rioters from attacking this building yet again. It seems if they had their way, they'd probably do what they did in the CHOP, CHAZ spaghetti potlucks dinner summer of love zone, and that's take control of it, or burn it down like they did in New York.

It is now more clear than ever, Democrats seem totally fine with lawlessness is a new normal in America. In fact, many are fully supporting it. Biden, whether he likes to admit it or not, he used the words police have now become the enemy of the people they are supposed to protect. Enthusiastically agreeing that funds should be diverted away from law enforcement, reallocated is the word he uses, even saying, yes, I don't like the word define but reallocating is the same darn thing, isn't it? Which brings us to a question that I've asked many times. In 106 days, America, you the American people, you are the ultimate jury.

What's interesting -- a couple of incidents happen this weekend. I'll tell you about a case in Portland, an African-American man with an American flag stands against the protesters tearing down a fence. Then an African- American woman dumped paint on one of the Black Lives Matter, a couple of the murals in New York City. We want our police. Refund the police. Sort of like with Goya. There was the boycott and then the buy-cott that I support. I don't support boycotts. That to me tells me a lot because now this entire has pivoted. Safety, security, radical socialism, radical environmentalism versus free market capitalism and a great economy Donald Trump created. DAVE RUBIN, \"THE RUBIN REPORT\" HOST : It's crazy to think about that that's really what this has boiled down. You know, I did a little Googling before the show and, Sean, you were born in New York city. I know Dan was born in Queens and I was born in Brooklyn, OK? So, you got the three boroughs right there. There is no panel on television that loves the great city of New York more than the three of us, right? And do we want federal troops in New York? Of course, we don't. But if the mayor himself, de Blasio, and by the way, this goes, of course, for the mayors of Los Angeles, Chicago, a couple of other adversities you mentioned, if they won't do their job, then Trump has got to do something. And we discussed it a couple weeks ago. Maybe partly with a progressive mayors are doing here is laying a trap so that Trump puts, you know, puts law enforcement in there, federal officers, so it makes him look like the authoritarian that they want him to look like. But I think the average person of its either my city is going to burn or were going to have to send the feds into fix it, they will choose the side of law and order. And, you know, just think back to what New York City was like before Mayor Giuliani. I'm sure many people remember David Dinkins, who is the progressive, and the entire city was a disaster of crime and drugs, and Times Square, it became a joke. Everybody knows about it. And then what did Giuliani do? He came in, he cleaned it up and New York had about 15 great years. So, it can be fixed but politicians have to have the will to do it."

Donald Trump, the obstacle between you and the mob, or Joe Biden and total complete chaos. Does anyone with a straight face actually believe Joe Biden has the guts or the smarts to stick up with these big city mayors who have just dominated American politics right now and who have turned their cities over to the criminals in the chaos?

Instead of trying to trying to appeal to centrist voters in independence, this is something pretty spectacular, unique and I believe it's all done out of fear and weakness by the Biden campaign. Biden now has to spend all of his time and energy accommodating the most radical elements of his own party. The Bernie people don't love him, so he's had to take on Bernie's economic plan, wholeheartedly agreeing that yeah, oh, yeah, no, the police have now become the enemy and we have to reallocate the funds away. Divert them, defund. He just doesn't like the word. Literally letting Bernie write his economic policies, AOC is in charge of his environmental task force. He's pledging trillions of dollars. Bozo O'Rourke, his guns czar, the guy's going to knock on doors and take your guns. Who's going to defend you? Chuck, Nancy, ready, willing to ram anything through the socialist want through Congress.

There's nothing wrong with wearing a mask. I think you're exactly right. Let's protect those that are vulnerable around us. If we have the ability to do that, let's do it. At the same time, we don't need government dictating every single move we make. Right now, we are looking at I think one of the clearest contrasts coming up in 2020. Do we want government running everything apart or lives or do we want them allowing us to be what makes America great, and that's having freedom and prosperity? I think one of the things that the president is doing right, right now, is making very clear that he's a president of law and order. What's taking place in these Democrat-run cities is absolutely tragic and shouldn't go on. And I'm glad that we have a president that's willing to stand up to the liberal mob and do his job. One of the number one priority of the government and particularly of the president is to keep Americans safe. He's the only one that's talking about how he's going to do that and actually taking action to do it, and I think he's smart to do that. But I also think we need to continue to encourage people to take personal responsibility and do our very best to protect those that are vulnerable around us."

In an effort to defeat the invisible China virus, many people say it's patriotic to wear a face mask, when you can't socially distance. There is nobody more patriotic than your favorite president. And the president tweets out a picture of the mask. He wore the mask. By the way, the two people who don't need to worry about wearing mask are the president and Joe Biden, because you can get around either of them unless you're tested. Putting that aside. Now I want to ask you about the issue of law and order and safety and security. Ari, this is the ad that was put out by the campaign of the president earlier today."

They tried to get a FISA warrant against Carter Page and it was rejected. They find the dossier and, all of a sudden, they get a warrant. Horowitz said without the dossier, there's no warrant. So from January 24th to January 27th, the FBI interviews the Russian sub source who put the dossier together. They created a 40-page memo showing it was a bunch of garbage, not reliable at all. Here's the question. How could it be they continue to use the dossier in April and June of 2017 knowing that in January, the dossier was completely discredited by the person who put it together? Here's the question for me. Did the intel analyst who wrote the memo tell anybody of the chain, all by the way our case just fell apart? I find it almost impossible to believe that senior people at the FBI were not told that in January 2017, the case fell apart against Carter Page."

She was the number two at the Justice Department. On August 5th, she will come before our committee and I appreciate her voluntarily coming. Remember on January 4th, 2017, the FBI agents involved on the ground said, let's drop Flynn from Crossfire Hurricane. We found no evidence at all that he was working with the Russians. Let's take him out of the investigation. That's when Strzok tells those people, no, the seventh floor wants to keep going.

If you can find the person who said that, you're off to the races. It's impossible they wrote this 40-page memo and didn't share it with people at the top. And here's what Peter Strzok said in February 2017: Again, we are unaware of any Trump advisors engaging in conversation with Russian intelligence officials. This is in February 2017. Here's the question. Why the hell was Mueller appointed to begin with if in February, they had no evidence of Trump officials talking to the Russians, working with them?

He sent over 200 FBI agents to the state of Missouri to help us with some of the violent crime problems we have. Defunding the police, getting rid of the police is just the opposite. We need to be doing is we need to be backing up our men and women out there sacrifice their lives every day. We need (ph) to put more officers on the ground to attack violent criminals in the state. And we can see these, quote, peaceful protesters, they quote (ph) to be, but we know there's violence behind them. We know there's people involved in crime almost everywhere we see a protest. And we've got to stand up for that and the president is trying to do that. We, governors, that understand how important it is, me personally because I've spent in law enforcement for 22 years, I'm going to step up for the -- I'm going to stand up for these men and women every day that risked their lives for me and all the other Missouri citizens."

Why? Because they dared to stand guard outside their home to protect their home and family, in order to ward off those making threats against them that they explained on this show. Now, if it's illegal to guard your home in St. Louis, is anyone going to be safe anymore, especially in this day and era of defunding the police? As you just heard and are expensive interview, the Missouri Governor Mike Parson, he said he'll be issuing a pardon. Here with more, we have Fox News contributor Dan Bongino, civil rights attorney Leo Terrell. You know, Leo, the gun was legal but they went and confiscated it? No police showed up that night when they broke into the -- broke down the gate and went into that community. The family described in detail the threats against them.

And that prosecutor, I would love to run against her. I would love to move to Missouri. And here's the problem. It seems like the Democrats will do nothing. On the Democratic network, they had softball questions handed to Joe Biden tonight.
