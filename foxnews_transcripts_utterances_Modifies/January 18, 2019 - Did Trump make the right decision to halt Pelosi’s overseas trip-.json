Fox on top, in the meantime, of a government that is still shut down, as Mother Nature continues to bear down.  Welcome, everybody. This is \"Your World.\" I'm Neil Cavuto. And happy arctic Friday, because an arctic blast is now spreading across the Midwest and the Northeast; 200 million Americans are caught in this deep freeze this weekend, part of New England now looking for upwards of two feet of snow.  More than 3,000 flights have already been delayed or outright canceled in the U.S., and that number is expected to grow. We're all over all of this with meteorologist Rick Reichmuth on just how bad the storm could get, FOX Business Network's Jeff Flock in Chicago, where they are already ready for a heavy now at that, and Alicia Acuna at Denver Airport on why the holiday getaway could make matters worse.  We will talk about that in a second. We begin with Rick.  Hey, Rick.",

      "sentences": "Hey. Yes, a really interesting storm set up for us across such a big populated area, at least in the Northeast, but not just Northeast. The center of the storm right now kind of getting going here right across the Central Plains, Iowa, parts of Missouri, into Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, you get the idea. That's the big piece of energy that's going to really develop, pull up some moisture from the south and watch for some pretty extreme snowfall totals.   We have winter storm warnings from parts of South Dakota, areas of Kansas. And, Neil, this stretches all the way through all of Maine. So it's a really big swathe of area here. So, you're going to be looking at some very heavy snow. And the southern side of this is going to be very rainy, could be seeing some flooding with this line of storms that will move through. And we could be watching severe weather breakout tomorrow on the southern side of this as well. However, go to the north, it's really kind of right on the north side of the Ohio River where we're going to be seeing that transition into snow, and eventually in across parts of the Northeast throughout tomorrow night and into the day on Sunday. By the time this has gone, which will happen, say, Sunday afternoon, I will tell you, get out and shovel your roads or your driveways. Shovel your sidewalk tomorrow afternoon as soon as you see that snow done, because it's going to get really, really cold after that.  And whatever's on the ground is going to freeze very rapidly. Snowfall totals will be extreme across interior sections, that said, I think a little bit lower than we thought yesterday. Yesterday, I think we thought we'd see a lot of areas maybe two feet-plus. Now I think we will see a lot of areas maybe 18 inches to 24 inches.   So, still a lot of snow, but maybe a little bit less. And then right here along I-95, New York down towards Philadelphia, definitely D.C., think we will see a little more rain with this than snow. That will keep the snowfall totals down just a little bit. But there will be snow, and there will be slush and there will be a hard freeze there you go, one inch in New York, but take a look at this, temperatures, Neil, a big concern. Sunday night into Monday, temps will plummet very fast, freeze everything that is out there.  And if it is kind of a thick thing, you're going to want to get rid of it right away.",

We think maybe eight inches, maybe 10 inches in Chicago. I stand in front of the biggest salt pile in the city, as perhaps you can see, city workers continuing to work it there. It kind of gets into a big boulder-like consistency. So they need to keep kind of fluffing it up, if you will.   There are 350,000 tons. Yes, you got that right, 350,000 tons of snow at the ready in Chicago because they haven't had to use it yet. Rick makes a great point, though, in, if you don't get it melted or moved over the weekend, it is going to freeze in place and it'll be with us for God knows how long. Winters tend to last until about May here in Chicago, as you see them work that snow pile. There could be also lake-effect snow here, which, of course, makes it even worse. Even when the storm has passed, you get the precipitation coming in off Lake Michigan. That tends to make it bad here in the city near the lake, as well as Indiana and Michigan, those shores of Lake Michigan, the Western shores of Lake Michigan as well. What can I tell you? Looks like 300 plows, the city tells us, are out or will be out. I leave you maybe with a picture of them. The lights are flashing over there, if Larry is able to see them, those, some of them dump trucks with the plows attached. Those are salt trucks, though, that you see right there, which will soon be filled and out on the street.  Not a disaster, Neil, but a mess, that's for sure.",

Denver International Airport's spokesperson says that, so far, operations here have not been impacted by the partial government shutdown. However, in checking the daily statements from the TSA, the number of employees calling out continues to grow nationwide. The TSA saying its workers reporting financial limitations as the reason, but it also says right now wait times are still within its normal times, although some airports do have longer wait times, for example. And no surprise, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest airport, has the holiday weekend, and folks traveling in and out for the Super Bowl in two weeks.

He said, look, there's a lot of people out there working to protect this event, and they're not getting paid. I talked to a couple of Democratic lawmakers who said that really got our attention. Another one said, if there's anything that would definitely reopen the government, it would be canceling the Super Bowl because of security reasons. Now, nobody's ready to go there yet. I asked Steny Hoyer, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, earlier this afternoon about this. And he said, \"We want people at their sharpest.\" So here's the issue. They still don't have any resolution to this government shutdown. Mike Pence, the vice president, came to the Capitol to meet with Mitch McConnell last night. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, has just left. The meeting between Pence and McConnell is the first substantive event we have had a couple of weeks here on this government shutdown. But there is no end in sight. And here it is late on a Friday afternoon. The Capitol is basically in.

      "utterance": "Hey. Yes, a really interesting storm set up for us across such a big populated area, at least in the Northeast, but not just Northeast. The center of the storm right now kind of getting going here right across the Central Plains, Iowa, parts of Missouri, into Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, you get the idea. That's the big piece of energy that's going to really develop, pull up some moisture from the south and watch for some pretty extreme snowfall totals. We have winter storm warnings from parts of South Dakota, areas of Kansas. And, Neil, this stretches all the way through all of Maine. So it's a really big swathe of area here. So, you're going to be looking at some very heavy snow. And the southern side of this is going to be very rainy, could be seeing some flooding with this line of storms that will move through. And we could be watching severe weather breakout tomorrow on the southern side of this as well. However, go to the north, it's really kind of right on the north side of the Ohio River where we're going to be seeing that transition into snow, and eventually in across parts of the Northeast throughout tomorrow night and into the day on Sunday. By the time this has gone, which will happen, say, Sunday afternoon, I will tell you, get out and shovel your roads or your driveways. Shovel your sidewalk tomorrow afternoon as soon as you see that snow done, because it's going to get really, really cold after that. And whatever's on the ground is going to freeze very rapidly. Snowfall totals will be extreme across interior sections, that said, I think a little bit lower than we thought yesterday. Yesterday, I think we thought we'd see a lot of areas maybe two feet-plus. Now I think we will see a lot of areas maybe 18 inches to 24 inches. So, still a lot of snow, but maybe a little bit less. And then right here along I-95, New York down towards Philadelphia, definitely D.C., think we will see a little more rain with this than snow. That will keep the snowfall totals down just a little bit. But there will be snow, and there will be slush and there will be a hard freeze there you go, one inch in New York, but take a look at this, temperatures, Neil, a big concern. Sunday night into Monday, temps will plummet very fast, freeze everything that is out there. And if it is kind of a thick thing, you're going to want to get rid of it right away."

      "utterance": "Already started, Neil, as perhaps you can tell. I don't know if you can tell, very light snow at this point. But we're on the leading edge of it. We think maybe eight inches, maybe 10 inches in Chicago. I stand in front of the biggest salt pile in the city, as perhaps you can see, city workers continuing to work it there. It kind of gets into a big boulder-like consistency. So they need to keep kind of fluffing it up, if you will. There are 350,000 tons. Yes, you got that right, 350,000 tons of snow at the ready in Chicago because they haven't had to use it yet. Rick makes a great point, though, in, if you don't get it melted or moved over the weekend, it is going to freeze in place and it'll be with us for God knows how long. Winters tend to last until about May here in Chicago, as you see them work that snow pile. There could be also lake-effect snow here, which, of course, makes it even worse. Even when the storm has passed, you get the precipitation coming in off Lake Michigan. That tends to make it bad here in the city near the lake, as well as Indiana and Michigan, those shores of Lake Michigan, the Western shores of Lake Michigan as well. What can I tell you? Looks like 300 plows, the city tells us, are out or will be out. I leave you maybe with a picture of them. The lights are flashing over there, if Larry is able to see them, those, some of them dump trucks with the plows attached. Those are salt trucks, though, that you see right there, which will soon be filled and out on the street. Not a disaster, Neil, but a mess, that's for sure."

You add the partial government shutdown and all that stuff that Rick Reichmuth was talking about, and, whew, here we go. Denver International Airport's spokesperson says that, so far, operations here have not been impacted by the partial government shutdown. However, in checking the daily statements from the TSA, the number of employees calling out continues to grow nationwide. The TSA saying its workers reporting financial limitations as the reason, but it also says right now wait times are still within its normal times, although some airports do have longer wait times, for example. And no surprise, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest airport, has the holiday weekend, and folks traveling in and out for the Super Bowl in two weeks.

We will see what the lines with TSA, the economic impact this is having. I look at all this, and I just go, these are things that are completely avoidable. This is -- it became a government shutdown, in essence, in the last couple decades.

But, I think, look, you lost the presidential election. So the president has a right to come and speak at whatever issues he chooses to. I think it was petty. And I wish all this would end on all ends, and we could just get together and figure out, look, Republicans are probably not going to get everything we want, or we may have to give Democrats something they want, vice versa. But when you start out a from a position of, there will never be a wall and we will never negotiate it, we're stuck in this -- in this problem right now, and we can't see a way out."

What do you think?"

A national emergency are anything from like 9/11 to a swine flu outbreak. So it depends where it falls within that. I would rather that not be the case, because I think this is the kind of thing that Congress needs to grow up and deal with. We need to be adults here. We have to realize that we have got to get out of this politics of the only way to win is if the other side completely loses, because neither side, when they have a branch or a lever of government, they have the option of not completely losing. Let's call it a win-win, or let's call it a lose-lose. I don't care what you call it. But there's a way out of this. And it takes compromise. And I guarantee you, Neil, if we did something like that, it would probably be supported by about 80 percent of the American public, when it was all said and done."

      "speaker": "KINZINGER",

But I think, look, the inconsistencies of Rand Paul -- at one point, he put out a budget that would have slashed the military by something like 25 or 30 percent. On the same day, he called for sanctioning Saudi Arabia for the Khashoggi killing. He called for lifting the sanctions against Russia for their invasion of Crimea. So he's very inconsistent on foreign policy. And it's all -- it's a legitimate viewpoint. It's just one I happen to strongly disagree with, which is, we have to stay on the offense against ISIS. I would love to declare the war against ISIS over too. It would be a lot easier and a lot more comfortable, but it's not a reality. And so there's multiple levels. You have a military part of it, and you also have to help the next generation reject terrorism from within their own religion."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No one has confirmed this, but I want you to see an inflection point in the markets today, and one of the reasons why we ended up 336 points on the Dow, the fourth straight winning week for the Dow, and the best start to the year since 1987. It was this report that the Chinese are committed to buying a whole bunch of American imports over the next six years, enough to erase the trade surplus they enjoy with this country, to the tune of 800-plus billion dollars. This comes a day, even though the Treasury Department denied it, where we had hinted we might roll back some of the tariffs and the like against the Chinese and Chinese products ahead of a trade deal as an act of good faith. Market watchers Larry Shover here -- Shover, I should say -- John Layfield as well. John, how much credence do you give these reports? They were obviously enough to propel, especially today, if it's true on the Chinese part, to eradicate the gap between our countries. But how important was that?"

      "speaker": "JOHN LAYFIELD, CONTRIBUTOR",

It can handle a slowdown in China. It can't handle uncertainty. And what is uncertain right now is this trade war. Is it going to escalate? Is it going to disrupt global supply chains? That's a very big deal to the market, because you can't handicap that and you can't price it. So I think what the Chinese are offering here is a win for President Trump. This is almost exactly, by the way, what they offered in the meeting in Buenos Aires in December, when President Xi and President Trump met face to face. But I think, this time, the president might be under the pressure to take it, just to get a win, to get out of this thing. It doesn't deal with intellectual property. It doesn't deal with all the big things that Lighthizer has a problem with. But it could be an off- ramp."

Earnings reports are coming out no worse than feared. We have this constant positive reverberation with regards to China, whether it's true or not. The market is assuming that a deal is going to be made of some sort. And beyond that, we have -- we have Williams coming out today very dovish, saying something brand-new, that data dependency, not just on rates, but also on the balance sheet run-off. And that's -- that's something the market is hugely concerned with. So, as it stands now, we're trading at about a 15-and-a-half multiple, assuming $173 for the S&P 520, 20 to 40 points higher from here. It's starting -- it'll start to get hard.

While there have been body blows to other markets around the world, and China and concerns about a slowdown, no matter what happens on trade, Britain, whether it stays or goes from the European Union and the Brexit troubles, we have done OK. Why is that? Is it just a flight to quality, we're a great alternative to all that, or what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAYFIELD",
      "utterance": "I think that's exactly right, Neil. You look at what is going on in the E.U. And if you have something like a hard Brexit, that probably gives the green light to Italy to probably drop out of the E.U. as well. And you probably talking about the solvency of the E.U. as an entity going forward. That is terrible for the -- especially for the continent of Europe. It's not great for the globe. But you also look at the slowdown in China. And when you look at those three big economies, when you include the United States in it, we are by far the best out there. We are in a slowdown, but we're not falling off a cliff. We still have full employment. We had record retail earnings this last quarter. This economy is doing OK. It is slowing, but it's by far the best in the world right now."

      "speaker": "SHOVER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's definitely not the snap-back, I mean, although it was a little too far too fast. But what keeps me up at night, if anything is just like corporate debt. I mean, that is something that's not been talked about a whole lot. Household debt is in great shape relative to 2008. But what does worry me is this credit quality of corporations. I think, at some point, as I mentioned earlier, a multiple of 16 times is about what I think the stock -- investors are willing to pay for the S&P 500 because of things like swelling fiscal deficits and also credit quality. So, something like that could come unwound fairly quickly. And given the rapid deterioration of consumer sentiment, which we even saw today with University of Michigan, it's something that's worth pausing about."

    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this is a travesty that the government remains closed. People's lives are being impacted. Federal workers are not being paid. And the fact that Nancy Pelosi was planning a trip to go to Afghanistan, instead of staying and negotiating a settlement to this, and getting government open and back to work, I think, really shows how she has no intention of trying to end the stalemate. I think Chuck Schumer is probably regretting the fact that he made a deal with Nancy Pelosi in December. In December, the House passed a bill that would have fully funded the government, that would have also funded the wall. There were majority votes in the Senate for this to pass. It would have gone on with the president's signature. But Nancy Pelosi, heading toward the speakership, with Chuck Schumer, got that bill blocked in the Senate. And now we're in the hold that we are today. I think the president did the right thing in saying that no military aircraft should be taking Nancy Pelosi and a set of Democrat members of Congress on a weekend trip, when, in fact, there's work to be done in Washington."

This is where, obviously, your focus is -- is distracted. Her focus is, obviously, she wants this to continue. She's for open borders. She doesn't want the border to be closed. This is a core value of hers. And I think that was probably a surprise to Chuck Schumer, because he's -- he's not made it a core value. The fact that she said that a wall is immoral shows the American public that she doesn't have much room to negotiate from. That leaves us all in a stalemate, and without much hope that there's going to be a resolution to this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, because she did vote in the past for wall funding under Barack Obama, as did Chuck Schumer. So there's a lot more in common between the parties, including many in your own, willing to entertain addressing DACA as part of a comprehensive solution. But that doesn't look likely."
    },

Will it work?"

It's going to be a crowded field. In fact, we thought it might be easier to keep track of those not running for the White House in 2020. Be that as it may, it's a crowded field. It's going to have maybe two dozen or more top names all vying to become the next president of the United States. Democratic strategist Robert Patillo joins us, as well as The Federalist's Emily Jashinsky. All right, looking at all of this, Robert, and wondering probably who emerges. I don't know if you have any favorites. But do you ever worry about a field that could be too crowded?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT PATILLO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, no, there's no such thing as a field that can be too crowded. Even look at the Republican field in 2016, where you had an army of Lilliputians trying to take down Hillary Clinton. Eventually, Donald Trump rose to the top, and, against all odds, won. So just because there are a lot of candidates running, what you will see is iron sharpens iron. We bring all these people together in the marketplace of ideas. America will have time, enough debates to get to know these candidates, and find out exactly who they want to compete against Donald Trump in 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Emily, obviously, it was an acrimonious nomination battle for Republicans in 2016. They all settled around and ultimately supported, not in the end fully, but enough, to make Donald Trump the next president of the United States. But it's tough to do that in a divided field, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY JASHINSKY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Yes. So I agree with the point actually that having a full -- the more candidates you have, hopefully, the wider spectrum of ideas that you have represented in the field. I think that's a good thing. But I think there are clear logistical challenges that the Republicans faced -- illustrated by what the Republican faced in 2016. How do you divide debates? And that's something the DNC is working with right now. When you have so many candidates, how do you determine what's fair? Who do you highlight? Who do you give more time to? Who do you emphasize? There are serious logistical challenges that I think Democrats are going to have to confront pretty quickly, because it's looking like it's going to be a very crowded field."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It's also looking, Robert Patillo -- and you know this far better than I, so I will defer to you -- like a field that's going to be hard left. Now, that could change if Joe Biden decides to run. He's considered more moderate in this possible bunch. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATILLO",
      "utterance": "Well, one thing we have seen is that this week on this discussion on the shutdown, the most dynamic voice for young people is when Cardi B made a statement about it. So we're in a reality show culture. We're in a reality show civilization. So when you have that many candidates, it turns into a weekly reality show during the debates. So the more these people argue, the more they put these ideas out there. And we're debating a 70 percent income tax. Let's have an entire debate session on that, so we can explain to people why that won't work for Americans. And that's how you get to a more moderate, centrist candidate and somebody who's going to be the actual voice for those working-class people. What we haven't seen right now in the Warrens and in the -- some of the other further afar, further left candidate is, what are you going to do about bring factory jobs back? What are you going to do about making sure education is available for more young people? What are you going to do about health care? So once we get out of these far leftist ideas, we will get back to a centrist candidate, but it's just going to have to, in a Darwinian way, work its way back together."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Emily, the polls are all over the map. So I don't stress about them one way or the other. But I did find it interesting that the president is picking up more support from Hispanics. That goes against the general view that they would be upset, as if you can typecast them, by his stance on the wall, et cetera. What did you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think actually Republicans always do what would be surprisingly well to people who only pay attention to the liberal narrative with Hispanics. I think that's been the case. And it's certainly true in different Hispanic communities in different states. We see different percentages of the vote going to Republican populate -- going to Republican candidates. But the Hispanic vote is so much more complicated than the narrative in the media often suggests."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAD PERGRAM, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, the reason is because it's a national security event. It's deemed that by the Department of Homeland Security. And Jim Clyburn, the Democratic whip, got the attention of his fellow Democrats in a caucus meeting earlier this week when he mentioned this as being a potential problem. He said, look, there's a lot of people out there working to protect this event, and they're not getting paid. I talked to a couple of Democratic lawmakers who said that really got our attention. Another one said, if there's anything that would definitely reopen the government, it would be canceling the Super Bowl because of security reasons. Now, nobody's ready to go there yet. I asked Steny Hoyer, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, earlier this afternoon about this. And he said, \"We want people at their sharpest.\" So here's the issue. They still don't have any resolution to this government shutdown. Mike Pence, the vice president, came to the Capitol to meet with Mitch McConnell last night. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, has just left. The meeting between Pence and McConnell is the first substantive event we have had a couple of weeks here on this government shutdown. But there is no end in sight. And here it is late on a Friday afternoon. The Capitol is basically in. Nancy Pelosi just left, and the government will probably remain shut down again well through next week."

These are Senate bills which were already conferenced, meaning they went to a conference committee. That's a high level of legislation, not through the floor yet. At some point, some people think that dam might have to break. And what we don't know is, in 11, 12 days, is there going to be a State of the Union message? That could be the tipping point, Neil."
