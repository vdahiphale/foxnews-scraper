Now, President Trump has loosen the rules of engagement. He has allowed the military to use more bombs, for example, and so I think that has helped. But, for me, the bigger question is what is the strategy going forward? There're tens of thousands of ISIS fighters who once they lose this territory in Syria and Iraq are going to go back to Europe, they're going to go online, they're going to radicalize people like we've seen try to commit terrorist attack here in the U.S. So, in terms of the fight against ISIS this is a good step, but the fight is going to continue in a different and almost more dangerous way.",

And you can give credit to President Obama for the strategy in the last year of his term but that was the military commanders, but you have to give credit to President Trump for actually listening to them and getting the job done. And the thing that's interesting to going forward as we look at the global war on terror, this is a victory now, but this is not something that has been completely solved.

And, of course, there are those who makes the case that there are U.S. interests that have to be secured in those places, and I think that argument gets flimsier and flimsier. And the president said as much when he was campaigning. Obviously, the realities of governing are quite different, but the success of containing ISIS is something that has to be satisfying for him. But Katie is absolutely right. You know, we can't hang mission accomplished banners because this can go on so many different directions. Syria has already devolved into civil war. And we've seen places like Yemen and Libya in an absolute shambles. And, you know, I hope that the president continues to indulge his non- interventionist streak. And he has people around him who understand the cost of human life and the amount of money that we have spent overseas.

Because I've talked to a number of people on the left as well, who say these messages that have come to light are actually alarming to them in terms of how this was handled and maybe some of the biases that happened during the Obama administration, not to hold Democrats accountable in the same way that Republicans are being held accountable.

Now, President Trump has loosen the rules of engagement. He has allowed the military to use more bombs, for example, and so I think that has helped. But, for me, the bigger question is what is the strategy going forward? There're tens of thousands of ISIS fighters who once they lose this territory in Syria and Iraq are going to go back to Europe, they're going to go online, they're going to radicalize people like we've seen try to commit terrorist attack here in the U.S. So, in terms of the fight against ISIS this is a good step, but the fight is going to continue in a different and almost more dangerous way."

    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "But I wouldn't argue that the ISIS strategy is completely about Syria. It's actually been more about getting back that territory in Iraq. And so, the administration has done that as you mentioned the rule of engagement, which were severely downplay during the Obama administration. It was not reported that 80 percent of the casualties in places like Afghanistan and Iraq happened under Obama's watch as a result of this rules of engagement, second guessing the commanders on the ground. And you can give credit to President Obama for the strategy in the last year of his term but that was the military commanders, but you have to give credit to President Trump for actually listening to them and getting the job done. And the thing that's interesting to going forward as we look at the global war on terror, this is a victory now, but this is not something that has been completely solved. And we're attacking terrorists in places like Somalia. We've just learned that the number of bombing since Donald Trump took office have doubled in Somalia in partnership with the government there..."

That's why whenever we have good news like the caliphate as 98 percent contain, you always have to wonder what's the mission creek, what's the next step? What is the ultimate goal of the United States? And, of course, there are those who makes the case that there are U.S. interests that have to be secured in those places, and I think that argument gets flimsier and flimsier. And the president said as much when he was campaigning. Obviously, the realities of governing are quite different, but the success of containing ISIS is something that has to be satisfying for him. But Katie is absolutely right. You know, we can't hang mission accomplished banners because this can go on so many different directions. Syria has already devolved into civil war. And we've seen places like Yemen and Libya in an absolute shambles. And, you know, I hope that the president continues to indulge his non- interventionist streak. And he has people around him who understand the cost of human life and the amount of money that we have spent overseas. The president had said that himself in regards to infrastructure spending saying, hey, why are we spending $7 trillion in overseas wars when we should essentially be spending that here in this country making our bridges and roads in better condition?"

I mean, everybody hates ISIS, so we're kind all together on that. I think people, you know, here, I give President Obama credit when he had success in that area. I also think it was great when he went back on his word and he kept Guantanamo Bay, like, I was glad he broke that promise. I think when he gets down with, a lot of times -- you know, he ran against his own -- I'm going to close Guantanamo, I'm going to change our foreign policy.

Not only people talking about it politically, but an official government office being used to talk about some kind of insurance policy. And I think it's legitimate that people have questions about what exactly that meant. Now Christopher Wray, the new FBI director, has an obligation to go through, remind his agents, especially the top brass working around him, that politics cannot impede any of your investigations, and none of your decisions can be made based on how you feel about particular candidates and what they are saying. And he has an obligation to do it in a transparent way so that the American people as a whole -- not Trump's ardent base supporters, but the American people as a whole -- can regain some kind of confidence in the FBI. Because I've talked to a number of people on the left as well, who say these messages that have come to light are actually alarming to them in terms of how this was handled and maybe some of the biases that happened during the Obama administration, not to hold Democrats accountable in the same way that Republicans are being held accountable.

If they were 70, they were most likely to see 75 or 80, if they, in fact, went outside of their house. So if you find that you have been shut in and isolated, but you want to live a long and productive life, there is a direct correlation between you getting out of your house and living longer. So go ahead. Find a way. Call a friend or family member. Make sure they drive you somewhere. Better yet, walk, if you can. Get out, live longer."
