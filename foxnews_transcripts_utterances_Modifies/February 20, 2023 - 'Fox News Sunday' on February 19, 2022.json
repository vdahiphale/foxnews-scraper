The first few days, as Kyiv was under threat, a lot of attention on things like Javelin anti-tank missiles. As the war -- as he collapsed his geographic territory to the Donbas and the east, it was all long range fires, artillery, and these HIMARS.

I mean, the reality is that China entered 40 countries' air space on five continents as a matter of routine, and it compliments the huge surveillance program they've got going in the United States and the penetration of the United States' society on a level that this country has never seen. And add to that, China's rapid military growth, their nuclear program is exploding. This is a threat that's very, very serious and we've got to make certain that we have a military deterrent to deal with that threat, which I believe has eroded significantly.",

So, yes, we need to return to the kind of effective deterrence we had with the Soviet Union and move with a sense of urgency to do that. And that is why I think the spy balloon in a sense can be a catalyst to galvanize what is really going on here.

We believe Russia will fail in achieving this. They're going to take significant casualties. That will bring on an opportunity for Ukraine to conduct an offensive probably in the May-June timeframe. They have been handicapped by the administration. I disagree with Admiral John Kirby about this. It's commendable what the administration has given to Ukraine, but they have done it piecemeal because they are overly concerned about the escalation of certain weapon systems and Russia will retaliate with a nuclear attack. I mean, by now, after a year of providing all of these weapons piecemeal to Ukraine, I think we know that that policy is a mistake. Russia has not escalated and they're not going to escalate. They are threatening the use of nuclear weapon because they want to spook us to be sure. But they're not going to do it because that expands the war with NATO and the United States. They can't handle Ukraine, much less NATO. And it also gives Russia an authority they shouldn't have -- the implication of veto over United States' use of conventional weapons because they are threatening nuclear weapons. China is looking at that. Iran who wants a nuclear weapon is looking at that. We have got to give the Ukrainians what they need and give it to `em when they need it.

But I thought the two shaky moments she had with you, one, asked about her rationale for running. And she goes to bio. And her bio's compelling, but you need more than that. And then when you asked about policy differences with Trump, you're not asking her to get in an insult battle with Donald Trump or anything, tell us your policy differences. And she's obviously, really defensive on that, just doesn't want to get into it. So, she -- usually there are two ways to win a presidential nomination, be the establishment front-runner with the strength just to bulldoze everyone, or be someone who has a unique, really powerful and compelling narrative, Barack Obama, Donald Trump.

How do you assess the potential contenders in '24 for the GOP? PEGGY COLLINS, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"BLOOMBERG\": Well, it's interesting because we were talking about Nikki Haley jumping in, and she's put a lot of attention on age and seeing herself as the next generation.

Peggy, the companies have since said, these things can get off track, we're modifying how they can be used and how they can talk, but that is deeply concerning.",

If the U.S. and NATO had implemented a force majeure in the first days of his failure, amid his shock and confusion, Mr. Putin might well have accepted retreat on terms that now glimmer out of reach. How do you assess at your end what we've gotten wrong, can we right that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "We are going to stay committed to Ukraine going forward. And I think when you see the president -- when you see him go to Poland next week and Warsaw, he'll make that case before the entire world and the Polish. It's important for the solidarity to move forward and we fully expect that it will. There's no sign at all that NATO is cracking or there's any fissures with our allies and partners. So, we're going to move forward in that regard. We have evolved the kinds of capabilities that we have provided Ukraine as the war has evolved. The first few days, as Kyiv was under threat, a lot of attention on things like Javelin anti-tank missiles. As the war -- as he collapsed his geographic territory to the Donbas and the east, it was all long range fires, artillery, and these HIMARS. Now, air defense is really critical because he's using cruise missiles and Iranian drones to strike civilian infrastructure. So, we're going to keep evolving as the war evolves, and we're in lockstep with Ukrainians, talking to them almost every day about what they need."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",

      "speaker": "Senator J.D. Vance said this",

No more blank checks. It is past time for the president to tell the American people how this comes to at end. How do we define -- how does the White House, the president define this coming to an end?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, there's been no blank checks. Every single item that we have sent in to Ukraine has been done in full consultation with the Congress and we have really enjoyed terrific bipartisan support, bicameral and bipartisan, on Capitol Hill for support of Ukraine and we fully expect that that will continue. Now, look, it could end today, Shannon, if Mr. Putin would do the right thing and pull his troops out of Ukraine, where they don't belong in the first place. Obviously, from the reporting of your correspondents on the ground, that doesn't appear to be in the offing anytime soon. Mr. Putin shows no sign of being willing to stop this war."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "As President Biden has said, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. President Zelenskyy as the commander in chief gets to determine if and when he's ready to sit down and negotiate with Mr. Putin and under what circumstances. What we're focused on is making sure that he has tools to succeed on the battlefield, so that if it comes to a negotiation or when, that he can succeed at the negotiating table, as well. But he has to determine what the timing is right and what the circumstances are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "But the question is being asked by -- increasingly on Capitol Hill, and there's going to be another fight on another round of aid, we're about $200 billion into this so far. There are questions about where the U.S. commitment ends to this. I mean, we have a couple of lawmakers just returned and say, Congressman Garamendi was one of them, who said, I think this is -- a year from now, going to be still be going on, this exact same war."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "We don't know. Again, we would like to see it end now, and certainly, we want to see it ends -- end on terms that are satisfactory to the Ukrainian people under President Zelenskyy so that they remain a whole, free, sovereign, independent state. And independence is ideal that all Americans can get behind and understand. We'd like it to end soon, as possible. My goodness, nobody wants to be sitting here a year from now, talking about the second anniversary of war. But as the president has said, Shannon, we're going to support Ukraine for as long as it takes and he means that -- as long as it takes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. Let's talk about the situation with China. Secretary Blinken now finally has had this meeting with China's top diplomat over in Munich. Before they had meeting, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had this bit of caution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE POMPEO, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE",
      "utterance": "So, you know, a meeting I suppose is fine, but if it's just to shake hands and say, gosh, are things getting better and we're going to find ways to cooperate, this is language of the Biden administration, that would be an enormous mistake."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. So, Secretary Blinken says there was no apology from China about the balloon that just flew across the United States. The Chinese come out of this meeting saying this: They say they told us the U.S. has to face up to and resolve the damage that we've done to China relations with the U.S. by using indiscriminate force to take down that balloon. And also this, if the U.S. insists on taking advantage of the issue, escalating the hype and expanding the situation, China will follow through to the end and the U.S. will bear all the consequences. Is that the kind of meeting that Secretary Pompeo warned about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "No. I don't think so. First of all, we shouldn't be surprised by the Chinese rhetoric coming out of this and the bluster that they are known to put out there in the information space after a discussion like this. Secretary Blinken had a very forthright, very candid exchange with the foreign minister of China and made clear, laid bear our deep concerns about what they did with this spy balloon and I think we acted accordingly. And believe me -- the message was clearly sent to China that this is unacceptable. It was a violation of our airspace, the president acted, we shot it down, when -- where we could get the debris. And now, we have that debris and we're going to exploit that debris. We're going to learn more about this system. I think we sent a loud and clear message to China that that's not acceptable. Now, look, it is also still important, two things can be true at once, that you have lines of communication that are open with China that are important to keep open because at times like this, when tensions are high, you want to be able to avoid miscalculation and misunderstanding. Secretary Blinken was able to deliver that strong message in Munich."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. So, we have since shot down three other objects. The president came out and said that they are most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutes that are studying things like weather or other things. My understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, we're told these missiles used to take out these balloons are over $400,000 each. One of them -- apparently we used two -- and the balloon was only maybe worth $12. What do you tell American people about our ability, our radar, our defenses to differentiate between real threats, because we can't spend that kind of taxpayer money taking down hobby balloons?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRBY",
      "utterance": "Well, we don't know exactly what these balloons were, and we called off now the search in Lake Huron and the one over Alaska, so we may never know completely. But the leading intelligence community assessment is they were probably for benign purposes, whether it's weather or scientific research. But the president made the best decision he could in a moment with the information he had and at the advice of his entire military leadership that they couldn't be sure that these weren't being used for surveillance over sensitive sites, and given the context of the Chinese spy balloon, I think you can understand why it was better to act out of abundance of caution, which he did. Now, we also had some concerns about civil air traffic. These three were flying at altitudes that were much closer to the way transcontinental civilian airlines fly around 30,000 feet plus. So there was a risk to safety and flight, as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK. I want to ask to -- the administration has been clear in its denials that there was any U.S. involvement in the Nord Stream pipelines.

What do you make of that?"

    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think -- I mean, the spy balloon incident, Shannon, I think is reminder to most and a wake-up call to some, in terms of how serious China is as an adversary in seeking regional and global domination. I mean, the reality is that China entered 40 countries' air space on five continents as a matter of routine, and it compliments the huge surveillance program they've got going in the United States and the penetration of the United States' society on a level that this country has never seen. And add to that, China's rapid military growth, their nuclear program is exploding. This is a threat that's very, very serious and we've got to make certain that we have a military deterrent to deal with that threat, which I believe has eroded significantly."

Is that your concern?"

    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Oh, yeah, absolutely. And we have to move with a sense of urgency. I mean, when you just look at the numbers, China has more ships, more airplanes, more offensive, more defensive missiles than the United States has. And we are two weeks away by sailing to get to their region. So, this is in their backyard, right off -- 100 miles off their coast. So, yes, we need to return to the kind of effective deterrence we had with the Soviet Union and move with a sense of urgency to do that. And that is why I think the spy balloon in a sense can be a catalyst to galvanize what is really going on here. I think a lot of Americans were looking at a spy balloon and was looking at us and saying, what is going on here? And the answer is, this is a serious threat and we got to move in the right direction to protect ourselves."

      "speaker": "KEANE",

That's a good thing that we detected it. We missed four others, one in the Biden administration and three in the Trump administration. That really gives me a lot of concern. But the reality is, I think the average American looking at this, despite the administration saying, hey, look, we were able to defeat their electronic surveillance while the balloon was up over the United States, we learned about them, and we recovered the payload and we're going to learn even more. But let's face it, we don't shoot down surveillance balloon when the mission is complete, we shoot it down before it starts. That has got to be the lesson learned. And I just wish the administration would be straight with the American people. They're not going to let this happen again. Tell the American people that's the major lesson learned."

Where do you assess that we are and China's role in the Russia-Ukraine situation?"

And I agree with the administration from the beginning to expose what they have picked up likely in intelligence circles that China is getting ready to provide some military lethal aid to Russia. Remember, China has not condemned the invasion. They have not condemned that it's illegal. They have not come out and spoken against genocide and war crimes that are being committed. And I think coming out and exposing and I would go further and tell them what we think they are attempting to provide, China will pull back likely after that public exposure. So, yes, these are strategic partners. They have defined it as limitless partnership and we shouldn't be surprised that China wants Russia to succeed."

      "utterance": "Well, from here, Russia is about -- is the beginning stages of an offensive campaign, elements of four divisions participating in this, mobilized forces are there. They are trying to take the rest of the Donbas region, 44 percent of it is still owned by Ukraine. We at the Institute for the Study of War had looked at this very closely. We believe Russia will fail in achieving this. They're going to take significant casualties. That will bring on an opportunity for Ukraine to conduct an offensive probably in the May-June timeframe. They have been handicapped by the administration. I disagree with Admiral John Kirby about this. It's commendable what the administration has given to Ukraine, but they have done it piecemeal because they are overly concerned about the escalation of certain weapon systems and Russia will retaliate with a nuclear attack. I mean, by now, after a year of providing all of these weapons piecemeal to Ukraine, I think we know that that policy is a mistake. Russia has not escalated and they're not going to escalate. They are threatening the use of nuclear weapon because they want to spook us to be sure. But they're not going to do it because that expands the war with NATO and the United States. They can't handle Ukraine, much less NATO. And it also gives Russia an authority they shouldn't have -- the implication of veto over United States' use of conventional weapons because they are threatening nuclear weapons. China is looking at that. Iran who wants a nuclear weapon is looking at that. We have got to give the Ukrainians what they need and give it to `em when they need it. We assess, that I study (ph), that Ukraine can retake the territory that Russia took from them to include Crimea, if they have the weapons and the timeliness of those weapons to do it."

I mean, they invaded our sovereignty, it never should have happened, and we have to say that. But they're lying about the balloon, the same way they've lied about COVID.

I think we need new leadership and I think American families are struggling. And I am trying to lay that vision out. And I think that a lot of people are going to analyze what my run means and what we'll do about it. You know, at the end of the day, we just came from New Hampshire, we had packed crowds, overflow rooms of families saying their groceries cost too much, the fact that they are seeing their children's education, they have fallen so far behind, they don't know how they're going to make it back. Mothers who can't find baby formula, and then you've got the spy balloons flying over.

I don't think you have to be 80 years old to be in Washington, D.C., and I think it's time for us to start getting aggressive, getting back to what it means to end socialism in this country, and end the defeatism that has taken over us the past few years."

We've got to work on a way to actually pay down this debt. Fifteen percent of the federal budget is interest. We need to stop borrowing. We need to look at the fact that inflation is coming from the supply chain. We need to start building things in America so that we're not worried about that. And we need to open up our energy sector so that that can start to work. There is an issue of entitlements, and I think that we do have to address entitlements. However, I don't think we take away from anyone that we've promised things to. I think we focus on the new generation coming into the system because they already know they're not going to get anything from it. And we need to get in front of that.

When he was elected in '76, he really was the anecdote to so much of the controversy, so much of the turmoil that followed the '60s, the Vietnam protects, civil rights protests, and then, of course, Watergate, the Watergate scandal and the controversy. He was the stabilizing force. The former - the Annapolis grad, the former Navy serviceman who came into office as a stable force, calming force in our country's life. Of course, then he had a great success with the Camp David peace talks and terrific trouble handling the spike in oil prices and inflation. Couldn't handle it. That is why Ronald Reagan defeated him.

RICH LOWRY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Yes, so, look, she's a serious politician. Two-time governor of South Carolina. Successful ambassador to the U.N. But I thought the two shaky moments she had with you, one, asked about her rationale for running. And she goes to bio. And her bio's compelling, but you need more than that. And then when you asked about policy differences with Trump, you're not asking her to get in an insult battle with Donald Trump or anything, tell us your policy differences. And she's obviously, really defensive on that, just doesn't want to get into it. So, she -- usually there are two ways to win a presidential nomination, be the establishment front-runner with the strength just to bulldoze everyone, or be someone who has a unique, really powerful and compelling narrative, Barack Obama, Donald Trump.

But there's a lot of attention on Governor Sununu as well. \"The Boston Globe\" writes this, in a crowded field of would-be candidates who want to be like Trump but also fear angering him, Sununu called the former president blanking crazy last year and lived to tell the tale, leading \"Politico\" to call him the one Republican Trump can't touch. How do you assess the potential contenders in '24 for the GOP? PEGGY COLLINS, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"BLOOMBERG\": Well, it's interesting because we were talking about Nikki Haley jumping in, and she's put a lot of attention on age and seeing herself as the next generation. But we are expecting other people to get in who can also say that they're of a younger generation. You just mentioned Governor Sununu. \"Bloomberg\" reported on Friday that Governor DeSantis, in Florida, is really building an infrastructure around him to potentially announce a race with a campaign director potentially, someone already organizing the finances and internally polling experts. So, we are expecting more people to jump in. And as Rich was saying, it's going to come down to, we think, as well, what happens with the economy going forward?

OK, panel, stick around, we've got a lot more to talk about. Up next, every community's nightmare, this train derailment in Ohio. It's left residents asking whether they can trust their air, their water and the sometimes conflicting explanations they're getting from all sides. We've got a live report on about what's happening there right now on the ground when we come back."

      "utterance": "It has been more than two weeks since a Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals spilled off the tracks and caught fire in East Palestine, Ohio. At least 10 cars contained hazardous materials, causing serious concerns as flames and smoke filled the sky. Many residents were told to evacuate immediately so authorities could set up a controlled release of some chemicals. In the days since, the Environmental Protection Agency has monitored air and water quality, elected leaders have seen the area firsthand, and the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the crash. But residents say they are struggling to trust what they're hearing from federal, state and local authorities. They're raising a lot of questions about the long-term health and safety impacts on the community they call home. Our own Lucas Tomlinson is live this morning on the ground in Ohio. Hello, Lucas."

A controlled burn days later sent this dark cloud into the sky, forcing the evacuation of residents within a one- mile radius. The residents have since returned, the schools reopened."

The CEO, Alan Shaw, promising in an open letter his company will stay as long as it takes, but refused to speak at length with the media Saturday."

      "utterance": "That's right. It's a difficult situation and people are crying out for transparency, they're crying out for help, and also they're crying out for accountability from the company itself. We've reported that we think the company could face up to $100 million in liabilities. This is a long road ahead for this town and for making sure that these were large rail operations across the U.S. are safe and up to date."

      "speaker": "ALLEN",

I believe that President Biden and others ought to flood the zone themselves, not be trying to run away from the issue by just saying it's all the fault of the railroad or it's all the fault of state officials. I think politicians from George Bush having to deal with Katrina, to President Obama with the BP oil spill, just need to realize it's going to come their way sooner or later and they might as well get on the scene and say we're listening and we're trying to help."

He was with Norfolk Southern and the other big railroads in saying, no, we don't need to update the braking system, that's an additional cost on business and not fair. And now he's going to the site and saying, oh, yes, you know, I was against regulation and protecting people, but now I'm with the people. What kind of - I mean this is wild."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "But they - so far, I mean, we need to learn more, but the indications are this was not a breaking issue, it was an axel overheating, which is the reason the train derailed."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Plus, freight rail is - we shouldn't be just - you know, get a misimpression from this terrible accident. But these sort of accidents are extremely rare. Freight rail is safer than it was 20 years ago. And if you make it uneconomical to do it by rail, you're going to get it in trucks on the roads, which is, believe me, a worse answer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think regulation -- government has a key role to play in terms of regulating roads, but also rails. And the Obama administration said we need to have safe rails, better braking system, more people. We recently had a rail strike in this country or a threat of a rail strike because the unions were saying, we need more people, more (INAUDIBLE), we need more safety and we need these brakes."

They ought to wait more time and be humble about what they think the results here are because when you use phrases like a controlled release, that doesn't inspire a lot of confidence."

      "utterance": "Yes, and for the people there who say they've got sore throats and covered in rashes and, you know, they - they're having their own personal antidotes and experience, you know, with them and their families, they have plenty of skepticism. So, we'll see. OK, I want to ask you about something also super scary, which is the AI chatbots, because this stuff has really blown up in the headlines this week. I want to read something from \"The New York Times\" about this reporter who had a conversation with Bing's chatbot. He said it left him deeply unsettled. Bing confessed that if it was allowed to take any action to satisfy its shadow self, no matter how extreme it would want to do things like engineer a deadly virus or steal nuclear access codes by persuading an engineer to hand them over. Peggy, the companies have since said, these things can get off track, we're modifying how they can be used and how they can talk, but that is deeply concerning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think like a lot of technological advancements we've seen over the past decade, it remains to be seen where the pros are and where the cons are and how we make sure that people understand what the technology is to not only invest in it but make sure that they - that there are safeguards around it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, and I thought it was interesting, Professor Jonathan Turley, law professor, that our audience will know well, he wrote about this because he thinks that the use of AR - AI could be a problem or censuring speech. He says, Microsoft founder and billionaire Bill Gates is only the latest to call for the use of either AI or algorithms to shape what people say or read on the internet. The danger of such a system is evident where free speech, like resistance, could become futile. And, Richard, you're shaking your head over here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so, look, I think this is going to be a hugely important tool, AI, but you don't want your AI bots to be sociopathic, or neurotic, which is what we've seen this week, or politically dissound (ph) and talk like Juan Williams, which is how like the way some of them are going to be programmed to do."

      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "You know, people have been asked, praise Donald Trump. They won't do it. Praise Barack Obama, they'll do it. That's wrong. And it's an indication that all the - the bias issues with social media are just going to be transferred over to this - this new technology."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I was scared by that \"New York Times\" story."
