But, for now, the count goes on in at least four crucial battleground states. And if that goes on as intended here, we should have some results within, we're told, another week that could confirm one way or the other whether Joe Biden is indeed the president-elect of the United States.  Already having crossed the 270 electoral vote threshold, it seems a foregone conclusion, but the president and his team of lawyers battling one by one.  We're going to be going state by state, city by city on where that count is going on, and how it's bedeviled not only Democrats going after Republicans, but in a couple of key precincts Republicans going after Republicans.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" First want to go to John Roberts at the White House right now on the legal strategy the president's employing to get the count going and maybe see some signs that it could be going his way. That might be a leap, but we will get the latest now from John -- John.",

But, first of all, just to let where we are right now, this hour, the president will be meeting with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin. The president is still doing some presidential business.  And what is some big news, the president signing an executive order which will prohibit Americans from investing in some 31 Chinese companies that support, supply and help modernize the People's Liberation Army. The president is saying American money will not be used to modernize the Chinese army, so that executive order brand-new this afternoon.   Also, probably topics of conversation in that meeting today will be new restrictions on H-1B visas that the president is expected to announce it in executive order soon, and the possibility for parents who are sending their kids to either private or parochial school because of coronavirus lockdowns and public schools may be able to get some money for that. Now, to the lawsuits, Pennsylvania, a bit of a moral victory more than anything for the Trump campaign, symbolic victory, at least, as a judge rules that Kathy Boockvar, the secretary of state of the state of Pennsylvania, did not have the authority to say that people who needed to show identification in order for their ballots to count would have until the 9th of November to do it, the judge saying that she had no authority to do that. So, those votes, which have all been sequestered and not counted, will likely be tossed out. But the Trump campaign is looking at this as potentially a harbinger of what may happen when it comes to the Supreme Court, because there is a case before the Supreme Court that is going to decide, if they take it up, whether or not the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had the authority to order an extension past 8:00 p.m. on election night to receive mail-in votes.   Another big thing that's going to be happening very soon in the next day or two is the beginning of the recount in Georgia. Congressman Doug Collins of Georgia is the point person for the Trump campaign on that. Here's what he said about it today:",

It's being suggested that President Trump should as well, though no determination has yet been made whether the president will campaign in Georgia.  And one thing I have got to say, Neil, is that it's now been almost eight days. It was a week ago today that we last saw the president come out and speak with us. I have never seen him be silent for so long. Obviously, he is prolific on Twitter, but no public statements that we have seen, so highly unusual.

Before I get to Jacqui Heinrich on how the Biden camp is responding to all of this, I want to bring you up to date on what really the focus seems to be now narrowed to three states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona. Together, they encompass about 47 electoral votes, in Pennsylvania, where Eric was, of course, 50,000-vote gap, amounting to about three-quarters of  1 percent. In Michigan, already called for Joe Biden -- all these states were -- 146,000-vote gap, amounting to a little bit more than 2.5 percent, and finally, in Arizona, 13,000-vote gap, about four-tenths of a percent. The president and his people are hoping that, with the count and some of these improprieties they charge are going on and the fraudulence going on, that all of those will be reversed and they will gain those 47 electoral votes, and that's it. There's a separate case with Georgia we will be getting into. But suffice it to say, that tends to be the big focus right now. Again to Jacqui Heinrich right now in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the vice president, who's already busy looking at possible Cabinet picks.

The focus now is on picking his Cabinet posts, his administration. The jockeying sure has begun. And some people are being a little more subtle than others. Delaware Senator Chris Coons, who's a close ally of the president-elect, who is said to be vying for secretary of state, today, his office announced he will be participating in a virtual summit on American global leadership in the time of COVID-19 alongside Cindy McCain, who is on the Biden transition advisory board.  Coons just also penned an op-ed in Foreign Affairs titled \"A Bipartisan Foreign Policy Is Still Possible.\" Senator Elizabeth Warren, reportedly vying for Treasury secretary, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post yesterday. She wrote: \"We know that Washington insiders and their establishment allies are ready to declare that unity and consensus mean turning over the keys to giant corporations and their lobbyists, the exact opposite of what voters want. Democrats must resist this pressure.\" But Congresswoman Marcia Fudge laid it all on the table, not mincing words about wanting to head up the Agriculture Department, telling Politico: \"I do know there are many people who are lobbying. My name was mentioned even before the election. I have been very, very loyal to the ticket and I will remain loyal to the ticket.\" There are a lot of folks, though, who want to see Bernie Sanders running the Labor Department. But with the balance of the Senate still a question, Senator Sanders knows he might have to fight hard on the floor for the promises made to get Biden progressive backing.   And that includes raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and also moving away from the fossil fuel industry.",

And, as you and your colleagues have mentioned, that does seem to be president-elect Biden. So, if that is the case, then why can't we get this process started for intelligence briefings, for president-elect Biden and his team, for the folks who are on these different transition teams, certainly in the national security realm, to show up to the General Services Administration building, and get clearances, get the right access to different departments and agencies that they will need to go to?

She's no fan of theirs, and they of her. But, of course, that might be a bit of a dicey proposition. We will get into that, having nothing to do with Elizabeth Warren, but the fact that she's a senator and the governor of her state is a Republican. I think you know how that goes. We have got Adam Lashinsky with us, FOX News contributor, Business Insider contributor writing, much, much more, David Asman, of course, a star on FOX Business, which, if you don't get, you should demand.

Stef, end it with you and begin with you on this pushing for a post in a Biden administration. The Bernie Sanders one struck me as a little odd and the labor secretary post. I could see that.

And that's precisely what Bernie Sanders wants to do. And he's been very open about it. And he comes out with a position paper called corporate accountability and democracy, in which he outlines the various things he would likely do as either president or secretary of labor. And to a large degree, workers, in his view of the new America, would replace both management and shareholders as -- in decision-making and profits. I mean, he would mandate, for example, that all publicly traded companies should provide at least 2 percent of the stocks to workers every year until the company's 20 percent owned by employees. He would mandate that 45 percent of board directors in any large corporation be directly elected by the firm's workers. So, essentially, he's creating the socialist ideal of a workers' marketplace.

But, first of all, just to let where we are right now, this hour, the president will be meeting with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin. The president is still doing some presidential business. And what is some big news, the president signing an executive order which will prohibit Americans from investing in some 31 Chinese companies that support, supply and help modernize the People's Liberation Army. The president is saying American money will not be used to modernize the Chinese army, so that executive order brand-new this afternoon. Also, probably topics of conversation in that meeting today will be new restrictions on H-1B visas that the president is expected to announce it in executive order soon, and the possibility for parents who are sending their kids to either private or parochial school because of coronavirus lockdowns and public schools may be able to get some money for that. Now, to the lawsuits, Pennsylvania, a bit of a moral victory more than anything for the Trump campaign, symbolic victory, at least, as a judge rules that Kathy Boockvar, the secretary of state of the state of Pennsylvania, did not have the authority to say that people who needed to show identification in order for their ballots to count would have until the 9th of November to do it, the judge saying that she had no authority to do that. So, those votes, which have all been sequestered and not counted, will likely be tossed out. But the Trump campaign is looking at this as potentially a harbinger of what may happen when it comes to the Supreme Court, because there is a case before the Supreme Court that is going to decide, if they take it up, whether or not the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had the authority to order an extension past 8:00 p.m. on election night to receive mail-in votes."

Before I get to Jacqui Heinrich on how the Biden camp is responding to all of this, I want to bring you up to date on what really the focus seems to be now narrowed to three states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona. Together, they encompass about 47 electoral votes, in Pennsylvania, where Eric was, of course, 50,000-vote gap, amounting to about three-quarters of 1 percent. In Michigan, already called for Joe Biden -- all these states were -- 146,000-vote gap, amounting to a little bit more than 2.5 percent, and finally, in Arizona, 13,000-vote gap, about four-tenths of a percent. The president and his people are hoping that, with the count and some of these improprieties they charge are going on and the fraudulence going on, that all of those will be reversed and they will gain those 47 electoral votes, and that's it. There's a separate case with Georgia we will be getting into. But suffice it to say, that tends to be the big focus right now. Again to Jacqui Heinrich right now in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the vice president, who's already busy looking at possible Cabinet picks.

Delaware Senator Chris Coons, who's a close ally of the president-elect, who is said to be vying for secretary of state, today, his office announced he will be participating in a virtual summit on American global leadership in the time of COVID-19 alongside Cindy McCain, who is on the Biden transition advisory board.

But, still, part of the language revolves around, in this Presidential Transition Act, who is considered the apparent successful candidate. And so it doesn't mean that, like, what the situation we're dealing now, that all the votes have to be formally counted and the Electoral College results are complete and in. It just means that, based on the way the voting is going at a specific time, that there should be some indication of who that apparent successful candidate is. And, as you and your colleagues have mentioned, that does seem to be president-elect Biden. So, if that is the case, then why can't we get this process started for intelligence briefings, for president-elect Biden and his team, for the folks who are on these different transition teams, certainly in the national security realm, to show up to the General Services Administration building, and get clearances, get the right access to different departments and agencies that they will need to go to? Or it might be virtual this time. But there's still a lot of sort of issues of mechanics and process that have to be worked out for any of this to start. And until it does start, then the Biden elect team is sort of waiting in the wings. And, again, I think this is -- has the potential to cause harm to our national security, both at home and abroad."

Because, if this goes on indefinitely, and Joe Biden, assuming he is the next president of the United States, isn't getting these briefings, that could really handicap him once he does take office. Some have said very similar to the long count with Gore and George Bush, and how that might have compromised national security and caught us flat- footed eight, nine months later on 9/11. Are you worried about something like that?"

Whether she has, though, the final thumbs-up from inside the West Wing or the White House, that is something we don't know. But, again, if she wanted to make this happen, she could. Whether she will or how much longer there will be a delay is something we will just have to wait back and see. But, in the meantime, again, as I have tried to emphasize, the longer this goes on, the more potential for harm that causes to national security.

A number of people are making it known that they'd love to be considered for that or have some great names for him to consider, among them Bernie Sanders, who would easily and happily take a labor secretary position in a Biden administration. And then there's all the talk around whether -- whether, again, Elizabeth Warren could be recruited to become Treasury secretary in her own way. That kind of stuff generally panics the markets. She's no fan of theirs, and they of her. But, of course, that might be a bit of a dicey proposition. We will get into that, having nothing to do with Elizabeth Warren, but the fact that she's a senator and the governor of her state is a Republican. I think you know how that goes. We have got Adam Lashinsky with us, FOX News contributor, Business Insider contributor writing, much, much more, David Asman, of course, a star on FOX Business, which, if you don't get, you should demand. But then again, you're watching us, so I'm sure you get it. So, Stef Kight with us as well, Axios reporter. Stef, end it with you and begin with you on this pushing for a post in a Biden administration. The Bernie Sanders one struck me as a little odd and the labor secretary post. I could see that. And the interests of a lot of people in the progressive party would love that, as they would in Elizabeth Warren at Treasury. The trouble with Elizabeth Warren at Treasury is that the Republican governor of Massachusetts would appoint her replacement. And, most likely, it would not be a Democrat, right?"

      "speaker": "STEF KIGHT, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "Right. Exactly. If you're looking at the two of them, Bernie Sanders is really the big main progressive who is safest to move out of the Senate for Democrats at this point. And, in many ways, it makes sense that it would be at the Labor Department, given that Bernie Sanders has for the past two presidential campaigns and throughout his career always focused on economic issues, always focused on economic inequalities. And we know that that's going to be a primary focus of a Biden administration next year coming out of coronavirus and after the summer of racial unrest we have had. We know that's going to be front and center. And it would be a huge win for progressives and make it easier on the transition team, for Biden's transition team, to fill other positions with other people, if they gave Bernie Sanders a position like this."

I guess it depends on the history and how you read it. It does seem to be the case. But, having said that, this Florida -- I'm sorry -- this Georgia race, twin races, if they both flip Democrat -- it seems like an uphill climb -- what do you think the Street's reaction would be, because that would give them a Senate majority?"

And we were just talking about Bernie Sanders as secretary of labor. I mean, whatever happens in this election, it was not a mandate to reject capitalism. And that's precisely what Bernie Sanders wants to do. And he's been very open about it. And he comes out with a position paper called corporate accountability and democracy, in which he outlines the various things he would likely do as either president or secretary of labor. And to a large degree, workers, in his view of the new America, would replace both management and shareholders as -- in decision-making and profits. I mean, he would mandate, for example, that all publicly traded companies should provide at least 2 percent of the stocks to workers every year until the company's 20 percent owned by employees. He would mandate that 45 percent of board directors in any large corporation be directly elected by the firm's workers. So, essentially, he's creating the socialist ideal of a workers' marketplace. And what that would do is essentially eliminate markets as a determination of the value of the company. And the value would be entirely determined by workers. It's a socialist vision. And is America ready for a socialism ideal to replace capitalism?"

    {
      "speaker": "JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good afternoon to you, Neil. Well, you can see a green arrow there on Disney stock in the after-hours, because the numbers were better than expected. Revenue was close to $15 billion. Earnings per share, it was a loss of 20 cents, but it was a smaller loss than Wall Street was expecting. When you dig in, what this really means for investors out there and all of us that are watching, you look at parks, experiences and products, that revenue was down 61 percent year over year. You think about the theme parks. It's a global operation. You have got parks in Europe. You have got parks in Asia. Here in the United States, closed in California, but opened with restrictions in Orlando, as we're talking about a spike in coronavirus cases, you could potentially see more shutdowns, president-elect Biden's health person, his COVID adviser, certainly suggesting that. And we could see a change here when it comes to a company like Disney. Now, Disney+ was the key, right, because people stayed home during the Disney+ pandemic and they streamed more services. Those numbers were good, 73.7 million subscribers. But studio and entertainment revenues, they were $1.6 billion, down 52 percent year on year, because a lot less people are going for those theatrical releases in the movies. And they're watching at home. And part of the concern right now is, can a company like Disney continue with the content that it's serving audiences with the streaming service, Neil, if we all end up under more lockdowns?"

It could be that black and white and that simple. Kristina Partsinevelos outside Madison Square Garden with what could go down, and sooner than you think. Hey, Kristina."

      "utterance": "Yes, exactly. You're heading to your maybe favorite band. For you, Neil, maybe it's Adele. And all of a sudden, you get stopped by an employee. They ask for you to prove that you took the vaccine or you tested negatively for COVID just within a 72-hour period. This could be the near future. Ticketmaster is exploring this as an option. They said that they're not going through with it just yet. But they said the onus of enforcing such a rule would be on the event organizer, like in Madison Square Garden. Keep in mind, Ticketmaster is owned by Live Nation. They have got venues all across the country. If they were to move through with this, it's a three-pronged approach. You got the first thing you need, the app, the Ticketmaster app. Then you would need -- they would be working with third-party health providers, and then, lastly, vaccine providers and distributors. They said too they wouldn't be keeping any of your personal information. That would be put on a third-party independent member, though Madison Square Garden, all of these artists in general, it's a huge revenue stream, bringing in more than $5 billion in gross revenue last year. So they want to get fans back into those concert halls. They're just working through the process. No timeline just yet -- back to you."

      "utterance": "I mean, it is sort of asking for a lot. I mean, say, Neil, you and I, we want to go see Billy Joel. We love Billy Joel. \"Piano Man,\" I mean, it's a classic. But then we find out that we now have to give a laboratory permission to give a third-party app our health results and more? There's been a lot of mixed reaction out there, especially online, from parents saying, hey, maybe I don't want to give my kids' health info to a third-party app if they just want to go see the Jonas Brothers. So, I understand it. I want concerts back. We all want some sort of normalcy. But is this too far of a line to go from, hey, mandating just face masks to now having to prove that you have gotten the vaccine? So, there's definitely a little bit of a gray area."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, I hear you on that. I would do it, buddy, for Adele. I don't know if I would do it for anyone else. But I am curious about this. You do this sort of stuff in business all the time. At our own company, right, you got to make sure with the test they give us, that we're still testing negative. If we're not, they haul us out. Actually, they bring you to the roof, and they just..."

      "utterance": "Well, we're going from live events. And people will argue, well, listen, it's not your right to go to a private concert. OK, that's fine. But are we going to see it go from live events to maybe airplanes next, that you have to prove some sort of negative test or that you have the vaccine to get on an airplane? Or what happens if that does go to an employee and trying to get to work? Is there some sort of legal right there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Alicia Acuna in Phoenix with how this particular battle is still raging -- Alicia."

    {
      "speaker": "ALICIA ACUNA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. In his opening statement, Trump campaign attorney Kory Langhofer said that this case is not about fraud. He said -- quote -- \"The allegation here is that, in what appears to be a limited number of cases, there were good- faith errors in the operating machine that should result in further review of ballots. It is not a fraud case. It is not a stealing the election case.\" What this is about in person voting on Election Day. The Trump campaign claims poll workers incorrectly told voters whose ballots were rejected by the machine as over-votes to override the system by hitting a green button, rather than letting them fix it. In openings, the defense pointed out -- quote -- \"Out of 166,875 ballots that were cast on Election Day in Maricopa County on the presidential line for electors, the Electoral College, either for defendant Donald J. Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden or the Libertarian candidate, only 191 of those Election Day ballots turned out to be reported as over-votes.\" Neil, on the latest count, Biden now leads the president by 11,537, the number of ballots remaining, while the count is still under way, 24,603 -- Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And they're convinced, if memory serves me right, Alicia, that those ballots from areas where Republicans might have filed them late, not in all cases, but that they could be disproportionately Republican. But to make up that gap, what does it look like?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ACUNA",
      "utterance": "If you look at the numbers, it's really not going to make up much of a difference. It will be minuscule. And from all of the analysis that we have seen, with the numbers that remain in the state of Arizona, the president would need to win 70 percent of what is left. And we're still waiting for numbers from Pima County, which also includes a very liberal part of the state, Tucson -- Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Alicia, thank you. That's very, very interesting here. In the meantime, there doesn't seem to be much so far to disrupt the notion that Joe Biden is indeed the president-elect of the United States. That could change in some of these counts. But, again, the Trump folks would have to run the table in the remaining races, which is why a lot of people are already calling Joe Biden about Cabinet positions and other jobs in the administration, Bernie Sanders the latest to say, yes, labor secretary, I'd be interested in that. Talk that a number of other groups, the more progressive in nature, are saying Elizabeth Warren would make a perfect Treasury secretary. So, the battle is on. I wonder what Debbie Dingell makes of it, the Democratic Michigan congresswoman. Congresswoman, very good to have you back. Is there a little bit of infighting going on among Democrats? You always see that. But between progressives, who definitely want a seat at the table and not to be forgotten, and others, more traditional, saying, Joe, don't go too far left with that Cabinet. Where are you on this?"

And I think people will be happy when they see the Cabinet that has been picked. I don't know who's going to be there. I have heard from lots people, like everybody else is. But I think Joe Biden is going to try to set a table that has every voice at it, listen to people, and try to find common ground, which I think we're going to get rid of some of the drama we have seen the last four years."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I would be curious what your thoughts -- I know you're in the House, but this battle in Georgia for these two remaining seats up. If they stay Republican, do you think that's going to hurt Joe Biden's agenda? Do you think it's going to make it much more difficult for him to raise taxes or do some of the other things if he's got to answer to and deal with Mitch McConnell?"

I will tell you something. Right now, I can't -- there are so many people desperate, as these numbers are starting to go up on COVID, that people are getting worried about their jobs. People aren't going into businesses. We need to do a COVID relief bill, period. And I think the senators..."

We had to do one. And I gave up predicting this. But I think Senator McConnell has said he would like to do something. Does that translate to action? What will the president do? I don't know. But we need one. And I will tell you something. I don't -- you're not in a red or blue state. Every state is suffering right now from increases in surges of COVID. And people need help and support."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you a little bit of talk -- you about a blue wave. There was less of one certainly than thought, minus the White House, and certainly in the House. It's looking like -- and it could change, Congresswoman. It's a 218-202 margin in favor of Democrats in the newly constituted House. But that's down from 232 Democrats and 197 Republicans. And there are some other races to go. Are you worried that whatever happened on the national level in the White House didn't extend to where you work in the House and didn't extend to the Senate?"

      "speaker": "DINGELL",
      "utterance": "You know, this is what I'm going to say, Neil. And I'm very blunt about this. None of us can be judgmental. We need to look at the number of people that voted for President Trump and why. I am someone who thinks that we have, A, let Republicans define who we are. And I use this -- you have seen all this -- everybody using different phrases to brand them. My father-in-law was one of the authors of Social Security. He got called a socialist. He got called a communist. He had crosses burnt on his lawn. You tell me who in America is going to call Social Security a socialist idea right now. Democrats have got to own what they're doing. There are people at the dinner tables every night that are talking about issues that they are worried about, from whether their job is going to be safe, having trade deals, whether there's a level playing field, access to broadband in urban and rural areas, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, making sure people with preexisting coverage have -- we have got a lot of common ground. And we have got to do a better job of talking about..."

      "utterance": "So, there's areas, areas where you -- areas where you could work. I get it. In the limited time we have, Congresswoman, a lot of Democrats are criticizing the president's team for just wanting to look at these states, count the ballots. Of course, you can remember, four years ago, there was the same criticism Republicans had of Democrats, wanted to count the ballots, not so sure, 20 years ago, in Bush-Gore, when the party's roles were reversed. Wouldn't it be the same if the roles were reversed?"

      "speaker": "DINGELL",
