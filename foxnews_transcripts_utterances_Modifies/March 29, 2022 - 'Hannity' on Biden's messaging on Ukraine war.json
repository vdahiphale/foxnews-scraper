      "sentences": "And welcome to HANNITY. Tonight, again, we begin with a FOX News alert. First, a new poll shows, surprisingly, shockingly, even two-thirds of Americans want actor Will Smith arrested after he slapped Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife. Now, this as new video has just emerged showing Smith making fun of a bald person shaved head several years ago. We'll get to that in a moment. But yet, we begin tonight with another day of the Biden administration's attempt to clean up Joe's disastrous trip abroad and it's not going well. Our current president is a walking, talking liability to the country, the world and its seriousness in these times are extraordinarily dangerous. In case you're keeping track, while he was in Europe, Joe wrongly suggested that our U.S. soldiers would soon be on the ground in Ukraine. He forgot the name of his own secretary of defense yet again and referred to him as the secretary of state. He spent several hours choking, if you recall on a spicy pizza -- a piece of pizza. He falsely claimed that U.S. soldiers were training Ukrainian forces in Poland. He said that Putin cannot remain in power which his handlers had to clean up and say this is not the position of his administration, and then guess what? He pretty much said the same thing yesterday. Now, in a monumental effort to right their ship -- well, Biden staffers, they think they're clever. They're now providing the president of the United States with his daily cheat sheets featuring one sentence answers to the most simple, the most basic questions in massive font about Joe's own policies. And yesterday, Joe did his very best to read -- see that little cue card there -- to read from the sheets. Take a look.",

The truth is, and I'll say it, I was right before the election, Joe Biden is not well. He is not competent. He is so cognitively weak that his own staffers won't let him or trying to stop him from going off script, which frankly I agree with. It is a necessary protection in these perilous times. Almost everything he says is poorly read from a teleprompter or now these new note cards. Almost all the questions that he's taken by the media mob are pre-selected by White House staffers, and still despite all of this assistance, Joe is struggling worse than ever.

Now, how many times has President Trump been on this program, either on a satellite in person or on the phone, how long how many times has he talked for 40, 45 uninterrupted minutes, he's always very well-informed on any topic I bring up, fully completely engaged, up to date, energetic, articulate and smart as hell. I'll take the smart, articulate guy that is tough, that the world fears with the mean tweets, I'll take him back any day. So would most Americans by the way. Look at this new poll, Harvard-Harris poll, Trump is trouncing Biden and Harris handily if the election were held today. Meanwhile, one recent NBC poll shows a whopping 71 percent of Americans, they are not confident about Joe Biden's ability to manage this crisis in Ukraine. The same poll found that Biden's approval ratings are now at an all-time low, with Americans worried about record high inflation, a 40-year high, record high gas prices, you've never paid more and the instability abroad. But high in their ivory tower, Biden's protectors for example over at MSDNC, well, they just can't seem to grasp why Joe's poll numbers are so low. Why is this happening? Take a look.",

I -- you know, I -- the 25th Amendment stuff that was uh you know laughingly hysterically invoked in the Trump year, you may not like Trump but he was certainly all there. Sean, we have to seriously start to think about this stuff. The man seriously is in cognitive decline. It's evident by just watching and observing him. Now, the problem we have with this is it's causing a genuine national security crisis. Everybody out there it's been widely reported, Vladimir Putin is horrified of being deposed. It's been rumored that he watches the video of Gaddafi and his pretty horrific death all the time, and he's afraid that could happen to him. It's also well known, Sean, that he has an aversion, Putin that is, to communicating via modern technology -- cell phones, emails, et cetera. Apparently, he has an aversion to computers and even looking up Internet stories. So what I'm trying to get at is you can't just assume that Putin has a full portfolio of information and is fully aware that when Joe Biden said, you know, we got to get this guy -- you know, he can't remain in power, that Putin's not interpreting that to mean the United States is supporting a coup. I mean, Dana Perino had said I think on \"THE FIVE\" that he still thinks that the U.S. government had Dan Rather fired. I mean, really. This -- the Joe Biden's gaffes, I'm not kidding. I -- listen, I'm a Republican, I'm not pretending to be some non-partisan journalist, but I say this with a pure heart, this guy is causing a genuine national security crisis in the United States by not being all there.",

You are 100 percent correct is far worse than even you and I are letting on here, which is really, really bad news and creates a very unsafe situation for the United States. You're 100 percent correct. Now, Geraldo, you're different. I can play you tape and I played it on the show of Joe Biden in 2007, 2008, 2012, 2016. The guy I see today is not the guy that even left office in 20 -- early 2017.

Now, Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, raised eyebrows with this cryptic post, quote: This is a season for healing and I'm here for it. Okay. Now, last night, Smith did apologize, but I want you to think about this question tonight. A lot of these celebrities they all come out, I'm sorry, I apologize. Do you think most of these apologies are real? Are most celebrity apologies real? Now, first, you got to know this. He did not write all this himself as my best guess. You have a room full of woke millionaires, by the way, just to start with, we shouldn't even care but we do. Now, what do you think went on behind the scenes before that statement went up and what goes into crafting a high-profile apology? Now, publicists usually, I would assume, they were here, can't say for sure, but usually are heavily involved. There's probably several rounds of edits, oh, no, you got to say it this way, you got to say it that way, no, take this word out, put this word in. No, look, comma here, period there, et cetera, et cetera. And understand, this is all an effort for what, in most cases? is it that they're really sincere and apologetic or is it to keep their career intact and be able to make more movies and more money? I'll let you decide now. Even though I know what goes on behind the scenes in most cases, I do like to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to apologies. And look at your screen, you may remember Will Smith actually slapped another guy about years ago while in Moscow for the \"Men in Black III\" premiere. Now, the reporter who turned out to be a prankster apparently tried to kiss him on the red carpet, this is back in 2012, nice little slap there. Did he ever apologize for that slap?

Twenty-five years ago, 57 million people tuned in. So you're talking about 45 million people less watching this year. And the reason why is because this thing has become insufferable. I mean, if I want to see the host attack Ron DeSantis, I'll tune to CNN, no problem. We've gone from Billy Crystal to Amy Schumer as far as a host, and the aura the glamour you mentioned before of Hollywood is no longer around at this point. But, look, we even saw this week because now, you know, we've gone to ludicrous speed completely. That Donald Trump is being blamed for Will Smith's actions by Howard Stern, by the guy who started the Lincoln Project, Steve Schmidt, by a CNN analyst named Asha Rangappa, a former FBI agent, they're saying Trump made him do it. That's where we're at this point. But, look, here's the bottom line, let's say an actor like James Woods, right, a Trump supporter had done what Will Smith did, I am certain he would have been removed from that event immediately. But Smith did what he did and then he was allowed to sit back down and stay for the remainder of the show, even after they went to commercial, they had time to figure this out what the right course of action is and people who produce live events had zero idea what to do.

      "utterance": "And welcome to HANNITY. Tonight, again, we begin with a FOX News alert. First, a new poll shows, surprisingly, shockingly, even two-thirds of Americans want actor Will Smith arrested after he slapped Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife. Now, this as new video has just emerged showing Smith making fun of a bald person shaved head several years ago. We'll get to that in a moment. But yet, we begin tonight with another day of the Biden administration's attempt to clean up Joe's disastrous trip abroad and it's not going well. Our current president is a walking, talking liability to the country, the world and its seriousness in these times are extraordinarily dangerous. In case you're keeping track, while he was in Europe, Joe wrongly suggested that our U.S. soldiers would soon be on the ground in Ukraine. He forgot the name of his own secretary of defense yet again and referred to him as the secretary of state. He spent several hours choking, if you recall on a spicy pizza -- a piece of pizza. He falsely claimed that U.S. soldiers were training Ukrainian forces in Poland. He said that Putin cannot remain in power which his handlers had to clean up and say this is not the position of his administration, and then guess what? He pretty much said the same thing yesterday. Now, in a monumental effort to right their ship -- well, Biden staffers, they think they're clever. They're now providing the president of the United States with his daily cheat sheets featuring one sentence answers to the most simple, the most basic questions in massive font about Joe's own policies. And yesterday, Joe did his very best to read -- see that little cue card there -- to read from the sheets. Take a look."

The truth is, and I'll say it, I was right before the election, Joe Biden is not well. He is not competent. He is so cognitively weak that his own staffers won't let him or trying to stop him from going off script, which frankly I agree with. It is a necessary protection in these perilous times. Almost everything he says is poorly read from a teleprompter or now these new note cards. Almost all the questions that he's taken by the media mob are pre-selected by White House staffers, and still despite all of this assistance, Joe is struggling worse than ever. Well, the past couple of weeks have been really, really bad. Just a quick reminder."

The first lady's husband contracting COVID, but look at this room and what you see. Pardon me. That's right. She's fine. It's me. That's not together. The second lady -- the first gentleman. From mom to get her kid on the Internet to be able to do their homework has to pull in the McDonald's parking lot? I mean, for real. That's what's happening.

By the way, Kamala Harris, well, she's got her own train wrecks to deal with. Now, how many times has President Trump been on this program, either on a satellite in person or on the phone, how long how many times has he talked for 40, 45 uninterrupted minutes, he's always very well-informed on any topic I bring up, fully completely engaged, up to date, energetic, articulate and smart as hell. I'll take the smart, articulate guy that is tough, that the world fears with the mean tweets, I'll take him back any day. So would most Americans by the way. Look at this new poll, Harvard-Harris poll, Trump is trouncing Biden and Harris handily if the election were held today. Meanwhile, one recent NBC poll shows a whopping 71 percent of Americans, they are not confident about Joe Biden's ability to manage this crisis in Ukraine. The same poll found that Biden's approval ratings are now at an all-time low, with Americans worried about record high inflation, a 40-year high, record high gas prices, you've never paid more and the instability abroad. But high in their ivory tower, Biden's protectors for example over at MSDNC, well, they just can't seem to grasp why Joe's poll numbers are so low. Why is this happening? Take a look."

I -- you know, I -- the 25th Amendment stuff that was uh you know laughingly hysterically invoked in the Trump year, you may not like Trump but he was certainly all there. Sean, we have to seriously start to think about this stuff. The man seriously is in cognitive decline. It's evident by just watching and observing him. Now, the problem we have with this is it's causing a genuine national security crisis. Everybody out there it's been widely reported, Vladimir Putin is horrified of being deposed. It's been rumored that he watches the video of Gaddafi and his pretty horrific death all the time, and he's afraid that could happen to him. It's also well known, Sean, that he has an aversion, Putin that is, to communicating via modern technology -- cell phones, emails, et cetera. Apparently, he has an aversion to computers and even looking up Internet stories. So what I'm trying to get at is you can't just assume that Putin has a full portfolio of information and is fully aware that when Joe Biden said, you know, we got to get this guy -- you know, he can't remain in power, that Putin's not interpreting that to mean the United States is supporting a coup. I mean, Dana Perino had said I think on \"THE FIVE\" that he still thinks that the U.S. government had Dan Rather fired. I mean, really. This -- the Joe Biden's gaffes, I'm not kidding. I -- listen, I'm a Republican, I'm not pretending to be some non-partisan journalist, but I say this with a pure heart, this guy is causing a genuine national security crisis in the United States by not being all there."

You are 100 percent correct is far worse than even you and I are letting on here, which is really, really bad news and creates a very unsafe situation for the United States. You're 100 percent correct. Now, Geraldo, you're different. I can play you tape and I played it on the show of Joe Biden in 2007, 2008, 2012, 2016. The guy I see today is not the guy that even left office in 20 -- early 2017.

He mentions tax, fee, penalties 120 times. It just shows really where their values are and how unserious they are. But what's worse about this budget, where he's talking about gasoline price, so high, he taxes $45 billion in tax for anybody doing energy production. So what does that mean?

Okay, let's just stop for one second. If this is the new standard, if you want to hold Justice Thomas accountable for something that someone in his family did, will that apply to Joe and Hunter? I think it has to apply. Or is it the usual one rule for Democrats and another rule for everybody else? Also, ask yourself, why have Democrats been so silent on Biden's own Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson and her troubling record of lenient sentences for child porn offenses? Get this, according to Senate Republican staffers, the White House left out very key details about a life sentence for child porn offender and confirmation hearing materials provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now, the White House says the case was unintentionally left out. I don't buy it. Senate Republicans, they're not buying it. Here to explain more, Republican senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley.

And every time we find out more about it, we find out that she's been soft on criminals, that she's been soft on child porn offenders. Of course, the White House is leaving out information and is trying to mislead and is trying to dissemble because it's just a fact that this is a woke judge who has been soft on crime, and that's not the kind of person we need on the bench."

In other words, if you own stock -- and let's say, April 15 comes around, and you're going to file your taxes, and the stock is worth say, $40, right? Okay, but you're not selling the stock. So it's not a gain until you sell the stock. Now, let's say by the time you sell it, it's only worth 20 bucks, I don't like the stock market for that reason. To me, there's a lot of gambling involved in that. Is this going to pass, the largest tax hike in history and it doesn't even include the monies that we need for Ukraine and the military?"

He green lights Putin's pipeline. He shuts down American pipelines, and now, his answer to this is to tax American energy and all the other taxes you're talking about on top of it? And this is a guy who just doesn't know what's going on. He has no idea what is actually happening here. His policies are 180 degrees wrong. And I'm just willing to bet, Sean, that when the American people finally get a chance to weigh in in November, they're going to say turn the exact opposite direction."

If that's the case, if that's the standard now Democrats want to set, wouldn't that apply to Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and the laptop, and wouldn't Joe equally have to be impeached himself or recused as they're trying to do to Clarence Thomas?"

Isn't that exactly what the Democrats are always saying that they're against? But the truth is, is that they will take any avenue they can to try and smear Justice Thomas, and Republicans have got to stand up against it and say, we're not going to let you smear and rig the Supreme Court, which is what they're trying to do."

A lot of these celebrities they all come out, I'm sorry, I apologize. Do you think most of these apologies are real? Are most celebrity apologies real? Now, first, you got to know this. He did not write all this himself as my best guess. You have a room full of woke millionaires, by the way, just to start with, we shouldn't even care but we do. Now, what do you think went on behind the scenes before that statement went up and what goes into crafting a high-profile apology? Now, publicists usually, I would assume, they were here, can't say for sure, but usually are heavily involved. There's probably several rounds of edits, oh, no, you got to say it this way, you got to say it that way, no, take this word out, put this word in. No, look, comma here, period there, et cetera, et cetera. And understand, this is all an effort for what, in most cases? is it that they're really sincere and apologetic or is it to keep their career intact and be able to make more movies and more money? I'll let you decide now. Even though I know what goes on behind the scenes in most cases, I do like to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to apologies. And look at your screen, you may remember Will Smith actually slapped another guy about years ago while in Moscow for the \"Men in Black III\" premiere. Now, the reporter who turned out to be a prankster apparently tried to kiss him on the red carpet, this is back in 2012, nice little slap there. Did he ever apologize for that slap?

And I think you know that poll or a couple of polls that have been taken today show that most of the public, you know, a small minority, especially women, are actually on Will Smith's side rather than Chris Rock's side, and whether that's a function of Will Smith's greater publicity, I don't know. But I think really what it reflects is this sort of desire for a lost stage of chivalry and this sort of primal sort of appeal of a man going into battle to defend his woman. And I think that, you know, women sort of crave that and even though it was done in a really repulsive way and it was an embarrassment to the Oscars -- I mean, you know, the Oscars used to be the pinnacle of glamour and celebration of the great arts of cinema in Hollywood, and it's just degenerated into now something that's like a modern day Jerry Springer.

So I don't know what was going on there. But the bottom line is, you know, in California, they don't prosecute crimes anyway.

Second lowest rated Oscars anyway, Hollywood to me is dead. They want to beat themselves up, that's their problem. I don't really care that much. To me, it was kind of entertaining."

      "utterance": "Well, look, you mentioned the ratings, right? And second lowest rated, but you got to put in perspective in terms of what this really means? Ten years ago, Sean, 40 million people tuned in to the Oscars, 15 million this year. \"A King Speech\" won that year, good but not the buzziest movie in the world. Twenty-five years ago, 57 million people tuned in. So you're talking about 45 million people less watching this year. And the reason why is because this thing has become insufferable. I mean, if I want to see the host attack Ron DeSantis, I'll tune to CNN, no problem. We've gone from Billy Crystal to Amy Schumer as far as a host, and the aura the glamour you mentioned before of Hollywood is no longer around at this point. But, look, we even saw this week because now, you know, we've gone to ludicrous speed completely. That Donald Trump is being blamed for Will Smith's actions by Howard Stern, by the guy who started the Lincoln Project, Steve Schmidt, by a CNN analyst named Asha Rangappa, a former FBI agent, they're saying Trump made him do it. That's where we're at this point. But, look, here's the bottom line, let's say an actor like James Woods, right, a Trump supporter had done what Will Smith did, I am certain he would have been removed from that event immediately. But Smith did what he did and then he was allowed to sit back down and stay for the remainder of the show, even after they went to commercial, they had time to figure this out what the right course of action is and people who produce live events had zero idea what to do. And I wonder now what does the precedent is -- what kind of what kind of precedent is being set now, Sean."

      "speaker": "LEO TERRELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Oh, I'll tell you right now, I want to be very clear, because Whoopi Goldberg needs to be put back in the timeout box. If Sean Hannity or Joe Concha or --"

      "speaker": "TERRELL",
      "utterance": "Oh, listen, why did she play the race card? Why does she got to bring up race? You asked me the question, if you would have done what Will Smith did, you would have gone to jail. Joe would have gone to jail. And if I would have done it, Whoopi would not have thrown me a lifeline or my color would have had no effect. I would have gone to jail. The reason is quite simple, Will Smith is part of the Hollywood elite, Sean, so he gets a pass. They like him, he makes money for them, and so that's why she threw him a lifeline and then she --"

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this."

    {
      "speaker": "TERRELL",
      "utterance": "Race is not an issue in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I really like Chris Rock. Chris Rock is one of my favorite comedians. Dave Chappelle is one of my favorites. Larry the Cable Guy, you know, the one -- I have a lot of favorites. I love comedians. I love comedians that are free to say anything, and I think they have the right to do it. Now, he took the shot and again there was a as Pam Bondi pointed out earlier in the show, somebody made a joke about this -- the -- this rumor or truth about an open marriage, and that didn't bother him? I don't get that part."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TERRELL",
      "utterance": "No, because I'll tell you right now, it's because of the fact that when Will Smith looked at Jada and she was upset, he decided to play the protective husband. It was fake. It was not real. Chris Rock is the victim, a black man, and Whoopi Goldberg throws a lifeline to Will Smith. Figure that out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I -- what are you -- Joe, I like your reaction to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "Oh, sure, well, Chris Rock -- and I think we're all in agreement that he handled this as well as you could, right, that he did he didn't go back at him and now, he's benefited seriously from this, Sean. The tickets for his comedy show before this we're going for 50 bucks, okay, before this incident happened. Now, they're going for $350, right? So, Chris Rock still hasn't responded however to Will Smith apologizing. Remember, he apologized twice, once without saying anything to Chris Rock, once on Instagram. I would think that Will Smith, if he wants to show that he's a real man, pick up the phone or go visit Chris Rock and apologize personally and maybe that's why we haven't heard from Chris Rock at this point. But that's very curious, that the guy who got hit, the guy who likes to talk a lot as a comedian and mostly everybody does love as a comedian hasn't said anything yet. I wonder why that is."

      "utterance": "Yeah, you're a conservative too. Look, I used to love the Broad Street Bullies, Dave Schultz, Bobby Clarke, you know, fighting like Bobby Nystrom and Clark Gillies of the Islanders. It was the greatest time in hockey. They dropped the gloves --"

      "utterance": "Wasn't that the `70s?"

      "utterance": "And then they started playing again. Thanks, guys. More HANNITY next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "You know, when you poll people about negative ads, they always say, oh, no, I don't like negative ads. When you poll people about fighting in hockey, oh, no, we can't have fighting in sports. But negative ads work and whether or not people will admit it, they usually like fighting. Anyway, that's my take. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have left. Thank you for being with us. Please set your DVR, never miss an episode. In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingram's next. Have a great night."
