      "sentences": "Amazing show tonight, Bret. Thank you so much. We pick up \"The Story\" from here. Breaking tonight, it is 7:00 p.m. in Virginia, where the polls have just closed in a closely watched a gubernatorial race between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam. Too early at this stage, as we like to say on election night, to predict a winner. Fox News voter analysis, which is great stuff that we have put together for you tonight that we're going to show you, shows a very close race right now in the Old Dominion as it's known.  Also in New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Kim Guadagno; their race has developed essentially into a referendum on Governor Chris Christie, who is as you know, one of the most unpopular governors in the United States of America. That's an interesting distinction. And we are keeping our eyes, of course, as well on New York City where Bill de Blasio is hoping for another term as he tries to be mayor once again of the nation's largest city in America. There's how that shapes up, but we begin with the big story tonight in Virginia.  Fox's Kristin Fisher, live at Northam headquarters tonight. We go first to Peter Doocy, who is at Gillespie headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. So, what's the good word over there, Peter?",

      "sentences": "Martha, the big reason that the Gillespie campaign has been getting so much national attention it's because he was a Republican trying to win without Trump. But tonight, a presidential robocall is spreading throughout the commonwealth where the president's voice is heard, telling voters that Ed Gillespie will help make America great again. Polls have shown that Gillespie is in second place, but closing in on the lead lately. And staffers I've spoken to today say they think his candidacy actually got a boost when the Northam supporting outside group, the Latino Victory Fund, released an ad showing Gillespie supporter, a fictional Gillespie supporter, trying to run over minority children with a pickup truck. However, this new Fox News voter analysis finds that Virginians believe Gillespie made the most unfair attacks throughout the course of the campaign, more than the Democrat Northam. This analysis also finds that voters today prefer Gillespie on the economy, but two-thirds of Virginians say they think Virginia's economy right now is excellent or good, which is a contrast to what President Trump tweeted today, that they need to move away from Democrats because the economy has been terrible under Democratic rule. Now, for a look at the Democratic candidate's headquarters tonight. Our colleague Kristin Fisher.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Peter. Well, for a candidate who came into this race, the clear favorite, Ralph Northam is ending it uncomfortably close in the polls. You know, in the closing days of this campaign, he's been hit on the right by his component and by President Trump for being weak on crime, for being weak on second amendment rights, weak on veterans' issues. But he's also been hit by the far-left flanks of his own party for reversing decisions on -- reversing his stance on things like sanctuary cities and Confederate statues. He's also been accused by some Democrats of running a rather lackluster campaign. In fact, many of them have compared it to Hillary Clinton's campaign, as being too establishment, is lacking enthusiasm, playing it too safe. And for just being, perhaps, a bit too old-fashioned for the Trump- era. But make no mistake, there's a lot on Northam's side tonight. This is the state that Hillary Clinton won by five points, almost exactly one year ago today. And President Trump remains deeply unpopular here in Northern Virginia, which is really just, you know, about a quick 20-minute drive away from Washington, D.C.  This is the only southern state that President Trump lost. So, throughout the course of this campaign, Northam has been trying to tie his opponent to President Trump's policies. He is expected to win, or he was at least at the beginning of this race, he is favored to win. The current outgoing Democratic governor says tonight that he believes he will win, but this race is very close tonight, Martha, and there's a lot of nerves here tonight.",

But what we left behind, you have Northern Virginia, which is basically a small, very affluent northeastern corridor state. Donald Trump lost it by 20 points or something, and then you have the rest of Virginia, which is about, I don't know, two-thirds of the vote in the state -- is a southern state, that if you took out Northern Virginia, Donald Trump would've won it by about three points, about the same margin that he won North Carolina. So, now, you have a race between the voters of these two states, who can get the turnout going tonight? So, we'll be looking at those, ex-urban counties Loudoun, and Prince William, and the far outskirts, those of the swing counties. And then, we're also going to be looking for: can Republicans turn out in less populous world counties like they did for Donald Trump?",

And he's issued 21 position papers, he has highlighted those with events, he's talking great detail about how it's going to cut taxes, grow the economy, reform state government, innovate. It's been an amazing campaign of substance and that was to establish himself earlier this year as a candidate worthy of being the governor of Virginia. So, I'd say he spent more time on that than just simply try to either glom on to the coattails of Trump in places where he's popular, or to do what Ralph Northam did -- which is basically to make most of his campaign about how he was going to oppose Donald Trump in all things, whether they affected Virginia or not.",

In a presidential election, there is 70 percent of the registered voters turned out. In an off your gubernatorial election, 40 percent do. That the variations in turn out by area, by county are going to be important to look at. We also need to look at the growing part of the state. Fairfax County, biggest county in the state, Northern Virginia, had 273,000 votes in '09; 306,000 votes four years ago. It'd be interesting to see how much larger it is this year to grow as part of the state. And then, I'm going to be looking at margins. It's not just whether they win them or lose them, but are they -- first of all, are they poaching? Ed Gillespie is going to try and get more votes than a Republican normally gets in Northern Virginia.  Northam is going to trying and get more votes in the Virginia Beach northern area where he's originally from, and where he has a military background. And then, we're going to see running up the totals. Ed Gillespie is going to this, I think, particularly to try and do this in Southwest Virginia. If you look down at the coal country, the area south of West Virginia, it was won by Mitt Romney, but Ed Gillespie won it in the Senate bid in 2014 but he didn't get the margins that Romney did. And then, Trump came and won that county just overwhelmingly. And the question is: is Ed Gillespie going to be able to get Trump-like margins in the southwest part of the state? Unlike the -- he became close.",

Shocking, because you remember Clinton and her aides spent so much time in public talking about inclusion and shattering the ultimate glass ceiling while charging that then-candidate Donald Trump mistreated women. But Brazile writes that in private, top Clinton officials, like the campaign managers -- you just heard about Robby Mook -- behave differently. Nodded when she talks, but then not actually listening to her or following up on what they agreed upon. It got so ugly that in one conference call, Brazile actually blurted to the male aides, \"Gentlemen, let's just put our manhood out on the table and see who's the bigger one because I know that mine is bigger than all of yours.\" Remember, we already learned Brazile's account what happened after Clinton fainted at that 9/11 memorial event, which led the party chair to briefly consider changing the ticket. That led Huma Abedin and dozens of other Clinton aides to sign an open letter to Brazile charging she was buying into Russian propaganda about Clinton's health. Brazile scoffs at all of that, so she just wanted basic respect from Clinton and her team while wishes that there was not so much turmoil right now ahead of the big gubernatorial races in places like Virginia and New Jersey.",

Breaking tonight, it is 7:00 p.m. in Virginia, where the polls have just closed in a closely watched a gubernatorial race between Republican Ed Gillespie and Democrat Ralph Northam. Too early at this stage, as we like to say on election night, to predict a winner. Fox News voter analysis, which is great stuff that we have put together for you tonight that we're going to show you, shows a very close race right now in the Old Dominion as it's known. Also in New Jersey, Democrat Phil Murphy and Republican Kim Guadagno; their race has developed essentially into a referendum on Governor Chris Christie, who is as you know, one of the most unpopular governors in the United States of America. That's an interesting distinction. And we are keeping our eyes, of course, as well on New York City where Bill de Blasio is hoping for another term as he tries to be mayor once again of the nation's largest city in America. There's how that shapes up, but we begin with the big story tonight in Virginia. Fox's Kristin Fisher, live at Northam headquarters tonight. We go first to Peter Doocy, who is at Gillespie headquarters in Richmond, Virginia. So, what's the good word over there, Peter?"
    },

      "speaker": "PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Martha, the big reason that the Gillespie campaign has been getting so much national attention it's because he was a Republican trying to win without Trump. But tonight, a presidential robocall is spreading throughout the commonwealth where the president's voice is heard, telling voters that Ed Gillespie will help make America great again. Polls have shown that Gillespie is in second place, but closing in on the lead lately. And staffers I've spoken to today say they think his candidacy actually got a boost when the Northam supporting outside group, the Latino Victory Fund, released an ad showing Gillespie supporter, a fictional Gillespie supporter, trying to run over minority children with a pickup truck. However, this new Fox News voter analysis finds that Virginians believe Gillespie made the most unfair attacks throughout the course of the campaign, more than the Democrat Northam. This analysis also finds that voters today prefer Gillespie on the economy, but two-thirds of Virginians say they think Virginia's economy right now is excellent or good, which is a contrast to what President Trump tweeted today, that they need to move away from Democrats because the economy has been terrible under Democratic rule. Now, for a look at the Democratic candidate's headquarters tonight. Our colleague Kristin Fisher."

      "speaker": "KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Hey, Peter. Well, for a candidate who came into this race, the clear favorite, Ralph Northam is ending it uncomfortably close in the polls. You know, in the closing days of this campaign, he's been hit on the right by his component and by President Trump for being weak on crime, for being weak on second amendment rights, weak on veterans' issues. But he's also been hit by the far-left flanks of his own party for reversing decisions on -- reversing his stance on things like sanctuary cities and Confederate statues. He's also been accused by some Democrats of running a rather lackluster campaign. In fact, many of them have compared it to Hillary Clinton's campaign, as being too establishment, is lacking enthusiasm, playing it too safe. And for just being, perhaps, a bit too old-fashioned for the Trump- era. But make no mistake, there's a lot on Northam's side tonight. This is the state that Hillary Clinton won by five points, almost exactly one year ago today. And President Trump remains deeply unpopular here in Northern Virginia, which is really just, you know, about a quick 20-minute drive away from Washington, D.C. This is the only southern state that President Trump lost. So, throughout the course of this campaign, Northam has been trying to tie his opponent to President Trump's policies. He is expected to win, or he was at least at the beginning of this race, he is favored to win. The current outgoing Democratic governor says tonight that he believes he will win, but this race is very close tonight, Martha, and there's a lot of nerves here tonight."

      "utterance": "Well, basically Virginia is two states. We took the best part and put in the West Virginia. But what we left behind, you have Northern Virginia, which is basically a small, very affluent northeastern corridor state. Donald Trump lost it by 20 points or something, and then you have the rest of Virginia, which is about, I don't know, two-thirds of the vote in the state -- is a southern state, that if you took out Northern Virginia, Donald Trump would've won it by about three points, about the same margin that he won North Carolina. So, now, you have a race between the voters of these two states, who can get the turnout going tonight? So, we'll be looking at those, ex-urban counties Loudoun, and Prince William, and the far outskirts, those of the swing counties. And then, we're also going to be looking for: can Republicans turn out in less populous world counties like they did for Donald Trump?"

      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TO GEORGE W. BUSH",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not sure, I'd say he distanced himself, what he tried to do is establish himself as a person with a vision and a plan for the future of Virginia. And he's issued 21 position papers, he has highlighted those with events, he's talking great detail about how it's going to cut taxes, grow the economy, reform state government, innovate. It's been an amazing campaign of substance and that was to establish himself earlier this year as a candidate worthy of being the governor of Virginia. So, I'd say he spent more time on that than just simply try to either glom on to the coattails of Trump in places where he's popular, or to do what Ralph Northam did -- which is basically to make most of his campaign about how he was going to oppose Donald Trump in all things, whether they affected Virginia or not."

It is important, yes, but we care about it so much because it looks a lot like America.

In a presidential election, there is 70 percent of the registered voters turned out. In an off your gubernatorial election, 40 percent do. That the variations in turn out by area, by county are going to be important to look at. We also need to look at the growing part of the state. Fairfax County, biggest county in the state, Northern Virginia, had 273,000 votes in '09; 306,000 votes four years ago. It'd be interesting to see how much larger it is this year to grow as part of the state. And then, I'm going to be looking at margins. It's not just whether they win them or lose them, but are they -- first of all, are they poaching? Ed Gillespie is going to try and get more votes than a Republican normally gets in Northern Virginia. Northam is going to trying and get more votes in the Virginia Beach northern area where he's originally from, and where he has a military background. And then, we're going to see running up the totals. Ed Gillespie is going to this, I think, particularly to try and do this in Southwest Virginia. If you look down at the coal country, the area south of West Virginia, it was won by Mitt Romney, but Ed Gillespie won it in the Senate bid in 2014 but he didn't get the margins that Romney did. And then, Trump came and won that county just overwhelmingly. And the question is: is Ed Gillespie going to be able to get Trump-like margins in the southwest part of the state? Unlike the -- he became close."

One of the most shocking revelations in this new book is that Brazile charges that Clinton staff was dominated by a small number of male aides who she claims exhibited sexist behavior to her. Shocking, because you remember Clinton and her aides spent so much time in public talking about inclusion and shattering the ultimate glass ceiling while charging that then-candidate Donald Trump mistreated women. But Brazile writes that in private, top Clinton officials, like the campaign managers -- you just heard about Robby Mook -- behave differently. Nodded when she talks, but then not actually listening to her or following up on what they agreed upon. It got so ugly that in one conference call, Brazile actually blurted to the male aides, \"Gentlemen, let's just put our manhood out on the table and see who's the bigger one because I know that mine is bigger than all of yours.\" Remember, we already learned Brazile's account what happened after Clinton fainted at that 9/11 memorial event, which led the party chair to briefly consider changing the ticket. That led Huma Abedin and dozens of other Clinton aides to sign an open letter to Brazile charging she was buying into Russian propaganda about Clinton's health. Brazile scoffs at all of that, so she just wanted basic respect from Clinton and her team while wishes that there was not so much turmoil right now ahead of the big gubernatorial races in places like Virginia and New Jersey."

And the other huge question I have is, why were you crafting a statement, weeks before you've even interviewed what ended up being nearly 16 people including the primary suspect herself, Hillary Clinton?

So, this comes as we're getting a closer look at the former Trump Campaign Aide, Carter Page's testimony as well before the House Intel Committee. And Page claims that Corey Lewandowski knew about a trip that he was taking to Russia. Here's his testimony with Congressman Trey Gowdy. I'm quoting here from the transcript. \"Gowdy: If you were going to Moscow in July of 2016, who did you tell, why did you tell them, and what did you tell them? Page: I had mentioned to them it was Corey Lewandowski, and I believe Hope Hicks and J.D., that I had received this invitation, you know, and I just wanted to let you know. Gowdy: And how did they respond?

The Clinton campaign has not publicly admitted that they spent millions of dollars to a spy overseas, an MI6 former agent to provide information and money to Russia to produce this dossier, the DNC as part of it. It seems to be that she might have had some cooperation with that through Fusion GPS.

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So we're getting some early numbers in Virginia, and I should stress that they are very early numbers. You can see 10 percent of the vote is in, and that's how it looks right now. Ed Gillespie at 51 percent, Ralph Northam at 44 percent. There are many counties that have not come in, so we will continue to keep a close eye on these as they come across, and we will keep you posted as we got more. Coming up next."

      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "President Xi where we will be tomorrow, China, has been very helpful. We'll find out how helpful soon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "President Trump sounding optimistic as he travels to China tonight with hopes of getting President Xi on board to try to stop the nuclear threat from North Korea. That is a very tall order, a delicate matter in so many ways. So who better than General Jack Keane to tell us what he thinks about this tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "We have brand-new video coming in from the president's trip in South Korea. We'll take you that in just a moment. But look at these numbers first of all. A 19 percent of the vote is in, and as you can tell it's tightening up quite a bit. It looks like a very tight race in the early going here, 49 percent to 50 percent with Ed Gillespie just slightly ahead. Nineteen percent of that vote in. We're going to get some analysis on that and look at the counties, what the importance is of what has been recorded, and what is still out there so we can give you a better sense of where this thing looks like it may be headed, and we'll do that in just a moment. In the meantime, new video, as I said, in from South Korea, where the president attempted to travel to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. You saw Bret Baier there earlier with a fascinating package about what it is like to be right on that border. But we're told that bad weather moved in, and they turned the motorcade around. The president had said earlier that -- the White House rather, that they weren't going to do that trip, which a lot of presidents do make because they want to spend time with the troops in South Korea instead. So we'll see what came of that. But tonight, as you know he is headed to China where he will begin his meetings with President Xi. Here now, General Jack Keane, chairman of the institute for the study of war, and a Fox News military analyst. General, what do you think about -- attempted the DMZ?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, I can understand it possibly. I've always thought it's overrated. The North Koreans take huge advantage of a president visiting the DMZ."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Oh, you mean a president going there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Oh, man. I mean, I thought the decision to go see the troops was a much better decision, and not give the North Koreans a photo op. I mean, this pressure around the president, oh, you got to go there and see this sort of thing. But I've been there a few times myself. It just doesn't measure up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's not a big deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "It doesn't measure up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So let's talk about the more important substance of this trip to China. And he has had a good relationship so far with President Xi. We've seen some movement from China that we didn't expect to see, but it's a long way to go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "I mean this is the centerpiece of the trip."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "As much as you're going to go to two countries after that, this is really what the Far East trip is all about. I mean, this is the most important bilateral relationship the United States is going to have in the 21st century. And President Xi has more power, and more ambition, more strategic ambition to be the preeminent global power in the world and replace the United States. He wants to dominate Asia and the pacific for sure. He's coming close to it already. That's why the president is reassuring our allies that we're back, we're in the game. We're going to stand by you. So he's got to go up there. He's got this incredibly delicate situation, Martha. He needs his help on North Korea. He's going to tell him you're not doing enough, I need it faster. I need more. At the same time, he's going to try to talk to them about Chinese aggression trampling all over our allies in the pacific and also our own interest. And he's going to talk to him about unfair trade and balances, the fact that U.S. companies can't compete so well inside of China. He's got to talk to them about cyber espionage, ripping off our intellectual property so much in the United States, so how he works that is really going to be statesmanship."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So talking about a chess for the art of the deal, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "That is a tough deal because he can't -- he needs his help, but in the same way he's got to put the other things on the table or Xi will walk out of there with a victory."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So it works both ways, too. Because China needs us economically, and they also don't really want a lot of trouble from North Korea. They don't want to deal with refugees pouring across their border from North Korea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Or a war."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Or a war. So there are common things that they both want, but I do find the most fascinating part of what you just said is his desire for world dominance. And Putin has the same desire. So you've got President Trump and President Xi and Vladimir Putin all fighting, and they're all strong characters, for the future of the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. We've return to an era of big power competition again, which we're -- you're not old enough to realize it, but I am. And we're there and we're right in the middle of it. Putin can't get to world domination because he doesn't have an economy to support him, but China can."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Fascinating,"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "And we're on a collision course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "General Jack Keane, we'll be along for the ride with you by our side. Thank you very much, good to see you, general. So coming up tonight, we'll get you some brand new numbers on the race in Virginia as we continue to watch these come in, 19 percent, 49-50. Very tight in the very early going here, and we're going to get some analysis on these numbers. Chris Stirewalt will join us and tell us which counties are in, what these numbers really mean in just a moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It is election night again in America, folks. You've got Virginia, New Jersey, and the mayor's race in New York City. The one that is the most interesting, because it looks like it could get interesting is Virginia. Ralph Northam is at 50 percent, and Ed Gillespie at 49 percent, 27 percent of the vote is in. And Chris Stirewalt is back on deck with us. Mollie Hemingway is also joining us now, senior editor of The Federalist. So Chris, let me go to you first, what do (INAUDIBLE) in these numbers for us, what do they say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Well, it's still quite early. Now we are seeing signs of quite a lot of turn out, and I mean like a lot of turnout both in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Who was that good for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Well, it depends on where it is. And we are seeing a ton of turnout in places like Northern Virginia and Charlottesville, which will be good for Northam. But at the same time, places in rural Virginia are keeping pace, at least with 2013 levels that they had. And remember, people forget about this in 2013, this is actually true. That in 2013 when they had the last race, Ken Cuccinelli, who was written off by many got within 2.5 points of Terry McAuliffe in this contest. So I would just say this, Virginia likes close races, and we're going to keep watching this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Mollie, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. This commonwealth is difficult to poll, but it does seem like Northam was heading into this with a solid lead. This is a blue state. It seems to get bluer every year. So he really should be able to pull this off. But there were so many things about this race that made it seem -- I mean, Ed Gillespie is a strong candidate. He almost won when he ran last time a few years ago for the senate. He has -- he's a little bit more favorable than most Republicans are in northern Virginia, which is lobbyist-heavy because Ed Gillespie himself is from that part of the economic sector. And then, of course, Ralph Northam did that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "The economic sector. You mean the huge swamp that drives real estate prices through the roof in the metro area around Washington, D.C.?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Lobbyist people too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Having just purchased a house, I can assure you that's exactly what I mean. But Ralph Northam coordinated on that ad where he basically accused all Republican voters of running down immigrant children, and that seemed to also spark some interest. I heard many neighbor say that they would crawl over broken glass to vote against him after that ad ran. So I think Northam should win, but I do think it will be close."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know what? I think we have a poll of what people thought of that ad, and just to remind everybody because we did that story the other night and we showed, you know, it's like an SUV, a black-window SUV with a big confederate flag on it, and it's ripping down neighborhood street, and little children are running in panic and fear for their lives, and there's a small black child, a Hispanic child, they grab their friend who is a Muslim girl. And the suggestion is that Gillespie is going to run you out of town. Chris, how does that go over with voters do we think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Obviously, it wasn't very good because they pulled it in about a day. This has been a heinously ugly race. Steve Bannon, the president's former strategist calls Ed Gillespie Trumpism without the Trump. And if Gillespie can find a way to win in Virginia using these issues, immigration as a top issue, but also crime, crime, crime. Crime works great for Gillespie in Northern Virginia where there's a large central -- Latin American population, MS13, talked about crime, talk about immigration. That works really well for him there. He had ads that is focus on that. That ads talking about sex crimes against children that I actually couldn't let my sons watch, it was so shocking. The ads in this race have been pretty garbage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Let's talk about New Jersey for just a moment. The polls close there at 8:00. Do we have the Chris Christie sound bite you guys from today? All right. This is Chris Christie when he went to vote today in vintage Chris Christie form. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE, R-N.J.",

      "speaker": "UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "I don't have the money like you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRISTIE",
      "utterance": "Oh, really? I'm sure. I'm sure. Easier to sit here and complain. But you know what? That's the joy of public service. It's serving folks -- it's serving folks -- yeah. It's serving folks like you that is really such a unique joy. It really is. You're fabulous. Any other questions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That's my home state, I know you're talking about West Virginia before, but that is just vintage bada bing there, right?"

      "speaker": "STIREWALT",

    },

      "utterance": "You know, talk about New Jersey for a moment here, Chris."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Well, look, Chris Christie is, as you mention earlier, arguably the least popular governor in the United States, and he seems to revel in it to a certain degree that he likes being the guy that they don't like, sort of being the heel, and kind of digs it. I think he's down with that. I think his lieutenant governor probably wishes that his numbers were a little better, but New Jersey is a state that does likes to flip-flop its governorship."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "This is true, Kim Guadagno. And the race is far from over in New Jersey, as we know. But Molly, you know, your thoughts on sort of the situation that Chris Christie was in, and maybe put his lieutenant governor in?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Chris Christie might be dragging down his side of the ticket there. But I think what's interesting about all these races is what it teaches us about how people are going to run in the next year. And again, I think, you know, as Chris said, what Gillespie did here by creating a coalition of establishment Republicans and Trumpites or Bannonites, and really making that work from him whether or not he wins. That is a way forward for Republicans. And so I think you're going to see people taking lessons from all of these local races, these state races, and see how they can make it work for them next time around."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But Chris, you know, he didn't embrace President Trump in the early stages of this. There was no Trump-Ed Gillespie rally happening in Virginia, which I would imagine the president would have been happy to do if he had asked for it. Why not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Well, look, it's fraught because we're talking about before, Virginia is two states. You have Northern Virginia, which is a Democratic state with a strong lien where Donald Trump only got about 35 percent of the vote in 2016. Then you have the rest of the state where if you put it altogether Donald Trump would have won it by three points. Donald Trump can help you a lot in Southwestern Virginia, if you go out to Wytheville, if you go out to Roanoke, he can help you a lot out there in Appalachian, Virginia, but he can't help you in the other side and most of the votes. And this is really the problem for Republicans in Virginia going forward. Most of the votes are up there in Northern Virginia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But are we going to see rural turn out like we saw in the national election? Do you think people are fired up in some of those areas where they weren't before? Mollie, your thoughts on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you're going to see -- I mean, we'll just have to wait and see. You don't know too much from exit polls or even earlier results. But I do think it's worth noting Mike Pence did campaign for Ed Gillespie, and much of the way that Ed Gillespie ran reminded me of how Mike Pence ran in the general last year for the presidential election. There are a lot of people who support Donald Trump as president, who might not support his style, who are very into the conservative principles, and they don't -- it's just as important as it is that Ed Gillespie didn't campaign with Trump. It's also important that he didn't run against Trump. And I think that that is the healthy balance we're going to see a lot of Republicans do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. We've got to go. Surprisingly close at this moment would you say, Chris?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Nah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Nah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. We're going to take a quick break, we will be right back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "We are back with more of \"The Story.\" And here's how the numbers are shaping up in Virginia tonight, 40 percent of the vote is in, Ralph Northam at 51 percent, Ed Gillespie at 48percent, as we wait for the other 60 percent of this. It is looking like a pretty tight race. And it's looking like turnout is pretty strong as well.
