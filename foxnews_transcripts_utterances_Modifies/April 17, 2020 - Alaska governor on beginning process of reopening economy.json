The tweet said, in part -- and I quote -- \"We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn't -- that you didn't need or use. These great men and women who did the job never hear you say thanks.\"   And after a reporter read a portion of the president's tweets, Cuomo thanked the president more than a dozen times, asking: \"What am I supposed to do, send him a bouquet of flowers?\" Cuomo said requests to increase hospital bed capacity were based on projections provided by the CDC and the White House Coronavirus Task Force.",

Now, one of the big issues that kept coming up -- and, again, David Lee was mentioning, as was I -- this need for testing. And a lot of top experts in the medical community have said, you're going to need a lot more of it before you start opening a lot more of it.  Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider with us now from the San Francisco Sutter Health Internal Medicine there. Now, Doctor, I was reading recently, in an interview you had, where you said, testing isn't only a good idea, it's necessary. You're worried about the whole lack of widespread testing.

But we have a responsibility to make sure that we do this in a safe way, and we're not just ramping everything back up at once and endangering the lives of potentially millions of people. And, as we all know, with this new virus, we're learning about it as we go. We're trying to gather as much new information and data as possible and base our decisions on science and evidence.   And so any reopening strategy needs to carefully balance, of course, the economic objectives with our public health objectives of this country. And it's critical, Neil, that we get this -- that we get this right and have the proper infrastructure in place with testing capacity.  We know that asymptomatic people can spread this virus. So, in many ways, it's an invisible virus. And so that's why widespread testing is so critical. And we also need, of course, reporting and the ability to trace and isolate cases to do this right, and -- because, as we know, American lives are at risk. What I will say is that testing capacity isn't where it needs to be anywhere in this country. Most Americans, for example, don't know, if they themselves are sick and need to get tested, do I call my doctor? Where do I go to get tested? How do I get those results?  I sure don't know those answers for myself and my family.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Doctor, a lot of states are planning to ease up on these lockdown provisions.  Bill Hemmer was just talking to the governor of Ohio, who has a plan eventually to do that. Even some of the states that have put that off until at least May 15 are working on plans where they can do this in a staggered fashion. The president has a three-phase program that addresses it the same way.  Are you saying, right now, the way we stand right out, it's too soon to be doing any of this?  UNGERLEIDER: Well, I'm saying that in order to enact that three-phase approach, we need to do -- we need to have three things in place. We need to have the data about numbers of cases.  So increase of widespread testing capacity is really critical. We don't yet have that anywhere, the capacity, number two, to treat patients within the health care system, and then have enough PPE so that health care workers can safely do their jobs. And then, three, the ability to trace the contacts of those who are infected, and they need data and evidence to drive all of these decisions, not an arbitrary timeline. And what would be disastrous is if each state doesn't have a clear sense of who's sick and where they are.  And to do this, we need to be running up to millions of tests a week, which isn't happening. This is dependent on things like a resilient supply chain of testing supplies. So we can't wait run out of the swabs that you need to test, or else this will hold up the process. And, unfortunately, we just aren't there yet in terms of our testing capacity. I think we will get there. That's the goal, but we definitely have a ways to go.",

If this were a worry to Wall Street, the testing thing, it didn't show it today. I want to show you a remarkable surge in the Dow today that really picked up steam literally in the last 20 minutes of trading, the Dow up better than 704 points.  Now, a lot of that wasn't really built on economic news. As you know, by and large, that news has been horrible. But it was well-telegraphed to be horrible. No, a report that Gilead Sciences just might be showing signs of an effective drug against the coronavirus. They're not even calling it a vaccine, per se, just something that shows great promise in treating this virus. Just news of that sent Gilead shares soaring today. But for the market, it provided a ray of hope that there is that proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. And that, coupled with a lot of these states unwinding their lockdown provisions, had some people thinking, maybe between these developments, and what the president wants to do on a three-phase sort of a coming-out process for the U.S. economy, we're moving in that direction.  Heather Zumarraga joining us all on these developments. Heather, did the market overdo it, get too excited, ahead of its skis? What other trite cliches can I come up with?

As you know, Heather, it wasn't that long ago, in the lows of the bear market, it was in and out of 18000. The fact of the matter is, we have retraced about 55 percent from the lows. And we're a little bit more than 5,000 points from the old highs in February. Is the market reflecting the reality here? I mean, it was fast on the way down. It seems to be fast on the way up.

As you rightfully pointed out, we had a rapid decline, almost 40 percent from the market highs. And we have recovered about half of that, over half that decline in a matter of two weeks as well. So as shocking and rapid move as we saw on the downside, we're seeing that on the upside. One clear winner is the technology sector from a shutdown economy. People are now working from home. If you have kept your job and you're not those that are joining the unemployed portion of Americans, you're keeping your job, working from home.

Moderna getting about $483 million from the federal government funding a virus vaccine that looks promising. I really think these type of developments -- and you follow them so well, Heather -- kind of make average folks, let alone investors, feel maybe something could be coming. It's on the cusp to make us worry a lot less about this virus, because I have always said the market and I think average folks ignore the stimulus around the virus. They welcome it.

You leave it up to the state and local governments and the governors to decide what is best for their states and communities on a local level, because every state is different.

Last week, Neil, \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" published data on hospitalized patients who were given I.V. remdesivir under a compassionate use basis.

The two have had a strained relationship since the beginning of this crisis. And now it appears to have escalated. As Cuomo was speaking, President Trump tweeted out criticism, accusing the governor of not being grateful for help provided and for asking for more assistance than was actually needed. The tweet said, in part -- and I quote -- \"We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn't -- that you didn't need or use.

Cuomo went on to call the president for -- to implement assistance in wide-scale testing and for financial help. And, again, he reaffirmed that the opening of the economy is the job for governors. Talking about the president's role, Neil, Governor Cuomo said -- and I quote -- \"All he's doing is walking in front of the parade, but he has nothing to do with the timing of the parade\" -- Neil."

They're going to need federal help. Was there any issue at all under President Trump that they wouldn't get it?"

    {
      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "The president has maintained that is going to be the responsibility of the states. The governor said many times that the states, especially New York, cannot do the type of large-scale testing that is going to be required to restore the economy, and although he says, when it comes to actually pulling the switch to put the economy back in operation, the testing is a requirement, and that will require the help of the federal government. So, right now, there is something of a stalemate -- Neil."

People that have very little sleep, it gets hot and nasty, and people are overwrought, overworked, so maybe just chalk it up to frayed nerves, my friend, David Lee Miller in New York on all of that. Now, one of the big issues that kept coming up -- and, again, David Lee was mentioning, as was I -- this need for testing. And a lot of top experts in the medical community have said, you're going to need a lot more of it before you start opening a lot more of it. Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider with us now from the San Francisco Sutter Health Internal Medicine there. Now, Doctor, I was reading recently, in an interview you had, where you said, testing isn't only a good idea, it's necessary. You're worried about the whole lack of widespread testing. What did you mean by that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. SHOSHANA UNGERLEIDER, SUTTER HEALTH",
      "utterance": "Well, thanks, Neil. Everybody wants to get our economy back up and running and get people back to work. But we have a responsibility to make sure that we do this in a safe way, and we're not just ramping everything back up at once and endangering the lives of potentially millions of people. And, as we all know, with this new virus, we're learning about it as we go. We're trying to gather as much new information and data as possible and base our decisions on science and evidence. And so any reopening strategy needs to carefully balance, of course, the economic objectives with our public health objectives of this country. And it's critical, Neil, that we get this -- that we get this right and have the proper infrastructure in place with testing capacity. We know that asymptomatic people can spread this virus. So, in many ways, it's an invisible virus. And so that's why widespread testing is so critical. And we also need, of course, reporting and the ability to trace and isolate cases to do this right, and -- because, as we know, American lives are at risk. What I will say is that testing capacity isn't where it needs to be anywhere in this country. Most Americans, for example, don't know, if they themselves are sick and need to get tested, do I call my doctor? Where do I go to get tested? How do I get those results? I sure don't know those answers for myself and my family."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, Doctor, a lot of states are planning to ease up on these lockdown provisions. Bill Hemmer was just talking to the governor of Ohio, who has a plan eventually to do that. Even some of the states that have put that off until at least May 15 are working on plans where they can do this in a staggered fashion. The president has a three-phase program that addresses it the same way. Are you saying, right now, the way we stand right out, it's too soon to be doing any of this?  UNGERLEIDER: Well, I'm saying that in order to enact that three-phase approach, we need to do -- we need to have three things in place. We need to have the data about numbers of cases. So increase of widespread testing capacity is really critical. We don't yet have that anywhere, the capacity, number two, to treat patients within the health care system, and then have enough PPE so that health care workers can safely do their jobs. And then, three, the ability to trace the contacts of those who are infected, and they need data and evidence to drive all of these decisions, not an arbitrary timeline. And what would be disastrous is if each state doesn't have a clear sense of who's sick and where they are. And to do this, we need to be running up to millions of tests a week, which isn't happening. This is dependent on things like a resilient supply chain of testing supplies. So we can't wait run out of the swabs that you need to test, or else this will hold up the process. And, unfortunately, we just aren't there yet in terms of our testing capacity. I think we will get there. That's the goal, but we definitely have a ways to go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Doctor, thank you very much. A good reminder for us all. Much appreciated. Have a safe, healthy weekend yourself. If this were a worry to Wall Street, the testing thing, it didn't show it today. I want to show you a remarkable surge in the Dow today that really picked up steam literally in the last 20 minutes of trading, the Dow up better than 704 points. Now, a lot of that wasn't really built on economic news. As you know, by and large, that news has been horrible. But it was well-telegraphed to be horrible. No, a report that Gilead Sciences just might be showing signs of an effective drug against the coronavirus. They're not even calling it a vaccine, per se, just something that shows great promise in treating this virus. Just news of that sent Gilead shares soaring today. But for the market, it provided a ray of hope that there is that proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. And that, coupled with a lot of these states unwinding their lockdown provisions, had some people thinking, maybe between these developments, and what the president wants to do on a three-phase sort of a coming-out process for the U.S. economy, we're moving in that direction. Heather Zumarraga joining us all on these developments. Heather, did the market overdo it, get too excited, ahead of its skis? What other trite cliches can I come up with? But what do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, as you know, the market is forward-looking. So this steady move into the close today, on the backs of horrible economic data, 22 million Americans now unemployed, as awful as that is, it was largely expected and already discounted into the marketplace. So this is just another anecdote, this promising news from Gilead, Gilead, though, cautioning that they do not have clinical trials yet, so they're cautioning on the optimism. But despite that, it was enough for the markets to rally into the close."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Heather, I just want to show you something. I don't know if you could see this here, but for our viewers back home -- and, Sam, if we can just show the market in the aggregate here, the Dow now crossing over 24000. As you know, Heather, it wasn't that long ago, in the lows of the bear market, it was in and out of 18000. The fact of the matter is, we have retraced about 55 percent from the lows. And we're a little bit more than 5,000 points from the old highs in February. Is the market reflecting the reality here? I mean, it was fast on the way down. It seems to be fast on the way up. Which is real?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZUMARRAGA",
      "utterance": "It really is. Well, it depends, if you're an investor or retail investor sitting at home, how you want to view things. It's glass half-full or half-empty. As you rightfully pointed out, we had a rapid decline, almost 40 percent from the market highs. And we have recovered about half of that, over half that decline in a matter of two weeks as well. So as shocking and rapid move as we saw on the downside, we're seeing that on the upside. One clear winner is the technology sector from a shutdown economy. People are now working from home. If you have kept your job and you're not those that are joining the unemployed portion of Americans, you're keeping your job, working from home. And the health care sector is only down 3 percent from its highs this year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And we should point out, besides the excitement over Gilead, Sanofi says that it can mass-produce a vaccine that, if it works, up to 600 million doses next year, again, if it works. Moderna getting about $483 million from the federal government funding a virus vaccine that looks promising. I really think these type of developments -- and you follow them so well, Heather -- kind of make average folks, let alone investors, feel maybe something could be coming. It's on the cusp to make us worry a lot less about this virus, because I have always said the market and I think average folks ignore the stimulus around the virus. They welcome it. But they really would much prefer progress on kicking this virus, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZUMARRAGA",
      "utterance": "You're right. People in the administration, such as Peter Navarro, have warned that shutting down the economy could be as bad or worse than the virus itself. And you couple these drug developments with the administration's plan to reopen the economy in four to six weeks, and whether you agree or disagree with that, there's a commonsense approach in three phases. You leave it up to the state and local governments and the governors to decide what is best for their states and communities on a local level, because every state is different. But, eventually, we need to reopen the economy. That's what needs to happen."

Now, we should also point out that that stimulus that has been in a holding pattern in Washington, the $250 billion thing that's going nowhere fast, it suddenly started moving, because of more stimulus and a deal that could be in the making. Stay with us."

And I know you're not happy with this, but you were right. I was wrong. I mean, the health numbers in Louisiana and elsewhere are better. We're -- our numbers are headed in the right direction. Economically, I mean, these numbers that have come out lately just take my breath away, 22 million jobs?

But I think what you're seeing with the president is, I see is -- that he's managing this situation, and he's now open to opening selective areas and letting governors decide, like Minnesota just did today, opening up fishing, hunting and golfing. And I think that was a good move. So, obviously people are going nuts, Neil. But it's different strokes for different folks. And he's having to make decisions. And that's what businesspeople have to do. Things don't always go as planned. And neither did this. And so he's doing the best that he can with what he's got and making decisions along the way. And I support him."

So I'm just wondering. I'm sure restaurants of all sorts will welcome getting back to business, probably fewer customers, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIAUTAUD",
      "utterance": "Oh, for sure. But, yes, there's -- they're obviously -- and they're going to have to just adapt. And the people that run the restaurants are going to adapt really, really quickly. And whatever the consumer demand is telling you, these small business owners will make those decisions, and they will adapt, and they we will do what it is that the consumer wants it to do. That's why the small business and free enterprise and the free market is so efficient. So, these small businesses will do what the customers want. If customers -- if the consumer demands masks, if the consumer wants a screen, if the consumer wants spacing, they will provide spacing. And they will do it before the government tells them to, because they're pretty quick on their feet. So, it's going to be what it is. It's going to be awkward. It's going to be uncomfortable. But they will adapt. And they are resilient and they will adapt to whatever -- whatever it is that the consumer demands. And they will couple that with what the rules are currently in place for that moment or that day or that week. And I think they're going to do just fine."

And I think that we're going to be the last ones that are going to get back to normal. So, this one in particular is very affected. And since -- we're at war right now. This is -- this is an unknown. Nobody knows what's going to happen. We don't know. We don't know when it's going to slow down, when it's going to end, when it's -- if it's going to pick up again or not. So there's going to be a lot of adapting, and there's going to be a lot of thinking on your feet. And there's going to be some mistakes made, not only by the business owners and the operators, but also by our governors and our president."

And then I remembered, having visited the state so many times -- love it, fantastic, awesome -- you do have Juneau and Fairbanks and Anchorage and a lot of other people who are tucked into fairly tight squeezes here, but in a massive state. The governor was sort of shepherding that process and trying to give an indication as to how people sort of get back to business as usual. Mike Dunleavy, Republican governor of that beautiful state of Alaska. Governor, very good to have you. Thank you for taking the time."

    {
      "speaker": "DUNLEAVY",
      "utterance": "So, we have 309 cases as of today, about 172 active cases, Neil. And we will probably have the lowest caseload in the entire country. Again, we got on this pretty early. We received that plane from Wuhan with U.S. diplomats and their families back in January. And, immediately, we began to stand up a response to what we thought was going to be a pandemic here in the state of Alaska, just understanding what the nature of that virus was. And so we have been on this since mid-January. And we have kept our caseload down, our numbers down. We have had a different type of social distancing here in Alaska. We tell people, you can do whatever you want, as long as you're six feet or more away from others. We have put some sanctions on certain businesses that -- where you would get crowds. But, for the most part, if you want to go hiking, running, walking, fishing, you can do it here in Alaska."

You want to get that go, and obviously return to things like elective surgery, which in many states across the country something they're not doing. But that's a hard process. So, where are you in that right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUNLEAVY",
      "utterance": "So, we have opened up our elective surgeries. We will be doing that here shortly. We have opened up all of our health care now, so folks can go see their chiropractors, their doctors, et cetera. We're working on our fishing industry. Our fishing industry is huge in the state of Alaska. And fishing starts here in May."

      "speaker": "DUNLEAVY",
      "utterance": "So, we're working through that process as well. And in terms of retail, we should have some guidance out here early next week in expanding our opening of retail also. And we're looking at restaurants too. For example, we have been having a conversation with the industry. And there is takeout. There's curbside. But for those that want to go to a restaurant, we're having discussions as to whether we could have a situation where a family that's under the same roof calls in for reservation and potentially goes to that restaurant. The adequate distance between others occurs, other families. But we're looking at a whole host of things, because, again, our caseload is not that high, and it looks like it's flattening out. And we do have the health care capacity now. So, we're feeling pretty good about things."

And I'm wondering, now, with all of this second-guessing on what the Chinese knew and what they didn't know or what they were saying and what they weren't saying, did you have any idea then that something was afoot or not smelling right, because a lot of people feel now, even with China updating some numbers out of Wuhan and elsewhere, that they're still not giving us the full truth about the severity of all of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUNLEAVY",
      "utterance": "Yes, good question. When this -- when we had the discussions with the State Department, and the plane came in, and when they landed, they -- the families cheered, obviously, because they were back here in America. We stood up. We sat up in our seats."

      "speaker": "DUNLEAVY",

So, then we heard rumors, like everyone else does, as to where this came from and so forth. But long story short, we knew this was going to be something that was a little -- that's going to be bigger than the flu, that was going to be different than other things, just by the urgency in getting those folks out of there and what was happening in Wuhan at that time. And so we're glad we did what we did. It's time for us to start easing off, because we can. But we don't know where this is going to go. We don't have a vaccination. We don't have antivirals at this point. We're prepared in Alaska to make sure that we have our testing in place. We're producing our own tests here in Alaska. We're getting some from the federal government as well. And that cooperation has been pretty good, Neil, but, long story short, Alaska is used to all kinds of natural disasters, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, fires, floods."

      "utterance": "Well, you were right to be cautious back then and raise some alarms. But, Governor, be well, be safe. My best to the residents in your beautiful state, the governor of Alaska, Mike Dunleavy. I'm sorry. There -- by the way, when I was reading this, there is something else I just want to alert you here. There are right now seven more states that have pushed back the school year or canceled it outright, bringing to, I believe, 24 states now that have nixed the rest of the school year. I hope to get an updated list for you right now. But it is the first time essentially half the country schools are not only shuttered, but shuttered for the rest of the year. Stay with us. Sadly, we can report right now that the number of deaths has just topped 1,000 in Connecticut, the first time it has topped 1,000. Governor Lamont will be joining me tomorrow on my Saturday show, \"Cavuto Live,\" to address this and other issues that have come up, in cooperation, he is, with other Northeast governors, including those in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Delaware, Pennsylvania, to -- this coordinated plan that they hope to start in the middle of next month, May 15. They have pushed back the sort of easing on a lot of these lockdown restrictions until at least then, while other states, like Texas, begin to essentially unwind those conditions, like, now, but, again, the death toll topic 1,000 in Connecticut. I will be speaking with the governor tomorrow. In the meantime, speaking of death tolls and all that, we're getting some mixed signals out of China. A lot of people have been suspicious the figures coming out of there. Then along comes a revision in the Wuhan death rate that effectively suddenly soared 50 percent. Gillian Turner on all of that, and what's really going on here -- Gillian."

The numbers are now totaling almost 3,900. And this is a big deal, because U.S. officials have been saying for weeks that you can't trust the official numbers coming out of the country. Today, we're also seeing senior White House officials, administration officials speak out about the ongoing investigation into Wuhan. Take a listen to Secretary Mike Pompeo."

Right now, we know intelligence analysts are looking into the Wuhan Institute of Virology and looking at what actions the Chinese government took and when they took them. Once they got what they are calling a complete site picture on all this, they're going to president their findings to the Trump administration. Ultimately, from there, President Trump, of course, will make a determination how to hold China accountable. That's where we're headed with all this next. Today, in the interim, China's government's punching back against the U.S. Take a listen to their Foreign Ministry."

They're saying that's off the table right now. That could change, because you know better than anyone investigations can ebb and flow and move all over the place. The other thing we're circling the wagons on this evening is claims that this that -- the virus, let's see -- I don't want to mince words here -- our sources are saying that more than ever before they are convinced this didn't come from a food market. So we will keep you apprised of that -- Neil."

The number of schools in this country -- or the number of states and schools that have essentially said class dismissed for the rest of the, there are 24 states now that have essentially given up on the school year, and saying there will be no school now for the rest of the year, among them, Oregon and Washington, Nebraska, Louisiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Alabama. I could go through them all here. There are at least five others, though, that are going to be closed through May, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Delaware, New York, and New Jersey, and Connecticut. If those other states hold, that would mean close to 60 percent of the of the nation's schools will be closed effective the rest of the year. Also, when we come back, the excitement around one company's drug, Gilead Sciences. It got more attention than even the company was talking about on an effective treatment for the coronavirus. Is it? A top doctor on that -- after this."

      "utterance": "All right, Gilead, boy, those shares were racing today. It could be coming up with a treatment for the coronavirus. I don't even know if they would go so far as to call on a vaccine, but something that does look promising. We have Dr. Janette Nesheiwat joining us right now on the phone. Doctor, obviously, the markets pounced on this as something extremely significant. The company itself was very reticent to say much on the subject, outside of it's working on something. Do you know what this is?"

      "speaker": "DR. JANETTE NESHEIWAT, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil. Hi. So, remdesivir, this is actually an antiviral drug. It's given an I.V. form. And it's under investigation. And it was actually first used to help fight a virus, a disease called Marburg disease, and Ebola years ago. But it's now being shown to maybe give some hope, some promise to those who are really critically and in the hospital. A small study showed that some patients who were given remdesivir were actually able to be discharged home in a matter of six days. So it gives us a little hope. But we still need a lot more data, a lot more research to know, is this safe? Is it efficacious? Is there any side effects? Because it's not a controlled study. It's just an anecdotal study. And we need to know more about it, because those patients could have just improved from time alone vs. did the medicine remdesivir really help? Last week, Neil, \"The New England Journal of Medicine\" published data on hospitalized patients who were given I.V. remdesivir under a compassionate use basis. And the results were shown to be promising. But, again, we need a lot more data, a lot more research to see, is this accurate? Is it going to work, or is it just maybe mild improvement of symptoms? It has been shown to be successful in vitro and in lab animals, but, as we know, what happens in the lab and in vitro doesn't always translate into reality."

Sanofi says that it is capable of mass-producing a vaccine that, if it works, they could churn it out at a rate of 600 million doses next year. Separately, Moderna is getting about half -- $483 billion, I should say, in federal funding for a separate vaccine that it's developing. So, there's a lot going on.

We have already started phase one trial this month actually. So, hopefully, within about a year, we will have a vaccine on the market.
