The changing of the guard, a peaceful transfer of power, another reassuring display of the awesome pageantry of constitutional government. There were solemn speeches today; sworn oaths, belted anthems, all echoing against the backdrop of 26,000 smartly attired Federal troops who are guarding our capital city from unseen threats. There's quite a display. It was all a lot to take, really.  So like many of you, we flipped on the tube to see what it meant. Here's what we learned.",

The funny thing is, and there are many funny things going on right now, every person with a microphone in every TV studio in America today knew the fuller truth when they said things like the ones you just heard. They knew, for example, for certain that Joe Biden isn't well. Everyone in Washington knows that, but no one said it out loud, not a word. They withheld that news from you as they have for months, so much for speaking truth to power. On the other hand, what did you expect? You've watched the lying for years now. You know what it is. You figured out how it works.  So it dawned on us today that maybe we ought to stop playing all these stupid media clips every night. It's like watching the town drunk throw up on himself over and over again. Obviously, it's repulsive and shocking. It's hard to turn away. But can you really be surprised by it?   Throwing up on themselves is what town drunks do. If you keep watching them as they do it, maybe after a while, you are part of the problem. Maybe so. In any case, we flipped off CNN and decided to check out Joe Biden's speech for ourselves. And it was interesting, actually, both for what it said and for what it didn't say. One particular part of the speech stuck out especially. Now, we didn't support Joe Biden for President, you probably guessed that. But if we're being totally honest here, and we want to be honest, we have to say it was very hard to disagree with this specific part of the address. Watch.",

      "sentences": "A declaration of war against white supremacy. Now, you may not have noticed that because then on one level, it's not very remarkable. Not many Americans support white supremacy. Most people in this country find it disgusting, of course, and they should.  But the question is, what is it exactly? Now that we're waging war on white supremacists, can somebody tell us in very clear language what a white supremacist is? That's not some Picayune semantic question. Joe Biden isn't a high school debate coach, Joe Biden is the new President of the United States. Joe Biden controls the largest military and largest law enforcement agencies in the world. He has now declared war. So we should know specifically and precisely who exactly he has declared war on. We have a right to know that. Innocent people could be hurt in this war, they usually are. There could be collateral damage in this war, and the casualties will be Americans.   So again, what is a white supremacist? You might be surprised to learn just how broad the definition for that has become. Bloomberg News has described a wall on our southern border as, quote, \"a monument\" to white supremacy so be certain not to support that. Colin Kaepernick who seems to have the unequivocal support of Corporate America calls the Fourth of July an example of white supremacy. So you'd better put away the fireworks and the hotdogs. The United States Army, a trusted institution, if there ever was one has used an entire manual on what is and what is not white supremacy. So you should know this. Among the telltale signs of a committed white supremacist are these: celebrating Columbus Day, using the term American exceptionalism, any support for Federal border security or English only measures or, quote, \"education funding from property taxes,\" all white supremacy.   Using the phrase, \"There's only one human race\" is white supremacy, too, according to the Army, and of course, voting for Donald Trump, all white supremacy.  Here's the problem. Let's say you don't buy those definitions. Let's say you're, for example, white foot poor, and you have trouble accepting the idea that you're benefiting from some kind of structural advantage. We better shut up about it if you know what's good for you because according to the United States Army, the quote, \"denial of white privilege\" is a classic sign of yes, white supremacy, so no complaining. You can see the problem with this, we definitely can see the problem. This show was not on the air for six months before there was an organized and highly aggressive campaign by prominent Democrats to denounce us as white supremacist. The first time it happened, the people who work on this show, many of them kids, were shocked and horrified by that. White supremacists? What's worse than that?  The phrase evokes images of burning crosses and lynchings. It's awful. In our case, it was totally undeserved. This show is completely opposed to the practice of judging people on the basis of their skin color. We have said that repeatedly every week for four years. No show in all media has said it more or meant it more sincerely.  Why have we said that? Why are we opposed to judging people on the basis of their race? Not simply because we were taught to oppose doing that though we were, but because it's immoral, and it's immoral because we believe in God. That's the real answer.  Believing in God doesn't make you a good person, unfortunately. But believing in God does answer the question of where we came from. God made us, that's what believers believe. Once you understand that, it is impossible to think that any one race is inherently better or worse than any other race, because God made every person.  God assigns an identical moral value to every individual. God cares about all of us equally. So we are judged by what we do, not by how we were born. We really believe that. Most Americans really believe that. It's not an accident that Martin Luther King was a Christian Minister and that Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong were not. Secular leaders are the ones most likely to count their populations by race, and then to embrace collective punishment. Through history, they often have. We've said all of that before in the show many times.  So the question is, why have they kept denouncing us, as of all things, white supremacists? We thought a lot about that, you should think a lot about it, too now that the Biden administration has declared war on people they claim to have white supremacist ideas. In our case, it all started when we began criticizing the people in charge. Other channels fill their air with attacks on so-called Proud Boys, whoever they are, or the QAnon enthusiasts or gun owners in Central Pennsylvania who fix air conditionings for a living and tend to vote the wrong way. They go after those people, and you can see why. Attacking those people isn't hard. None of them have real power. They don't -- let's be honest, they don't. But private equity does have power, a lot of power. So does Google, so does Citibank, so does the government of China, so does even silly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with her massive social media accounts. Those are the people who run our country. They don't like to be criticized. On the other hand, they don't care to defend themselves directly with reason and fact, often they can't do that. So instead, they denounce you, your critics, their critics, as white supremacists. And then they just ignore what you say. Fine. We've dealt with this for years, we're used to it. It no longer hurts our feelings, we understand what's going on.  But there's a new regime in power starting today and they seem to be planning to accelerate things dramatically. They're getting the F.B.I. and The Pentagon involved in this hunt for people who may criticize them. That's a very big change, and you should understand what it's really about.  Jason Whitlock is a journalist. We're always happy to have him on the show. Jason, thanks so much for coming on tonight. No one ever says this, but I think it's true that the bulwark against white supremacy, supremacy of any kind, racial supremacy of any kind is faith. And that people of faith are far less likely, in fact, they're commanded not to judge people on the basis of how they were born. Why does nobody say that?",

Black people, as I said on Monday are being fooled into thinking this is some sort of defense of us. It is not. When you start talking about basically a war on white supremacy, basically a war on people that you disagree with politically, because that's all this is, whoever the left disagrees with, gets painted as a white supremacist. It's happened to me, I'm black. I'm proudly black with two black parents, black siblings. I'm in no denial. I'm actually -- I'm proud of being black. But now because I express conservative values, conservative non-political values, I'm seen as a friend of white supremacists. I'm a white supremacist. Anybody that disagrees with the left is a white supremacist. And now with this war on white supremacy, just like the war on drugs was an attack on the working class and poor, we are about to see it all over again. And I just want to reach out to black people and quit -- let's quit being used as a pawn by a political organization, the left, Democrats.   They're punching down.

Police officers assassinated, citizens assassinated. No one gets blamed for that. But people walk into the Capitol, unarmed. And this is the -- this is Pearl Harbor. This is 9/11 all over again.

What he is saying is the exact opposite. Every group he lifted, even libertarians. Essentially, he is defining the insurgency as anyone who has an ideology, other than neoliberalism. In other words, other than the ruling class of you that is about to congeal and merge with the power of the state. And what they're talking about explicitly, Tucker, is using the tools that they used to take ISIS off the internet, the tools that they used to destroy al Qaeda. They're talking about it as a second war on terror, and that first war and terror no matter what your views were originally at the beginning of 9/11 ended up eroding, not civil liberties, just elsewhere, but here at home as well. One that is born by name of being a domestic orienteer designed to essentially criminalize any oppositional ideology to the ruling class.

Now those same New York Times employees and the rest of the mainstream media are cheering on the militarization not just with the nation's capital, but of all 50 state capitals. Now, why might this be, Tucker? Is there a sudden newfound respect for law and order and for the police officers of this country? Of course not. The Biden administration has already declared that it's going to reinvigorate the war on cops that the Obama administration prosecuted. Now the reason that they are loving the tanks, the barbed wire, the guys in military riot gear is because they serve as a visual symbol for what is going to be the dominant theme of the Biden administration, which is that the greatest threat in America today is the so-called rising tide of systemic racism and white supremacy. That's a lie, but it's a lie that allows them to get to an even bigger agenda, something you've been covering relentlessly, Tucker, that is the biggest worry right now to our constitutional liberties, which is the use - - the attempts to destroy First Amendment protections for conservative speech on the idea that it is giving rise to this threat of domestic terrorism.",

As you might expect, that means she is not for equality or against racism. She favors overt racial discrimination for the benefit of groups she believes vote for the Democratic Party. She was in the Obama administration. And at that time, Catherine Lhamon threatened several school districts with civil action. Why? Because more African-American students were getting suspended than white students. Therefore, she concluded by definition, those schools must be racist. She couldn't think of another explanation. Then in April of 2018, Lhamon came on this show to defend race based admissions policies. I've got to give her credit for saying it out loud. She did.

The presumption is it's a demonstrably false and indeed inane presumption that almost every disparity on the basis of race is the result of systemic racism or outright white supremacy. And, you know, there are no other reasons for disparities. And it results in things like the school discipline policy that she enforced while she was a member of the U.S. Office of Civil Rights for the Department of Education that presumed that disparities in suspensions and discipline in schools is a result of racism. So schools in order to abide by this guidance engaged in quotas. Now, what that also resulted in in terms of suspensions, so you had kids who are violent and acting out remaining in class, and as a result of that, predictably what happened was that the amount of violence in schools skyrocketed. We had a hearing in which teachers testified that they were being beaten, one suffered brain damage. Hundreds of thousands of students per year polled said they missed at least one day of school because of fear of going for school, it was a concrete disaster. But this is what happens when you count by race. This is what happens when you don't take into consideration very well-known reasons for why there are disparities that have absolutely nothing to do with racism. And in 2021, the good news is, it is rarely vanishingly rare the case that racism promotes or is the cause for disparities on the basis of race, but we're going to see more and more stress on identity politics, more and more stress on structural causes of racism that permit for the kind of social engineering under the guise of trying to remedy racial disparities.",

He joins us tonight, Steve, one of my hopes is to be able to watch television, again, without gritting my teeth, just like basic news coverage. Are we ever going to get that do you think? STEVE KRAKAUER, FOUNDER, \"FOURTH WATCH\": Yes, I don't know. Because it does feel like the pendulum is starting to swing a whole different direction right now. Look, I think if there was one positive that came from the Trump era, it was the journalists sort of rediscovered the idea that the press should serve the public and be a check on power, and it should have an adversarial relationship with the power now. Now, the press in the Trump era went completely overboard and became you know, this is this evil, you know, dictatorship that we're covering. But at least that's, you know -- maybe if you could take some of those lessons and bring that to the Biden era.",

You know, I had Olivia Nuzzi, who is one of the few reporters in D.C. who I actually trust may keep that adversarial relationship go into the next era. She was on my podcast and she described that a lot of D.C. based journalists are motivated by the reluctance to make one's social life uncomfortable. So the idea is, look, you can be mean to Kayleigh McEnany and you can interrupt her all day, and you're just going to get praised on Twitter and no one is going to care. Everyone's going to beat -- you know, you're going to get more Twitter followers. If you start doing that to Jen Psaki, you start interrupting her, you're going to be -- you know, you're going to be a misogynist, or you know, a mansplainer, and you're not going to get invited to the same parties that probably Jen Psaki is going to. And you're certainly going to get, you know, railed against on Twitter. So, yes, I'm very concerned about the way that this is going to go, and I think that, that what we're -- if it's any indication of where things were in the Obama years, and frankly, even a little bit in the Bush years, I think that we need to have a press that is motivated to be adversarial. And I'm not sure we're seeing that, particularly, as I'm seeing all of these tweets right now from people saying that they are so tired and exhausted from the last four years, kind of not giving good signs of where things are about to go next.",

Now that we're waging war on white supremacists, can somebody tell us in very clear language what a white supremacist is? That's not some Picayune semantic question. Joe Biden isn't a high school debate coach, Joe Biden is the new President of the United States. Joe Biden controls the largest military and largest law enforcement agencies in the world. He has now declared war. So we should know specifically and precisely who exactly he has declared war on. We have a right to know that. Innocent people could be hurt in this war, they usually are. There could be collateral damage in this war, and the casualties will be Americans. So again, what is a white supremacist? You might be surprised to learn just how broad the definition for that has become. Bloomberg News has described a wall on our southern border as, quote, \"a monument\" to white supremacy so be certain not to support that. Colin Kaepernick who seems to have the unequivocal support of Corporate America calls the Fourth of July an example of white supremacy. So you'd better put away the fireworks and the hotdogs."

      "utterance": "celebrating Columbus Day, using the term American exceptionalism, any support for Federal border security or English only measures or, quote, \"education funding from property taxes,\" all white supremacy. Using the phrase, \"There's only one human race\" is white supremacy, too, according to the Army, and of course, voting for Donald Trump, all white supremacy. Here's the problem. Let's say you don't buy those definitions. Let's say you're, for example, white foot poor, and you have trouble accepting the idea that you're benefiting from some kind of structural advantage. We better shut up about it if you know what's good for you because according to the United States Army, the quote, \"denial of white privilege\" is a classic sign of yes, white supremacy, so no complaining. You can see the problem with this, we definitely can see the problem. This show was not on the air for six months before there was an organized and highly aggressive campaign by prominent Democrats to denounce us as white supremacist. The first time it happened, the people who work on this show, many of them kids, were shocked and horrified by that. White supremacists? What's worse than that? The phrase evokes images of burning crosses and lynchings. It's awful. In our case, it was totally undeserved. This show is completely opposed to the practice of judging people on the basis of their skin color. We have said that repeatedly every week for four years. No show in all media has said it more or meant it more sincerely. Why have we said that? Why are we opposed to judging people on the basis of their race? Not simply because we were taught to oppose doing that though we were, but because it's immoral, and it's immoral because we believe in God. That's the real answer. Believing in God doesn't make you a good person, unfortunately. But believing in God does answer the question of where we came from. God made us, that's what believers believe. Once you understand that, it is impossible to think that any one race is inherently better or worse than any other race, because God made every person. God assigns an identical moral value to every individual. God cares about all of us equally. So we are judged by what we do, not by how we were born. We really believe that. Most Americans really believe that. It's not an accident that Martin Luther King was a Christian Minister and that Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong were not. Secular leaders are the ones most likely to count their populations by race, and then to embrace collective punishment. Through history, they often have. We've said all of that before in the show many times. So the question is, why have they kept denouncing us, as of all things, white supremacists? We thought a lot about that, you should think a lot about it, too now that the Biden administration has declared war on people they claim to have white supremacist ideas. In our case, it all started when we began criticizing the people in charge. Other channels fill their air with attacks on so-called Proud Boys, whoever they are, or the QAnon enthusiasts or gun owners in Central Pennsylvania who fix air conditionings for a living and tend to vote the wrong way. They go after those people, and you can see why. Attacking those people isn't hard. None of them have real power. They don't -- let's be honest, they don't. But private equity does have power, a lot of power. So does Google, so does Citibank, so does the government of China, so does even silly, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with her massive social media accounts. Those are the people who run our country. They don't like to be criticized. On the other hand, they don't care to defend themselves directly with reason and fact, often they can't do that. So instead, they denounce you, your critics, their critics, as white supremacists. And then they just ignore what you say. Fine. We've dealt with this for years, we're used to it. It no longer hurts our feelings, we understand what's going on. But there's a new regime in power starting today and they seem to be planning to accelerate things dramatically. They're getting the F.B.I. and The Pentagon involved in this hunt for people who may criticize them. That's a very big change, and you should understand what it's really about. Jason Whitlock is a journalist. We're always happy to have him on the show. Jason, thanks so much for coming on tonight. No one ever says this, but I think it's true that the bulwark against white supremacy, supremacy of any kind, racial supremacy of any kind is faith. And that people of faith are far less likely, in fact, they're commanded not to judge people on the basis of how they were born. Why does nobody say that?"

This is secular values blossoming and coming into power, and the left and this power elite, I just can't blame just the left. Political elites are demonizing the people they are supposed to represent. This is an attack on the American people. Black people, as I said on Monday are being fooled into thinking this is some sort of defense of us. It is not. When you start talking about basically a war on white supremacy, basically a war on people that you disagree with politically, because that's all this is, whoever the left disagrees with, gets painted as a white supremacist. It's happened to me, I'm black. I'm proudly black with two black parents, black siblings. I'm in no denial. I'm actually -- I'm proud of being black. But now because I express conservative values, conservative non-political values, I'm seen as a friend of white supremacists. I'm a white supremacist. Anybody that disagrees with the left is a white supremacist. And now with this war on white supremacy, just like the war on drugs was an attack on the working class and poor, we are about to see it all over again. And I just want to reach out to black people and quit -- let's quit being used as a pawn by a political organization, the left, Democrats. They're punching down. They're attacking 75 million people that voted for Trump. And in that attack, they're also attacking you, trust me."

What about the lies we listened to all summer about the police killing black people randomly? And they got everybody wound up and riots and violence all across the country. Police officers assassinated, citizens assassinated. No one gets blamed for that. But people walk into the Capitol, unarmed. And this is the -- this is Pearl Harbor. This is 9/11 all over again.

And what's the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party right now? Black Lives Matter and Antifa. They will come to your home and violate your home, try to intimidate the people in your home, if they disagree with you, politically. Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization. Marxism is hostile towards religion. That's why I'm glad you went there today.

That's the way to inoculate yourself from ever being accused of racism or being a sellout to your black race. That is their political strategy. That's what they're offering the people. We can protect you from being smeared as a racist. Joe Biden offered no policies today. There were platitudes and generalizations and attacks on President Trump. There was no vision expressed for America and how we move this country forward. There was no offer of unity. Again, as we said, a week or two ago, you have to reach out to these 75 million people and say, hey, I know you're struggling, and I know you're frustrated with this country. Let's have a conversation and let's quit smearing each other. Let me hear your concerns and try to address some of them. We're not doing that, so I don't see any unity being promoted."

But if you listen carefully to what he said and what his allies have been saying for the past couple of weeks, we are now in a new war on terror, but it's a domestic war focused inward on the people of this country.

The thing that struck me so much about that John Brennan video is it would be one thing if they were saying, look, there's a band of people 20 here 50 over here who wear swastika armbands, who still are in the KKK, there's maybe 2,000 we need to -- that's not what they're saying. What he is saying is the exact opposite. Every group he lifted, even libertarians. Essentially, he is defining the insurgency as anyone who has an ideology, other than neoliberalism. In other words, other than the ruling class of you that is about to congeal and merge with the power of the state. And what they're talking about explicitly, Tucker, is using the tools that they used to take ISIS off the internet, the tools that they used to destroy al Qaeda. They're talking about it as a second war on terror, and that first war and terror no matter what your views were originally at the beginning of 9/11 ended up eroding, not civil liberties, just elsewhere, but here at home as well. One that is born by name of being a domestic orienteer designed to essentially criminalize any oppositional ideology to the ruling class. There is literally nothing that could be more dangerous, and it's not fear mongering or alarmism to say it. There are bills pending by Adam Schiff as well that would simply take the existing war on terror legislation always aimed at foreign governments and foreign actors and simply amend it to say we can now do that within the United States."

It is not true. There is a ruling class elite that is extremely comfortable with the establishment wings of both parties. They love Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and everybody as much as they love Mitch McConnell and Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio and Paul Ryan. Those are the people who they fund equally, because those are the people who serve their agenda. Then there's a whole other huge group of people at whose expense they roll in. Some of them consider themselves on the left and some consider themselves on the right, and it's time to break down those barriers. I was super enthused to see a group of eight left-wing politicians, including Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar and others say, we will not allow a new war on terror because we know how dangerous it can be.

Now the Big Tech companies told us that was disinformation. It wasn't, it was all true. In fact, there is still an active Federal investigation into Joe Biden's family, excuse me, his son about his overseas business dealings.

You could say that Joe Biden won the election because of the censorship and the favorable reporting that he received. And now, you saw just from the first press conference just a little over an hour ago that the media is really eating out of the Biden administration's hands. Only one reporter, that was Peter Doocy, from Fox News, asked a question that was difficult and that was one about unity. How can you possibly be preaching unity when you're trying to impeach your predecessor? So I don't think that anything will change. And all we saw before the election was that the media was quite happy to accept some complete nonsense from people like John Brennan and his former colleagues, the spooks, so-called, who told us that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation. Well, it wasn't. But now they have a new bogeyman, and as you rightly said, Joe Biden put it out there in his supposedly unifying inauguration speech today, it is domestic terrorists.

Now those same New York Times employees and the rest of the mainstream media are cheering on the militarization not just with the nation's capital, but of all 50 state capitals. Now, why might this be, Tucker? Is there a sudden newfound respect for law and order and for the police officers of this country? Of course not. The Biden administration has already declared that it's going to reinvigorate the war on cops that the Obama administration prosecuted. Now the reason that they are loving the tanks, the barbed wire, the guys in military riot gear is because they serve as a visual symbol for what is going to be the dominant theme of the Biden administration, which is that the greatest threat in America today is the so-called rising tide of systemic racism and white supremacy. That's a lie, but it's a lie that allows them to get to an even bigger agenda, something you've been covering relentlessly, Tucker, that is the biggest worry right now to our constitutional liberties, which is the use - - the attempts to destroy First Amendment protections for conservative speech on the idea that it is giving rise to this threat of domestic terrorism."

Democratic Members of Congress today announced they were wearing body armor at the Inauguration. Meditate on that for a minute. Meanwhile, Catherine Lhamon is Joe Biden's picked to be the Deputy Director of something called the Domestic Policy Council for Racial Justice and Equity, not equality, which is what we are in favor of, all Americans are, but equity, something very different. As you might expect, that means she is not for equality or against racism. She favors overt racial discrimination for the benefit of groups she believes vote for the Democratic Party. She was in the Obama administration. And at that time, Catherine Lhamon threatened several school districts with civil action. Why? Because more African-American students were getting suspended than white students. Therefore, she concluded by definition, those schools must be racist. She couldn't think of another explanation. Then in April of 2018, Lhamon came on this show to defend race based admissions policies. I've got to give her credit for saying it out loud. She did.

The clips that you've played with respect to Catherine and her position with respect to race, especially with respect to education, we've had hearings at the Civil Rights Commission where positions and in fact, if you look at her opinions that she has written after we've had hearings, make it very clear that what we're about to engage in is, again, racial politics on steroids. The presumption is it's a demonstrably false and indeed inane presumption that almost every disparity on the basis of race is the result of systemic racism or outright white supremacy. And, you know, there are no other reasons for disparities. And it results in things like the school discipline policy that she enforced while she was a member of the U.S. Office of Civil Rights for the Department of Education that presumed that disparities in suspensions and discipline in schools is a result of racism. So schools in order to abide by this guidance engaged in quotas. Now, what that also resulted in in terms of suspensions, so you had kids who are violent and acting out remaining in class, and as a result of that, predictably what happened was that the amount of violence in schools skyrocketed. We had a hearing in which teachers testified that they were being beaten, one suffered brain damage. Hundreds of thousands of students per year polled said they missed at least one day of school because of fear of going for school, it was a concrete disaster. But this is what happens when you count by race. This is what happens when you don't take into consideration very well-known reasons for why there are disparities that have absolutely nothing to do with racism. And in 2021, the good news is, it is rarely vanishingly rare the case that racism promotes or is the cause for disparities on the basis of race, but we're going to see more and more stress on identity politics, more and more stress on structural causes of racism that permit for the kind of social engineering under the guise of trying to remedy racial disparities."

For example, you cannot talk about Kamala or is it Kamala -- hard to know -- you noticed that Justice Sonia Sotomayor got it wrong, maybe we think -- in any way that's not fawningly positive. That's deeply sexist, if you do. Go get reprogrammed, misogynist. Of course, that rule does not apply to the media. When CBS News runs entire segments on Kamala Harris's shoes, it is not offensive. It is indeed empowering."

You're a journalist, your job is to inform your viewers and your readers about what they can expect from their government. But instead, you degrade yourself by asking about her shoes.

You wouldn't lose your job if you did that. I'd love to see it though. Speaking of losing their job, Jim Acosta at CNN lost his job, you may not have read that. He is no longer going to be their Chief White House correspondent. He's still oppressed though. Today, Jim Acosta celebrated the ouster of a dictator, a fascist so bad that Jim Acosta got a book deal out of criticizing him. Those words are behind us now, thank God. Jim Costa is celebrating, the dictator is gone."

You're not going to get COVID outside at a live shot. This is just performance art, and it's very tiresome. Please stop. Will they stop? How long will this go on exactly? Steve Krakauer is the editor of the \"Fourth Watch\" podcast. He joins us tonight, Steve, one of my hopes is to be able to watch television, again, without gritting my teeth, just like basic news coverage. Are we ever going to get that do you think? STEVE KRAKAUER, FOUNDER, \"FOURTH WATCH\": Yes, I don't know. Because it does feel like the pendulum is starting to swing a whole different direction right now. Look, I think if there was one positive that came from the Trump era, it was the journalists sort of rediscovered the idea that the press should serve the public and be a check on power, and it should have an adversarial relationship with the power now. Now, the press in the Trump era went completely overboard and became you know, this is this evil, you know, dictatorship that we're covering. But at least that's, you know -- maybe if you could take some of those lessons and bring that to the Biden era."

      "speaker": "KRAKAUER",
      "utterance": "I think we're going to -- yes, I'm not sure we're going to see that. You know, I had Olivia Nuzzi, who is one of the few reporters in D.C. who I actually trust may keep that adversarial relationship go into the next era. She was on my podcast and she described that a lot of D.C. based journalists are motivated by the reluctance to make one's social life uncomfortable. So the idea is, look, you can be mean to Kayleigh McEnany and you can interrupt her all day, and you're just going to get praised on Twitter and no one is going to care. Everyone's going to beat -- you know, you're going to get more Twitter followers. If you start doing that to Jen Psaki, you start interrupting her, you're going to be -- you know, you're going to be a misogynist, or you know, a mansplainer, and you're not going to get invited to the same parties that probably Jen Psaki is going to. And you're certainly going to get, you know, railed against on Twitter. So, yes, I'm very concerned about the way that this is going to go, and I think that, that what we're -- if it's any indication of where things were in the Obama years, and frankly, even a little bit in the Bush years, I think that we need to have a press that is motivated to be adversarial. And I'm not sure we're seeing that, particularly, as I'm seeing all of these tweets right now from people saying that they are so tired and exhausted from the last four years, kind of not giving good signs of where things are about to go next."

I think all the smart ones went into finance or something. It's kind of the slow second son goes over to work at NBC. It it's very sad, because we kind of need a competent media.

So if you really meant it, why wouldn't he? And well, he is the question. Call on his allies in the monopolies in Silicon Valley to stop censoring people, Americans.' Vivek Ramaswamy has thought a lot about that question, a lot. He's a tech entrepreneur, author of the forthcoming book, \"Woke, Inc.,\" which we plan to read. Vivek, thanks so much for coming on. So if you wanted to unify the country, why wouldn't you just say, look, people get to speak freely. And I may disagree, but I can handle it because I'm an American. Do you think he will do that?"

We engage with them. We debate them. And for the President of the United States to step up and do that would be a small step actually, for Joe Biden, but I think it would be a big step forward for this country."

America's story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us, on we, the people. That's the task before us. The only way we'll get through the darkness around us. There are moments in our history, when more is asked of us as Americans. We saw that in the Civil War. We saw that with Dr. King dreaming from these steps across the Mall. We are in one of those moments now. The pandemic, economic crisis, racial injustice, the climate crisis, and threats to our very democracy. The question is, are we up to it? Will we meet the moment like our forebears have? I believe we must and I believe we will. You, the American people are the reason why I've never been more optimistic about America than I am this very day. There isn't anything we can't do, if we do it together and that's what you'll see tonight. Stories of ordinary Americans who do extraordinary things. That's how we'll celebrate America, and respect and represent America in our time in office. America, America, built of decency -- it is built of decency and dignity, of love and healing, of greatness and goodness, of possibilities. This is a story that guides us, inspires us, and unites us today and always. So thank you for this honor. I will give my all to you. May God bless America and may God protect our troops."

There aren't a ton, but you're looking at a live shot of the Teddy Roosevelt statue at the Museum of Natural History in New York. Teddy Roosevelt, the greatest President we ever had, one of the greatest people who ever lived here. But since May, you have heard calls to tear the statue down. In fact, it is now planned to be torn down. The Mayor of New York said he will tear it down for reasons he has never really explained. But it is still standing tonight, and that's the point we want to make. And as long as it does stand, the country has not gone completely crazy. Mark Steyn joins us tonight to celebrate this and tell us what it means. Great to see you, Mark."

You can't tear down history. If you tear down history, you leave a void where something false fills it instead. That's the story of every totalitarian society. So it's great to see that this thing is still standing in defiance of the mobs we saw over the summer."

      "speaker": "STEYN",

That's why, you know, they are furious at any talk of pardoning Julian Assange because we have bozos running the most lavishly funded Intelligence Community in the world and they couldn't keep their secrets, because John Brennan isn't -- shouldn't be holding that job."

What do you think about the -- what are the principles you believe it? That would be the most devastating hour of television ever made, which is why they will do whatever they can to prevent it from being made. You used to wear Chuck Taylors."
