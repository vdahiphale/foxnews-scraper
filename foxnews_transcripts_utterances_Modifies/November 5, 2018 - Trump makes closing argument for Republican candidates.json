And coming up, the president himself, he's going to join us for an exclusive live interview. Plus, we'll take Rush Limbaugh's speech as it happens. So, tonight, so much is at stake in a few short hours. Are you ready? A packed house. Americans, you have the power. You have the fate of all 435 House seats, 35 Senate seats and 36 gubernatorial elections.  As we speak, the balance of power is literally up for grabs and in just a moment, we're going to break down all of the close races. We're also going to call out the mainstream media and their final negative over-the-top predictable push for all the Democratic allies and Democratic parties. And tonight, we have the highlights from the president's final message to you, we the people, as he's been pounding the campaign trail, crisscrossing all across the country.  America, you have the power. Tomorrow you can shock the world again. It's time for our midterm elections breaking news, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "All right. Two years ago, Americans from all over this country went to the polls. They cast their ballots for Donald J. Trump. Virtually all of the political pundits and analysts, so-called journalists, pollsters, they predicted a huge win for Hillary and they were all dead wrong. Americans, the voters, you shocked the world and ever since -- well, the Trump agenda has been paying massive dividends in just two short years.  The economy is booming, 4.5 million new jobs, 4.3 million fewer Americans on food stamps. Four million Americans lifted out of poverty.   On the manufacturing plant, Obama said these jobs -- they're never coming back -- 400,000 new jobs. Unemployment claims are at a 49-year low. In just two years, we are seeing record low unemployment for African- Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans, historic unemployment for women in the workplace. These are all records. And for military veterans and for youth unemployment; median household income is now hitting record highs, 4.2 percent GDP growth in the second quarter, 3.5 percent in the most recent quarter. And this all comes as President Trump slashed regulations, promises made, promises kept. It comes after he signed of the single biggest middle-class tax cut in American history. A promise made, a promise kept. He opened up American energy. Now, literally, we are in a path towards energy independence, green lighting the drilling at Anwar, the Dakota access pipeline, the Keystone pipeline, a promise made, a promise kept.  Negotiating new trade deals in Europe, renegotiating NAFTA. Pulled us out of the job killing Paris Accord. Promises made, promises kept.  In two short years, he's led with peace through strength abroad. He has pulled us out of the one-sided ridiculous insanity of the nuclear deal. We are no longer dropping cargo planes of cash on a tarmac for radical mullahs chant \"Death to America.\" Addressing the looming crisis in North Korea, keeping their promise has so many other presidents made, he's the only one to keep this promise of moving the embassy in Jerusalem -- in Israel to Jerusalem. Promises made, promises kept.   And despite being out of the office for two years -- this is the joke of all jokes -- watching Obama this weekend, Obama had the worst record of any president in modern history, which I will point out, he's now trying to take credit for Trump's success. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Let's remind you, the voters, what his actual records is, because it's humiliating and it's embarrassing. Eight years of Obama, 13 million more Americans are on food stamps, 8 million more on poverty, the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s, the worst recovery since the '40s, the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years.  Get this -- he was the only president in the U.S. history never to experience 3 percent GDP growth in a single year of his presidency. Oh, and the guy that claimed $9 trillion in debt, oh, that's irresponsible, and unpatriotic. In eight years of Obama, he took on more debt than every other president before him combined. That was two years ago.   Today, President Trump has been making a final pitch to voters and an op-ed on FOX News. And the message is clear: If you want more safety and security and prosperity for the American people from all walks of life, this is about continuing the progress, voting Republican. The Democrats, we know, they have no plan to make your life better, safer, more prosperous. Eight years under Obama was a disaster. So instead, what have we been witnessing? Democrats have some pretty extreme ulterior motives. I've been sounding the alarm about this for months right here on this show. When Democrats tell you what their plans are, believe them. Maxine Waters, she keeps saying, \"impeach 45, impeach 45\", \"reclaiming my time.\" And, by the way, her fellow Democrats keep saying, Maxine, just don't tell them. We'll do it but just don't tell them, keep quiet. Keep it a secret.  Remember this.",

They want unless investigation into a farce, but they don't want to investigate Hillary, the one that paid for phony Russian lies that led to, oh, lying to FISA court judges and committing obviously a fraud on the court. Oh, then leaking that information so they can get a special counsel.  They don't care about that. They only care about, oh, if it's involved President Trump. They want to impeach, investigate the president. And if you want to vote for Democrats tomorrow, you're voting to raise your taxes. Remember, Nancy Pelosi, largest tax cut in American history, literally 90 percent of working Americans benefit and you saw what they were willing to do to Justice Kavanaugh.  You want higher taxes? You want the lies said about a man that was literally smeared and slandered and besmirched with no due process, no presumption of innocence, they will block all judicial appointments. By the way, remember the great promise, keep your doctor, keep your plan, and pay less? What a lie. It's the biggest lie ever told by any one party. And now, they are literally trying to campaign on that lie. Oh, they want to preserve Obamacare forever. That's what's at stake tomorrow. They want to bring back the mandate tax that President Trump and the Republicans killed.   They couldn't care less if your premiums continue to skyrocket. For them, it's about power. Look at the issue of immigration. They are told by the Center for American Progress, don't talk about it. Oh, change the topic.  But we know what they want -- open borders, sanctuary cities, sanctuary state, to abolish ICE.  And once again, they are hiding their agenda from the American people.  Center for American Progress, the think tank of John Podesta, oh, just change the topic as quickly as you possibly can. And, by the way, Democrats, they are literally listening because their radical positions are so unpopular, they can't even run on what they truly believe. That's the modern Democratic Party. This is your choice tonight. Is this what you want? Because that's the agenda of Nancy Pelosi. That's the agenda of Chuck Schumer. You vote for any House Democrat, you are voting for Pelosi. You bought for any Senate Democrat, you are voting for Chuck Schumer. Everything at this hour tonight is up for grabs. But the good news is, you have the power. Tonight, we are working on three different scenarios, just so you know.   Scenario one: Republicans maintain the majority in the House, gained seats in the Senate, and guess what? That is a huge win. Republicans, option number two: it's a split decision. That would be Republicans losing the House, gaining seats in the Senate. Worst-case scenario, which, you know, we'll let the fake news guys over their talk about, would be Republicans losing the House and Senate. That would mean Wednesday morning, you hear a Speaker-elect Pelosi, Senate Majority-elect Chuck Schumer. In the House, there is literally about 36 toss ups that will decide whether or not Nancy Pelosi gets that gavel back. Now, these are incredibly close, important races. Look at them on your screen. We also have on hannity.com, literally states like California, Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, everywhere in between, all 435 seats matter.   Historically, a sitting president almost always sees losses in the House.  Look at this number.  In 2010, the first midterm of Barack Hussein Obama, Democrats lost 63 seats. Oh, but he was elected two years later. 1994, Bill Clinton, Democrats lost 54 seats, and for the first time in 40 years, leading the way by Newt Gingrich, Republicans took back the House of Representatives.  Both of them, Obama and Clinton, two years after those disasters midterms, went on to win reelection, two years later. Over in the Senate, we are watching a handful of very close races that will determine whether or not Chuck Schumer becomes the majority leader. Right now, where we are tonight in Missouri, we are right now, Republican Josh Hawley, who will join us, is polling well. He's up against liberal radical leftist incumbent Claire McCaskill, far left senator who is trying to convince the good people of Missouri that she is a moderate. We know that's not true.  Don't forget, she voted against Kavanaugh, she voted against Neil Gorsuch, she voted against the tax cuts for the people of Missouri. Her campaign caught on tape literally supporting widespread gun restrictions and gun bans. But she's not telling the people of Missouri that. Arizona, I can't even believe we are talking about this race. Republican, American hero Martha McSally, multiple tours of duty, six in Iraq and Afghanistan, 28 years of service.  While McSally was serving her country abroad, her opponent, radical leftist Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema organizing events with a radical since indicted lawyer for the blind sheikh leading antiwar protests in a pink tutu with a group of witches -- I'm not making that up. She was making the case for, oh, it's OK if Americans want to fight with Taliban. And asked this weekend, she stood by that stupidity. Those are our enemies.  She called Arizonans crazy, the meth lab of democracy. But they are only crazy in a Lindsay Lohan way.  We go to the state of Indiana, a tossup tonight between Mike Braun and Democratic incumbent. Well, for Schumer wannabe disciple Joe Donnelly.  According to reports, not only has funded shadow efforts to find ads for the third-party libertarian in that race, he can't win without the libertarian in that race, dirty politics at its worst. And one more reminder, by the way, that a vote for a libertarian in Indiana is a vote for Donnelly and Schumer. In Montana, this is a state that is now in play. Republican Matt Rosendale gaining ground against Schumer Democratic incumbent Jon Tester. In the latest poll, Tester down by three. Fifty percent of the state voted, it will all depend on turnout tomorrow. Remember, people of Montana, Tester voted with Schumer 87 percent of the time. You might as well have Schumer.  In Tennessee, a very important race. Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn should win. If you are in Tennessee tonight, take nothing for granted, anything can happen. Nevada, races are always close. Republican Senator Dean Heller in a most- hold seat for the Republicans. Now, we're going to have an actual race in our hands in West Virginia. That's news tonight, between incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin, Republican Patrick Morrisey. And in Florida, let me just be blunt -- everything in Florida is as usual, too close to call. Democratic do-nothing Schumer Democrat Bill Nelson against the Florida Governor Rick Scott who has been there again and again for the people of Florida. In Florida, the gubernatorial race also so tight between Ron DeSantis and corrupt socialist -- by the way , wouldn't it be great if we could ay get from an FBI, you know, investigator, free tickets to \"Hamilton,\" and free vacations like Gillum, the worst crime rate in all of Florida. Republicans -- by the way, you guys like Elton John?   Just checking. We need a massive turnout. It's all about turnout tomorrow. That's all it is. You get -- we'll get to the government we deserve. We are keeping our eyes also on a potential shocker, of all places, in New Jersey. Polls between corruption-plagued Democrat Bob Menendez, Republican Bob Hugin. Marine, Semper Fi Bob. Guess what? Closer than anybody predicted.  And in the great state of Texas, Ted Cruz has and has maintained a steady lead against Bozo O'Rourke, even though this Democrat has literally almost gotten $100 million to throw at the greatest constitutionalist in the U.S. Senate. Texas, don't let somebody that doesn't have Texas values win Texas. Ted Cruz needs to be back in the U.S. Senate. Tomorrow's vote will be crucial. Democrats across the country benefited -- I'm looking right over there, all over there -- fake news by the mainstream media, the biggest donor to the Democratic Party, they speak with one voice at this point, and say the most hateful, disgusting, despicable, anti-Trump vitriol that this country, frankly, has ever seen. They have been worse than ever. And we've got the tape to prove it. Take a look.",

And liberals and the Democrats, you know, they were discouraged. And there was asymmetry between the parties and coalitions on their enthusiasm. What happened after the Kavanaugh hearing and because of the president's relentless campaigning is our sides enthusiasm now equates to their side's enthusiasm. You know hash tag resistance is passionate. They hate this president and they want to do everything they can to search and destroy anybody who supports him.

Virtually all of the political pundits and analysts, so-called journalists, pollsters, they predicted a huge win for Hillary and they were all dead wrong. Americans, the voters, you shocked the world and ever since -- well, the Trump agenda has been paying massive dividends in just two short years.  The economy is booming, 4.5 million new jobs, 4.3 million fewer Americans on food stamps. Four million Americans lifted out of poverty. On the manufacturing plant, Obama said these jobs -- they're never coming back -- 400,000 new jobs. Unemployment claims are at a 49-year low. In just two years, we are seeing record low unemployment for African- Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans, historic unemployment for women in the workplace. These are all records. And for military veterans and for youth unemployment; median household income is now hitting record highs, 4.2 percent GDP growth in the second quarter, 3.5 percent in the most recent quarter. And this all comes as President Trump slashed regulations, promises made, promises kept. It comes after he signed of the single biggest middle-class tax cut in American history. A promise made, a promise kept. He opened up American energy. Now, literally, we are in a path towards energy independence, green lighting the drilling at Anwar, the Dakota access pipeline, the Keystone pipeline, a promise made, a promise kept.  Negotiating new trade deals in Europe, renegotiating NAFTA. Pulled us out of the job killing Paris Accord. Promises made, promises kept. In two short years, he's led with peace through strength abroad. He has pulled us out of the one-sided ridiculous insanity of the nuclear deal. We are no longer dropping cargo planes of cash on a tarmac for radical mullahs chant \"Death to America.\" Addressing the looming crisis in North Korea, keeping their promise has so many other presidents made, he's the only one to keep this promise of moving the embassy in Jerusalem -- in Israel to Jerusalem. Promises made, promises kept. And despite being out of the office for two years -- this is the joke of all jokes -- watching Obama this weekend, Obama had the worst record of any president in modern history, which I will point out, he's now trying to take credit for Trump's success. Watch this."

Get this -- he was the only president in the U.S. history never to experience 3 percent GDP growth in a single year of his presidency. Oh, and the guy that claimed $9 trillion in debt, oh, that's irresponsible, and unpatriotic. In eight years of Obama, he took on more debt than every other president before him combined.

Maxine Waters, she keeps saying, \"impeach 45, impeach 45\", \"reclaiming my time.\" And, by the way, her fellow Democrats keep saying, Maxine, just don't tell them.

The question, though, I don't know whether Mueller has been able to answer, because I don't know whether he has been a given license to look into it, is where the restaurants laundering money to the Trump organization. And that will be a very high priority to get an answer to, for the reason that if they were doing this, it's not only a crime, but it's something provable, something that the Russians could hold over the head of the president of United States."

Oh, then leaking that information so they can get a special counsel. They don't care about that. They only care about, oh, if it's involved President Trump. They want to impeach, investigate the president. And if you want to vote for Democrats tomorrow, you're voting to raise your taxes. Remember, Nancy Pelosi, largest tax cut in American history, literally 90 percent of working Americans benefit and you saw what they were willing to do to Justice Kavanaugh. You want higher taxes? You want the lies said about a man that was literally smeared and slandered and besmirched with no due process, no presumption of innocence, they will block all judicial appointments. By the way, remember the great promise, keep your doctor, keep your plan, and pay less? What a lie. It's the biggest lie ever told by any one party. And now, they are literally trying to campaign on that lie. Oh, they want to preserve Obamacare forever. That's what's at stake tomorrow. They want to bring back the mandate tax that President Trump and the Republicans killed. They couldn't care less if your premiums continue to skyrocket. For them, it's about power. Look at the issue of immigration. They are told by the Center for American Progress, don't talk about it. Oh, change the topic.  But we know what they want -- open borders, sanctuary cities, sanctuary state, to abolish ICE. And once again, they are hiding their agenda from the American people.  Center for American Progress, the think tank of John Podesta, oh, just change the topic as quickly as you possibly can. And, by the way, Democrats, they are literally listening because their radical positions are so unpopular, they can't even run on what they truly believe. That's the modern Democratic Party. This is your choice tonight. Is this what you want? Because that's the agenda of Nancy Pelosi. That's the agenda of Chuck Schumer. You vote for any House Democrat, you are voting for Pelosi. You bought for any Senate Democrat, you are voting for Chuck Schumer. Everything at this hour tonight is up for grabs. But the good news is, you have the power. Tonight, we are working on three different scenarios, just so you know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Scenario one",
      "utterance": "Republicans maintain the majority in the House, gained seats in the Senate, and guess what? That is a huge win. Republicans, option number two: it's a split decision. That would be Republicans losing the House, gaining seats in the Senate. Worst-case scenario, which, you know, we'll let the fake news guys over their talk about, would be Republicans losing the House and Senate. That would mean Wednesday morning, you hear a Speaker-elect Pelosi, Senate Majority-elect Chuck Schumer. In the House, there is literally about 36 toss ups that will decide whether or not Nancy Pelosi gets that gavel back. Now, these are incredibly close, important races. Look at them on your screen. We also have on hannity.com, literally states like California, Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, everywhere in between, all 435 seats matter. Historically, a sitting president almost always sees losses in the House.  Look at this number. In 2010, the first midterm of Barack Hussein Obama, Democrats lost 63 seats. Oh, but he was elected two years later. 1994, Bill Clinton, Democrats lost 54 seats, and for the first time in 40 years, leading the way by Newt Gingrich, Republicans took back the House of Representatives.  Both of them, Obama and Clinton, two years after those disasters midterms, went on to win reelection, two years later. Over in the Senate, we are watching a handful of very close races that will determine whether or not Chuck Schumer becomes the majority leader. Right now, where we are tonight in Missouri, we are right now, Republican Josh Hawley, who will join us, is polling well. He's up against liberal radical leftist incumbent Claire McCaskill, far left senator who is trying to convince the good people of Missouri that she is a moderate. We know that's not true. Don't forget, she voted against Kavanaugh, she voted against Neil Gorsuch, she voted against the tax cuts for the people of Missouri. Her campaign caught on tape literally supporting widespread gun restrictions and gun bans. But she's not telling the people of Missouri that. Arizona, I can't even believe we are talking about this race. Republican, American hero Martha McSally, multiple tours of duty, six in Iraq and Afghanistan, 28 years of service. While McSally was serving her country abroad, her opponent, radical leftist Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema organizing events with a radical since indicted lawyer for the blind sheikh leading antiwar protests in a pink tutu with a group of witches -- I'm not making that up. She was making the case for, oh, it's OK if Americans want to fight with Taliban. And asked this weekend, she stood by that stupidity. Those are our enemies. She called Arizonans crazy, the meth lab of democracy. But they are only crazy in a Lindsay Lohan way. We go to the state of Indiana, a tossup tonight between Mike Braun and Democratic incumbent. Well, for Schumer wannabe disciple Joe Donnelly.  According to reports, not only has funded shadow efforts to find ads for the third-party libertarian in that race, he can't win without the libertarian in that race, dirty politics at its worst. And one more reminder, by the way, that a vote for a libertarian in Indiana is a vote for Donnelly and Schumer. In Montana, this is a state that is now in play. Republican Matt Rosendale gaining ground against Schumer Democratic incumbent Jon Tester. In the latest poll, Tester down by three. Fifty percent of the state voted, it will all depend on turnout tomorrow. Remember, people of Montana, Tester voted with Schumer 87 percent of the time. You might as well have Schumer. In Tennessee, a very important race. Republican Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn should win. If you are in Tennessee tonight, take nothing for granted, anything can happen. Nevada, races are always close. Republican Senator Dean Heller in a most- hold seat for the Republicans. Now, we're going to have an actual race in our hands in West Virginia. That's news tonight, between incumbent Democrat Joe Manchin, Republican Patrick Morrisey. And in Florida, let me just be blunt -- everything in Florida is as usual, too close to call. Democratic do-nothing Schumer Democrat Bill Nelson against the Florida Governor Rick Scott who has been there again and again for the people of Florida. In Florida, the gubernatorial race also so tight between Ron DeSantis and corrupt socialist -- by the way , wouldn't it be great if we could ay get from an FBI, you know, investigator, free tickets to \"Hamilton,\" and free vacations like Gillum, the worst crime rate in all of Florida. Republicans -- by the way, you guys like Elton John? Just checking. We need a massive turnout. It's all about turnout tomorrow. That's all it is. You get -- we'll get to the government we deserve. We are keeping our eyes also on a potential shocker, of all places, in New Jersey. Polls between corruption-plagued Democrat Bob Menendez, Republican Bob Hugin. Marine, Semper Fi Bob. Guess what? Closer than anybody predicted. And in the great state of Texas, Ted Cruz has and has maintained a steady lead against Bozo O'Rourke, even though this Democrat has literally almost gotten $100 million to throw at the greatest constitutionalist in the U.S. Senate. Texas, don't let somebody that doesn't have Texas values win Texas. Ted Cruz needs to be back in the U.S. Senate. Tomorrow's vote will be crucial. Democrats across the country benefited -- I'm looking right over there, all over there -- fake news by the mainstream media, the biggest donor to the Democratic Party, they speak with one voice at this point, and say the most hateful, disgusting, despicable, anti-Trump vitriol that this country, frankly, has ever seen. They have been worse than ever. And we've got the tape to prove it. Take a look."

Or do you support those on the left, do nothing but smear, slander, besmirch, name call, plot political revenge, obstruct the president's agenda, they have no plan to make your life better. They attempt day after day, hour after hour, to divide this country anyway they can. Today on multiple campaign stops, President Trump highlighted what is a clear choice and contrast between the parties and division for this future and he made his final pitch, which he will be making right after this show tonight to voters. Let's take a look."

The Democrat agenda is a socialist nightmare for our country. The Republican agenda is the American Dream, and that's what we're doing.  We're bringing back the American Dream. They want to raise your taxes, the Democrats do, restore crippling regulation, shut down your new steel mills, take away your health care, and put illegal aliens before American citizens, that's what they want. Democrats are inviting caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to pour into our country, overwhelming your schools, your hospitals, and your communities. There's only one way to stop this Democrat-let assault on America's sovereignty. You have to vote Republican tomorrow. You have to. I am asking every citizen from every party, every background, and every race, color, and created, to reject the Democrat politics of anger and division, and to unite behind our proud and righteous destiny as Americans altogether."

He's doing the same to keep a Republican majority, the same people that brought him to the White House he wants to make sure return to Congress. So, he's out there flipping these states red. I think Josh Hawley is going to do it, and I think that we are going to have Mike Braun from Indiana, Patrick Morrissey from West Virginia. Look, everybody has left evrything on the field. The president is doing everything he can. The reason we're competitive in the Senate, normally a president out of power loses up to five seats. The reason there is no blue wave in the Senate states, then the Senate, is because this president has gotten involved and left it on the field. The RNC has left it on the field, America first has left it on the field. We have made this competitive because this president is engaging like never before.

I remember the one in 1994, it's one of the reasons I'm in Washington, D.C., but that was when Republican enthusiasm was very, very high. And liberals and the Democrats, you know, they were discouraged. And there was asymmetry between the parties and coalitions on their enthusiasm. What happened after the Kavanaugh hearing and because of the president's relentless campaigning is our sides enthusiasm now equates to their side's enthusiasm. You know hash tag resistance is passionate. They hate this president and they want to do everything they can to search and destroy anybody who supports him. But what's happen in the meantime is the battles have been joined. For that reason, there cannot be any blue wave. I agree with Sean. We're actually going to have a historic night in the Senate, and I think because of what the president has done, you know, we are very competitive in the House. We can hold on to this majority in the House. I think it's a coin flip. And it will, if it comes out the one thing, Sean, does the Trump voter in 2016 vote tomorrow?"

Number one is, the Democrats have largely self- selected and live in big cities where they rack up winds of, you know, 90 to 10 percent.

So they're tired of it. But secondly, Rasmussen had a great article out today, Sean. And they said Republicans are far less likely to tell pollsters who they vote for by the marking of -- by margin of like 20 percentage points over Democrats. I think there is a big under vote, I think there is a damn good chance we hold the House."

You know, 2004 the exit polls, Sean Spicer, John Kerry was the president. Two years ago, when the exit polls came out at 5.15 Eastern Time, and looked at it, Donald Trump had lost Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin and he won them all.

If you look at the intensity of the president's rally, the number of people that are coming out, they are waiting in line for hours on end just to hear him speak. These are people that understand what's at stake, I think that intensity. The idea that people are getting on these calls that pollsters are making and standing on there for 25 or 30 minutes going through a litany of questions, they are not being represented in what you are seeing.

That fight the other side, that make it clear that the left isn't always on the side of these people who really want to pay their dues and simply want to live free and take care of their family.

We're making it very -- you know, the whole thing in terms of military, plus the back wall and plus the barbed wire, plus we have a lot of digging going on, a lot of trenching.

We have the worst laws anywhere in the country, catch and release, visa lottery, all of these laws here are disaster. We have the worse laws, we got to get them changed. The Democrats won't give us any votes. We need Democrat votes. You can't. We don't enough Republicans unless we elect a lot of Republicans tomorrow. But I will say that we are doing really well on illegal immigration, considering that we have the worst laws we have ever seen. We are moving thousands of MS-13 out of the country, they are being put into jails and they are being sent out of the country. And frankly, in a lot of ways I like out of the country put more because putting them into jail, let them solve it. But we've moved thousands of MS-13 gang members, we moved them out of the country."
