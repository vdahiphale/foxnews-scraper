He hasn't bothered attacking fellow Democrats yet, instead he's gunning for this guy named President Donald J. Trump.  The former VP has no shortage of fans though in the mainstream media. They are obsessed with his aggression, his opposed authenticity and his aviator glasses.",

He has been in politics for nearly 40 years and I honestly don't know what's at his core and in the end, Hillary Clinton made this mistake, because we saw that in those clips that you played.  As a Democrat, you can't just say, \"Donald Trump is a bad guy, I'm a good guy,\" or in Hillary's case, a good woman and if you vote for me, that's good enough. No, people want to know what you're going to do to improve their lives. What's his position in terms of improving healthcare, immigration, the opioid crisis? In terms of raising taxes -- will you raise taxes or not raise taxes? What's your position on infrastructure? And so on. So I want to hear those questions. I don't want to see what I saw today. I'm not surprised by it, and there are actually two Republicans that are on that panel and I get with Meghan McCain why she would want to endorse Biden considering her father's relationship with Mr. Biden, but at the same time, look, he is going to have to do some interviews with some tough people in some tough places if he expects to be President of the United States and answer the kind of questions that I would pose as I just laid out just now.",

I'm not sure what he's doing about two controversial things -- the Anita Hill situation, as well as the touchy feeling trend. He hasn't really apologized.

She was -- she thought, it was the last. She wasn't allowed to bring up people to verify her story. So just go out and explain what you were doing as Chairman with the Republican nominee and move on because nobody wants to re-litigate. We barely remember the story.

Before the 2016 election, 59 papers -- major ones -- offered their endorsements. Fifty seven went to Hillary Clinton, two went to Donald Trump. That got Hillary Clinton a concession speech, so that's all you need to know in terms of influence of our media today, at least on the political side. And look, the bottom line is that, as far as the media putting their finger on the button for Joe Biden, we saw it obviously with Hillary Clinton, it simply doesn't work as half the country does not trust the messenger.

I could only turn to one man who would answer the call on a Friday night, Chris Hahn.

I think a celery stalk with a good healthcare plan, it will be united around by Democrats if they're the nominee, if they think that person could win the presidency.

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, MEMBER OF EDITORIAL BOARD, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, there's a couple of problems here, Brian. Obviously, that's overwrought, utterly overwrought, and we just had a two-year probe that proved that Donald Trump is not compromised and at some point Democrats are going to need to accept the findings of that report on the collusion front in particular. But the other issue too is, look this is how we got here in the first place. Russia is certainly an adversary, someone that we need to be very concerned about and Putin and his authoritarian tendencies, but we have a lot of enemies in the world and to suggest that this is the only one and then also to suggest that anyone that attempts to forge a diplomatic compromise or treat with Putin in a way that tries to get him to behave more responsibly is somehow engaged in treasonous actions. Of course, our administration exists to interact even with rogue nations in an attempt to improve world order.",

It seems a lot of people were not warned about what was going on including state and local election officials, too. So a real failing of competence there in terms of dealing with this adversary that we have.  But also look, you've got to remember, Rosenstein, he's been subject to a lot of negative headlines. I've been critical of him especially when he was obstructing some of the House's efforts to get information on what the FBI and the DOJ did in 2016, but he's also been thrown under the bus by McCabe in particular and others and I think we're going to have a lot to hear from him going forward.

Pugh made at least $800,000.00 selling the self- published book. The City Council has unanimously demanded Pugh's resignation. Instead, she has taken a leave of absence and hasn't appeared in public since. On Thursday, FBI agents raided her house and seized several boxes of materials including many copies of \"Healthy Holly\" so it is going to be very hard to get by the way. Now, today, Pugh's attorney made this remarkable claim. He says her health is so bad, quote, \"She is not lucid enough to make a decision about resigning.\" He says Pugh has been suffering from pneumonia and bronchitis and then at the earliest, a decision about resigning will come early next week. We'll continue to follow this story through all its twists and turns and find out what the truth is.

We support the First Amendment and are happy to provide copies of the Constitution to anyone who hasn't read it.\" The post also led to a heated social media debate with some congratulating the Governor quote, \"Good for you, Governor.

A single mistake can cost hundreds of lives, right? Last year, on this program, Tucker revealed how the FAA has diluted its standards hiring less qualified candidates in an effort to promote diversity. They deemphasized job skills and instead rewarded applicants for irrelevant factors like how many sports they played in high school. In the wake of Tucker's reporting, by the way, the administration got rid of the worst abuses, but there still has not been a return to purely merit- based hiring. Finally, this year, bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Senator John Hoeven would fix the problem permanently and they did it.

Ironically, there are a lots of minorities on those lists because colleges quite frankly are very diverse, but behind the scenes, this was for diversity. Publicly, they came out and tried to say that the best qualified candidate was someone without experience. I akin to saying a doctor that the VA would hire, it's better to go get someone off the street and throw them through a VA medical training program versus going to our quality medical schools or quite frankly, the IRS hiring accounts without any accounting experience.

That's not even seen as an entertainment show, so I'll just leave that there and I watched this interview today and I didn't hear any questions in terms of who is Joe Biden? He has been in politics for nearly 40 years and I honestly don't know what's at his core and in the end, Hillary Clinton made this mistake, because we saw that in those clips that you played. As a Democrat, you can't just say, \"Donald Trump is a bad guy, I'm a good guy,\" or in Hillary's case, a good woman and if you vote for me, that's good enough. No, people want to know what you're going to do to improve their lives. What's his position in terms of improving healthcare, immigration, the opioid crisis? In terms of raising taxes -- will you raise taxes or not raise taxes? What's your position on infrastructure? And so on. So I want to hear those questions. I don't want to see what I saw today. I'm not surprised by it, and there are actually two Republicans that are on that panel and I get with Meghan McCain why she would want to endorse Biden considering her father's relationship with Mr. Biden, but at the same time, look, he is going to have to do some interviews with some tough people in some tough places if he expects to be President of the United States and answer the kind of questions that I would pose as I just laid out just now."

Totally understandable. But if Donald Trump teaches you anything, it's don't run from it, embrace it, explain it, but don't apologize for it. I'm not sure what he's doing about two controversial things -- the Anita Hill situation, as well as the touchy feeling trend. He hasn't really apologized. He addressed it and the other thing he did, he mocked right after he addressed it in his a poorly done Instagram video. So far in term of damage control, you can't give him an A."

And with Anita Hill, I mean doesn't anybody on \"The View\" or anybody else who interviews him going forward, didn't anybody find that completely disingenuous that only after he announced that he decides to apologize to Anita Hill? What was that? Nearly 30 years ago, he hasn't had the time since then or even what he was running for Vice President? So to do that now and say, \"Hey, I'm running for President. I think I feel bad about what I did.\" I'm sorry, that comes across as phoney and what we've learned, at least from Donald Trump winning, Brian is that people embrace authenticity -- good and bad or ugly, but be authentic. Don't be that guy."

She gave an interview to The New York Times\" where she said I don't -- I essentially don't accept his apology and he didn't really apologize. What are they upset about? He didn't vote for Clarence Thomas. What did he do? Evidently, he didn't tell the truth according to her about when she would get to testify. It was not going to be first. She was -- she thought, it was the last. She wasn't allowed to bring up people to verify her story. So just go out and explain what you were doing as Chairman with the Republican nominee and move on because nobody wants to re-litigate. We barely remember the story. I'm not saying it wasn't important, but if you're a politician and you have a staff and he's got money, he should be able to answer these questions. I mean, the other 19 contenders aren't seeing the undefeated heavyweight champ right now."

Look, for people that are worried that Joe Biden is going to get a free ride from the media, Brian, here's all you need to know. Before the 2016 election, 59 papers -- major ones -- offered their endorsements. Fifty seven went to Hillary Clinton, two went to Donald Trump. That got Hillary Clinton a concession speech, so that's all you need to know in terms of influence of our media today, at least on the political side. And look, the bottom line is that, as far as the media putting their finger on the button for Joe Biden, we saw it obviously with Hillary Clinton, it simply doesn't work as half the country does not trust the messenger. It's all white noise. The punditry and the predictions mean nothing to the American people. They'll decide what happens here from debates and a concise message which Biden needs to establish besides Trump is a bad guy."

He said, \"I didn't know what to do. To shake your hand, to give you a hug, to give you a kiss, because we're friends,\" but with Joe Biden to win in 2019, he can't be Joe Biden.

Elizabeth Warren says Biden sold out Americans and credit card companies -- I'll have to look that up -- and in an e-mail to supporters, Bernie Sanders blasted Biden for hosting his first fundraiser at the home of a top Comcast lobbyist, quote, saying this, \"It's a big day in the Democratic primary and we're hoping to end it strong, not with a fundraiser in the home of a corporate lobbyist, but with an overwhelming number of individual donations.\" So the question remains, is Biden liberal enough to lead the 2020 Democratic Party? I could only turn to one man who would answer the call on a Friday night, Chris Hahn. He is a former Chuck Schumer staffer and host of the \"Aggressive Progressive Podcast.\" He's a great talk-show host. We share the same lineup on WRC into Long Island. Chris, is he liberal enough?"

Look, at the end of the day, my friend, Democrats are going to unite around the person who they think can beat Donald Trump and I think the reason why he is leading in the polls right now is because they think he can beat Donald Trump. That's really the ultimate goal. I heard your previous guest talking about healthcare plans and everything else. I think a celery stalk with a good healthcare plan, it will be united around by Democrats if they're the nominee, if they think that person could win the presidency. That's the key for Democrats right now. Now, there'll be a lot of talk between now and then. There'll be a lot of fighting. There'll be a lot of backstabbing. There'll be a lot of mud throwing, politics aiming beanbag, Brian. You and I know this very well. But at the end of the day, Democrats are you going to unite behind whoever the nominee is and every single person running, all 20 or 30 or 90 that might decide to run this year are going to have to make that pledge at some point that they'll support the ultimate nominee."

So I, mean I could read you a list of things that they say matter to the American people and then as a matter to the Democrats, I'm not sure where Jill Biden stands and if it matters. That's what makes this period so interesting to have a Chris Hahn on. Another thing, here's what Bernie Sanders' former Press Secretary, Symone Sanders had to say back in November of 2016."

Politics is a competition of people who are in it want to win at the end of the day. Now what the positions are, you laid out some things that might change, that might move, that might move left, that might move right or might move center. But at the end of the day, it's the winning message and let me tell you something. The message that's going to win in 2020 might not even be around policy. I think everybody knows that Democrats are going to have a progressive healthcare plan that's going to cover more Americans than the Republicans. I think what they're going to want to know is who can lead this country in the right direction and who is going to bring sanity back to the Oval Office."

There's going to be two sides totally separate and we both know that. But first one person has to emerge from a group of 19 -- excuse me, a group of 20 that could grow even more.

KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, MEMBER OF EDITORIAL BOARD, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, there's a couple of problems here, Brian. Obviously, that's overwrought, utterly overwrought, and we just had a two-year probe that proved that Donald Trump is not compromised and at some point Democrats are going to need to accept the findings of that report on the collusion front in particular. But the other issue too is, look this is how we got here in the first place. Russia is certainly an adversary, someone that we need to be very concerned about and Putin and his authoritarian tendencies, but we have a lot of enemies in the world and to suggest that this is the only one and then also to suggest that anyone that attempts to forge a diplomatic compromise or treat with Putin in a way that tries to get him to behave more responsibly is somehow engaged in treasonous actions. Of course, our administration exists to interact even with rogue nations in an attempt to improve world order."

They wanted to see what he had to say. We haven't heard much from him. What about the fact that he took some shots to the Obama administration and James Comey for holding on to this information and letting it go right in the heat of 2016 about Russia's infiltration?"

You get finished with this entire Mueller report and you find out that Russia was seriously engaged in some very concerning ways in the election; luckily, in no way that affected our election results, but still alarming ways and who was in charge when that happened? The Obama administration and yet no one heard anything about it. We know that the Trump administration was not given a defensive briefing. It seems a lot of people were not warned about what was going on including state and local election officials, too. So a real failing of competence there in terms of dealing with this adversary that we have. But also look, you've got to remember, Rosenstein, he's been subject to a lot of negative headlines. I've been critical of him especially when he was obstructing some of the House's efforts to get information on what the FBI and the DOJ did in 2016, but he's also been thrown under the bus by McCabe in particular and others and I think we're going to have a lot to hear from him going forward.

I saw him at one event and he said to me, \"Hey, don't believe everything you read. We get along fine.\" And he traveled out to Long Island to do an opioid conference with the President and I saw him talking casually with the President. He also made it clear in that speech, \"I did not anybody I was going to turn over everything that we got in the Mueller probe.

Several companies admit they bought thousands of copies of Pugh's children's book series called \"Healthy Holly\" while competing for lucrative city contracts. Pugh made at least $800,000.00 selling the self- published book. The City Council has unanimously demanded Pugh's resignation. Instead, she has taken a leave of absence and hasn't appeared in public since. On Thursday, FBI agents raided her house and seized several boxes of materials including many copies of \"Healthy Holly\" so it is going to be very hard to get by the way. Now, today, Pugh's attorney made this remarkable claim. He says her health is so bad, quote, \"She is not lucid enough to make a decision about resigning.\" He says Pugh has been suffering from pneumonia and bronchitis and then at the earliest, a decision about resigning will come early next week. We'll continue to follow this story through all its twists and turns and find out what the truth is. Meanwhile, the crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is getting worse by the day, but Beto O'Rourke's solution is to have I.C.E. make fewer deportations. That's right. And then on the way out, can you have them take up the fence in El Paso? We're going to take a wide shot. The music will come up and we need another break."

On Thursday, at least 1,300 migrants escaped a detention center -- they are mostly Cubans -- that was in southern Mexico, 700 have been detained once again, but 600 are loose. Meanwhile, in Tennessee, an illegal immigrant who has already been deported five times now stands accused of murdering a four-month-old infant. But in the Democratic Party, in some cases, the only immigration problem we have is the border still exists at all. Take for example presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke. He not only stands on counters on every good diner, but if he is elected, he has got an idea. He is going to cut back on the number of illegal immigrant deportations."

ETHAN BEARMAN, HOST, \"LEFT COAST NEWS PODCAST\": I actually like what Congressman O'Rourke had to say and it's correct. We need to focus on violent criminals, gangs, the type of people that you just put up on the screen, but we don't need to be intercepting dads dropping their kids at school who have been here for 20 years and their kids are U.S. citizens to break up those families and stopping people randomly on the street to inquire about their immigration status.

The way to do that is to change the laws. We could do it in a half hour and Jay Johnson sat on the \"Fox and Friends\" couch and said as much, the Flores rule -- the amendment -- would have hampered him.

Asylum is when you are fleeing a government that is persecuting you because of your membership in a particular social group. The international definition of asylum does not include the fact that you are poor or that you are fleeing criminals in your own country. That is not a basis for asylum. And what's happened Brian is, you know, 10 years ago, people would sneak into our country in the cover of night in small groups. Now, they come in in groups of 200 or 300 and walk straight up to the Border Patrol and then tell the Border Patrol, \"Here I am, please take me to your station. I'd like to make a claim of asylum.\" A bogus claim. But here's the thing. Right now, they're so overwhelmed with bogus asylum claims and the vast majority are being denied when they get heard. It takes six years for that claim to be heard, so the illegal alien has given a work visa for six years. They're getting food stamps and everybody knows that you can abuse the system now.

If you have that system then our own welfare state collapses. I agree with Cher on this point. She said we have so many people in our own country who are needy and who need our help, we can't just have an open border at this point in time. And you know, I talked to one Border Patrol agent a couple of weeks ago. She told me that the word among the Border Patrol is we are now Uber drivers for illegal aliens.

We support the First Amendment and are happy to provide copies of the Constitution to anyone who hasn't read it.\" The post also led to a heated social media debate with some congratulating the Governor quote, \"Good for you, Governor.

A single mistake can cost hundreds of lives, right? Last year, on this program, Tucker revealed how the FAA has diluted its standards hiring less qualified candidates in an effort to promote diversity. They deemphasized job skills and instead rewarded applicants for irrelevant factors like how many sports they played in high school. In the wake of Tucker's reporting, by the way, the administration got rid of the worst abuses, but there still has not been a return to purely merit- based hiring.

So fortunately, Congress is stepping in with this bill and also the one that's been proposed by us. Senator Mike Lee to do to do the same thing.

Ironically, there are a lots of minorities on those lists because colleges quite frankly are very diverse, but behind the scenes, this was for diversity. Publicly, they came out and tried to say that the best qualified candidate was someone without experience. I akin to saying a doctor that the VA would hire, it's better to go get someone off the street and throw them through a VA medical training program versus going to our quality medical schools or quite frankly, the IRS hiring accounts without any accounting experience.

But secondly, this probably explains poor decisions like this. Why Mayor de Blasio went up to New Hampshire for a presidential thing and had 14 people at an event. And they were all panelists. The rest were media at an event. He is not really getting a lot of crowds in this because of decisions like this."

Peter Strzok, the FBI agent of course responsible as the lead investigator for the Spygate drama in the Hillary Clinton case. These texts keep getting worse. We have texts from Catherine Herridge and Sara Carter and others who wrote pieces on this showing them what appears to be coordinating getting a mole inside of the White House. Now, Brian, listen, these are the top spy catchers in our government. I love the FBI. Don't get me wrong. I have worked with the rank-and-file agents. They are the best. But these people at the top, this is like the greatest spy story ever told, except it is full of idiots. I keep telling people, it is not a James Bond story. It is like a Bond James story. There is no Jack Ryan in this, but there is a lot of Ryan Jacks. I cannot believe they were texting each other back and forth exposing their whole plot. What were you guys thinking?"

You know when you went to Lollapalooza, the music festival, everybody was so good. You missed all the bands because they all just blended in, they were so awesome. This is the exact opposite. It was a scandalpalooza. They had so many scandals in the Obama administration that Biden apparently is forgetting about all of them and they are legit."
