But the part of the story where anyone wearing a hat like this, that says \"Make America great\" on it is potentially committing a racist offense.

He holds U.S., Canadian, British, and Irish citizenship. And some Russian authorities believe he's been spying on Moscow for 10 years. Whelan's family calls the claim preposterous.

My other argument is there's an old rule of thumb that trial lawyers follow. If there is damaging information about your client, better it comes out of your mouth and out of the government's mouth.

The teachers and the parents feared for the safety after students were branded racists in a story that let's say on the theme got out over its skis a bit, and is now kind of retracting into a shell of embarrassment in an apparent attempt by some to just disappear. But the part of the story where anyone wearing a hat like this, that says \"Make America great\" on it is potentially committing a racist offense. Sticks around tonight and it attaches itself to the narrative that often gets played out against the President Trump."

But first, joining me here in the studio, Dan Henninger, Wall Street Journal deputy editorial page editor, and Fox News contributor.

So, as I said, Juan, and I saw you kind of shake your head a little bit, you know, people definitely got out over their skis on this story. Would you agree with that?"

I mean, but to me, the real story here and there's lots of different angles depending on the visions or perspectives you have is that you saw today, Twitter suspend this 2020 fight feed web site that had been feeding. This when they discovered it wasn't a teacher in California with somebody in Brazil. And these people have been trying to divide us, Martha, quite intentionally. And the mainstream media and others have picked it up because now, kind of both the extremes, far left and far right had their own narratives and seek to somehow take advantage of this. In addition, we just saw additional video come forward of some young woman who ran into this school group and said they were shouting offensive things to them before the encounter with the Native American."

Is this issue -- I've just like -- you know, everyone -- just do everyone knows what's in everybody's heart apparently? Everybody digs it, you know, these boys are bigots, their parents are -- you know, horrible people for raising such bad children. Know all cost support, everybody just already knows what their intentions are."

But it's intriguing here, you have just said, some of them think they are bigots, Juan was saying, the remarks and the behavior were offensive. The one word neither of you have used that we have heard several times here in the opening was \"racist\". Is the president in United States as Bernie Sanders says a racist? And I think racism is one of the most serious charges you can make against somebody. The idea that some class or group of people are somehow genetically inferior and ought to be repressed. That is the understanding of racism. And the left has now begun used this word over and over again, I think is a kind of form of moral imperialism to drive their opponents out of political debate, and simply silence them. So, the idea that America -- Make America Great hat, again is racist is simply a corruption of language."

But you go through the actions of the -- of the presidency, the policies of the presidency, are they racist? I mean, is there -- is the argument that's being made by these Democratic candidates that there's this blanket racism charge that applies to this presidency is tougher I think when you dig into his actions?"

When you look at the biggest civil rights issue on the map today, Black Lives Matter, the police relationship with communities. Here's Justice Department, pulling back from consent decrees. You look at education. Again, opposition to minority, affirmative action. Saying, \"Oh Asians are discriminated against, or whites are discriminated against.\" What we see here consistently with the calling the NFL players who are out against police brutality. SOBs that should be fired. Maxine Waters, a low intelligence person. That kind of rhetoric, you know, even Republicans, let me just say. Republicans, 22 percent of Republicans in the poll I cited say, Trump has emboldened racist in our society."

I like Juan Williams, but he used, to just use the phrase war on civil rights. That is incredibly charged language. Particularly if you're a person of color. And you hear that a party has a war on civil rights. You mentioned Tim Scott and his reference to unemployment and underemployment being down. He's also the author of something called Opportunity Zones. It was Republicans who passed criminal justice reform, Republican House, Republican Senate, signed by a Republican. So, Tim is exactly right. We need to talk about policy. The rhetoric coming from some Republicans is indefensible, it is -- it should be categorically rejected. But when I look at the Republican Party, I see Tim Scott and I see, Elise Stefanik. I don't see Steve King."

And he essentially, you know, he was asked about Jeff Sessions and why he didn't come out and condemn him more forcefully over the issue of separation of family and all that. He said, \"Because I took the time to get to know him, and I don't believe that what is being said about him is accurate.\""

There were ministers of color, there were law enforcement officers of color. And Tim was not going to support him until he knew and his well of souls that this is somebody who understands the plight, or at least, makes the effort to understand the plight of black and brown people. So, that is not rhetoric from Tim Scott, he actually did it. I was at the table that this is what Republicans I think need to come to grips with. And this is advice that I got from a Democrat."

So, the policies, the Tim Scott's, the Elise Stefanik's, the new generation of Republicans, they are doing great but we have to be very mindful of the rhetoric that we use and the rhetoric that we condone on the Republican side, or we will continue to struggle in communities of color in this country, electorally."

They could have picked a lot of things that happened over this weekend including lots of examples of my fellow citizens being kind and generous and considerate to one another. That doesn't go viral. It doesn't make the news. I don't know either of the people in this video. I honestly, because I don't know them. I could care less what they think about almost any issue that impacts our country. So, at least, take the time to get to know someone before you assign motives or assign what is in their heart. I just think it's a sad reflection on where we are politically, and media-wise that something like this would dominate the news cycle and not examples of my fellow citizens being considerate and kind to one another because that far outpaces, anything like what was represented in that video."

Sources telling Fox News tonight that while the President is full speed ahead, drama over the shutdown and Nancy Pelosi's call to cancel the speech are leading to some alternative possible plans. The White House is working on a Plan B possibly outside Washington and other outlets are reporting that it could be similar to a political rally, an idea that we first floated here, actually, last week when we talked to Sean Spicer. So would that happen? Would that be a good idea? Joining me once again former Congressman Trey Gowdy. So first of all, you know can -- just in terms of the rules, can the President forge ahead? He can't just walk over there and walk in the door and start giving an address? Can he?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "No. I mean, the floor of the House belongs to the people's House. And right now for whatever reason, the voters decided to let Nancy Pelosi control that. He can go to the Senate. He can go to another venue in Washington. I talked to two of my friends before I came on air with you tonight. Both of whom are in leadership in the House on the Republican side. One thinks it will go forward next week and the other does not. He has not been officially uninvited but there are things that need to be done this week that have been canceled. So where it takes place, the venue and the time is less important to me than the message. It is a unique opportunity for the leader of the free world to communicate to all Americans at once about the state of our country. I hope that he will do it. I hope it won't be a rally. I hope he will gather lawmakers who are willing to come and do it in a setting as close to the to the floor of the House as he can -- as he can come."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

So I mean, a joint resolution of Congress needs 60 votes on the Senate side I believe to get together even if it's on the Senate side according to what Chad Pergram is telling us. I mean, it is possible, but as you say the invitation was not officially rescinded and maybe Nancy Pelosi will not choose to go that far down that road. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "He was not uninvited. She just asked him to postpone it. But look, Paul Ryan gave his farewell address at the Library of Congress. There are lots of beautiful historic venues in Washington that would be a great backdrop for the President of the United States to address the citizenry. And it ought to be done on the floor of the House. That's where it ought to be done. But if she doesn't want it done there, he ought to go forward, don't do a rally. This is for everyone including people that don't agree with you, including for Americans who will never vote for you. This is the leader of the free world, the leader of our country addressing the citizenry. I would encourage him not to do it in a rally."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, it'll be interesting to see the optics as we like to say of her sitting behind him at that speech whether or not Nancy Pelosi would show up to do that is all a question as you point out. It's just really important that he'd be able to address the United States in the way that he sees fit. I want to get your quick thoughts on this. Joe Neguse, representative Joe Neguse, Democrat from Colorado believes that Judge Kavanaugh when he was in his hearings committed perjury and as a new member of the House Judiciary Committee, he would like to open an investigation into that. Watch this."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So they're likely going to take that up. He did not -- he did not point out any particular instance of perjury which is obviously a serious claim but he didn't back it up with any specific whatsoever, Trey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "It's so reckless on so many levels. Number one, the House of Representatives doesn't decide if somebody commits perjury. You have to be indicted and then tried by a jury of your peers and found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. And even if someone did commit perjury somewhere in America, the House of Representatives can't do a doggone thing about it. So the recklessness of concluding that that someone committed perjury and then trying to convince your constituents that you can actually do something about it as a level of recklessness that even surprises me for the Democrats on Judiciary."

Whatever happened to saying with particularity this is what you said that was materially false and that we can prove it instead of just getting a cheap applause line from constituents back home.

The Russian government contends that Paul Whelan was caught red-handed with Russian state secrets that reportedly included a list of Russian Defense Department employees who work in espionage and have access to classified information. The allegation is that Whelan was trying to recruit Russian nationals to provide intelligence, though it is unclear what country Whelan is accused of spying for. He holds U.S., Canadian, British, and Irish citizenship. And some Russian authorities believe he's been spying on Moscow for 10 years. Whelan's family calls the claim preposterous. But Paul Whelan's Russian attorney says his client was given a flash drive containing Russian state secrets but the lawyer contends that Whelan never looked at the flash drive and assumed it contained random information Whelan had requested from a friend.

Remember, Whelan who works as a global security director for a Michigan Auto Parts Company was in Russia for a friend's wedding just before Christmas. The State Department says it's confident Whelan is not a spy and Whelan's family believes he may have been entrapped. The family is also worried about his ability to present his defense in English. Whelan made his first public court appearance today though he was held in a glass cage and did not speak to reporters. The judge ordered that he stayed behind bars until at least the end of February.

We're just watching people speak to him you know, through the crack in the door when he's probably as you say, trying to you know, get some clarification on what they're saying, what's going on. Talk to me about what the Russian attorneys, Zherebenkov said -- he said he can confirm that at the time of his detention Whelan had some documents containing state secrets but I cannot go into details and it was not clear whether how he received the documents or whether he was aware that they were on him, that he had them. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHELAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not surprising in a sense. We haven't had any official information from the Russian government about why Paul was arrested, how he was arrested, what he received as far as what they're alleging he did for spying. It's unfortunate really that we continue to hear just bits and pieces from either Paul's lawyer or from leaks to other Russian media about what apparently happened. I think it's clear to me now. Certainly, I guess it's been clear to many people for a while that whatever happened Paul has been used as a pawn -and this is entrapment. If it was indeed, if it was a real espionage case, I think we would have someone who was also under arrest and under similar charges for having transferred the information to Paul."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, that is an FSB tactic that has been written about and talked about in the past where they try to plant some evidence on you and as soon as that happened it appears other individuals rushed into the hotel room and they grabbed him. What are you hearing from Ambassador Huntsman or from the State Department? Initially, Secretary Pompeo's response is to whether or not Paul was a spy was somewhat ambiguous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHELAN",
      "utterance": "Right. And I think at this point it's probably the same statement, which is that, if the charges are unfounded, then they'll bring Paul home. And I think the frustration that we have now is that it's almost a month that Paul has been in detention and nobody seems to be able to get the information from the Russians about what happened and to show that the charges are unfounded. Unfortunately, I think that means that Paul is going to stay in detention for many months now while this fiasco of a legal process drags on. And the only thing that the family can rely on is that the U.S. embassy staff and the counselor staff from Canada and Ireland and U.K. are also at least able to get into to see Paul as long as the Russians continue to allow that."

      "utterance": "Big story developing here. The Supreme Court siding with President Trump's call to restrict transgender troops from serving in the military. It was a five-four decision, allows the ban to continue while a legal fight persists in the lower courts. The DOJ applauding the move, Democrats slamming this move and some service members aren't quite sure what to think. Here now to break it down, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst. This was something that General Mattis agreed with. He wanted to put a hold on admitting transgender military for essentially further evaluation I guess in terms of the impact on our armed forces."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDREW NAPOLITANO, JUDICIAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, the decision that is not on the merits, that is they didn't decide whether or not the president has the authority to do it, they just decided not to interfere with the president's management of the military while this case is challenged. It does not remove anybody that's transgendered and is already in the military, it just blocks new people who identify as being transgendered from entering the military. So, there will be, listen to this, there will be five trials throughout the United States, because there are all these different challenges. I also think the chief justice should consolidate them all at one time and at one place and before one judge. But during the pendency of the trial did the president violate their constitutional rights? He can enforce the ban, that's all that happened today."

A totally different topic, Rudy Giuliani has spent the last 48 hours basically correcting and, you know, changing out statements that he made about Michael Cohen and President Trump, and to what extent and for how long into the election period. They discussed the possibility of a Trump project in Moscow. Your thoughts on how he is handling this. How does this look and what does it reveal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "The initial appearance is that Rudy is a cheerleader for the president and is loose with the facts. But on closer examination it appears to me that Rudy Giuliani is the president's champion, not just as his lawyer but as a sort of P.R. person and is willing if he can to sacrifice his own image to lower the bar so that if the president is charged with a crime or an impeachable offense, it will be rejected by the public. My other argument is there's an old rule of thumb that trial lawyers follow. If there is damaging information about your client, better it comes out of your mouth and out of the government's mouth. So, Rudy has a good idea from all of his negotiations with Bob Mueller over whether or not the president is going to testify before a grand jury or sit down for an interview with Bob Mueller. Rudy has got a good idea of what Mueller and company have on or about the president. If he can slowly release that drip, drip, drip, as opposed to the government coming down like an anvil and a pond all at once, it will be more palatable to the public and less shocking when it comes out."

The fact is that Minister Bellamy when he created the Pledge of Allegiance, he meant to define true Americanism as someone that excluded being African-American, being Latino, or any person of color especially immigrants. Those were the people who were coming in early in the 20th century European, Eastern Europeans who were supposedly invading the country, so it's a historical fact that this Pledge of Allegiance, the original one that we have currently now excluded people including my own family coming here."

We believe in things like religious tolerance. Those are the things that are embodied in the Pledge of Allegiance and in all of the founding documents of our country. And those are things that have no respect whatsoever for race, creed, color of skin, or even where you came from. If you are here legally and you're abiding by the rules, abiding by the laws, then you are allowed to partake in the American dream and that's what we should be focused on. This idea of going back and ripping up the Pledge of Allegiance is so stupid, and this is always the problem in our country. Whenever we look backwards, we do stupid things. If we look forward and fix real things like the broken -- the broken border that invites young children to be dragged across a very dangerous trek only to die at the border, things like that -- why don't we focus on fixing things like that?

One nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice, for all, not for some people, for all people, and that includes all people who all immigrants, generations of immigrants who come here legally as so many have, Cesar.

We don't feel, people don't feel like the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States is respecting those rights that Charlie is talking about, people don't feel that the Pledge of Allegiance speaks to them because we are seeing African-Americans being stopped by police and being killed by police.
