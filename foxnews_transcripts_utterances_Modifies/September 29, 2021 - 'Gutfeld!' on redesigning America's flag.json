This guy has -- this guy has more brats than the cars for kids commercial.  He gives the ladies more hot flashes than menopause. Yes, like a Hershey bar left in a hot car. When Pete's -- when Pete's on T.V. the women just sit there and melt. Not just the women, Pete. And of course we have Kats. There she is.

Speaking of vomiting, you know, that's not the only thing making us sick tonight, The New York Times published a redesign of the American flag because, you know, the current one reeks of white privilege.  Look at this one. What the hell is this? I don't know whether to saluted or calibrate the color on my new flat screen. You know, if your child showed you that, you kicked the brat out of arts and crafts. If it were Pete's kid, he'd leave it by the roadside on a family vacation.  He's got plenty of spares. What does he care? Now look at this one. It's called lift every voice and sing. I call it open every mouth and puke. Do these people understand what a flag is? It's supposed to inspire patriotism, not an aneurism. Then there's this one. This one is giving me a migraine just looking at it. Now my eyes know how my ears feel when AOC speaks.  Just -- if you're going to give me a hangover, at least let me earn it by drinking. That is not a flag. It's the wallpaper in a $5.00 a night motel in New Jersey. Not that I would know. That was quite a weekend though. The pattern for a clown's pajamas. And speaking of clowns, and pajamas. So how's Joe doing? You know, according to an ABC News Poll, public approval of how he's handling key issues is eroding faster than Hunter septum. I care about his health. By the way, when this poll says key issues, they're talking about how long it takes Joe to find his keys every morning. But when it comes to polling, he's more underwater than a Ted Kennedy date. Oh, you feel bad about that? Well, don't kill anybody, then.  Oh, we offended somebody. You let a girl die. My apologies. But his numbers are like Joe's teeth in a glass next to his bed, floating at the bottom.   And he makes it worse by making crap up. That's positively hysterical. Colbert should hire him as a writer. Did you hear that the $3.5 trillion spending bill actually costs us nothing? Yes, tell us Joe.",

But by the time we steal that money, we'll have another trillion-dollar bill, which again, we'll pay for later by taxing the hell out of you. It never ends. It's lather, rinse and repeat. Or in Joe's case, lather, rinse and fall between the sink and toilet. It's not a budget, it's a pyramid scheme. One step from selling household cleaning supplies from your trunk. So we elected Biden instead we got Bernie Madoff. And apparently the spending bill includes free community college for illegal immigrants, which given the state of our education system should be considered cruel and inhuman punishment. By the time they graduate, they won't be qualified for anything. But they'll have learned 50 new pronouns for a bearded lady. I just say B.L. So what is Joe have to say for himself?",

Obviously, Jeff Bezos woke up one day, the richest man in the world and said, I really would like to help you turn your lights off. Obviously, they're collecting data and listening to your conversations. To me, it's so common sense. I'm like so paranoid about it that even I have a child, I won't even, the baby monitor, the new baby monitors or like they call the nest. It's super expensive. And it has Alexa. I don't know what Jeff wants to say to my baby in his crib but it's not going down. So, I have the old school Janky 90s one. That's like it's black and white. I'm like, that's good. If you're crying?

That's not the way we grew up. We thought we were safe. We probably weren't. Remember those rides in the family car in the backseat. No seatbelts. Seatbelts highly optional in the 1970s. Yes, you know, dad took a right you just slide over to the left. Take a left you slide back, it worked. It worked. We were less safe or less sensitive in the 70s. If you want to know about the sensitivity level of the 1970s look at the advertising. Look at the commercials. We had the Frito Bandito the most politically incorrect spokesman in the history of salted snacks. For those too young to remember, the Frito Bandito was a three-and-a-half- foot tall Mexican thief. He would come into town with guns blazing, steal your fritos. Eat them while you watch. Then he would lean against the tree pull his sombrero over his eyes and take a nap. They would never get away with that today. Can you imagine the guy suggesting that at the ad agency today? It'd be like OK, your concept, the Frito Bandito. Phil, you don't work here anymore. You got to go to HR right now. All the commercials were insensitive. You remember the detergent? How do you keep my husband shirts so clean? Ancient Chinese secret, gong. Really. Some of them were violent. Remember that a Hawaiian punch? Every commercial was the same. They'd be kids on the playground. I'm thirsty. I don't know where this Hawaiian would walk in and punch the kid directly in the face. And it wasn't a fun little tap. It was a full on; he would clock the kid was an unconscious child on the playground. Everyone celebrating: yay, Hawaiian punch. Timmy's in a coma. The jingles were politically incorrect. Remember that the hotdogs arm or hot dogs? What kind of kids eat arm or hotdogs? Fat kids? Yes, fat kids. Kids, they listed all the children of the world. Start with the fat kids. Was there a discussion about that? They actually start with the fat kids, definitely. That's our customer base. Secure the fatties, move on from there. Fat kids, skinny kids, kids who climb on the rocks. It's an extremely specific demographic there, right? Tough kids, sissy kid they said kids, and they showed a sissy kid. Holding a hot dog bawling his eyes, I don't want to be the sissy kid. Well, you're good at it cry baby. Even kids with? Chickenpox. Wow, that's appetizing. Even kids with chickenpox. Look, I did not go to copywriting school, but I'm pretty sure rule number one is don't associate your product with a communicable disease. You guys are great. Thank you so much.",

Speaking of vomiting, you know, that's not the only thing making us sick tonight, The New York Times published a redesign of the American flag because, you know, the current one reeks of white privilege. Look at this one. What the hell is this? I don't know whether to saluted or calibrate the color on my new flat screen. You know, if your child showed you that, you kicked the brat out of arts and crafts. If it were Pete's kid, he'd leave it by the roadside on a family vacation. He's got plenty of spares. What does he care? Now look at this one. It's called lift every voice and sing. I call it open every mouth and puke. Do these people understand what a flag is? It's supposed to inspire patriotism, not an aneurism. Then there's this one. This one is giving me a migraine just looking at it. Now my eyes know how my ears feel when AOC speaks. Just -- if you're going to give me a hangover, at least let me earn it by drinking. That is not a flag. It's the wallpaper in a $5.00 a night motel in New Jersey. Not that I would know. That was quite a weekend though. The pattern for a clown's pajamas. And speaking of clowns, and pajamas. So how's Joe doing? You know, according to an ABC News Poll, public approval of how he's handling key issues is eroding faster than Hunter septum. I care about his health. By the way, when this poll says key issues, they're talking about how long it takes Joe to find his keys every morning. But when it comes to polling, he's more underwater than a Ted Kennedy date. Oh, you feel bad about that? Well, don't kill anybody, then. Oh, we offended somebody. You let a girl die. My apologies. But his numbers are like Joe's teeth in a glass next to his bed, floating at the bottom. And he makes it worse by making crap up. That's positively hysterical. Colbert should hire him as a writer. Did you hear that the $3.5 trillion spending bill actually costs us nothing? Yes, tell us Joe."

But by the time we steal that money, we'll have another trillion-dollar bill, which again, we'll pay for later by taxing the hell out of you. It never ends. It's lather, rinse and repeat. Or in Joe's case, lather, rinse and fall between the sink and toilet. It's not a budget, it's a pyramid scheme. One step from selling household cleaning supplies from your trunk. So we elected Biden instead we got Bernie Madoff. And apparently the spending bill includes free community college for illegal immigrants, which given the state of our education system should be considered cruel and inhuman punishment. By the time they graduate, they won't be qualified for anything. But they'll have learned 50 new pronouns for a bearded lady. I just say B.L. So what is Joe have to say for himself?"

Oh, that's a terrible, terrible signal. Stanford and Cornell have also adopted similar housing programs. So leftists demand students be segregated just like the races that they once hated. So we figured why not resurrect other awful things from the past that we've long gotten rid of? For example, how about only men being allowed to vote? Well, come on. Frankly, everything went downhill when they change that. A sexist might say, how dare you applaud or laugh at that? What about leeches to treat disease, huh? I'm wearing a leech right now. It's why I never have to go to the bathroom. It does pinch. So why not throw suspected witches in the water to see if they float? It's really a win-win.

They will turn that on you so quick, and they'll use it all day long and they'll manipulate it to make sounds and do weird things. And then pretty soon what's useful to me? It can't even bring me a beer from the other. That's it -- I don't, that's why I have kids: bring me a beer from the other room."

And she's like, yes, I just got Alexa because it helps me turn the lights on. I'm like, are you so lazy that you actually don't understand. Obviously, Jeff Bezos woke up one day, the richest man in the world and said, I really would like to help you turn your lights off. Obviously, they're collecting data and listening to your conversations. To me, it's so common sense. I'm like so paranoid about it that even I have a child, I won't even, the baby monitor, the new baby monitors or like they call the nest. It's super expensive. And it has Alexa. I don't know what Jeff wants to say to my baby in his crib but it's not going down. So, I have the old school Janky 90s one. That's like it's black and white. I'm like, that's good. If you're crying? Absolutely not. Not in my household."

      "utterance": "Thank you. I love you guys. I love a big crowd with uncovered faces. Good to see you. We're in a moment of extreme caution in this country, aren't we? That's not the way we grew up. We thought we were safe. We probably weren't. Remember those rides in the family car in the backseat. No seatbelts. Seatbelts highly optional in the 1970s. Yes, you know, dad took a right you just slide over to the left. Take a left you slide back, it worked. It worked. We were less safe or less sensitive in the 70s. If you want to know about the sensitivity level of the 1970s look at the advertising. Look at the commercials. We had the Frito Bandito the most politically incorrect spokesman in the history of salted snacks. For those too young to remember, the Frito Bandito was a three-and-a-half- foot tall Mexican thief. He would come into town with guns blazing, steal your fritos. Eat them while you watch. Then he would lean against the tree pull his sombrero over his eyes and take a nap. They would never get away with that today. Can you imagine the guy suggesting that at the ad agency today? It'd be like OK, your concept, the Frito Bandito. Phil, you don't work here anymore. You got to go to HR right now. All the commercials were insensitive. You remember the detergent? How do you keep my husband shirts so clean? Ancient Chinese secret, gong. Really. Some of them were violent. Remember that a Hawaiian punch? Every commercial was the same. They'd be kids on the playground. I'm thirsty. I don't know where this Hawaiian would walk in and punch the kid directly in the face. And it wasn't a fun little tap. It was a full on; he would clock the kid was an unconscious child on the playground. Everyone celebrating: yay, Hawaiian punch. Timmy's in a coma. The jingles were politically incorrect. Remember that the hotdogs arm or hot dogs? What kind of kids eat arm or hotdogs? Fat kids? Yes, fat kids. Kids, they listed all the children of the world. Start with the fat kids. Was there a discussion about that? They actually start with the fat kids, definitely. That's our customer base. Secure the fatties, move on from there. Fat kids, skinny kids, kids who climb on the rocks. It's an extremely specific demographic there, right? Tough kids, sissy kid they said kids, and they showed a sissy kid. Holding a hot dog bawling his eyes, I don't want to be the sissy kid. Well, you're good at it cry baby. Even kids with? Chickenpox. Wow, that's appetizing. Even kids with chickenpox. Look, I did not go to copywriting school, but I'm pretty sure rule number one is don't associate your product with a communicable disease. You guys are great. Thank you so much."
