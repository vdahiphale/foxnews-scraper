And the people benefiting the most are middle-class families, who were struggling under eight years of a weak economy under Barack Obama. So President Trump said, we want to make sure we rebuild our middle class. And that's happening. And, frankly, the regulation relief that we have provided is one of the big things, in addition to the tax cuts, that's bring those good manufacturing jobs back to America.  Don't reverse that success. By the way, they also want to repeal ICE. They want to abolish the very agency that's protecting our country from criminals and human traffickers.   So we're going to remind people what's at stake in this election. By the way, we also want to make those tax cuts permanent. The temporary tax cuts, we're going to have a bill to let every Democrat who voted against cutting middle-class taxes, we're going to let them have a vote to actually make those successful tax cuts permanent.",

If you're a lot of industries in America and you try to go do business in Canada, there are huge barriers to getting your products in the Canadian markets.  They don't have those same impediments when they try to bring their products here. All we're asking is for countries to treat us fairly.

But to continue just going on and making blanket accusations with no fact behind it, I think people are starting to get fed up with that. We have seen some of the problems within the FBI and over at Justice. Let's go and get this agency cleaned up again.  America needs and deserves a Justice Department and an FBI that's working for them every day without a political bias. And if somebody over there -- and we have seen, unfortunately, a number of people over there that had political biases. They were literally trying to derail the presidency of Donald Trump. And whether the name is Donald Trump or Barack Obama, those agencies shouldn't be working to try to undermine our own government. And so we're going to continue rooting out those kind of bad apples.

And we found none. And so, if he's got some new evidence, he ought to be getting it out there. But to continue just going on and making blanket accusations with no fact behind it, I think people are starting to get fed up with that. We have seen some of the problems within the FBI and over at Justice. Let's go and get this agency cleaned up again. America needs and deserves a Justice Department and an FBI that's working for them every day without a political bias. And if somebody over there -- and we have seen, unfortunately, a number of people over there that had political biases. They were literally trying to derail the presidency of Donald Trump. And whether the name is Donald Trump or Barack Obama, those agencies shouldn't be working to try to undermine our own government. And so we're going to continue rooting out those kind of bad apples. I would hope the agency would work with us too, so that they could get rid of the bad actors and then focus on keeping this country safe."
