We also know that we have a president who does what he says that he will do. And he has said very clearly that whatever decision he makes in Syria, it will bear no resemblance to Afghanistan, Iraq, or even Libya.",

Let's bring in the panel now. We've Steve Hayes, senior writer for the Weekly Standard, Charles Lane, opinion writer for the Washington Post, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. We'll have more on the president's remarks a little bit later in the segment.  But, Steve, let's start with you. What do you make of it today?",

I guess what struck me in listening to him and thinking about the administration's case more broadly is the tension between the case that they're making, the urgency, and the strength of the case that they're making for intervention, and then what they've already announced that we're going to do. I mean, they're making this case that suggests we ought to be entering a real war, aimed at changing the regime and changing conditions on the ground, and yet they're talking about limited strikes, not targeting regime elements. There's, I think, some real tension between those two things. And Secretary Kerry also said that the world is watching to see how we respond to this use of chemical weapons. I think that's true, but it was also true that the world was watching when Assad used chemical weapons earlier, something that the White House briefers mentioned on a conference call today with reporters.   And it's certainly been the case that the world has been watching as we've been watching more than 100,000 people be killed on the streets of Syria. So I think the administration is going to have to do more to reconcile the strong case they're making for intervention and the announcements and I think likely attack that will be a slap on the wrist, or as Charles called it, a pin prick.",

This problem, though, how now distilled down to a very simple matter. The president said there was a red line. Assad crossed it. Whatever else, besides those two facts may be, it doesn't really matter. The president has to do something, maybe relatively minimal, as Steve says, to back up his red line and it's going to happen in one way or another.   And John Kerry is trying to lay the ground work for that, quite emotionally, with few facts to back it up, but let's face it, that's what this is all about.",

They ended up with two world wars as a result. The analogy today is Iran in the Middle East. It's a rising power. It's an aggressive one. It's a (INAUDIBLE). It wants a place in the sun, it's acquiring nukes, and it scares the hell out of the Arabs. It's a Persian country. And it now has a client in Syria.  The war is being driven by Iran. There's actual evidence that Iranian agents, Revolutionary Guard who were involved in the poisonous gas, Iran that controls Hezbollah, which spread terror in the Middle East and in the region, and Iran is the one driving the war. Iran is looking and it's also developing the nukes, of course.  The problem is that if you -- if you get into this war, even in a limited, I think, almost absurd way Obama is doing, he is giving them so much notice that even if we drop all the ammunition on the three or four ships, it wouldn't -- I mean, everything of importance has been moved. Iran is strengthened. And the question is it's going to look as if the U.S. -- U.K. has already walked away. Iran is in the driver's seat. And America is slinking away. And the problem is if you make a miscalculation here, and you let Iran imagine that it is in charge, it threatens to attack Israel, Syria or Hezbollah, Israel will respond fiercely and it could get out of control.  So it isn't as if Obama imagined. Although, you know, he says I'll do a narrow thing, I'll do a limited thing, it's not going to be boots on the ground, as if he is pleading with Assad, you know, don't take it seriously, it's just going to be a few bombs in the desert.   Well, if he miscalculates and the Iranians and Hezbollah reacts, we could have a regional war, a major regional war.",
