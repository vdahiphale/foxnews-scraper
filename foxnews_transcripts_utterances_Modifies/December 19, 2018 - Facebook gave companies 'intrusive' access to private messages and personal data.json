Mendacity, deceit, duplicitousness (ph), saying things that aren't true that here my arms is going up just telling you about this. But it happened. And we can prove it. Now, to be clear, news anchors didn't do it. News anchors don't lie. They're good people. Neither do professional cable news commentators, the one making millions on the side as lobbyists for foreign governments or big multinational corporations. Commentators always tell the truth. And that's why they, and their scrupulously honest news anchor friends are so utterly disgusted tonight, horrified really by what retired General Michael Flynn has done. Watch their stunned reactions.",

For his crime of lying, Michael Flynn, the liar, may soon be locked away in a cell. That would keep the rest of us safe from his perfidious lies. That day can't come fast enough say the news anchors. Cuff him. America longs to breathe free once more.  Michael Flynn will be 60 years old next week. The Washington Post calculates he faces five years in prison. And let that be a warning to all of us. That's what happens to people who lie in Washington. Or does it?   From a golf course somewhere in Dubai, you can almost hear Bill Clinton chuckling softly. Lied under oath, still making $300,000 a speech; not everyone faces the same penalties for lying it turns out. Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington last spring to talk about Facebook that's the sole destroying social media company that has made him a multibillionaire. While in town, Zuckerberg stopped by the Congress where - and you might want to ask the kids to leave the room for this - he lied. Yep. Don't tell Don Lemon. But Mark Zuckerberg is a liar.

      "speaker": "ZUCKERBERG",
      "sentences": "Senator, as somebody who uses Facebook, I believe that you should have complete control over your data.    The only problem, it was a lie. Sorry, kids. According to a piece in the New York Times, Facebook does not actually allow you or anyone else to control your data. Not at all. In fact, they secretly hand over your data, personal data, to other big tech companies. Now, that decision has made Mark Zuckerberg even richer, adding on to the house in Hawaii probably. Unfortunately, he's had to lie in the process, including to Congress, and that's a crime. As Robespierre once famously noted, \"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.\" In this case, the eggs are your privacy. Apparently, Facebook allowed Microsoft search engine, Bing, to see the names of your Facebook friends without telling you about it. Facebook also allowed Netflix and Spotify to read your private messages without telling you.  Now, there's no evidence so far as of tonight that Facebook has a video camera hidden in your shower, but close enough. That's what Mark Zuckerberg lied about. Not a small lie, really. What did Mike Flynn lie about? Well, according to the FBI, Flynn lied about conversations he had had with the Russian Ambassador Kislyak. You remember him. Flynn said that he and Kislyak had never talked about expelling Russian diplomats or about Russia voting in the U.N. on symbolic resolutions. And in fact, they had talked about both of those things. The feds already knew that because they were listening in, secretly.  There was nothing improper about the conversations that Flynn and Kislyak had. The crime was the lie. It's always the crime. Except when it's Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg can lie about something that affects hundreds of millions of Americans, but it's not really a big deal. Zuckerberg is not looking at five years in prison. Zuckerberg will not be sanctioned by Congress ever.  So what's the difference? Well, unlike Mike Flynn, Mark Zuckerberg is a hero to the American news media. He is who they want to be. He is richer than God. He went to Harvard. He wears T-shirts at work for real. He's for open borders. All the cool people like Mark Zuckerberg, even foreign countries. For example, when the fascist government of China was looking for new tools to oppress its own population, you think they went to Mike Flynn for help? Yes, OK. I don't think so. Flynn is tough on china, old fashioned as he is. But Mark Zuckerberg, by contrast, was happy to help.  As they say at McKenzie, Mark Zuckerberg gets it.   Boy, what has Mike Flynn ever done for anyone? 33 years in uniform? That's not very innovative. Two lies told by two high-profile Americans. One is going to prison in late middle age. The other will be available for like 40 years for commencement addresses and awards dinners held in his honor. That's the tale of Mike Flynn and Mark Zuckerberg. It tells you everything. Joining us now to break down what's happening to Mike Flynn is Harvard Law Professor Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz. He is the case of the book - the author, rather, of the book The Case Against Impeaching Trump. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So I read in The Washington Post this morning--",

I think you can make a very, very strong case that before you can be convicted of a crime for lying, you should have to raise your hand, put it on a Bible, look to your God or look to your ethics, have a solemn moment where you look the person in the face and swear to him that you are going to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

So I really do think that we have kind of three criteria. Just lying politically. It's done too often. I hate it. But it's done too often. It's not a crime. Second, lying only to government officials, which is a crime but probably shouldn't be a crime, or if it is, it should be a misdemeanor, not a serious felony akin to raising your right arm and swearing under oath that you will tell the truth.  There's too much lying in Washington and there are too many, as you point out correctly, double standards about who is prosecuted for lying. In civil cases, people lie in depositions all the time. And they're never prosecuted. I tried to bring a case recently against people who lied. Prosecutors laugh at you. Lying in a deposition? That's like gambling in Casablanca. It's just done all the time, and it's tragic that it's done. I testified in front of Congress about this. When they were going after Bill Clinton and trying to - and impeaching him for his lies. I had a whole session where I talked about how many lies are told in how many different places and how selective they are in going after people. That's one of the problems of not requiring an oath.

There's a long list of those. But it's hardly the only abuse. All the major tech platforms have colluded to silence opinions they don't like and to destroy the people who express those opinions. They've done this in the open. We've watched it happen. Google employees secretly, meanwhile, discussed hiding conservative websites and search results because they're just not legitimate. Facebook's founding president Sean Parker admitted that his company created an intentionally addictive product, like cigarettes, that could destroy children's brains, which is exactly, of course, what it's done.  It all adds up to a terrifying picture, a serious menace to this country, to a democracy, to our mental health - check the numbers on that sometime - to our cohesion as a nation. It's a real threat, obviously. And everybody knows it. How is Congress doing protecting us from any of these threats? Good question. They're not. And they're not even trying. And if you're wondering why they're not trying, the answer might be, in part anyway, the outgoing Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan didn't seem interested in reigning in the tech companies in any way, when he was the third most powerful man in America. In part, he was too busy preventing a wall from being built on our southern border to get to the tech question. But there might have been other reasons we're just speculating now. Now that he is leaving the Congress and moving to the private sector, will Paul Ryan be taking any money from any of the big tech firms like Facebook or Google or Twitter? Seemed like an interesting question. Obvious, but then no one has asked. So we called Paul Ryan's office today and we asked that question. We haven't got an answer yet. And it's 8:20 p.m. Eastern. We're going to keep checking and get back to you when they respond. So the leadership of the House, of course, is changing. Democrats are taking over. But the Republicans still hold the Senate. Is there any interest, will there be, in reigning in tech at all? Josh Hawley was just elected Senator. He's a Republican from Missouri, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Senator Elect, thanks very much for coming on. Now, I'm not going to force you to join me in pointing fingers as to why this hasn't been done up to this point.

      "sentences": "Insulin is one of the basic human hormones. Everyone needs insulin to live. Diabetics, though, can't properly produce insulin. And that's a big question in this country. In America right now, about 6 million people are dependent on daily injections of insulin just to survive. It's a great thing that they can do that. Almost a century ago, scientists discovered how to produce synthetic insulin. The scientists who did that sold the patents to a university for $1. Their goal was to help humanity. That's why they did that. It turned out to be one of the great health advances in human history. Diabetes went from almost a certain death sentence to a manageable illness, as it is today or was. Cheaply available insulin has extended the lives of tens of millions of people. But in this country, that seems to be changing. For the last 20 years or so, the price of insulin has been rising very quickly, even relative to other healthcare costs. When top insulin drug, NovoLog, rose in price 353 percent in just 14 years. It isn't exceptional, and the growth has shown no signs of stopping. Thanks to these price hikes, millions of diabetics have started rationing their insulin, gambling with their health and likely shortening their lives to save money. They have no choice. A cheap medicine that your parents took for granted increasingly is inaccessible to poor Americans though, already the group most likely to suffer from diabetes in the first place, as you probably know. Now, there are a lot of reasons this is happening. One is the drug companies keep slightly tweaking their formulas so their drugs never leave patent and generic competitors can't enter the market to compete with them. Another reason is rigid FDA regulations, which make it costly and time- consuming to put a new insulin drug in the market. Pharmaceutical companies use legal challenges to deter competition too. Of course, most companies do do that. And of course, greed plays a role, too. That's a word that we don't use very often, but it's still real. One of the deadly sins for good reason.  But whatever the reasons for the spike in prices of insulin, it's a huge problem. And you would think it's something that Congress and the administration would consider taking action on. There are some things they could do. Maybe they should streamline an FDA approval process or adjust patent law. Maybe they should subsidize the creation of a generic insulin brand. After all, we spend billions subsidizing solar panels and electric cars that only rich people can afford. So before you give us a lecture about the market, remind us we already do that, we're not sure what the best solution is, we're not scientists or economists. What we can say, this is a real problem that Congress appears to be ignoring. In October, the President pitched a plan to lower drug prices across the board by tying Medicare reimbursement to drug prices in other countries. Republicans in Congress and on K Street hate that idea. Pharma's bottom line is important to them and it's not an unimportant factor. On the other hand, Americans are dying from easily treated illnesses. That's a factor too. On the left, well, they don't care at all, at least not right now. Their top priority is impeaching Trump, not collaborating with Trump on healthcare. And just like on tech and other issues, they're easily distracted by superficial political signaling. Sanofi is one of the companies now driving up insulin prices, but that company won some degree of credibility from the left last summer and is now insulated from criticism. Why? Well, because when Roseanne Barr blamed Ambien for the ill-advised tweets that got her show cancelled, that company tweeted that racism is not a side effect of its medications. And the left roared with laughter. Go, big pharma. If only they'd roar about that company extorting poor Americans with life-saving drugs! But just like on immigration or trade or automation or global warming, it doesn't matter when America's most vulnerable are hurt. It's actual most vulnerable people no one in D.C. and particularly no one on the left seems to care. Not their constituency. So the debate over the wall on our southern border continues. Not a single person in Washington, D.C. is in favor of building a wall on our southern border. They are terrified, not because they think it won't work but because they believe that it might work and it might clamp down on a source, a ready source of cheap labor. And that's why they're willing to risk a government shutdown rather than give a mere $5 million to start the wall.  So what is going to happen? Is the wall over? Will the administration surrender on this? And what will the voters on either side think of the outcome?

And nowhere does the war on Christmas exist less than in China. And that's why the city officials of Langfang, China, have issued a total ban on the public celebration of Christmas. That means no Santa, no lights, and obviously no nativity scenes. The ban is part of a wider religious crackdown in China, which has seen churches shut down and believers thrown in prison, a story that hasn't gotten a ton of ink here among our elites who are getting rich in China. In Russia, by contrast, and even in Assad's Syria, millions of Christians will happily celebrate Christmas without any oppression. Just take a guess which countries are despised and which ones they suck up to? And maybe that's why they love China's government so much. Beijing does what Washington wishes it could do, with efficiency too. I want to bring you a major development tonight in America's involvement in Syria despite heavy pressure from Saudi Arabia and thousands of foreign policy experts.

If they say something naughty or threatening, no gun. Well, given that, we are fascinated to see the news yesterday.

They get richer and they can believe, and many do believe that they are morally superior to you. And that's why they destroy anyone who threatens the status quo. Mike Flynn, for example, is being destroyed. Mark Zuckerberg lied as well. He's being protected because he's on the side of the people who make those decisions. That's also why the establishment has become so obsessed with crushing free speech. It's getting harder and harder for them to win arguments on the merits. The best option then is to keep the arguments from being made at all. When you can tar your opponent as immoral, as a bigot, you don't have to defend you own position, you can just do what you want. You can also ruin the lives of anyone who gets in your way and feel good about it. How do we get to this place? So that entire story is in a new book called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution. Christmas is coming.

Mark Zuckerberg came to Washington last spring to talk about Facebook that's the sole destroying social media company that has made him a multibillionaire. While in town, Zuckerberg stopped by the Congress where - and you might want to ask the kids to leave the room for this - he lied. Yep. Don't tell Don Lemon. But Mark Zuckerberg is a liar. Watch him do it."

      "utterance": "Senator, as somebody who uses Facebook, I believe that you should have complete control over your data. The only problem, it was a lie. Sorry, kids. According to a piece in the New York Times, Facebook does not actually allow you or anyone else to control your data. Not at all. In fact, they secretly hand over your data, personal data, to other big tech companies. Now, that decision has made Mark Zuckerberg even richer, adding on to the house in Hawaii probably. Unfortunately, he's had to lie in the process, including to Congress, and that's a crime. As Robespierre once famously noted, \"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.\" In this case, the eggs are your privacy. Apparently, Facebook allowed Microsoft search engine, Bing, to see the names of your Facebook friends without telling you about it. Facebook also allowed Netflix and Spotify to read your private messages without telling you. Now, there's no evidence so far as of tonight that Facebook has a video camera hidden in your shower, but close enough. That's what Mark Zuckerberg lied about. Not a small lie, really. What did Mike Flynn lie about? Well, according to the FBI, Flynn lied about conversations he had had with the Russian Ambassador Kislyak. You remember him. Flynn said that he and Kislyak had never talked about expelling Russian diplomats or about Russia voting in the U.N. on symbolic resolutions. And in fact, they had talked about both of those things. The feds already knew that because they were listening in, secretly. There was nothing improper about the conversations that Flynn and Kislyak had. The crime was the lie. It's always the crime. Except when it's Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg can lie about something that affects hundreds of millions of Americans, but it's not really a big deal. Zuckerberg is not looking at five years in prison. Zuckerberg will not be sanctioned by Congress ever. So what's the difference? Well, unlike Mike Flynn, Mark Zuckerberg is a hero to the American news media. He is who they want to be. He is richer than God. He went to Harvard. He wears T-shirts at work for real. He's for open borders. All the cool people like Mark Zuckerberg, even foreign countries. For example, when the fascist government of China was looking for new tools to oppress its own population, you think they went to Mike Flynn for help? Yes, OK. I don't think so. Flynn is tough on china, old fashioned as he is. But Mark Zuckerberg, by contrast, was happy to help. As they say at McKenzie, Mark Zuckerberg gets it. Boy, what has Mike Flynn ever done for anyone? 33 years in uniform? That's not very innovative. Two lies told by two high-profile Americans. One is going to prison in late middle age. The other will be available for like 40 years for commencement addresses and awards dinners held in his honor. That's the tale of Mike Flynn and Mark Zuckerberg. It tells you everything. Joining us now to break down what's happening to Mike Flynn is Harvard Law Professor Emeritus, Alan Dershowitz. He is the case of the book - the author, rather, of the book The Case Against Impeaching Trump. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. So I read in The Washington Post this morning--"

So I really do think that we have kind of three criteria. Just lying politically. It's done too often. I hate it. But it's done too often. It's not a crime. Second, lying only to government officials, which is a crime but probably shouldn't be a crime, or if it is, it should be a misdemeanor, not a serious felony akin to raising your right arm and swearing under oath that you will tell the truth. There's too much lying in Washington and there are too many, as you point out correctly, double standards about who is prosecuted for lying. In civil cases, people lie in depositions all the time. And they're never prosecuted. I tried to bring a case recently against people who lied. Prosecutors laugh at you. Lying in a deposition? That's like gambling in Casablanca. It's just done all the time, and it's tragic that it's done. I testified in front of Congress about this. When they were going after Bill Clinton and trying to - and impeaching him for his lies. I had a whole session where I talked about how many lies are told in how many different places and how selective they are in going after people. That's one of the problems of not requiring an oath.

There's a long list of those. But it's hardly the only abuse. All the major tech platforms have colluded to silence opinions they don't like and to destroy the people who express those opinions. They've done this in the open. We've watched it happen. Google employees secretly, meanwhile, discussed hiding conservative websites and search results because they're just not legitimate. Facebook's founding president Sean Parker admitted that his company created an intentionally addictive product, like cigarettes, that could destroy children's brains, which is exactly, of course, what it's done. It all adds up to a terrifying picture, a serious menace to this country, to a democracy, to our mental health - check the numbers on that sometime - to our cohesion as a nation. It's a real threat, obviously. And everybody knows it. How is Congress doing protecting us from any of these threats? Good question. They're not. And they're not even trying. And if you're wondering why they're not trying, the answer might be, in part anyway, the outgoing Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Ryan didn't seem interested in reigning in the tech companies in any way, when he was the third most powerful man in America. In part, he was too busy preventing a wall from being built on our southern border to get to the tech question. But there might have been other reasons we're just speculating now. Now that he is leaving the Congress and moving to the private sector, will Paul Ryan be taking any money from any of the big tech firms like Facebook or Google or Twitter? Seemed like an interesting question. Obvious, but then no one has asked. So we called Paul Ryan's office today and we asked that question. We haven't got an answer yet. And it's 8:20 p.m. Eastern. We're going to keep checking and get back to you when they respond. So the leadership of the House, of course, is changing. Democrats are taking over. But the Republicans still hold the Senate. Is there any interest, will there be, in reigning in tech at all? Josh Hawley was just elected Senator. He's a Republican from Missouri, and he joins us tonight. Mr. Senator Elect, thanks very much for coming on. Now, I'm not going to force you to join me in pointing fingers as to why this hasn't been done up to this point. But I will ask the question, do you think the Congress, maybe on a bipartisan basis going forward, will recognize that maybe there's some tweaking that needs to be done in the government's relationship with these companies?"

And to see this report today that Facebook has allowed these big tech companies, Amazon, Microsoft, Spotify, Netflix to have access to the personal information of users, after Facebook said that it would not allow, it would not give away users' personal data is really extraordinary.

They said that they would not share personal, private confidential data of users without the users' consent. Well, Tucker, it looks like that's exactly what Facebook is doing though that they are sharing that data in order to make a profit, as you pointed out, without users' consent. So, number one, FTC needs to enforce the consent decree, they need to investigate right now, whether or not Facebook has violated it.

      "utterance": "Insulin is one of the basic human hormones. Everyone needs insulin to live. Diabetics, though, can't properly produce insulin. And that's a big question in this country. In America right now, about 6 million people are dependent on daily injections of insulin just to survive. It's a great thing that they can do that. Almost a century ago, scientists discovered how to produce synthetic insulin. The scientists who did that sold the patents to a university for $1. Their goal was to help humanity. That's why they did that. It turned out to be one of the great health advances in human history. Diabetes went from almost a certain death sentence to a manageable illness, as it is today or was. Cheaply available insulin has extended the lives of tens of millions of people. But in this country, that seems to be changing. For the last 20 years or so, the price of insulin has been rising very quickly, even relative to other healthcare costs. When top insulin drug, NovoLog, rose in price 353 percent in just 14 years. It isn't exceptional, and the growth has shown no signs of stopping. Thanks to these price hikes, millions of diabetics have started rationing their insulin, gambling with their health and likely shortening their lives to save money. They have no choice. A cheap medicine that your parents took for granted increasingly is inaccessible to poor Americans though, already the group most likely to suffer from diabetes in the first place, as you probably know. Now, there are a lot of reasons this is happening. One is the drug companies keep slightly tweaking their formulas so their drugs never leave patent and generic competitors can't enter the market to compete with them. Another reason is rigid FDA regulations, which make it costly and time- consuming to put a new insulin drug in the market. Pharmaceutical companies use legal challenges to deter competition too. Of course, most companies do do that. And of course, greed plays a role, too. That's a word that we don't use very often, but it's still real. One of the deadly sins for good reason. But whatever the reasons for the spike in prices of insulin, it's a huge problem. And you would think it's something that Congress and the administration would consider taking action on. There are some things they could do. Maybe they should streamline an FDA approval process or adjust patent law. Maybe they should subsidize the creation of a generic insulin brand. After all, we spend billions subsidizing solar panels and electric cars that only rich people can afford. So before you give us a lecture about the market, remind us we already do that, we're not sure what the best solution is, we're not scientists or economists. What we can say, this is a real problem that Congress appears to be ignoring. In October, the President pitched a plan to lower drug prices across the board by tying Medicare reimbursement to drug prices in other countries. Republicans in Congress and on K Street hate that idea. Pharma's bottom line is important to them and it's not an unimportant factor. On the other hand, Americans are dying from easily treated illnesses. That's a factor too. On the left, well, they don't care at all, at least not right now. Their top priority is impeaching Trump, not collaborating with Trump on healthcare. And just like on tech and other issues, they're easily distracted by superficial political signaling. Sanofi is one of the companies now driving up insulin prices, but that company won some degree of credibility from the left last summer and is now insulated from criticism. Why? Well, because when Roseanne Barr blamed Ambien for the ill-advised tweets that got her show cancelled, that company tweeted that racism is not a side effect of its medications. And the left roared with laughter. Go, big pharma. If only they'd roar about that company extorting poor Americans with life-saving drugs! But just like on immigration or trade or automation or global warming, it doesn't matter when America's most vulnerable are hurt. It's actual most vulnerable people no one in D.C. and particularly no one on the left seems to care. Not their constituency. So the debate over the wall on our southern border continues. Not a single person in Washington, D.C. is in favor of building a wall on our southern border. They are terrified, not because they think it won't work but because they believe that it might work and it might clamp down on a source, a ready source of cheap labor. And that's why they're willing to risk a government shutdown rather than give a mere $5 million to start the wall. So what is going to happen? Is the wall over? Will the administration surrender on this? And what will the voters on either side think of the outcome?

He could even use visual aids. There's clearly plenty to show. And I think that there might just be a way for him to have a nod to reality, that he's not going to get this wall funding before the end of the year. I think they're going to try to figure out a way just to punt this for a little bit. Now he's going to have a different Congress to work with. A lot of those members of Congress had already voted for border security, which included fencing, which some people might call a wall. But Democrats, many of them who are running for President, right, they're already in Congress, they - it's like they can't say the \"W\" word. They can't say wall. They can call it all sorts of other things, not a wall. I think that there might be some room for compromise here in the New Year on the merits. On the politics of it, well, the Democrats continue to push back against him, maybe say, oh ha ha, we proved you wrong. Mexico didn't pay for it. You didn't get your wall. Maybe. But there is a political cost to that as well. People understand that our borders need to be secure and that we can be a welcoming, opening, compassionate people at the same time."

The Democrats are going to fuss about that because of just technical reasons of reprogramming money is not that easy to do. But the President has two opportunities coming up in the next six weeks. He'll have the State of the Union. That's a big moment. Right? That's all eyes on the President."

Will that look like a steel wall all across the border? Probably not. But no matter what President Trump gets in terms of border security, he is going to call that a wall. He's a good communicator. He'll figure that out. And no matter what, the Democrats will say, see, we told you he wasn't going to get that steel wall all across the border. But border security, I think, it's a real possibility. I think there're some new members of Congress that are going to be willing. And remember this. For Republicans and Democrats, there's a lot more veterans that just got elected to Congress. They're used to working with the other side. There are responsible people who care deeply about the national security of the United States. The President ought to invite all of them, Democrats, Republicans, bring that coalition together. I think that's a really exciting group. And that America has a lot to be proud of that these veterans have come back and are still willing to serve their country just in a different way."

And nowhere does the war on Christmas exist less than in China. And that's why the city officials of Langfang, China, have issued a total ban on the public celebration of Christmas. That means no Santa, no lights, and obviously no nativity scenes. The ban is part of a wider religious crackdown in China, which has seen churches shut down and believers thrown in prison, a story that hasn't gotten a ton of ink here among our elites who are getting rich in China. In Russia, by contrast, and even in Assad's Syria, millions of Christians will happily celebrate Christmas without any oppression. Just take a guess which countries are despised and which ones they suck up to? And maybe that's why they love China's government so much. Beijing does what Washington wishes it could do, with efficiency too. I want to bring you a major development tonight in America's involvement in Syria despite heavy pressure from Saudi Arabia and thousands of foreign policy experts.

He wants to force all citizens in the State of New York to turn over their social media password so their accounts can be inspected by the thought-police before they buy guns. If they say something naughty or threatening, no gun. Well, given that, we are fascinated to see the news yesterday. Parker grew angry with the Republican spokeswoman and tweeted her this. \"Kill yourself.\" Well, the irony, obviously, pretty obvious. So Parker apologized. He said he was making a donation to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. We applaud that. Has he learned the lesson embedded in his own actions though? The anti-gun bill he sponsored is still pending in the New York State legislature. We've asked Senator Parker to come back on this show, so he can explain once again why he ought to have the power to police thought-crime on Twitter. And by the way, should he, given his record, be allowed to own a gun? So far, his office has not responded, but we'll keep asking him. Great guest. Happy to have him again. Well, yesterday in Capitol Hill, the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sharply attacked a proposal to give the President an immigration enforcement slush fund, as he called it."

I called Leader McConnell and told him we would not accept their $1 billion slush fund and that our offers to fund the government remain."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Now, don't take those words the wrong way. The problem Democrats have is with border enforcement. They don't have a problem with slush funds. Congress loves slush funds. That's why, for years, Congress has maintained a slush fund at your expense, taxpayer funded, to pay off people who accuse members of Congress of sexual harassment. The Democrats will control the House in just a couple of weeks, of course. Are they going to end the slush fund, and more to the point, will they tell us who has been protected by it? What are the names? Penny Nance is President of Concerned Women for America, and she joins us tonight. Penny, thanks so much for coming on. This seems like a very simple ask. Why shouldn't the public know who got paid with our money to settle these claims?"

      "speaker": "PENNY NANCE, PRESIDENT, CONCERNED WOMEN FOR AMERICA",
      "utterance": "That's a very good question. And by the way, Concerned Women for America members sent thousands of petitions asking Congress to tell us. Over 20 years, 264 cases, $15 million of our money was paid out to hide what members of Congress did. And these weren't little allegations. These were big things. We have the case of Blake Farenthold, who sexually harassed his communications director, shared his sexual fantasies about her. And when she dared to complain, he fired her. And you remember Eric Massa and his groping of young men, and then he called it tickle fights. He had to pay out $100,000--"

      "speaker": "NANCE",
      "utterance": "We have called on her to do that, but she so far has chosen to shield her colleagues. She even went as far as to say that John Conyers was a hero and a great American. Remember John Conyers was hosting meetings with his staff in his underwear and was caught on film - caught on video on a airline flight on the taxpayer dollars watching porn. This is the guy, by the way, who used to be the Judiciary Committee Chairman who had oversight over pornography. So you can't make this stuff up. The new bill does make some improvements and, going forward, requires restitution. But it's not clear whether or not even then we'll know for sure, going forward, who actually is the perpetrator. Because in the new legislation, you just disclose the office. It could be the Chief of Staff, it could be the legislative director, it could be the Press Secretary, and like they're going to write off their boss. So--"

      "utterance": "Well, as you've seen tonight, permanent Washington cares a great deal about protecting the way things are, the status quo. It's great for them. They get richer and they can believe, and many do believe that they are morally superior to you. And that's why they destroy anyone who threatens the status quo. Mike Flynn, for example, is being destroyed. Mark Zuckerberg lied as well. He's being protected because he's on the side of the people who make those decisions. That's also why the establishment has become so obsessed with crushing free speech. It's getting harder and harder for them to win arguments on the merits. The best option then is to keep the arguments from being made at all. When you can tar your opponent as immoral, as a bigot, you don't have to defend you own position, you can just do what you want. You can also ruin the lives of anyone who gets in your way and feel good about it. How do we get to this place? So that entire story is in a new book called Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution. Christmas is coming. This tells a story that might rattle you, but it's still worth knowing. You can find it on our website, tuckercarlson.com. That's about it for us tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy - and we mean it - of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink; the show that says what we think is true, whether they like it or not. Good night from Washington. Sean Hannity is next. Dan Bongino is sitting in-- Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
