So, as soon as that gets underway, we will take you there live. And there is also tonight, not too far from here, another James Comey book event. As that of battle and the media blitz continue to heat up tonight, it seems that his book tour is prompting an attempt by some House Republicans to throw the book at him, and everyone else at the FBI and DOJ who was involved in the Clinton investigation. Nearly a dozen House Republicans are now demanding that the DOJ investigate several Obama-era officials. Here is the response on that when he was asked about it. Here's the former FBI director today.",

The letter from House Republicans' calls on the Justice Department, FBI, and the U.S. Attorney to investigate key players in the Clinton e-mail and Russian investigation, as well as Uranium One -- a business deal tied to the Clintons. The wide-ranging level allegations against former FBI Director James Comey, former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Hillary Clinton, and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch among others. Lawmakers question whether their actions potentially violated federal statute on lying, perjury, obstruction of justice, as well as federal election law. Tonight, the Justice Department declined to comment on the letter. There was no immediate response from the FBI. In a statement to Fox News, McCabe's lawyers said, his client got a raw deal from his old boss. And the Justice Department's internal watchdog who concluded that McCabe lied four times about a media leak. 'The report fails to adequately address the evidence, including sworn testimony, and documents, that prove Mr. McCabe advised Director Comey repeatedly that he was working with The Wall Street Journal. Neither Mr. Comey, nor the inspector general is infallible, and in this case, neither of them has it right.' Last night on you show, the Republican chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee said he also want the Fed to review e-mails and text messages that raise new questions about Comey's statement to Congress about the email case and the level of coordination with the Justice Department.",

You know, the fact that he rushed this book out is inexcusable. He was the head of this investigation and is now one of the cooperating witnesses. Nobody would suggest that this book is benefiting the investigation. To the contrary, he's undermining his role as a witness. And so, the question is why is he doing it, and the answer is rather obvious. He's going to make a lot of money, but in the process, he's going to do untold harm to the institution he once headed.",

But more importantly, when you read that book, it's a bit of a sham. You know, he said well, I wrote this book because America is looking for ethical leadership. Really? So, the ethical leadership is him. He's saying America needs me. I'm selling me. But the problem with that pitch is that when Comey was fired, he removed seven memos from the FBI, in my view, and appropriately. Those were -- that was FBI material linked to an investigation. Four of those memos now are believed to be classified. Now, it's just like a book. He could've given it to Congress, he could've given it to the investigators. But instead, the man charged with finding leakers became a leaker himself and gave it to a friend so the information could get to the media. That's not ethical leadership.",

I've spoken to some of the president's top advisors who believe there's no good reason to block Mike Pompeo's nomination other than Democratic obstructionism. And there are signs tonight the White House is trying to play hardball with those Democrats by leaking out some of the details of the CIA director's mission to North Korea, and here's why. Sending Pompeo to Pyongyang, the highest-level official to visit since Bill Clinton', secretary of state, 18 years ago suggest these talks are much further along than the president's critics want to admit. And there's a school of thought that administration officials leaked a word of the mission in order to pressure Democrats and say how can you vote against the secretary of state nominee when he's so directly involved in such sensitive diplomacy? Yet nine of 10 Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have announced they're voting 'no,' while the tenth Democrat, Chris Coons of Delaware says, he's undecided.  But complicating the White House's effort to blame this on Democrats is the fact that Rand Paul -- one of 11 Republicans on the committee -- has said he'll vote 'no,' because he thinks Pompeo is too hawkish, and he's upset about the director's support of the CIA's use of harsh interrogation techniques for terrorist. Paul revealed today, he spoke by phone with the president, who urged him to meet with Pompeo, but Paul is suggesting that's not likely to change his mind over concerns about U.S. entanglements overseas. Now, historians cannot find an example of a secretary of state being voted down by the Foreign Relations Committee, though his nomination could still be sent to the Senate floor for an up or down vote with the GOP slim majority though. And Senator John McCain unlikely to vote because of health. The White House has to get Democratic votes. So, today, Pompeo met with Democrat Claire McCaskill, she faces a tough re-election in a red state and he sounded positive after meeting with moderate Democrat Mark Warner. Listen.",

After all, no president of the United States has ever met with a North Korean leader and certainly never had a total discussion like they were about to have. That tells me that Director Pompeo told the president to, look, there is an opportunity here, and it's worth the risk of going into a meeting with this guy. Because he had to convince Pompeo about some sincerity here. Pompeo knows that he's dealing with a liar, a manipulator, a thug, and a killer.

But that aside, this is huge, it's monumental, as General Keane was saying. You're talking about nuclear deterrence, you're talking about nuclear security, you're about a possible diplomatic solution. And here's the guy who went and had that conversation, diplomatically. And at the Democrats are talking about opposing him. I heard a couple of Democrats spokesman on T.V. today, saying well, he's not really enthusiastic about gay marriage. Seriously? Is that what we are talking about? By the way, on gay marriage, the Barack Obama and the Clintons weren't all out and for it until a few years ago.

The guy can be, obviously, a very effective diplomat. Let me just say as well, along with Tom Cotton and one or two other people, this is about the best resume in America right now. Number one, from the U.S. Academy, top of his class on Harvard Law School, the hearings that showed what a bright and thoughtful, decent guy he is.

And about 30 minutes after takeoff, there were reports, and you saw the picture there, of a small fire in the planes right engine. Now, there is a photographer who works for our Atlanta Fox affiliate, he happens to be on board that plane and he took some videos of smoke coming out of the engine. And clearly, you can see from the smoke, the plane is on the ground, it did land safely, but you can see there that the flaps are up and the smoke is coming out the back. There are no reports of any injuries. The plane is now being towed back to the gate. Witnesses say, the plane is in airbus A330, and it was carrying some 274 passengers. We have calls into Delta and the FAA. So far, no response, and no word on when those passengers might be rerouted. You see the video inside, the people are calm, the plane is down there. Apparently, there was never any report of any problems with the landing or an emergency landing, but they did pull off the end of the runway and it will be towed back to the gate. You recall, it was about 30 minutes in the yesterday's Southwest airlines flight from New York to Dallas, when the left engine on the 737 broke apart, shooting debris and piercing a window in row 17. A woman sitting next to that window was killed after being hit by shrapnel and then being partially sucked out of the window.   The coroner now says that woman, identified as Jennifer Reardon, died of a blunt impact trauma of the head, neck, and torso. It remains unclear if her death is a result of the impact from the shrapnel, the force of being sucked towards the window, or a combination of both. Investigators say she was wearing her seat belt at the time of the incident, and they still do not know exactly why the entire window blew out. A group of passengers pulled that woman back in. They know the engine was caused -- this blow out was cause by a fan blade that was just blown apart. It was apparently some metal fatigue. It's the very same problem that happened to a Southwest 737, same engine, same problem, two years ago, and there was an air directive put out on that plane. We should tell you that yesterday marked the first U.S. airline fatality and nine years. And now, we've had two engine blows in two days, but the planes are totally different in these cases.",

Juan argues that Eric Holder is a centrist. I would argue that he's a far left radical. And if you want a candidate who is corrupt and in scandal, then Eric Holder is your guy. You've already mentioned the IRS scandal. You had him spying on reporters on multiple times. You had him apologizing for that eventually. You had him being involved in not prosecuting Black Panthers for intimidating voters at the polls. And, he's been fighting tooth and nail against voter I.D. laws, which 70 plus percent of the country agrees with. And so, I would say he's very far left. People who worked with him at the Justice Department like Jake Christian Adams have written about this. His entire focus while he was there was on race issues, not bringing people together, but dividing the country.

We have faith she's in heaven, and we know life will go on, as she would have it. So, cross the Bushes off your worry list, he writes.

Lawmakers question whether their actions potentially violated federal statute on lying, perjury, obstruction of justice, as well as federal election law. Tonight, the Justice Department declined to comment on the letter. There was no immediate response from the FBI. In a statement to Fox News, McCabe's lawyers said, his client got a raw deal from his old boss. And the Justice Department's internal watchdog who concluded that McCabe lied four times about a media leak. 'The report fails to adequately address the evidence, including sworn testimony, and documents, that prove Mr. McCabe advised Director Comey repeatedly that he was working with The Wall Street Journal. Neither Mr. Comey, nor the inspector general is infallible, and in this case, neither of them has it right.'

You know, they need to have presidents trust them. And Comey has really destroyed that. And it's not just a book, it's not just the tenor, but the timing. You know, the fact that he rushed this book out is inexcusable. He was the head of this investigation and is now one of the cooperating witnesses. Nobody would suggest that this book is benefiting the investigation. To the contrary, he's undermining his role as a witness. And so, the question is why is he doing it, and the answer is rather obvious. He's going to make a lot of money, but in the process, he's going to do untold harm to the institution he once headed."

I thought you were all about the FBI, all about the rule of law, why wouldn't you clear it with Mueller? I mean, you were one of his cooperating witnesses. But more importantly, when you read that book, it's a bit of a sham. You know, he said well, I wrote this book because America is looking for ethical leadership. Really? So, the ethical leadership is him. He's saying America needs me. I'm selling me. But the problem with that pitch is that when Comey was fired, he removed seven memos from the FBI, in my view, and appropriately. Those were -- that was FBI material linked to an investigation. Four of those memos now are believed to be classified. Now, it's just like a book. He could've given it to Congress, he could've given it to the investigators. But instead, the man charged with finding leakers became a leaker himself and gave it to a friend so the information could get to the media. That's not ethical leadership."

And he's saying that James Comey reached a conclusion on his investigation of Hillary Clinton before he had even interviewed her. And when James Comey was asked about that, Jonathan, he basically said, well, if you don't know where an investigation is going and you've been at it a year, and you don't know what direction it's going, you're doing something wrong.

And it really is undermining his credibility. He's going to make a lot of money, but he will damage his reputation, his legacy, and they are very important and good things about his legacy. And he will damage the FBI. And in the end, you know, Trump does have this ability to get his critics that sort of bring out the worst in his critics.

I've spoken to some of the president's top advisors who believe there's no good reason to block Mike Pompeo's nomination other than Democratic obstructionism. And there are signs tonight the White House is trying to play hardball with those Democrats by leaking out some of the details of the CIA director's mission to North Korea, and here's why. Sending Pompeo to Pyongyang, the highest-level official to visit since Bill Clinton', secretary of state, 18 years ago suggest these talks are much further along than the president's critics want to admit. And there's a school of thought that administration officials leaked a word of the mission in order to pressure Democrats and say how can you vote against the secretary of state nominee when he's so directly involved in such sensitive diplomacy? Yet nine of 10 Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have announced they're voting 'no,' while the tenth Democrat, Chris Coons of Delaware says, he's undecided. But complicating the White House's effort to blame this on Democrats is the fact that Rand Paul -- one of 11 Republicans on the committee -- has said he'll vote 'no,' because he thinks Pompeo is too hawkish, and he's upset about the director's support of the CIA's use of harsh interrogation techniques for terrorist. Paul revealed today, he spoke by phone with the president, who urged him to meet with Pompeo, but Paul is suggesting that's not likely to change his mind over concerns about U.S. entanglements overseas. Now, historians cannot find an example of a secretary of state being voted down by the Foreign Relations Committee, though his nomination could still be sent to the Senate floor for an up or down vote with the GOP slim majority though. And Senator John McCain unlikely to vote because of health. The White House has to get Democratic votes. So, today, Pompeo met with Democrat Claire McCaskill, she faces a tough re-election in a red state and he sounded positive after meeting with moderate Democrat Mark Warner. Listen."

I know that you spoke to the CIA director before the secret mission that he went on to North Korea. We've heard Rand Paul saying he doesn't think that Mike Pompeo is lined up with the president on foreign policy. Do you agree?"
    },

      "speaker": "JACK KEANE, FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST AND CHAIRMAN FOR THE INSTITUTE OF THE STUDY OF WAR",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, you know, I did speak to him. He certainly did not disclose his visit to North Korea but the subject we had, we spoke at length on North Korea. And I believe a couple of things: one, the Central Intelligence Agency has clearly got the best focus on Kim Jong-un, who he is, and a profile, and the director understands that fully. Pompeo also has tremendous grasp of what the issues are in North Korea and certainly what the risks are. And I totally agree that Pompeo is on the same page with the president and his entire national security foreign policy agenda. And I think his relationship with the president, as a result of the daily briefings is excellent. They truly understand one another. They're both very bright and they both learn from each other."

    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think the primary purpose is not certainly to -- as a step to -- a preliminary step to actually have a meeting with two leaders. The primary purpose was to stress test Kim Jong-un's determination and sincerity, and authenticity about really making a deal. And the fact that Pompeo has debriefed the president, and the president is going forward with this summit meeting, with all the political risks associated with it. After all, no president of the United States has ever met with a North Korean leader and certainly never had a total discussion like they were about to have. That tells me that Director Pompeo told the president to, look, there is an opportunity here, and it's worth the risk of going into a meeting with this guy. Because he had to convince Pompeo about some sincerity here. Pompeo knows that he's dealing with a liar, a manipulator, a thug, and a killer. But at the same time, there's huge national security interest at risk for the world, for the region, and for the United States here. So, I think that's what happened, Martha. And that's why we are where we are."

We've seen that happen in the last 15 months. Listen, we are on the cost fear of a potentially huge event.

Jack Keane laid it out a very well except I'll issue one correction to my friend, an esteemed and admired Jack Keane. I think some of the diplomacy that Ronald Reagan practice at Reykjavik was world historic as well in his meetings with Gorbachev. But that aside, this is huge, it's monumental, as General Keane was saying. You're talking about nuclear deterrence, you're talking about nuclear security, you're about a possible diplomatic solution. And here's the guy who went and had that conversation, diplomatically. And at the Democrats are talking about opposing him. I heard a couple of Democrats spokesman on T.V. today, saying well, he's not really enthusiastic about gay marriage. Seriously? Is that what we are talking about? By the way, on gay marriage, the Barack Obama and the Clintons weren't all out and for it until a few years ago. But this is not the grounds on which you decide if you should be the secretary of state. But the other kind of opposition that is to bellicose Rand Paul, again, a person I respect. It's just mistaken, Martha. I mean, he went diplomatically. He didn't go to put something secret in Kim Jong Un's cup of tea. This is a diplomatic mission. The guy can be, obviously, a very effective diplomat. Let me just say as well, along with Tom Cotton and one or two other people, this is about the best resume in America right now. Number one, from the U.S. Academy, top of his class on Harvard Law School, the hearings that showed what a bright and thoughtful, decent guy he is. So, Democrats do this, and if they do it, it could hurt that meeting. That meeting might not take place. It might not take place under the right kind of atmosphere. That will be a price that they will have to pay for a very long time. Think of the risk, the downside of losing this meeting."

And we're going to take you, you know, a lot of times we're going to get some shouted questions, and we'll bring you there live as soon as that gets underway. And this alert for you, moments ago, a Delta plane has an engine that caught fire. You can see the smoke coming out the right-hand side of the plane there. Apparently, this is taking place at Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport. Trace Gallagher has been following all of this from our West Coast Newsroom, with the breaking news tonight.

      "utterance": "This is a Delta flight, Martha, from Atlanta to London. And about 30 minutes after takeoff, there were reports, and you saw the picture there, of a small fire in the planes right engine. Now, there is a photographer who works for our Atlanta Fox affiliate, he happens to be on board that plane and he took some videos of smoke coming out of the engine. And clearly, you can see from the smoke, the plane is on the ground, it did land safely, but you can see there that the flaps are up and the smoke is coming out the back. There are no reports of any injuries. The plane is now being towed back to the gate. Witnesses say, the plane is in airbus A330, and it was carrying some 274 passengers. We have calls into Delta and the FAA. So far, no response, and no word on when those passengers might be rerouted. You see the video inside, the people are calm, the plane is down there. Apparently, there was never any report of any problems with the landing or an emergency landing, but they did pull off the end of the runway and it will be towed back to the gate. You recall, it was about 30 minutes in the yesterday's Southwest airlines flight from New York to Dallas, when the left engine on the 737 broke apart, shooting debris and piercing a window in row 17. A woman sitting next to that window was killed after being hit by shrapnel and then being partially sucked out of the window. The coroner now says that woman, identified as Jennifer Reardon, died of a blunt impact trauma of the head, neck, and torso. It remains unclear if her death is a result of the impact from the shrapnel, the force of being sucked towards the window, or a combination of both. Investigators say she was wearing her seat belt at the time of the incident, and they still do not know exactly why the entire window blew out. A group of passengers pulled that woman back in. They know the engine was caused -- this blow out was cause by a fan blade that was just blown apart. It was apparently some metal fatigue. It's the very same problem that happened to a Southwest 737, same engine, same problem, two years ago, and there was an air directive put out on that plane. We should tell you that yesterday marked the first U.S. airline fatality and nine years. And now, we've had two engine blows in two days, but the planes are totally different in these cases."

I think, you know, in our celebrity subculture on the Democratic side as well, as the Republican side right now. You people are talking about Michelle Obama or Oprah, but in realistic terms, I think Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders are at the head of the class, maybe the two women senators, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.

It was also Democrats who voted him in contempt for refusing to turn documents over as part of operation Fast and Furious, where a border patrol agent was killed as a result of his department running illegal firearms into Mexico, where hundreds of people were killed. Juan argues that Eric Holder is a centrist. I would argue that he's a far left radical. And if you want a candidate who is corrupt and in scandal, then Eric Holder is your guy. You've already mentioned the IRS scandal. You had him spying on reporters on multiple times. You had him apologizing for that eventually. You had him being involved in not prosecuting Black Panthers for intimidating voters at the polls. And, he's been fighting tooth and nail against voter I.D. laws, which 70 plus percent of the country agrees with. And so, I would say he's very far left. People who worked with him at the Justice Department like Jake Christian Adams have written about this. His entire focus while he was there was on race issues, not bringing people together, but dividing the country. So, Eric Holder, I think, is a far- left candidate that will not be welcomed by the majority of the country."

You know, the thing about it is -- that contempt mode I think would be used by the Republicans in a general election of Holder with a Democratic candidate. But, keep in mind, the 2020 election is really going to be a referendum on Donald Trump. And whoever the Democrat is, I don't care if it's Mother Teresa or Jesus himself, that person is going to be vilified by the Republicans so that Trump looks like the more appealing of the two options. But, I will say this, Katie, you have people that I worked with, Karl Rove, you know, John -- Josh Bolton. They've had been held in contempt by congressional committees. And I think so much of that Fast and Furious stuff really was heavily politicized. But it will come back. You're right. It'll come back. They'll try to use it."

It's the culture that -- it's been that way that, you know, we kind of attribute to the Karolyi's for starting this type of culture in the U.S. And that's what needs to change. And it's not going to change unless, in my opinion, they decertify USA Gymnastics, and pretty much start all over."

It was originally built, as you've probably heard, as the Southern White House, and it turn out to be the Southern White House. So, it's really an honor. We've had two very productive days on trade, on military, on North Korea. And, we will continue, and we will also continue into the weeks ahead, and we're coming up with what will be a very fair trade deal for both countries. And we look forward to it.

As the state's Democratic governor is among the opponents. A spokesperson saying, quote, Pennsylvania Republicans are trying once again to criminalize a health care decision that Governor Wolf has made clear should be made by a woman and her doctor, not politicians in Harrisburg. Here now, Dr. Gina Loudon is a psychology expert and creator of, quote, they all have names, a nonprofit that helps families adopt children like her son, Samuel, who has Down syndrome.

      "utterance": "Well, I'm glad that states like Pennsylvania are taking steps to recognize that. As a culture, Martha, we talk a lot about tolerance and about civility, and those sorts of things, and then at the same time, is there anything more heinous or more discriminating than killing someone based on a disability? I mean, we have to really ask ourselves that question as a culture. But, like anything, you follow the money. There's a reason why that a legislator, like the one in Pennsylvania, can pass this by such a wide margin. I believe the numbers were like 139 to 56 or something. But the governor opposes it, and he's a Democrat. And that's by design, Martha, because about $1.5 million of taxpayer money is spent every day on abortion, and most of that ends up in Democrat politicians coffers. It's just the reality."

      "speaker": "LOUDON",
      "utterance": "Well, that's just really isn't about money going into Democratic coffers. Great. Then, how about the same Democrat lawmakers propose bill that fund families when there are hundreds of them waiting, like my family, adopting Samuel, hundreds of families waiting in the United States to adopt these babies. Why not fund those efforts? Adoption is an expensive process to begin with. It can cost between -- anywhere from, like, $10 to $50,000 to adopt a child with special needs. And, at the same time, there are no money available for that on the federal level. Instead, the money goes into killing the babies, which is, in my opinion, the worst form of discrimination against someone with a disability, ever."

And, they all have names helps to connect people who may not feel that they're equipped to carry out -- take care of this child, and they can find adoptive homes.

After two weeks of negotiation, California Governor Jerry Brown says he will mobilize 400 National Guard troops within the state and along the borders. Brown is doing a bit of about face here. He has previously been reluctant to get troops to the border over concerns that it would be too closely tied to immigration enforcement. He reiterates that his conditions from last week that they will not enforce immigration laws or participate in the construction of any new border barrier, aka, the wall. And this for you tonight, President George W. Bush has released a statement a short time ago about the passing of his wife of 73 years, First Lady Barbara Bush. He said, quote, I always knew Barbara was the most beloved woman in the world. The outpouring of love and friendship being directed at the enforcer is lifting us all up. We have faith she's in heaven, and we know life will go on, as she would have it. So, cross the Bushes off your worry list, he writes. Their love story began at a dance when she was 16, and it was captured in a collection of letters that George wrote to his wife. One of them reading, quote, you have given me joy that few men know. I have climbed perhaps the highest mountain in the world, but even that cannot hold a candle to being Barbara's husband. Tonight's quote of the night comes from Barbara Bush herself."
