      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” In a televised address to the country last night, as you know, the President made his case for why America needs a wall on our Southern border, and why that wall is so important and that's worth shutting down the federal government to get it. Democrats remained unmoved by the address. Leaders in Congress on the Democratic side, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, delivered their party's initial response. Their words were then echoed with mechanical precision by Democrats up and down the chain, from sitting members of Congress all the way down to the Left-wing lady muttering in your local dog park.  Talking points doesn't really do justice to the rhetorical discipline here. It was really like watching a 3D printer at work, churning out carbon copies of stilted propaganda one after the other after the other, a miracle of replication. You might even call the Democratic response manufactured.",

We can answer that question with some authority because last week on January 3rd, House Democrats passed their own proposal, they say, would secure our Southern border.  What's in it? What would it do? Well nothing that is not being done already. The Democratic bill provides the same funding for partial fencing, border security technology, hiring more customs officers, and so forth that we already have.  In other words, the Democratic border security plan is the status quo. Democrats' argument is that things work just fine right now. Instead of spending another dollar to secure our border, Democrats in Congress have, for example, just proposed spending another $12 million to investigate reparations for slavery, just to give you some proportion and a sense of their priorities. To Democrats, everything is more important than border security. And that would be fine if our current security was working. It's not. In fact, it's likely that more than 20 million people already live illegally in our country right now. That's more than 2.5 times the entire population of New York City.   And the actual number may be bigger than that. We don't really know. And that's the point. It's totally out of control. The problem isn't the Border Patrol doesn't have the right technology to do the job. The problem is that politicians don't care to fix it. And if they did, they could solve the problem in an afternoon. Borders are not that complex, not like we're trying to cure pancreatic cancer here. Our best minds are stumped. Hardly!  What worked for Hadrian will work for us. It works for Israel right now, and a lot of other places. Walls work. That's why people still build them. Everybody knows that. This is all a charade. And we should at least admit what's happening.  What you saw last night was not two parties bickering over the best way to solve a shared problem. No. In this case, one side's problem is the other side's solution. For Democrats, a porous border is a good thing, unalloyed, good thing. It means more low-wage workers for their donors. That's deeply appreciated. It means more compliant voters for them to replace the millions of actual Americans they have alienated. And then, there's the emotional payoff of the whole thing. Democrats feel good about letting in poor people from around the world. These are people who don't make a lot of complicated demands about healthcare or dental or unfunded pensions or what their kids should be doing for a living.   They're not whiny, like Americans. They're not living reminders of how politicians have failed to fulfill their promises. No, they're just grateful to be here. They're immigrants. Democrats love people like that. In fact, they've come to love them much more than they love you.  Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez said that out loud just last night.",

So before I was even Chief of the Border Patrol, I served in the FBI for two decades.  One of my assignments is I led the El Paso office. From my office, right on the border, I could see Juarez, every single day, Tucker. We worked with the DEA and all components of DHS, and we worked human trafficking cases, we worked drug cases, and we worked - and gang cases, all impacting the Southern border. And then as Chief, every single day, Tucker, I was briefed, every single day about the men and women who are risking their lives every day, and they're apprehending murderers, rapists, pedophiles, other violent offenders, and gang members. That's not manufactured. That is real. And that's a fact and it's still happening today. And I would also say one last point is a 127 Border Patrol agents have died. They didn't die playing Monopoly. They died defending, being the frontline defenders of our borders, trying to apprehend that 17,000 people, that bad people that Secretary Nielsen mentioned.

You've got one from Neontaster right there, as you see, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer's faces superimposed on the American Gothic painting, hilarious there, and that's also what Brian Williams was referencing as well. So, another one, this is from George P. Bush saying \"We are not mad, we are just disappointed.\" This looks like, Tucker, your parents, you're in high school where you come home late past curfew, they're mad at you.

      "sentences": "Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia and various other related and unrelated topics feels like it's been going on for about a generation now, maybe multiple generations. But at some point, it will end, all things end. Obviously, we don't know what Mueller's findings will be. We do know there are an awful lot of people from the Democratic Congress to the entire news media who will use the Russia report, whatever it says, to try to force the President from office. That's inevitable. Donald Trump has an awful lot of enemies. He also has a lot of supporters. 63 million Americans voted for this President. Pretty soon, he will need every one of those people to stand up for him, and not just him, personally, but for democracy itself, the principle that we choose and remove our leaders by voting, not through bureaucratic coups. That moment is coming. Will the President get the support he needs to stay in office? Well, so far, Trump's voters have been remarkably loyal to him. But loyalty is a two-way street. It must be requited. You stick by the people who stick by you. Has the President stuck by his supporters? Well, in some ways, he has. But if you voted for Trump, take a step back. How's your life two years later? Are you freer now to say what you think than you were on Election Day 2016? Are you bolder and more confident in your beliefs? Or are you more afraid? It's a question James Damore might ask. The company that Damore once worked for, Google, often boasts about its commitment to the free exchange of ideas. So, Damore dared to exchange his ideas with others. He never threatened or demeaned anyone. Google just didn't like what he said. So, they fired him and they trashed his reputation so thoroughly he couldn't find a job. Something very like that happened to the tech entrepreneur, Palmer Luckey. Luckey was thrown off the board of Facebook solely because he supported Donald Trump for President. And then, how about Alex Jones? You may not like Jones. You may despise him. But you should know that he was systematically crushed by the big tech companies just for saying things they disliked. He can't even use PayPal anymore, and he's not the only one, hardly. Others have been punished not for what they say but simply for refusing to read from pre-approved scripts. Virginia public school teacher, Peter Vlaming lost his job because he resisted using pronouns he believed to be inaccurate. Vlaming didn't criticize or mis-gender anyone. He simply avoided using pronouns entirely and addressed a student by name, instead. That wasn't good enough. Vlaming was fired for the crime of having an opinion that most of the country shares. Those things happen, and they're just a few of the best-known examples. Imagine all those that don't make the news. How many Americans have been fired or denied work because of their political beliefs over the last two years? Who's protecting these people? In the business world, virtually every major company seems to have lurched Left since Trump's election. Our corporate leaders are now openly determined to award this country's spoils on the basis of skin color rather than merit. They say that out loud. This is unfair and it's deeply divisive. It makes Americans hate each other. It's also, as a factual matter, illegal. Corporations are not allowed to practice racial discrimination, neither are universities. There's an entire division of the Justice Department that exists to enforce our laws against racism. Have they noticed what's happening? Of course, they have. They just don't care. Maybe they should find other jobs. There are still lawyers in this country who care about civil rights, and the Administration should hire them and set them to work. And while they're at it, they ought to defend our constitutionally-guaranteed religious freedoms as well. Traditional Christian beliefs are not a crime. Discriminating against them is. Corporate America ought to be reminded of that. Beliefs that were considered conventionally conservative just five years ago are now routinely described as terrorism. Meanwhile, actual terror, committed by the Left, seems to go unpunished. In 2017, to name just one example, a Left-wing college professor called Eric Clanton smashed strangers in the head with a bike lock. Why? Because he believed they disagreed with his politics. Clanton was charged with a felony. But then the charges were dropped. He spent no time in jail. How did that happen? That same year, a Left-wing mob in North Carolina destroyed a public statue they didn't like, purely because they felt like it. The whole thing was caught on video. Somehow, nobody was punished. At Evergreen College in Washington State, a Left-wing mob ordered Professor Bret Weinstein to leave campus for having the wrong skin color. When he refused, the mob rioted. Weinstein was forced to hold classes in a public park. Police told him he wasn't safe on campus. Eventually, Weinstein resigned from his job. He felt he had no choice. The people who threatened Weinstein were never punished. In other words, they won, violence won. This is all happening right now. Imagine how Barack Obama would have responded if it had happened to his voters while he was President. Let's say it's 2010. Obamacare has just passed, and public sentiment against the Administration is intense, people are angry. Suddenly it has become, in effect, a crime to support Barack Obama in public. You can be fired for admitting you voted for him. You can be punched in the face for wearing a hat with Obama's name on it. You think Obama would have done something about that? Hell, yes. These are his voters. He's the President of the United States. His job is to protect them, and all Americans who want to speak freely. You would never get away with threatening an Obama voter for supporting Obama. There is no chance, not for a second. The FBI would be in your living room before you got home, and good for the FBI. If our government exists to do anything, it's to preserve the free society that is our birthright. That society is crumbling. This country is becoming less free. The Administration should fight back against that. They have the power. Laws on the books already protects an individual's right to support any political candidate he chooses. Enforce those laws. Should Americans need the approval of some tech billionaire in order to exercise their freedom of speech online? We won't know for sure until the Administration pushes back against digital censorship. Facebook and Google and Twitter likely would respond with legal challenges. Let them. Fighting for speech is always the right fight. It's also good politics. The President is up for re-election in two years, and he'll be judged on what he has accomplished in office. Will he get a Border wall or an infrastructure plan? Who knows? The Congress doesn't seem anxious to cooperate on anything. One thing the President can do is exercise his Executive powers to defend the Bill of Rights, and the dignity of all Americans, no matter what they think. Let's say the wall is never built. On the other hand, in November of 2020, the President can sincerely say to the country that he has fought as hard as he could to make certain that everyone in America is treated equally under the law, regardless of sex or skin color or political beliefs. No, he'll say, you didn't get new roads or airports, you didn't live to see Planned Parenthood defunded. Congress blocked all that. But the good news is you're no longer afraid. You don't have to whisper anymore when you say what you really think. You don't live in fear that some Corporate Sensitivity Officer will destroy your career for thinking the wrong thing. You can say what you really believe in public. You're an American citizen. That is your right. If Donald Trump can credibly say all that two years from now, it's still possible he won't win. But he'll be a genuinely great president. Well, for decades, the Republican Party has been proud to call itself the party of free markets, and good for them. There's nothing wrong with markets, of course. We're for them. But there is something much more important than any economic system, and that is the health of people. When corporate interests, and the interests of American families conflict, you've got to side with American families. It seems like an obvious one. We made it last week. We'll continue to make it. One person who's been saying this for a long time is J. D. Vance. He's the Author of Hillbilly Elegy, and he joins us tonight. J. D. Vance, thanks very much for coming on.",

Why do they do that? Because they know that their own devices hurt children. But at the same time, the tech industry has no problem foisting those devices on everybody else's kids. According to Google, half of all the country's K through 12 students use Google Apps to learn. Google has donated a 100 million in devices to schools, which, of course, has the welcome side effect of acclimating and addicting children to Apple products when they are most impressionable. Did Phil Morris pass out Marlboros to kids? I don't know. We'll check. Microsoft has, similarly, donated more than a billion dollars in discounted Windows products to schools. No one's really noticed this. Michelle Malkin has though. She's a syndicated columnist, author, and blogger, and she joins us tonight.

For example, American Engagement Technologies or AET, founded by former Obama Administration official, Mikey Dickerson, bought ads for two Facebook pages, The Daily Real and Today's Nation, both encouraging Republican voters to stay home because the election was inconsequential, posting ads like this, \"Everyone else hearing more recent stories that the Blue Wave is a myth, and the Republicans are going to win and upset mainstream pollsters once again,\" or this ad, quoting again, \"We told Conservatives that we would defend their values and they believed us!\" And still another ad saying, quote, \"Some Trump supporters see midterm losses for Congressional Republicans as a wake-up call to get serious on the wall.\" Now, for context, billionaire, Reid Hoffman, was an early investor in Facebook and acknowledged that he founded AET, after that group came under fire for allegedly running misinformation ads in the 2017 Alabama Special Election, intended to falsely link GOP Senatorial Candidate, Roy Moore, to Russian influence operations.

Democrats remained unmoved by the address. Leaders in Congress on the Democratic side, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, delivered their party's initial response.

We can answer that question with some authority because last week on January 3rd, House Democrats passed their own proposal, they say, would secure our Southern border. What's in it? What would it do? Well nothing that is not being done already. The Democratic bill provides the same funding for partial fencing, border security technology, hiring more customs officers, and so forth that we already have. In other words, the Democratic border security plan is the status quo. Democrats' argument is that things work just fine right now. Instead of spending another dollar to secure our border, Democrats in Congress have, for example, just proposed spending another $12 million to investigate reparations for slavery, just to give you some proportion and a sense of their priorities. To Democrats, everything is more important than border security. And that would be fine if our current security was working. It's not. In fact, it's likely that more than 20 million people already live illegally in our country right now. That's more than 2.5 times the entire population of New York City. And the actual number may be bigger than that. We don't really know. And that's the point. It's totally out of control. The problem isn't the Border Patrol doesn't have the right technology to do the job. The problem is that politicians don't care to fix it. And if they did, they could solve the problem in an afternoon. Borders are not that complex, not like we're trying to cure pancreatic cancer here. Our best minds are stumped. Hardly! What worked for Hadrian will work for us. It works for Israel right now, and a lot of other places. Walls work. That's why people still build them. Everybody knows that. This is all a charade. And we should at least admit what's happening. What you saw last night was not two parties bickering over the best way to solve a shared problem. No. In this case, one side's problem is the other side's solution. For Democrats, a porous border is a good thing, unalloyed, good thing. It means more low-wage workers for their donors. That's deeply appreciated. It means more compliant voters for them to replace the millions of actual Americans they have alienated. And then, there's the emotional payoff of the whole thing. Democrats feel good about letting in poor people from around the world. These are people who don't make a lot of complicated demands about healthcare or dental or unfunded pensions or what their kids should be doing for a living. They're not whiny, like Americans. They're not living reminders of how politicians have failed to fulfill their promises. No, they're just grateful to be here. They're immigrants. Democrats love people like that. In fact, they've come to love them much more than they love you. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez said that out loud just last night."

So before I was even Chief of the Border Patrol, I served in the FBI for two decades. One of my assignments is I led the El Paso office. From my office, right on the border, I could see Juarez, every single day, Tucker. We worked with the DEA and all components of DHS, and we worked human trafficking cases, we worked drug cases, and we worked - and gang cases, all impacting the Southern border. And then as Chief, every single day, Tucker, I was briefed, every single day about the men and women who are risking their lives every day, and they're apprehending murderers, rapists, pedophiles, other violent offenders, and gang members. That's not manufactured. That is real. And that's a fact and it's still happening today. And I would also say one last point is a 127 Border Patrol agents have died. They didn't die playing Monopoly. They died defending, being the frontline defenders of our borders, trying to apprehend that 17,000 people, that bad people that Secretary Nielsen mentioned. I wonder if you ask their families if this is a manufactured crisis."

For example, in the speech last night, the President spoke of a crisis at the border. A number of the fact - fact-checks that were critical of the speech disputed the fact that there was a crisis at the border. Let's start with this, Tucker, whether there's a crisis at the border or not is not a matter of fact. It is a matter of opinion."

And in some instances, people - I saw facts checked as being a - a problem that were in - that were true. For example, there was a statistic, 266,000 people arrested who had come across the border, and the Washington Post announced that - that that was a true statistic, but it was misleading. Well, there again we are. Mis - what's something - whether something is misleading or not is not a simple matter of fact. It is a matter of opinion. But the - the - the impassion, the ambition of journalists today to get in on the opinion game is so strong that they're coming in through all the doors, including the fact-check door. And--"

The President wasn't actually saying that they commit more crimes than anybody else. He's saying they commit a lot of crimes, and they do. And I guess the first one in many instances is the mere - the fact that they arrived here illegally, so that - I mean that - that - that doesn't seem to me to be an effective fact-check, no matter how you look at it. And - and what's striking about this is when you hear this repeated over and over again, the whole - that whole montage you did that people saying, manufactured crisis, echoed by their friends in the media. The Washington Post itself, which is leading the fact-check charge, I think, it's fair to say, had a story the other day at some length by a couple of these reporters who went down to the border, and came back and reported that there was yes, a crisis at the border. And it explained that numbers that say that the number of border crossings or whatever are down, doesn't get at the point because it's about the composition of the people who are coming now--"

You've got one from Neontaster right there, as you see, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer's faces superimposed on the American Gothic painting, hilarious there, and that's also what Brian Williams was referencing as well. So, another one, this is from George P. Bush saying \"We are not mad, we are just disappointed.\" This looks like, Tucker, your parents, you're in high school where you come home late past curfew, they're mad at you.

      "utterance": "Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia and various other related and unrelated topics feels like it's been going on for about a generation now, maybe multiple generations. But at some point, it will end, all things end. Obviously, we don't know what Mueller's findings will be. We do know there are an awful lot of people from the Democratic Congress to the entire news media who will use the Russia report, whatever it says, to try to force the President from office. That's inevitable. Donald Trump has an awful lot of enemies. He also has a lot of supporters. 63 million Americans voted for this President. Pretty soon, he will need every one of those people to stand up for him, and not just him, personally, but for democracy itself, the principle that we choose and remove our leaders by voting, not through bureaucratic coups. That moment is coming. Will the President get the support he needs to stay in office? Well, so far, Trump's voters have been remarkably loyal to him. But loyalty is a two-way street. It must be requited. You stick by the people who stick by you. Has the President stuck by his supporters? Well, in some ways, he has. But if you voted for Trump, take a step back. How's your life two years later? Are you freer now to say what you think than you were on Election Day 2016? Are you bolder and more confident in your beliefs? Or are you more afraid? It's a question James Damore might ask. The company that Damore once worked for, Google, often boasts about its commitment to the free exchange of ideas. So, Damore dared to exchange his ideas with others. He never threatened or demeaned anyone. Google just didn't like what he said. So, they fired him and they trashed his reputation so thoroughly he couldn't find a job. Something very like that happened to the tech entrepreneur, Palmer Luckey. Luckey was thrown off the board of Facebook solely because he supported Donald Trump for President. And then, how about Alex Jones? You may not like Jones. You may despise him. But you should know that he was systematically crushed by the big tech companies just for saying things they disliked. He can't even use PayPal anymore, and he's not the only one, hardly. Others have been punished not for what they say but simply for refusing to read from pre-approved scripts. Virginia public school teacher, Peter Vlaming lost his job because he resisted using pronouns he believed to be inaccurate. Vlaming didn't criticize or mis-gender anyone. He simply avoided using pronouns entirely and addressed a student by name, instead. That wasn't good enough. Vlaming was fired for the crime of having an opinion that most of the country shares. Those things happen, and they're just a few of the best-known examples. Imagine all those that don't make the news. How many Americans have been fired or denied work because of their political beliefs over the last two years? Who's protecting these people? In the business world, virtually every major company seems to have lurched Left since Trump's election. Our corporate leaders are now openly determined to award this country's spoils on the basis of skin color rather than merit. They say that out loud. This is unfair and it's deeply divisive. It makes Americans hate each other. It's also, as a factual matter, illegal. Corporations are not allowed to practice racial discrimination, neither are universities. There's an entire division of the Justice Department that exists to enforce our laws against racism. Have they noticed what's happening? Of course, they have. They just don't care. Maybe they should find other jobs. There are still lawyers in this country who care about civil rights, and the Administration should hire them and set them to work. And while they're at it, they ought to defend our constitutionally-guaranteed religious freedoms as well. Traditional Christian beliefs are not a crime. Discriminating against them is. Corporate America ought to be reminded of that. Beliefs that were considered conventionally conservative just five years ago are now routinely described as terrorism. Meanwhile, actual terror, committed by the Left, seems to go unpunished. In 2017, to name just one example, a Left-wing college professor called Eric Clanton smashed strangers in the head with a bike lock. Why? Because he believed they disagreed with his politics. Clanton was charged with a felony. But then the charges were dropped. He spent no time in jail. How did that happen? That same year, a Left-wing mob in North Carolina destroyed a public statue they didn't like, purely because they felt like it. The whole thing was caught on video. Somehow, nobody was punished. At Evergreen College in Washington State, a Left-wing mob ordered Professor Bret Weinstein to leave campus for having the wrong skin color. When he refused, the mob rioted. Weinstein was forced to hold classes in a public park. Police told him he wasn't safe on campus. Eventually, Weinstein resigned from his job. He felt he had no choice. The people who threatened Weinstein were never punished. In other words, they won, violence won. This is all happening right now. Imagine how Barack Obama would have responded if it had happened to his voters while he was President. Let's say it's 2010. Obamacare has just passed, and public sentiment against the Administration is intense, people are angry. Suddenly it has become, in effect, a crime to support Barack Obama in public. You can be fired for admitting you voted for him. You can be punched in the face for wearing a hat with Obama's name on it. You think Obama would have done something about that? Hell, yes. These are his voters. He's the President of the United States. His job is to protect them, and all Americans who want to speak freely. You would never get away with threatening an Obama voter for supporting Obama. There is no chance, not for a second. The FBI would be in your living room before you got home, and good for the FBI. If our government exists to do anything, it's to preserve the free society that is our birthright. That society is crumbling. This country is becoming less free. The Administration should fight back against that. They have the power. Laws on the books already protects an individual's right to support any political candidate he chooses. Enforce those laws. Should Americans need the approval of some tech billionaire in order to exercise their freedom of speech online? We won't know for sure until the Administration pushes back against digital censorship. Facebook and Google and Twitter likely would respond with legal challenges. Let them. Fighting for speech is always the right fight. It's also good politics. The President is up for re-election in two years, and he'll be judged on what he has accomplished in office. Will he get a Border wall or an infrastructure plan? Who knows? The Congress doesn't seem anxious to cooperate on anything. One thing the President can do is exercise his Executive powers to defend the Bill of Rights, and the dignity of all Americans, no matter what they think. Let's say the wall is never built. On the other hand, in November of 2020, the President can sincerely say to the country that he has fought as hard as he could to make certain that everyone in America is treated equally under the law, regardless of sex or skin color or political beliefs. No, he'll say, you didn't get new roads or airports, you didn't live to see Planned Parenthood defunded. Congress blocked all that. But the good news is you're no longer afraid. You don't have to whisper anymore when you say what you really think. You don't live in fear that some Corporate Sensitivity Officer will destroy your career for thinking the wrong thing. You can say what you really believe in public. You're an American citizen. That is your right. If Donald Trump can credibly say all that two years from now, it's still possible he won't win. But he'll be a genuinely great president. Well, for decades, the Republican Party has been proud to call itself the party of free markets, and good for them. There's nothing wrong with markets, of course. We're for them. But there is something much more important than any economic system, and that is the health of people. When corporate interests, and the interests of American families conflict, you've got to side with American families. It seems like an obvious one. We made it last week. We'll continue to make it. One person who's been saying this for a long time is J. D. Vance. He's the Author of Hillbilly Elegy, and he joins us tonight. J. D. Vance, thanks very much for coming on."

And to your point about corporate interests, sometimes the corporate interests who are responding to market incentives, who are acting just as you might expect a company to act, is actively going to harm the American social fabric.

And the question is what do we do to protect the promise of the free market to ensure that it continues to be a tool to create prosperity, so that we can have a healthy community, have a healthy society, or do we continue to ignore the fact that a lot of people in America are hurting right now? And when people hurt, they eventually go to the ballot box, and eventually, sometimes, people do things even worse than voting for politicians and policies that you don't like. That's the lesson of history. And the question is do we heed the lesson of history? Do we build a modern conservative coalition that supports working and middle-class families? It's really, to me, the only way out of this. It's not just about avoiding the worst consequences of history. It's also about building a society, I think, that's better even than the one we inherited, which is what our entire goal should be, as people who care about public policy and just about the - the nation."

According to Google, half of all the country's K through 12 students use Google Apps to learn. Google has donated a 100 million in devices to schools, which, of course, has the welcome side effect of acclimating and addicting children to Apple products when they are most impressionable. Did Phil Morris pass out Marlboros to kids? I don't know. We'll check. Microsoft has, similarly, donated more than a billion dollars in discounted Windows products to schools. No one's really noticed this. Michelle Malkin has though. She's a syndicated columnist, author, and blogger, and she joins us tonight.

For example, American Engagement Technologies or AET, founded by former Obama Administration official, Mikey Dickerson, bought ads for two Facebook pages, The Daily Real and Today's Nation, both encouraging Republican voters to stay home because the election was inconsequential, posting ads like this, \"Everyone else hearing more recent stories that the Blue Wave is a myth, and the Republicans are going to win and upset mainstream pollsters once again,\" or this ad, quoting again, \"We told Conservatives that we would defend their values and they believed us!\" And still another ad saying, quote, \"Some Trump supporters see midterm losses for Congressional Republicans as a wake-up call to get serious on the wall.\" Now, for context, billionaire, Reid Hoffman, was an early investor in Facebook and acknowledged that he founded AET, after that group came under fire for allegedly running misinformation ads in the 2017 Alabama Special Election, intended to falsely link GOP Senatorial Candidate, Roy Moore, to Russian influence operations.
