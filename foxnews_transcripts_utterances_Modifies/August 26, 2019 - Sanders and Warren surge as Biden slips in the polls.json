      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Sure. And as we've seen with North Korea, as we have seen multiple instances, Trump is not -- he is not about telling -- he does not want to be the policeman to the world. He is against aggressive intervention. I'm sure he would like to engage in Iran in the kind of way that, by the way, I'm sure it makes John Bolton's mustache curl a little bit. But I think the president is very open to this kind of stuff, and he's demonstrated not just with Kim Jong-un, but around the globe, he'll do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Leslie, there is a difference in when these world leaders stand next to the president and speak to the press, and the coverage of it prior to that, a big difference. Macron pretty much said that's not true, here's the deal, I told him all the way along."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Right. I don't know when France has become an enemy. Quite frankly, they are a strong ally. And even though we are very different government, very different leaders with very different styles, there is a certain level of diplomacy and respect for the office of the presidency and whoever has held that offense historically because they are elected by the people. When it comes to Iran, quite frankly, this is an area where I would like Trump to sit down. I don't like the fact that he has pooh-poohed Macron in the past and certainly President Obama in the past. He's even talked about some kind of short-term loans for Iran to try and help them out during this time. I think what we've seen, very similar with North Korea, is that just sanctions and just threats to work. Sometimes you have to sit down, you have to get into a room, and you say what do you want, this is what we want, how can we meet halfway?"

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "That's how he talks about his style of making deals. In both China and Iran, Lanhee, the U.S. is putting some serious pressure on both of those countries, and Iran is really feeling it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHEN",
      "utterance": "Iran is feeling in particular. If Iran were to come to a table, it would be under a very different set of terms than what was the previous negotiation, the previous administration. That I think is what the president has wanted. The question is, are they actually going to come to the table, are they actually going to have a legitimate conversation? Is this just playacting by the Iranians? There's no question they're feeling a tremendous amount of internal pressure. In a similar way China is feeling that internal pressure as well. Are they going to come to the table, is this going to be a genuine negotiation? Those are open questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "But is their pressure on Europe to get out of the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHEN",
      "utterance": "I think so. I think if this deal is going to be on the U.S.'s terms, they've got to come on the U.S.'s terms, not on the previous version of this in the JCPOA.
