So, the media perpetuates the cycle. Right? If there is riot, they will call them mostly peaceful which then puts the cops on notice, right, that you better not arm these peaceful protesters holding their Molotov cocktails. And they will deliberately like those clowns ignore the facts of the case, bear the truth about Jacob Blake, the truth about the man that Rittenhouse or the non-men that Rittenhouse killed in order to make sure that there is, there is trouble later. I'm not rooting for anything but justice. So, I will live with whatever outcome there is. But the media plays as a lower bar for the activist class. They believe that their behavior can include any kind of violence no matter what. I said this, and I said this yesterday to the audible gasps a month ago when I talked about the Chauvin verdict that I was relieved that Chauvin was found guilty because my neighborhood would not be torched.

I think we are at a stage where every juror that takes part in a trial will have to be placed in witness relocation after the trial because the media in a fraud (Ph) and activist class puts them in danger because they see violence as an appropriate response if the jury doesn't come back with the decision that they want. So, the media perpetuates the cycle. Right? If there is riot, they will call them mostly peaceful which then puts the cops on notice, right, that you better not arm these peaceful protesters holding their Molotov cocktails. And they will deliberately like those clowns ignore the facts of the case, bear the truth about Jacob Blake, the truth about the man that Rittenhouse or the non-men that Rittenhouse killed in order to make sure that there is, there is trouble later. I'm not rooting for anything but justice. So, I will live with whatever outcome there is. But the media plays as a lower bar for the activist class. They believe that their behavior can include any kind of violence no matter what. I said this, and I said this yesterday to the audible gasps a month ago when I talked about the Chauvin verdict that I was relieved that Chauvin was found guilty because my neighborhood would not be torched. There was a commentary on this and how the justice system is now being held hostage by threats of mayhem because the media will allow the activist to riot for that reason."

But I also think that the trial being on television helped a lot of people understand what was actually happening that night. Why did Kyle Rittenhouse feel threatened? Was it self-defense?

I think that on the basis of the defense moving for mistrial without prejudice, which means the state would have a do-over, that doesn't seem that they have a lot of confidence in their case for the defense to do that. Why would they want a mistrial without prejudice, a do-over if they thought they were winning right now? So, you know, I'm starting to feel a little bad on the fact that the deliberations are now being prolonged. But remember when I was starting in the news business decades ago, there was a guy and the Warner Wolf was the sports guy who said \"let's go to the videotape.\" Nowadays, because of body cams on cops and surveillance cameras everywhere and drones with cameras, people, the jurors are discounting the physical testimony and are asking to be their own witnesses by looking at the videotape themselves and making a determination what they see.

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, Jesse, there's the issue too, is that the prosecution got berated by the judge multiple times during the trial for trying to introduce evidence that are already been thrown out and now we are learning that they didn't actually give the defense the proper evidence."
