But look, the President did the right thing to take the meeting with one of the most of powerful international celebrities. She has a legitimate cause, not just prison reform, but she has been fighting for the rightful pardon of Alice Marie Johnson, and I think -- look, CNN and Jim Acosta, they can't possibly wrap their head around the fact that a leftist type celebrity can actually interface with a Republican President, so they are trying everything they possibly can to delegitimize it."

He got a promotion earlier this year, right, and he had the audacity to go on Jimmy Kimmel just a couple of weeks ago and claimed that he was just as tough on President Obama than he was on President Trump. Now, here is the real punch line, when you look at ratings from last May, May of 2017 to May of 2018, CNN has lost one-quarter of its viewers, 25% gone. And you can't say it's been a slow news cycle over the last year. It's been the best news cycle ever up here in this industry, 25% in total viewers, 35% on what's called the demo, that's 25 to 54 year olds that advertisers cover most, more than a third gone.

He has traded his well-done steaks that he usually drowns in ketchup with dover sole and those cheeseburger he eats after he plays a round golf now only come with a bottom bun and no longer the top half of the bun.

There were contacts going on by people identified as informers and informants, people who provided information began much, much earlier than July 31st. That's the first part. The second part is as the investigation was just starting to ramp up, there are internal FBI documents showing FBI agents talking about the White House trying to take over the investigation."

The President slamming that investigation and its soaring costs, tweeting, \"AP has just reported that the Russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over $17 million. And going up fast. No collusion except by the Democrats.\" Joining me now, former US Attorney Joe diGenova, and Philippe Reines. Joe, I now question this entire investigation because what they said was the beginning of the investigation, this Papadopoulos comment to this Australian diplomat about -- he said he had dirt -- doesn't add up because now, we know the FBI was running spies at the campaign months beforehand. What does that mean to you?"

      "speaker": "JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER US ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think there is any doubt that to a reasonable United States Attorney, what you have here is an out of control CIA and FBI doing counter-intelligence investigations against American citizens in the united states and abroad without a proper predicate and without authority in an effort to start another investigation so that they can do damage to the Presidential candidate of the other party. I don't think there is any doubt based on the available public evidence that John Brennan, James Clapper, James Comey and others worked together to try to start a counter-intelligence investigation against the Trump campaign, and that in the end, in order to get that done, they fabricated information, fed it to people overseas who were American citizens who then mouthed information about that which was picked up by the FBI and used in FISA warrants. So, when all is said and done, what we have here is let's have a nice Federal grand jury run by a competent person, either a senior Justice Department official, a US attorney or a special counsel and let's get Brennan, Clapper, Comey, and all these folks in front of a grand jury so they can explain themselves. And I am not calling for anybody to be indicted. I just want truthful testimony under oath in front of a grand jury, and if indictments result, fine. If they don't, then we'll get an explanation about what happened here."

But in terms of your question, I think there is a problem here. We all forget where this started. This starts with Russia trying to screw around with us. What happened from there is American intelligence, counter- intelligence and law enforcement trying to stop them. The so-called spy gate is flipped on its head. The spying was done by Russia on America, what the FBI tried doing is preventing it. I am not exactly sure why the President and the White House have internalized this as some kind of hunt."

Number two, have any Russians been indicted for collusion? They were indicted for calling Hillary Clinton names on Facebook and dressing up with a little Hillary for prison costume and running around Florida at a rally. These are not high-level Russian spies colluding with the Trump campaign, Joe. After two years, wouldn't there actually be evidence of Russians colluding if that was the object?

Many of the Obama administration officials have bemoaned the fact that President Obama didn't do enough to stop the Russians from meddling in the campaign. But when you look the FBI and see what they did and what they now say they were trying to do as James Clapper said, \"We were only trying to help the Trump campaign.\" That's not what you do. You don't start a counter-intelligence investigation against an American Presidential candidate. What you do is, you go to that candidate's campaign and the candidate, and the FBI and you say, Mr. Candidate, we think the Russians are trying to influence your campaign. We are giving you a defensive briefing. We would like to you take defensive measures. Prophylactic measures against the Russians. But the Bureau didn't do that. That's not what they were doing.

They do not comport with traditional law enforcement and trade craft of spy. What they comport with is an effort to subvert the campaign of the opposing candidate. And let me just say, it would be one thing if this were just sort of a simple story, but it's not because when you go back to July 5, 2016, and James Comey's famous news conference where he accuses Hillary Clinton of a series of crimes, and then exonerates her, whatever the Russians were trying to do, they couldn't have done anything worse than what James Comey did on that day.

And I must say, there is absolutely irrefutable evidence now that that's exactly what they were doing. And I am perfectly happy by the way, to have a grand jury look at it and make all the decisions necessary about whether or any of that was illegal. And I'll tell you, I just think right now, watching the fight between McCabe and Comey about who lied about what during all of this tells you exactly what kind of leadership we had at the FBI and the Department of Justice in the Obama administration -- a disgraceful bunch of dirty cops."
