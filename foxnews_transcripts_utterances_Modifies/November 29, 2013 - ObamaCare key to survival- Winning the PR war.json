Just a few minutes ago you heard from doctor who raised a lot of red flags, including a 90-day grace period for companies to pay doctors. Can you imagine your mortgage company giving you 90 days to pay? People wouldn't pay. \"The Washington Examiner's\" Susan Ferrechio joins us now. I'm still reeling from that, Susan. This is unbelievable. Why are we hearing this from the White House? If doctors feel they are not going to be paid in a timely manner, they are not going to want to work in this system.",

We are at the point where everybody is trying to sign up for this thing and having a hard time because the website as have you been saying isn't up and running, isn't functioning yet. Secondly you have a lot of people who are shying away from signing up for coverage because the premiums are really high. The deductibles are high. It's not gotten off the ground yet.  But, when it does, we are going to start running into the problems that you have been talking about on the show, particularly the doctor reimbursement issue, availability as well, so all of these things sort of a rolling system of problems associated with the health care law.
