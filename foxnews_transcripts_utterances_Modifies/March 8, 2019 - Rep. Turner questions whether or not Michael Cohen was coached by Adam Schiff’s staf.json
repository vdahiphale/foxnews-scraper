And what is ahead for your money?  Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne in for Neil Cavuto. This is \"Your World.\"  Those weaker-than-expected jobs numbers raising new concern about the economy, just as the bull market for the Dow and the S&P 500 turns 10 tomorrow. So, what does it mean for your money, the 2020 election? We are going to get to in a moment.  But, first, Fox team coverage with Susan Li with the action and John Roberts at the White House with the president's reaction, what he likes about today's report. But we begin with Susan.

What a decade it's been.  Take a look at the performance of all the stock markets here in the U.S., the S&P and the Dow both up some 300 percent over those 10 years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq seeing gains of over 400 percent, thanks to the emergence of tech giants like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon during that period.   And it's not surprising that when we take a look at the best performing stocks over that 10-year period, Apple is at the top of the tree, up some 1300 percent. A surprising one in second place, Boeing, the plane maker, up some 1200 percent. UnitedHealth and Visa rounding out the top four. Now, a bull market is defined as a sustained period of gains over 20 percent without a drop of 20 percent. We were very close to reaching those levels at the end of 2018. Close. Thank goodness we didn't get there. But today's jobs number, given that we saw a big miss, only 20,000 jobs in the month of February, 180,000 expected, this has investors concerned because bull markets usually don't last 10 years. We are here in the final stages, according to a lot of investors, and these global growth concerns, whether it's slowing in China, Europe, people are concerned that it will come here to the U.S. at some point and end this bull market run that we're still in the middle of -- Charles.",

So, I give all the credit to President Trump, deregulatory policy, tax policy. And, unfortunately, I think Obama had higher wealth inequality and not real good job growth. So, GDP numbers were awful.

It feels a little bit more self-sustaining. It feels a little more energetic vs., say, what it was in the previous administration. So, you're seeing companies raise wages, minimum wage and things like that, because of the fact that they're confident about the regulatory environment going forward and they're confident about what's happening in D.C. now going forward.

And I would say actually especially true in the current environment in 2019. We do have a slowing economy taking place in China. They were down some 30 percent last year -- I would say probably the best performing stock market so far in 2019, but that all hinges on getting a U.S.-China trade deal.  Last night, we saw exports really falling off a cliff, down some 20 percent in a month. And don't forget, that is the bread and butter of the Chinese economy. That's what oils it. And if that's going down at this point, you can imagine that they are looking at a very sharp downturn and they want to sign a deal as soon as possible. So maybe the U.S. and the Trump administration has the upper hand when it comes to signing possibly a trade truce.",

And I think Powell has already telegraphed it and I suspect we are going to see him lower rates during 2019, probably helps markets and, keep fingers crossed, keeps our economy in good stead. And, again, let me repeat something. I give all the credit to Trump on not only lowering the taxes, but lowering the regulatory front. That was huge.

We were expecting that there was going to be a meeting Mar-a-Lago at the end of this month between President Trump and Xi Jinping, the president of China. It now looks like that's not going to happen. FOX News has learned that the Chinese had time pencilled in, blocked out for Xi Jinping to come to Mar-a-Lago at the end of March. They have removed that time from his calendar. And I'm told there is no plan on the American side for a meeting in March now. Now, what President Trump has said, getting a trade deal with China may come down to a face-to-face meeting between he and Xi. The Chinese now want a deal in place before Xi comes to the United States. One of the reasons why, China watched what happened in Hanoi last week, when President Trump walked away from Kim Jong-un, and there is no chance that the Chinese will let Xi come to the United States and have that happen if they can't reach a final deal.  This morning, the president didn't seem to be aware that China was reconsidering the summit. Listen here.",

That means that they would have spent three hours behind closed doors working with Cohen preparing him for that testimony and questioning for every hour that we got to see on TV. Now, we thought this was a congressional hearing, how they normally are, people asking questions, contemporaneously getting answers. Now, they say this is a public investigation, but it sounds like public and professional orchestration. These types of contacts are very, very unusual.

The president and first lady started with the helicopter tour getting a bird's-eye view of just the scope of the massive amounts of damage here in Lee County, Alabama. They then landed and took a walking tour of one of the neighborhoods that suffered some of the worst devastation. There, they met with families who lost loved ones in Sunday's tornado. They include the family of Sheila Creech and Marshall Lynn Grimes, a couple that died in the storm. Mr. Grimes' 10-year-old daughter remains hospitalized. In fact, she wasn't well enough to go to the parents' funeral. And the daughter's friend, 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who was over for a visit at the time died in the storm. Family and friends held a funeral service for Taylor this morning. After touring the devastation, President Trump visited a church that is serving as a staging area for relief efforts. There, he met with volunteers and first-responders and thanked them for all their hard work during the hours and days following the tornado. He also praised Alabama Governor Kay Ivey for her handling of the disaster. Now let's go to a live shot that we have from the town of Smiths Station. That's about 20 miles away from where I'm standing. You can see recovery efforts are well under way. The president's visit is receiving praise even from the other side of the aisle. Alabama Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, says such visits have a way of connecting Washington politicians with communities in need on a much more intimate and enduring level. And now coming back to our live location here in Beauregard, Alabama, look at all of this debris on the ground and up in the trees. That's a concern as we go into the weekend, because, Charles, more severe weather is forecast for Alabama. The worst storms are expected to pass to the north of us. But with all this debris on the ground, even moderate winds could scatter it. And the concern is that will slow down some of the recovery efforts -- Charles, back to you.",

What a decade it's been. Take a look at the performance of all the stock markets here in the U.S., the S&P and the Dow both up some 300 percent over those 10 years. The tech-heavy Nasdaq seeing gains of over 400 percent, thanks to the emergence of tech giants like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon during that period. And it's not surprising that when we take a look at the best performing stocks over that 10-year period, Apple is at the top of the tree, up some 1300 percent. A surprising one in second place, Boeing, the plane maker, up some 1200 percent. UnitedHealth and Visa rounding out the top four. Now, a bull market is defined as a sustained period of gains over 20 percent without a drop of 20 percent. We were very close to reaching those levels at the end of 2018. Close. Thank goodness we didn't get there. But today's jobs number, given that we saw a big miss, only 20,000 jobs in the month of February, 180,000 expected, this has investors concerned because bull markets usually don't last 10 years. We are here in the final stages, according to a lot of investors, and these global growth concerns, whether it's slowing in China, Europe, people are concerned that it will come here to the U.S. at some point and end this bull market run that we're still in the middle of -- Charles."

His last year in office, it was 1.6 percent and then Trump came in, in 2017 and took it to 2.3 percent. And that's what his economists had projected. So, I give all the credit to President Trump, deregulatory policy, tax policy. And, unfortunately, I think Obama had higher wealth inequality and not real good job growth. So, GDP numbers were awful. So, no, it's unusual to have 10 years. This is the longest ever. And I do think the global slowdown is making investors nervous and it's interesting. We're in a really interesting point."

And you're seeing companies, too. You know, you guys talked about in kind of the previous comments about a little bit of different feel to the economy now, isn't it? It feels a little bit more self-sustaining. It feels a little more energetic vs., say, what it was in the previous administration. So, you're seeing companies raise wages, minimum wage and things like that, because of the fact that they're confident about the regulatory environment going forward and they're confident about what's happening in D.C. now going forward. So, that's another reason that companies, which is a good thing, are going to make their own decisions. They're going to breathe and live on their own and create job growth and create economic growth. And that, too, is going to keep this economy going in the coming years."

And I would say actually especially true in the current environment in 2019. We do have a slowing economy taking place in China. They were down some 30 percent last year -- I would say probably the best performing stock market so far in 2019, but that all hinges on getting a U.S.-China trade deal. Last night, we saw exports really falling off a cliff, down some 20 percent in a month. And don't forget, that is the bread and butter of the Chinese economy. That's what oils it. And if that's going down at this point, you can imagine that they are looking at a very sharp downturn and they want to sign a deal as soon as possible. So maybe the U.S. and the Trump administration has the upper hand when it comes to signing possibly a trade truce."

I don't -- I think China may be even in a recession. But we're not immune. I think we will slow down also. And I think Powell has already telegraphed it and I suspect we are going to see him lower rates during 2019, probably helps markets and, keep fingers crossed, keeps our economy in good stead. And, again, let me repeat something. I give all the credit to Trump on not only lowering the taxes, but lowering the regulatory front. That was huge. Obama for eight years was the king of regulations and that needed to be undone. So good on this president."

And that helped kind of unleash that next level of growth that I think everybody kind of is waiting for here, even trade deal or not. So I think that's really good. And I like Susan's point, too, about kind of the cleanest dirty shirt in the basket here. And I will throw another one to her. You know, the U.S. is still kind of like the strongest guy or girl at the beach. And so that's another reason why if you're an investor here and you see pullbacks like we have seen in the S&P 500 this year alone on, say, controversial or maybe good or bad economic data, that's why I would take that as an opportunity to get in and put some money to work."

Now you it's pulled back and kind of normalized. We expect -- the underlying fundamentals are the best in the world.

We were expecting that there was going to be a meeting Mar-a-Lago at the end of this month between President Trump and Xi Jinping, the president of China. It now looks like that's not going to happen. FOX News has learned that the Chinese had time pencilled in, blocked out for Xi Jinping to come to Mar-a-Lago at the end of March. They have removed that time from his calendar. And I'm told there is no plan on the American side for a meeting in March now. Now, what President Trump has said, getting a trade deal with China may come down to a face-to-face meeting between he and Xi. The Chinese now want a deal in place before Xi comes to the United States. One of the reasons why, China watched what happened in Hanoi last week, when President Trump walked away from Kim Jong-un, and there is no chance that the Chinese will let Xi come to the United States and have that happen if they can't reach a final deal. This morning, the president didn't seem to be aware that China was reconsidering the summit. Listen here."

Let's get reaction from The Hill's editor in chief, Bob Cusack, and The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Melchior. Bob, let me start with you. We have had an amazing run in household wealth, but that fourth quarter obviously impacted with that massive soon in the stock market and even some softness in housing. Obviously, those aren't the numbers that the president wants to go into in 2020. But just how important are they?"

And that's something the Democrats are going to have to grapple with. And, of course, it's a long way, Charles, before 2020. We don't know what's going to happen with China. And I think that's -- that China deal, if it happens, will greatly impact the market. But, right now, it is the one thing that Trump is going to repeatedly mention, of course, going after Democrats for investigations, but the economy being something that he improved."

We haven't seen anything like this in well over a decade. Six of those seven months, wages for blue-collar workers growing faster than their supervisors. Those are jobs in the heartland. Those are jobs that President Trump promised."

And, you know, there's also a Fed paper that just came out today, and it's looking at the impact of such a tight labor market, and it's really showing that when the economy is booming, like it is right now, that no one is left behind. So the theory here is that female workers, people of color, workers with a lack of skills or a lack of education, in a labor market this tight, businesses are going to give opportunities to all of them. They're competing for workers. So you're seeing wages go up, more opportunity. So I think this is really inclusive growth. And Democrats are playing up this identity politics game. I think this in two ways -- I mean, it not only affects their narrative on the economics, but also some of the identity politics that they're playing up. It's hard to say that only the 1 percent is benefiting, when it's been bottom up."

To give you some perspective, he testified in front of the government reform committee for seven hours. Let's say the Democrats were four hours of that questioning and answering. That means that they would have spent three hours behind closed doors working with Cohen preparing him for that testimony and questioning for every hour that we got to see on TV. Now, we thought this was a congressional hearing, how they normally are, people asking questions, contemporaneously getting answers. Now, they say this is a public investigation, but it sounds like public and professional orchestration. These types of contacts are very, very unusual.

I think that the public deserves answers as to what happened during these sessions, what was discussed?

They knew the answers he was going to give before they asked the questions, and that's what -- not what the American public expects. They don't expect guiding and coaching of a witness.

At five hours, you start to get, what are you talking about? But now we're hearing this is over 10 hours. Over 10 hours, clearly, this is trying to affect testimony. This is where coaching occurs.

That's a little dark secret about penalizing somebody for going to trial. Had Paul Manafort pled guilty, everybody would have said, oh, it's eight to nine years, on the same facts, OK? A little dark secret. So, the point is I knew for sure that the judge wasn't going to give him 20 years. That was..."

The other 80 percent was six to nine years, seven to 10 years. That's what all my friends, all the experts were telling me. And I agreed with that. Now, the point is, though, this is a little bit of a head-fake, because next Wednesday, Judge Jackson in the District of Columbia sentences him. The sentence she imposed by law is consecutive, unless she determines that that she wants to make it concurrent. I'm still trying to handicap -- I'm not there yet -- what I think she's going to do.

      "utterance": "Hi, Charles. The president and first lady started with the helicopter tour getting a bird's-eye view of just the scope of the massive amounts of damage here in Lee County, Alabama. They then landed and took a walking tour of one of the neighborhoods that suffered some of the worst devastation. There, they met with families who lost loved ones in Sunday's tornado. They include the family of Sheila Creech and Marshall Lynn Grimes, a couple that died in the storm. Mr. Grimes' 10-year-old daughter remains hospitalized. In fact, she wasn't well enough to go to the parents' funeral. And the daughter's friend, 10-year-old Taylor Thornton, who was over for a visit at the time died in the storm. Family and friends held a funeral service for Taylor this morning. After touring the devastation, President Trump visited a church that is serving as a staging area for relief efforts. There, he met with volunteers and first-responders and thanked them for all their hard work during the hours and days following the tornado. He also praised Alabama Governor Kay Ivey for her handling of the disaster. Now let's go to a live shot that we have from the town of Smiths Station. That's about 20 miles away from where I'm standing. You can see recovery efforts are well under way. The president's visit is receiving praise even from the other side of the aisle. Alabama Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, says such visits have a way of connecting Washington politicians with communities in need on a much more intimate and enduring level. And now coming back to our live location here in Beauregard, Alabama, look at all of this debris on the ground and up in the trees. That's a concern as we go into the weekend, because, Charles, more severe weather is forecast for Alabama. The worst storms are expected to pass to the north of us. But with all this debris on the ground, even moderate winds could scatter it. And the concern is that will slow down some of the recovery efforts -- Charles, back to you."

And, of course, because of the density of the population here or in Auburn would really have been -- it's bad enough as it is with 23 lives lost. But it would have been really a terrible, terrible thing had it moved several miles north. But, you know, the cleanup continues. We were very grateful to have the president and first lady with us today.

The original resolution condemned anti- Semitism, and it actually had a little bit about the history of anti- Semitism and why it is such a problem. Well, they totally watered it down. As James Clyburn of South Carolina said, we need to have an anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, all that stuff. It's mind-boggling.

And the Democrats -- at first Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer, the Democratic leadership in the House, had a statement when Omar first made some comments. They have wimped out since then.

Look, these companies only have two things in common. The first is that they have been successful. And the second is that they sell things over the Internet. That doesn't mean that the government should take their regulatory chain saw and arbitrarily decide, if you get to be a certain size, that must be bad, and so we're going to cut you in half.
