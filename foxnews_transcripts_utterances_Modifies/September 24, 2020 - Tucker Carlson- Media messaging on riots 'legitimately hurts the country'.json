      "sentences": "You'll get live images from Louisville, Kentucky where there was violence rioting into the night. We're monitoring the situation there tonight. And in Jacksonville, Florida, we're keeping an eye on the Trump rally in progress. Of course, we'll break in with any news that develops and it may.  There's a lot going on.  In the meantime, though. Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's hard to think clearly when things are on fire. That's a basic rule of life, that maybe why looking back on it, we've seen so much arson recently.  If you wanted to keep the public from thinking clearly about what you plan to do to their country, you might riot and no one would notice that you're lying. They definitely have been lying. Every story we've been told for the past three months has been at its core, a lie, all of them from the first day.  George Floyd was executed by racist cops on the street. That's what they told us. That's what everyone believed. Yet when the autopsy became public, it showed that George Floyd had lethal levels of fentanyl in his system among other drugs. Floyd said he couldn't breathe long before police landed on him as he was in fact sitting untouched in the back of a patrol car. But the mob wasn't interested in hearing those details. They torched Minneapolis.  In Kenosha, Democrats told us that bloodthirsty cops just walked up and shot Jacob Blake as he was trying to break up a fight between two women. It was horrifying. But that's not what happened.   Police arrived there after a woman called 911 to say Blake was at her home in violation of a restraining order. That woman had previously accused Blake of sexual assault. Blake fought with the responding officers, first cops tried non-lethal force to subdue him. They Tased Blake, that didn't work. When they saw him reach for a knife, they shot him. What else were they supposed to do exactly? But Kamala Harris wasn't interested in knowing what actually happened. She declared that she was proud of Jacob Blake and then her voters burned Kenosha.   Tonight, the mob is in Louisville to protest the death of Breonna Taylor. News organizations told us that Taylor was in bed when police shot her. But she wasn't, she was in her hallway. They told us that Taylor had nothing to do with her drug dealing ex-boyfriend whom police were investigating. That's why they were there.  In fact, intercepted jailhouse communication suggest that Taylor was warehousing that man's drug money. They told us that police shot first.   That's not true. Taylor's boyfriend shot a cop first. Then they told us over and over and over again that police surprised Taylor in the middle of the night. They barged into her apartment in a so-called no-knock raid. Then yesterday the Attorney General of Kentucky exposed that as yet another lie.  The police did in fact knock on Breonna Taylor's door. They identified themselves as police. There's a witness to it. But it didn't matter. They kept lying to us. Kamala Harris issued a statement attacking no-knock raids. Amazingly, so did Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a Republican. Tim Scott should know better.  A grand jury did know better. The jurors considered all of the available evidence in the Breonna Taylor case. And yesterday, they declined to charge the officers with murder. There wasn't any evidence that a murder took place.  That is how our system is supposed to work. We don't indict the innocent. That's wrong. It's not justice. But the mob doesn't care about justice no matter what they scream. They want blood.  So with the encouragement of so many of our leaders, they unleashed violence on the City of Louisville. They set fires. They destroyed businesses, then to the surprise of no one, they opened fire on the police.   Here are scenes of it.",

It seems clear this was not a street crime. It seems clear these were attempted political assassinations. Lorenzo Johnson's social media posts don't look very different from Kamala Harris's Twitter feed, pro-BLM, outraged by the racist killing of Breonna Taylor.  Whipped into a frenzy by media generated lies, it is not surprising that people like Johnson will try to murder the police.

When two cops were shot last night in Louisville, BLM's Chapter there did not express a word of sympathy for the officers in the hospital with bullets in them. Instead, BLM Louisville called for the total abolition of law enforcement. Apparently, the plan is to take out one cop at a time.  Here's BLM last night in Louisville.",

There are legions behind them. People you don't see on camera. It takes legions. It takes money and it takes organization to stage effective riots for three and a half months.   So it's worth asking, who is funding all of this? That is a central question too few have tried to answer it. We still don't know the full answer, but we're getting a clear picture tonight.  Last night, we showed you footage of a U-Haul truck in Louisville full of rioting supplies and mobile armor. Watch the mob descend on that U-Haul within minutes of the grand jury's verdict.",

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "sentences": "When we showed you that footage last night, we suggested we had leads as to who might have rented that U-Haul. Tonight we know who did. We've determined that a woman called Holly Zoller paid for that U-Haul truck. Zoller works as a so-called bail disruptor. That's her description from an organization called The Bail Project. The Bail Project helps get suspected criminals and rioters back out onto the street as quickly as they can.  So who funds The Bail Project? It takes money to get people out of jail.  Take a look at that organization's Board of Directors and it tells you the story.  There's a first term Democratic Congresswoman on there, but other than that, you will not find a more pampered group of revolutionaries. One Board member is a woman called Lisa Gersh. She previously served as the President of Strategic Initiatives at NBC and a Managing Director at NBC Universal. She also was the CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Gersh even founded her own law firm at one point, not a starving artist.  Another Board member is a man called Michael Novogratz. He is the CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners and a former principal at Fortress Investment Group LLC, and the Fortress Macro Fund. He's a finance guy. He also serves on the Board of the Princeton Varsity Club. So what's going on here? Why are the most privileged people in our society, rich executives like Gersh and Novogratz supporting an organization that bails people out of jail who are destroying our cities and attacking our police? People like that, Board members like this live far from the scenes of riot. So why are they paying for riots? Maybe they're doing it to cover their own tracks. That's a thought. America's core problems are not racial. America's core problems are economic. A small group of people have a disproportionate amount of money. Everyone else is getting poor. For the majority of the population, the American Dream is dying.  But if you were on the right end of that equation, you wouldn't want the public to think too much about this. So maybe you'd fund racial conflict, so they wouldn't think about it. It's pretty clever. It's also completely evil.  Last night, we told you about the Hearst Corporation. That's a media company that generates more than $11 billion a year. One of Hearst properties maybe its most famous property is \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine. \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine spent most of yesterday raising money to bail out rioters in Louisville. At one point yesterday, \"Cosmo\" tweeted an image of Holly Zoller, the woman who rented the U-Haul and others along with this message. \"Support protesters who are brave enough to go out and take a stand in coming days.\"  Take a stand? \"Cosmo\" wants you to take a stand and send money to people who are taking a stand. So what does taking a stand look like? Well, they took a stand last time in Portland, Oregon. \"Cosmo\" readers did. They tried to kill police officers with Molotov cocktails. Keep in mind, this took place thousands of miles from Louisville and Breonna Taylor. Why?",

But here's one, a word from Kamala Harris might slow these people down. But Harris isn't interested in slowing them down.  There's an election to win so the mob rages on. By the way, you should know that in the name of racial justice, a BLM supporter shot a black cop in Louisville last night against racial justice.

Remember when Joe Biden announced that no true black person could vote Republican? Well, Biden's allies in the media -- and that's everyone -- went a step further. At MSNBC, they explained that black people are, quote, \"performing for white supremacy,\" if they don't tow the D.N.C.'s line. At CNN, the anchors wants you to know it's quote \"politically charged\" to criticize, quote, \"mob violence.\" Can you imagine saying something like that?  Our leaders in Congress and on television and at \"Cosmo\" have decided that law enforcement of any kind is an act of bigotry? Do they really believe that? Well, of course, they don't really believe that. That's why so many of them are surrounded by armed bodyguards. But it doesn't matter what they really believe.

They were trying to set the boards that were covering the windows or the Hall of Justice on fire. And so the Louisville, sorry, the Louisville Metro Police said that it was unlawful assembly and if they didn't disperse that they would have to be subjected to crowd control ammunitions. And so, they did leave the area, but as they were leaving the area, people were breaking off and breaking windows. They were smashing bus stops and setting even more fires as they were walking away and so that's why when they were confronted by the police, the police used two flashbangs above the crowd to try to disperse them.  And then unfortunately, right after that happened, that's when we heard the gunfire. And at that point, people did start to scatter, because at that point, we didn't know what exactly was going on.

They called him in their phrase, racially charged names, because he deviated from the D.N.C.'s line. This kind of attack is everywhere now. What should we make of it? Candace Owens has borne the brunt of attacks of this for a long time. She is the author of the book \"Blackout: How Black America Can Make its Second Escape from the Democratic Plantation.\" She joins us tonight. Candice, thanks so much for coming on. So you saw the Attorney General of Kentucky and I think I'd be honest enough to say this, even if I disagreed with him, certainly made a rational case for his position in a pretty traditionally American case, rioting is not justice, and then you see him attacked as a race traitor, what do you make of that? CANDICE OWENS, AUTHOR, \"BLACKOUT\": That's right. For me, it's absolutely infuriating to watch and you are correct in saying that I've been on the receiving end of the same sorts of attacks and here's what's so fundamentally wrong and backwards about it, is that if you actually look at what they're saying and what the deeper implications are here, it's that there is a right way, a correct way and a wrong way to be black. Meaning that you could look at me, Tucker, and say Candace Owens is black. And therefore, I can assign a bunch of characteristics and expectations upon to her based on her skin color. Ironically, Tucker, that's the very definition of racism. And it's coming from the liberals who like to say that they see racism everywhere, but they can't recognize it when it's coming out of their own mouths.  I've often said that the Democratic Party has built almost a prototype of what it means to be a black American. That prototype means a black American must vote Democrat, you must react emotionally and not rationally and not pause to think. We must be faithful and abide by cultural icons, meaning we must worship the words and the advice of King LeBron James as he is called, and Queen Beyonce. Queen Beyonce being the person, I will remind your listeners and viewers who actually wrote a letter to hurry up the Attorney General in his investigation and said that she wanted her kind of justice delivered in the Breonna Taylor case. He did the right thing by ignoring her. He did the right thing by ignoring the various pressures coming from culture and the mainstream media. And for that, you're seeing him being socially lynched and stripped of his identity, because he acted professionally and rationally. You know, this guy should be commended by both sides, and instead, he is being attacked racially by the left.",

And the evidence that people have tried to drum up in the last six months to suggest otherwise is almost embarrassingly weak. Okay, there's a there's an open label study, essentially a study with no control arm that was done on Massachusetts healthcare workers a few months ago, and it showed that after these people were told to wear masks, infection rates went down in Massachusetts. Guess what? Infection rates went down in Massachusetts, overall, too, okay. So that means nothing. There's a couple of, you know, studies -- there's a study from a Starbucks in South Korea. There's a study of a couple of a hairdressers in Missouri. It's a joke. The best evidence before this pandemic started, before March, which is when the science was not politicized suggest that masks were broadly useless in the general population. To the extent they were useful, it would be for people who are actively infected and coughing. And to the extent that that made any difference, it was probably just as a signaling mechanism to show people step away from me, I'm sick. Okay, so the evidence here is just beyond week. What's happened, Tucker, is that masks have become a talisman. Okay? Masks have become something that we use to show were serious about this, and this is a problem and lots of people are dying and we're going to do something about it and we can't do lockdowns anymore. I mean, you know even the Democratic governors have dropped lockdowns because they're so economically devastating. So they have to tell people to do something and they tell them to wear masks and the social pressure -- I do want to talk about the social pressure a little bit because I think it's very important. A few weeks ago, I was in Walmart with my son who is four. Okay, a four-year-old is essentially 0.000 risk of anything happening with coronavirus. Little kids don't spread the coronavirus. He was not wearing a mask. I don't like him to wear a mask, although he has unfortunately had to wear one now that he goes to school. And a woman came up to me and she said, your son is not wearing a mask. And I said I know. He doesn't like them. And she said I'm going to go get a police officer. And she did. There was a police officer at the Walmart. Okay, so what do I do? I don't argue with the police. I tell him, you know, I tell my son to put on a mask he puts it on. This is a sort of social pressure that we're engaged in right now and it has real consequences. There are other even more serious issues than masks coming. There are vaccines. There are test and trace and how aggressively we're going to isolate people and quarantine them. There are hundreds of thousands of college students right now at no risk being essentially forced to not leave their dorms for no reason.",

It was amusing to watch. Of course, the risks of mail-in voting are obvious. The latest example of that came today. D.O.J. announced that the F.B.I. and the Pennsylvania State Police are investigating fraud in mail-in ballots in Luzerne County. That's a place Donald Trump won by double digits four years ago. According to D.O.J., several military ballots were quote \"discarded.\" Investigators have recovered a total of nine ballots so far not surprisingly, D.O.J. says an overwhelming majority of those ballots were cast for guess who? Donald Trump. Meanwhile, in Greenfield, Wisconsin authorities announced Tuesday that three trays of mail including mail-in ballots were discovered in a ditch -- not counted -- in a ditch. We've seen other examples of this throughout the year including deliberate mail-in ballot fraud in New Jersey and in West Virginia. Just hours ago, in the State of Texas, the State Attorney General announced that a County Commissioner and several others have been arrested in an organized mail-in balloting scheme that took place during the 2018 Democratic primary. But to reporters in Washington, this is impossible to believe. For the people doing it, it is confirmation that actually, it works pretty well. Last week, judges on Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled that mail-in ballots need to be counted well after Election Day. You won't be shocked to know that five members of the body that made that decision, five out of seven people in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania are partisan Democrats. They are elected. They are politicians. Last week in the State of Michigan, a judge called Cynthia Diane Stephens issued a very similar ruling, in fact, she went farther, she mandated ballot harvesting. Ballot harvesting allows paid political operatives to collect ballots in bundles and bring them to polling places. What could go wrong? Well, fraud for one thing, in fact fraud is the whole point of it. You should know that Cynthia Diane Stephens is not much of a judge, she is a political activist. You often hear conservatives deride activist judges, but that's not an overstatement in this case. Cynthia Diane Stephens is proud to be an activist. Four years ago, she appeared at an event at the University of Michigan on equity and inclusion and she literally gave the crowd advice on how to be an effective activist, not judge, activist. It is on video if you want to find it. There's nothing partisan judges would like to destroy more in the end that a quick efficient fraud free election night. That's the goal here and make no mistake. If all the votes are counted in one night, no one will have time to issue rulings to throw out ballots they don't like. That's why judges in Pennsylvania and Michigan want poll workers to count votes four weeks after Election Day. With their rulings last week, they made that essentially inevitable. It'll be a disaster. We know that for certain. We've seen it before. During the Iowa Caucuses this past February, we still don't really know who won in Iowa today, seven months later, but to the leaders of the Democratic Party, the caucuses weren't a debacle, they were a blueprint for the presidential election where Joe Biden takes Hillary Clinton's advice and does not concede no matter what happens. All he has to do is smile and wave from his hotel room on Election Night and the lawyers will take it from there. That's the plan. Up next, F.B.I. analysts working on the Michael Flynn case were very concerned it turns out in 2016, and 2017. We'll show you what they were concerned about because we have their texts, next.",

Later, another F.B.I. employee wrote this quote, \"Trump was right. What is wrong with these people?\" The probe was so obviously corrupt that F.B.I. officials discussed getting quote \"professional liability insurance\" to protect them from the consequences of the corruption. Separately, FOX News has learned today that the primary source of the anti- Trump Steele dossier posed by BuzzFeed was under an F.B.I. investigation as a possible national security threat for suspected contact with Russian Intelligence officers. The irony is just unbelievable. Sean Davis has been parsing these details for years now. He is cofounder of \"The Federalist\" and he joins us tonight to sort them out. Sean, thanks for joining us.

We also learned that the original case against Flynn, the investigation was closed on Election Day. They were ordered to close it on Election Day 2016 and only open it up afterwards, which is just shocking. And in these texts, we also learn from these agents who remain unnamed unfortunately, that they found nothing on Flynn. They even used national security letters to avoid subpoenas in order to get to his financial records and they said there's nothing there.

Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. It's hard to think clearly when things are on fire. That's a basic rule of life, that maybe why looking back on it, we've seen so much arson recently. If you wanted to keep the public from thinking clearly about what you plan to do to their country, you might riot and no one would notice that you're lying. They definitely have been lying. Every story we've been told for the past three months has been at its core, a lie, all of them from the first day. George Floyd was executed by racist cops on the street. That's what they told us. That's what everyone believed. Yet when the autopsy became public, it showed that George Floyd had lethal levels of fentanyl in his system among other drugs. Floyd said he couldn't breathe long before police landed on him as he was in fact sitting untouched in the back of a patrol car. But the mob wasn't interested in hearing those details. They torched Minneapolis. In Kenosha, Democrats told us that bloodthirsty cops just walked up and shot Jacob Blake as he was trying to break up a fight between two women. It was horrifying. But that's not what happened. Police arrived there after a woman called 911 to say Blake was at her home in violation of a restraining order. That woman had previously accused Blake of sexual assault. Blake fought with the responding officers, first cops tried non-lethal force to subdue him. They Tased Blake, that didn't work. When they saw him reach for a knife, they shot him. What else were they supposed to do exactly? But Kamala Harris wasn't interested in knowing what actually happened. She declared that she was proud of Jacob Blake and then her voters burned Kenosha. Tonight, the mob is in Louisville to protest the death of Breonna Taylor. News organizations told us that Taylor was in bed when police shot her. But she wasn't, she was in her hallway. They told us that Taylor had nothing to do with her drug dealing ex-boyfriend whom police were investigating. That's why they were there. In fact, intercepted jailhouse communication suggest that Taylor was warehousing that man's drug money. They told us that police shot first. That's not true. Taylor's boyfriend shot a cop first. Then they told us over and over and over again that police surprised Taylor in the middle of the night. They barged into her apartment in a so-called no-knock raid. Then yesterday the Attorney General of Kentucky exposed that as yet another lie. The police did in fact knock on Breonna Taylor's door. They identified themselves as police. There's a witness to it. But it didn't matter. They kept lying to us. Kamala Harris issued a statement attacking no-knock raids. Amazingly, so did Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, a Republican. Tim Scott should know better. A grand jury did know better. The jurors considered all of the available evidence in the Breonna Taylor case. And yesterday, they declined to charge the officers with murder. There wasn't any evidence that a murder took place. That is how our system is supposed to work. We don't indict the innocent. That's wrong. It's not justice. But the mob doesn't care about justice no matter what they scream. They want blood. So with the encouragement of so many of our leaders, they unleashed violence on the City of Louisville. They set fires. They destroyed businesses, then to the surprise of no one, they opened fire on the police. Here are scenes of it."

Lorenzo Johnson's social media posts don't look very different from Kamala Harris's Twitter feed, pro-BLM, outraged by the racist killing of Breonna Taylor.

When two cops were shot last night in Louisville, BLM's Chapter there did not express a word of sympathy for the officers in the hospital with bullets in them.

There are legions behind them. People you don't see on camera. It takes legions. It takes money and it takes organization to stage effective riots for three and a half months. So it's worth asking, who is funding all of this? That is a central question too few have tried to answer it. We still don't know the full answer, but we're getting a clear picture tonight. Last night, we showed you footage of a U-Haul truck in Louisville full of rioting supplies and mobile armor. Watch the mob descend on that U-Haul within minutes of the grand jury's verdict."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "When we showed you that footage last night, we suggested we had leads as to who might have rented that U-Haul. Tonight we know who did. We've determined that a woman called Holly Zoller paid for that U-Haul truck. Zoller works as a so-called bail disruptor. That's her description from an organization called The Bail Project. The Bail Project helps get suspected criminals and rioters back out onto the street as quickly as they can. So who funds The Bail Project? It takes money to get people out of jail. Take a look at that organization's Board of Directors and it tells you the story. There's a first term Democratic Congresswoman on there, but other than that, you will not find a more pampered group of revolutionaries. One Board member is a woman called Lisa Gersh. She previously served as the President of Strategic Initiatives at NBC and a Managing Director at NBC Universal. She also was the CEO of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Gersh even founded her own law firm at one point, not a starving artist. Another Board member is a man called Michael Novogratz. He is the CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners and a former principal at Fortress Investment Group LLC, and the Fortress Macro Fund. He's a finance guy. He also serves on the Board of the Princeton Varsity Club. So what's going on here? Why are the most privileged people in our society, rich executives like Gersh and Novogratz supporting an organization that bails people out of jail who are destroying our cities and attacking our police? People like that, Board members like this live far from the scenes of riot. So why are they paying for riots? Maybe they're doing it to cover their own tracks. That's a thought. America's core problems are not racial. America's core problems are economic. A small group of people have a disproportionate amount of money. Everyone else is getting poor. For the majority of the population, the American Dream is dying. But if you were on the right end of that equation, you wouldn't want the public to think too much about this. So maybe you'd fund racial conflict, so they wouldn't think about it. It's pretty clever. It's also completely evil. Last night, we told you about the Hearst Corporation. That's a media company that generates more than $11 billion a year. One of Hearst properties maybe its most famous property is \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine. \"Cosmopolitan\" magazine spent most of yesterday raising money to bail out rioters in Louisville. At one point yesterday, \"Cosmo\" tweeted an image of Holly Zoller, the woman who rented the U-Haul and others along with this message. \"Support protesters who are brave enough to go out and take a stand in coming days.\" Take a stand? \"Cosmo\" wants you to take a stand and send money to people who are taking a stand. So what does taking a stand look like? Well, they took a stand last time in Portland, Oregon. \"Cosmo\" readers did. They tried to kill police officers with Molotov cocktails. Keep in mind, this took place thousands of miles from Louisville and Breonna Taylor. Why?"

But here's one, a word from Kamala Harris might slow these people down. But Harris isn't interested in slowing them down. There's an election to win so the mob rages on. By the way, you should know that in the name of racial justice, a BLM supporter shot a black cop in Louisville last night against racial justice.

And the people who run NBC News should be ashamed of that. They should stop putting that stuff on television. It legitimately hurts the country. But that's the position of the Democratic Party. Remember when Joe Biden announced that no true black person could vote Republican? Well, Biden's allies in the media -- and that's everyone -- went a step further. At MSNBC, they explained that black people are, quote, \"performing for white supremacy,\" if they don't tow the D.N.C.'s line. At CNN, the anchors wants you to know it's quote \"politically charged\" to criticize, quote, \"mob violence.\" Can you imagine saying something like that? Our leaders in Congress and on television and at \"Cosmo\" have decided that law enforcement of any kind is an act of bigotry? Do they really believe that? Well, of course, they don't really believe that. That's why so many of them are surrounded by armed bodyguards. But it doesn't matter what they really believe.

But the whole reason why that they were marching out on the street is because as you can see in the videos that I captured, they were trying to set fires in Jefferson Square Park. They were trying to set the boards that were covering the windows or the Hall of Justice on fire. And so the Louisville, sorry, the Louisville Metro Police said that it was unlawful assembly and if they didn't disperse that they would have to be subjected to crowd control ammunitions. And so, they did leave the area, but as they were leaving the area, people were breaking off and breaking windows. They were smashing bus stops and setting even more fires as they were walking away and so that's why when they were confronted by the police, the police used two flashbangs above the crowd to try to disperse them. And then unfortunately, right after that happened, that's when we heard the gunfire. And at that point, people did start to scatter, because at that point, we didn't know what exactly was going on. But it is just not true at all to say that this was a mostly peaceful protest. I can't even believe that. Even after guns were shot, the people in the media would still try to make that claim."

There's one gentleman particular who I saw in Kenosha, but I don't think he was a rioter or a protester. I think he was just there. But people do travel.

They called him in their phrase, racially charged names, because he deviated from the D.N.C.'s line. This kind of attack is everywhere now. What should we make of it? Candace Owens has borne the brunt of attacks of this for a long time. She is the author of the book \"Blackout: How Black America Can Make its Second Escape from the Democratic Plantation.\" She joins us tonight. Candice, thanks so much for coming on. So you saw the Attorney General of Kentucky and I think I'd be honest enough to say this, even if I disagreed with him, certainly made a rational case for his position in a pretty traditionally American case, rioting is not justice, and then you see him attacked as a race traitor, what do you make of that? CANDICE OWENS, AUTHOR, \"BLACKOUT\": That's right. For me, it's absolutely infuriating to watch and you are correct in saying that I've been on the receiving end of the same sorts of attacks and here's what's so fundamentally wrong and backwards about it, is that if you actually look at what they're saying and what the deeper implications are here, it's that there is a right way, a correct way and a wrong way to be black. Meaning that you could look at me, Tucker, and say Candace Owens is black. And therefore, I can assign a bunch of characteristics and expectations upon to her based on her skin color. Ironically, Tucker, that's the very definition of racism. And it's coming from the liberals who like to say that they see racism everywhere, but they can't recognize it when it's coming out of their own mouths. I've often said that the Democratic Party has built almost a prototype of what it means to be a black American. That prototype means a black American must vote Democrat, you must react emotionally and not rationally and not pause to think. We must be faithful and abide by cultural icons, meaning we must worship the words and the advice of King LeBron James as he is called, and Queen Beyonce. Queen Beyonce being the person, I will remind your listeners and viewers who actually wrote a letter to hurry up the Attorney General in his investigation and said that she wanted her kind of justice delivered in the Breonna Taylor case. He did the right thing by ignoring her. He did the right thing by ignoring the various pressures coming from culture and the mainstream media. And for that, you're seeing him being socially lynched and stripped of his identity, because he acted professionally and rationally. You know, this guy should be commended by both sides, and instead, he is being attacked racially by the left."

You have to come to us with ideas and get us to see your perspective. But when it's black Americans, they view it as proprietary. There is something proprietary about black skin to Democrats, and they get super angry, and people that think independently, like myself, like the Attorney General, and like various other black Americans who are waking up to this delusions."

There's a study of a couple of a hairdressers in Missouri. It's a joke. The best evidence before this pandemic started, before March, which is when the science was not politicized suggest that masks were broadly useless in the general population. To the extent they were useful, it would be for people who are actively infected and coughing. And to the extent that that made any difference, it was probably just as a signaling mechanism to show people step away from me, I'm sick. Okay, so the evidence here is just beyond week. What's happened, Tucker, is that masks have become a talisman. Okay? Masks have become something that we use to show were serious about this, and this is a problem and lots of people are dying and we're going to do something about it and we can't do lockdowns anymore. I mean, you know even the Democratic governors have dropped lockdowns because they're so economically devastating. So they have to tell people to do something and they tell them to wear masks and the social pressure -- I do want to talk about the social pressure a little bit because I think it's very important. A few weeks ago, I was in Walmart with my son who is four. Okay, a four-year-old is essentially 0.000 risk of anything happening with coronavirus. Little kids don't spread the coronavirus. He was not wearing a mask. I don't like him to wear a mask, although he has unfortunately had to wear one now that he goes to school. And a woman came up to me and she said, your son is not wearing a mask. And I said I know. He doesn't like them. And she said I'm going to go get a police officer. And she did. There was a police officer at the Walmart. Okay, so what do I do? I don't argue with the police. I tell him, you know, I tell my son to put on a mask he puts it on. This is a sort of social pressure that we're engaged in right now and it has real consequences. There are other even more serious issues than masks coming. There are vaccines. There are test and trace and how aggressively we're going to isolate people and quarantine them. There are hundreds of thousands of college students right now at no risk being essentially forced to not leave their dorms for no reason."

And what's interesting is that it's actually the Anglophone countries, it's the U.K., and it's the U.S. It's Canada and Australia and New Zealand that have taken the most irrational steps. Right now in Europe, they are done with lockdowns and they are -- it is funny, the countries that we view as more bureaucratic and statist are the ones that are pushing back more and making more rational decisions than we are."

      "utterance": "If you have seen today's White House press briefing, if you didn't you missed Democratic operatives posing as reporters stunned by the idea that mail-in voting might not be totally a hundred percent secure. It was amusing to watch. Of course, the risks of mail-in voting are obvious. The latest example of that came today. D.O.J. announced that the F.B.I. and the Pennsylvania State Police are investigating fraud in mail-in ballots in Luzerne County. That's a place Donald Trump won by double digits four years ago. According to D.O.J., several military ballots were quote \"discarded.\" Investigators have recovered a total of nine ballots so far not surprisingly, D.O.J. says an overwhelming majority of those ballots were cast for guess who? Donald Trump. Meanwhile, in Greenfield, Wisconsin authorities announced Tuesday that three trays of mail including mail-in ballots were discovered in a ditch -- not counted -- in a ditch. We've seen other examples of this throughout the year including deliberate mail-in ballot fraud in New Jersey and in West Virginia. Just hours ago, in the State of Texas, the State Attorney General announced that a County Commissioner and several others have been arrested in an organized mail-in balloting scheme that took place during the 2018 Democratic primary. But to reporters in Washington, this is impossible to believe. For the people doing it, it is confirmation that actually, it works pretty well. Last week, judges on Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled that mail-in ballots need to be counted well after Election Day. You won't be shocked to know that five members of the body that made that decision, five out of seven people in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania are partisan Democrats. They are elected. They are politicians. Last week in the State of Michigan, a judge called Cynthia Diane Stephens issued a very similar ruling, in fact, she went farther, she mandated ballot harvesting. Ballot harvesting allows paid political operatives to collect ballots in bundles and bring them to polling places. What could go wrong? Well, fraud for one thing, in fact fraud is the whole point of it. You should know that Cynthia Diane Stephens is not much of a judge, she is a political activist. You often hear conservatives deride activist judges, but that's not an overstatement in this case. Cynthia Diane Stephens is proud to be an activist. Four years ago, she appeared at an event at the University of Michigan on equity and inclusion and she literally gave the crowd advice on how to be an effective activist, not judge, activist. It is on video if you want to find it. There's nothing partisan judges would like to destroy more in the end that a quick efficient fraud free election night. That's the goal here and make no mistake. If all the votes are counted in one night, no one will have time to issue rulings to throw out ballots they don't like. That's why judges in Pennsylvania and Michigan want poll workers to count votes four weeks after Election Day. With their rulings last week, they made that essentially inevitable. It'll be a disaster. We know that for certain. We've seen it before. During the Iowa Caucuses this past February, we still don't really know who won in Iowa today, seven months later, but to the leaders of the Democratic Party, the caucuses weren't a debacle, they were a blueprint for the presidential election where Joe Biden takes Hillary Clinton's advice and does not concede no matter what happens. All he has to do is smile and wave from his hotel room on Election Night and the lawyers will take it from there. That's the plan. Up next, F.B.I. analysts working on the Michael Flynn case were very concerned it turns out in 2016, and 2017. We'll show you what they were concerned about because we have their texts, next."

      "utterance": "More text messages released tonight, more evidence that the Michael Flynn prosecution was politically motivated. In August of 2016, one of the F.B.I. analysts working on the Flynn case texted this quote, \"Doing all this selection research, I think some of these guys want a Clinton presidency.\" You think? Later, another F.B.I. employee wrote this quote, \"Trump was right. What is wrong with these people?\" The probe was so obviously corrupt that F.B.I. officials discussed getting quote \"professional liability insurance\" to protect them from the consequences of the corruption. Separately, FOX News has learned today that the primary source of the anti- Trump Steele dossier posed by BuzzFeed was under an F.B.I. investigation as a possible national security threat for suspected contact with Russian Intelligence officers. The irony is just unbelievable. Sean Davis has been parsing these details for years now. He is cofounder of \"The Federalist\" and he joins us tonight to sort them out. Sean, thanks for joining us. What have we learned today? SEAN DAVIS, COFOUNDER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, we've learned a lot today. The first is that the corruption at the F.B.I. and how they conducted their anti-Trump Jihad was so bad that F.B.I. agents were purchasing for themselves using your money and my money, by the way, as taxpayers -- purchasing liability insurance for when people finally found out how corrupt their activities were. We also learned that the original case against Flynn, the investigation was closed on Election Day. They were ordered to close it on Election Day 2016 and only open it up afterwards, which is just shocking. And in these texts, we also learn from these agents who remain unnamed unfortunately, that they found nothing on Flynn. They even used national security letters to avoid subpoenas in order to get to his financial records and they said there's nothing there. And in fact, the guy who was running the whole thing, who is also unnamed was obsessed with rabbit holes and conspiracy theories and his scope was absolutely beyond logic."

And you know, we're told it was only the leadership who is doing kind of bad things. The rank and file are good. These are rank and file agents talking about this. And where are the whistleblowers? And why are we learning about this three years after Chris Wray took over the F.B.I.? Why are we having to learn about this from a court case? Why was this not disclosed to Congress?

One person has been indicted and pleaded guilty to this, one person in that entire building. So until we actually see people indicted and go to prison for what we know are crimes. No, I don't think any reform they do matters whatsoever."

I haven't seen any indictments other than the one of the F.B.I. lawyer, and I hope Bill Barr understands that if nothing happens on this, it's not going to be Durham that people hold responsible, it is going to be Bill Barr because he is the one who picked him. He is the one who assured us and the President that he would take care of this and nothing's happened."
