And then tonight's Angle, why all the whining from the cults of Trump after 8 years of swooning over the real messiah, Obama? But we begin with broad sides from Team Trump, after the outlandish revelations in the inspector general's report on the Clinton email investigation. Starting with President Trump's shot at the FBI brass and the chief he fired, Jim Comey. On \"Fox & Friends\" this morning, the president took a swipe at what he called the scum at the top of the bureau under Obama.",

Strzok is now facing his own day of reckoning as House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte has begun proceedings to subpoena him. Strzok was the lead FBI agent, remember, in the Clinton email probe, a top agent in the FBI's Russia and probe, and the agent who interviewed former national security advisor Mike Flynn. He then became a top investigator in Bob Mueller's Russia probe. All that ended of course when Strzok's bombastic texts with his lover, FBI Attorney Lisa Page were revealed. Strzok was demoted to the FBI's HR department, that's ironic, which raises the question, why the heck is he still working at the FBI? Especially in light of the text message revealed yesterday where he vowed to stop Trump from becoming president. Joining me now are national spokesperson and special agent John Annarelli, attorney and RNC Committee woman from California, Harmeet Dhillon, and former assistant attorney general, Robert Driscoll. All right I want to start with you, Bob, on this because it's fascinating to me how when you survey the other networks over the last 24 hours, it was like onto Stormy Daniels. They spent precious little time on this, \"Oh no evidence of bias, this is a big nothing burger\", I'm so sick of that word, by the way. But let's remember what Horowitz did conclude and this is important, \"Departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and Department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the Department as fair administrators of justice\". Robert, fair administrators of justice now with a Russia collusion probe gone on for more than a year, about $18 million it' cost, apparently with no end in sight.",

All the report says and I think people take this sentence out of context, the report said that Horowitz couldn't link the examples of bias to any particular investigative decision, which of course he couldn't. No one generally writes down when they're doing something that improper. But he found bias through all 500 pages. On each page there's more examples of bias on text message or emails worse than the next. And so the bias is there, it's just a question that he took a broad view, essentially if any investigative decision was defensible, not proper, but just defensible, he passed on it. So I think it really is to me shockingly bad, both the breath of the report, and the bias and corruption was, I think shocking.",

So when you read this report you can't help feel like number one, obviously it's very thorough report and goes into a lot of the shocking bias but, the conclusion is we don't have a smoking gun so we can't do anything about it. That's the problem all along with an office of an inspector general investigation, they don't have the power to do anything about it, it's more an after the fact HR internal investigation as what we can do better next time.

I want to go back to you Rob, thinking about the IG, again Horowitz, Trump was kind of annoyed today, he said that there's a lot of good stuff then he kind of peed it out at the end, that's what Donald Trump said.

So in the Clinton investigation, we have the Clinton IT guy getting granted immunity essentially nothing, admitting that they destroyed the emails after they were already under the subpoena, no prosecution, Cheryl Mills being in the interview with Hillary Clinton as both as a witness and as a lawyer, Huma Abedin being allowed to sit in on the interview. I mean all those things may be defensible individually in a vacuum, but an incredibly light touch for anyone who has ever gone through and FBI investigation. And then we get to compare that in 2.0, to gee, what do you know, people's houses are being searched at six in the morning, everyone's being charged with false statements without they were materials to any given crime and so I think the second report could be a big deal because it could fill in these gaps, at least allow us to draw some inferences.",

So he should not go in there, there's no confidence that the decks won't be stacked against him. We've seen that with Flynn, we seen how Strzok has behaved in many instances but in terms of witnesses, a CEO, a powerful person is the worst witness, anybody I tell you. They're the worst witness because they are used to getting their way, everybody in the room sucks up to them and it's just a totally different scenario when you're talking, even seemingly, casually to a prosecutor or an FBI agent.

Meet the real cultists, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. You have to hand it to the anti-Trump resistance, they've tried a lot of different things to stop Donald Trump. Well during the campaign, the chattering classes at various times called him a racist, xenophobe, he was a misogynist, he was stupid, a fraud in business, oh he wasn't as well read as the other candidates, oh he also didn't play nice in the sandbox, remember, with his fellow Republicans. He was brash, boring and an egomaniac, not fit for the presidency. And now that after this IG Report that came out yesterday, we know that burrowed inside the FBI were agents by day and activists by night who were working on an insurance policy to stop Trump from winning the presidency. And then, when that didn't work, fired FBI Director Jim Comey leaked his notes to a pal who in turn leaked them to the press, all to trigger the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller on that bogus Russia collusion theory. And now more than a year and $17 million later, well the special counsel's approval numbers shave gone down and Donald Trump's numbers have gone up, hey the economy is soaring and he unleashed the possibility of denuclearized Korean Peninsula. And of course Trump is enforcing our immigration laws after years of neglect. Wages are going up, unemployment is way down, and as a result, Americans are more confident about their future, yay.

I've been dying to talk to you guys all day about this because when I started hearing this meme this week, `Oh it's the cult of Trump'.

And when he talks about Korea or Iran or the economy, the critics all say he can't do it, its' impossible but then he gets it done, he implements it. And even after he does they still say he didn't do it or it'll come apart and that creates a real sense that apart from ideology, apart from program, apart from party, this guy is somebody to follow because he gets it done. It's the same concept that inspired Reagan and even Churchill supporters that we don't care if he's left or right, Labor or Tory or Democrat or Republican, we love the way he acts, the way he gets it done and the way he expresses out innermost desires about what the government should do for us.",

But it took me about 15 seconds on the Google to find New York Times editorial last week, the cult of Trump, Axios in February, the cult of Trump, National Journal last year, Trump's cult overwhelms the GOP.   I get the idea that this is President Trump's Republican Party and whether out of loyalty or out of fear many Republicans are falling into line.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Giuliani was referring to Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who vowed to stop Trump from becoming president in a text uncovered in the IG report. Strzok is now facing his own day of reckoning as House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte has begun proceedings to subpoena him. Strzok was the lead FBI agent, remember, in the Clinton email probe, a top agent in the FBI's Russia and probe, and the agent who interviewed former national security advisor Mike Flynn. He then became a top investigator in Bob Mueller's Russia probe. All that ended of course when Strzok's bombastic texts with his lover, FBI Attorney Lisa Page were revealed. Strzok was demoted to the FBI's HR department, that's ironic, which raises the question, why the heck is he still working at the FBI? Especially in light of the text message revealed yesterday where he vowed to stop Trump from becoming president. Joining me now are national spokesperson and special agent John Annarelli, attorney and RNC Committee woman from California, Harmeet Dhillon, and former assistant attorney general, Robert Driscoll. All right I want to start with you, Bob, on this because it's fascinating to me how when you survey the other networks over the last 24 hours, it was like onto Stormy Daniels. They spent precious little time on this, \"Oh no evidence of bias, this is a big nothing burger\", I'm so sick of that word, by the way. But let's remember what Horowitz did conclude and this is important, \"Departing so clearly and dramatically from FBI and Department norms, the decisions negatively impacted the perception of the FBI and the Department as fair administrators of justice\". Robert, fair administrators of justice now with a Russia collusion probe gone on for more than a year, about $18 million it' cost, apparently with no end in sight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT DRISCOLL, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Well I mean the damage has been done and I think this report makes it clear that here was rampant bias in the FBI and levels of the DOJ and it's clear in the report. All the report says and I think people take this sentence out of context, the report said that Horowitz couldn't link the examples of bias to any particular investigative decision, which of course he couldn't. No one generally writes down when they're doing something that improper. But he found bias through all 500 pages. On each page there's more examples of bias on text message or emails worse than the next. And so the bias is there, it's just a question that he took a broad view, essentially if any investigative decision was defensible, not proper, but just defensible, he passed on it. So I think it really is to me shockingly bad, both the breath of the report, and the bias and corruption was, I think shocking."

I mean that just takes the cake, you can't write how stupid that is. But it looks like Bob Goodlatte does want him to testify on Capitol Hill. Apparently he's wanted to talk to him for over a year and he's begun the process reportedly, of getting that subpoena. It takes two days I guess, the process takes about two days but he wants Strzok up on Capitol Hill, and he wants information and he wants it yesterday."

      "speaker": "HARMEET DHILLON, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",

Strzok and you know, Ray who the president was praising in his tweets, why they haven't done something about this already. There was evidence of bias. We see the shocking instance of the text that he sent back to his lover about how he wasn't going to let Trump become the president, and that was withheld from Congress. So when you read this report you can't help feel like number one, obviously it's very thorough report and goes into a lot of the shocking bias but, the conclusion is we don't have a smoking gun so we can't do anything about it. That's the problem all along with an office of an inspector general investigation, they don't have the power to do anything about it, it's more an after the fact HR internal investigation as what we can do better next time. And that's not going to cut it here, but the damage has been done to our country and the damage that is being done to the Mueller investigation, it requires stronger measures than simply an investigation into what went wrong. We got to do something about it."

We have men and women who work so hard in the field offices all across this country, day by day, night by night, to keep Americans safe, and do really great investigative work. This ended up being a political oppo-research operation ultimately against the president with the Russia probe. But the CYA with the Hillary Clinton and these emails all along but if you actually read this report, I've gotten through most of it, there is a lot in this report that the press, of course, is conveniently glossing over."

Remember, this is a group of individuals who knew each other, some were handpicked by their friends to work in this project, if you will. Meanwhile you have 35,000 FBI employees doing good things every day and not acting biasly. I think it's important that they need to come clean here and you're right, whether or not Mr Strzok should still be working at FBI headquarters is certainly a question a lot of us are asking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now remember guys as we said the IG did not say he found no bias at the FBI, he said that there was no documentary evidence that bias produced specific decisions. And we've got to remember there's another IF Report coming down the pipe, you can call it IG 2.0, if you want, and that could end up being loaded with evidence of such bias because that would looking into the informants that were used in the Trump campaign and maybe potentially these Pfizer abuses, the FBI handling of the Russia probe. I want to go back to you Rob, thinking about the IG, again Horowitz, Trump was kind of annoyed today, he said that there's a lot of good stuff then he kind of peed it out at the end, that's what Donald Trump said. I think this other report could be really important in seeing what happened to place individuals, or encourage individuals to try to penetrate these lower level people inside the campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DRISCOLL",
      "utterance": "I think it would be important for two reason, one is what you are talked about, we'll find the basis of this investigation, whether or not it was Dossier originally, whether or not it was an opposition research generated investigation totally or not. But more importantly, we'll be able to lay it side by side with the IG Report that just came out because it will provide some context. So in the Clinton investigation, we have the Clinton IT guy getting granted immunity essentially nothing, admitting that they destroyed the emails after they were already under the subpoena, no prosecution, Cheryl Mills being in the interview with Hillary Clinton as both as a witness and as a lawyer, Huma Abedin being allowed to sit in on the interview. I mean all those things may be defensible individually in a vacuum, but an incredibly light touch for anyone who has ever gone through and FBI investigation. And then we get to compare that in 2.0, to gee, what do you know, people's houses are being searched at six in the morning, everyone's being charged with false statements without they were materials to any given crime and so I think the second report could be a big deal because it could fill in these gaps, at least allow us to draw some inferences."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well yeah I mean guys they have certainly very zealous in trying to find evidence of Russia working with Trump, getting this professor in London, talk to Papadopoulos, like all this stuff they were trying to do, my goodness they were leaving no stone unturned. Trying to get a Russian billionaire to help that Oleg Deripaska, I mean they're doing everything. Meanwhile with Hillary it's like, \"Well maybe we should get the Wiener laptop, maybe we should wait on that\". So a totally different approach which also I think comes through when you read the totality of this report. Harmeet, Giuliani today talked about the question that we've been talking about for months here about whether the President should testify. I want you all to listen carefully to this. AINSLEY EARHARDT, \"FOX & FRIENDS\" CO-HOST: What do you think should happen now in the Mueller investigation?"
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "He went on to say, he basically say that there will be no interview with the President shouldn't be bothered with it. Harmeet any thinking of yours that changed from the beginning of a possible perjury trial for a president who, President Trump likes to talk. He's very affable, he loves to get his point across, he didn't do anything wrong, he says, \"So I'm happy to talk\", he wants to talk, but as a lawyer and I'm a lawyer as well, how dangerous is it to go into that special counsel's office?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "Okay Laura to answer the first part of your questions, does it change anything? No, from day one I thought the president shouldn't talk. You and I both know that federal prosecutors are not just regular prosecutors. They're the gunners, you know, they're the go-getters who want to make their case and make their name, there's no bigger prey than the president of the United States. So he should not go in there, there's no confidence that the decks won't be stacked against him. We've seen that with Flynn, we seen how Strzok has behaved in many instances but in terms of witnesses, a CEO, a powerful person is the worst witness, anybody I tell you. They're the worst witness because they are used to getting their way, everybody in the room sucks up to them and it's just a totally different scenario when you're talking, even seemingly, casually to a prosecutor or an FBI agent. So it would be a big mistake for any CEO or for any president, but particularly for this president even for a lack of corruption, now we've seen the corruption pervading the FBI so absolutely not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's what Giulinai's point was. Giuliani's point today was now that we've seen, now we know just what was going on in there, with the desperate effort to stop him from becoming president. If Cheryl Mills gets to sit in there when they are talking about whether they should subpoena Hillary, the cozy relationship between the press and the FBI agents, the press are giving perks to the FBI agents, they don't know where these leaks came from. It's totally out of control and I want to go back to you John because we have John Dowd exclusively gave us a comment tonight about what this IG report actually says. He said the clear, John Dowd former of course lead counsel for Trump, \"The clear evidence of his usurpation of power, violation of his oath of office and material false statement to the public and Congress, all to conceal his own misconduct, warranted a criminal referral of Comey's conduct. The finding of no bias was ludicrous. The IOG's findings support the president's decision to fire Comey\". John"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANNARELLI",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Comey was fired for the things he had done and the president was right to step forward and take those actions. I also think a lot things have been made out of the fact that the president fired the director of the FBI. It's not unprecedented, we saw with William Sessions back in the early 90s when he was fired by a Democratic president, President Clinton. There were firings of FBI directors but this is clearly, based on the report we're seeing, gives good cause and justification for the actions the President took."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Then guys there was also the shocking news today, a federal judge appointed by Obama actually jailed Paul Manafort after Mueller claimed he tried to tamper with witnesses.

Robert this led Jeffery Toobin to say the following about Giuliani, let's watch."

      "speaker": "JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANAYLIST",

It really is appalling."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DRISCOLL",
      "utterance": "Well another reason too, just strategically as a defense lawyer, I wouldn't want Manafort pardoned before this case is over because once he's pardoned, his Fifth Amendment right against prosecution likely goes away. So if he is pardoned he no longer faces criminal prosecution, he would conceivably be forced to testify. And moreover, there's no reason to handle it now, you just wait and see where the chips fall. And if at some point if the president wants to pardon, he can. And as far as it being unprecedented, George Bush Senior pardoned Cap Weinberger the day of his trial I think it was, or the day before his trial."

I mean all these things happen, the tarmac meeting, there's no moral outrage suddenly, oh Jeffery Toobin of CNN is outrage over the discussion pardon. Give me a break, close it out for us."

I'm outraged as a civil libertarian that a judge is appearing to use incarceration as a penalty, as a punishment for somebody prior to their trial. We know that it's actually only supposed to be used as preventative detention in very limited cases where it deals with flight risk and other issues and I don't think that standard was in that today so that's what he should be outraged about from a civil libertarian point of view."

Thank you all, fantastic panel. And with Trump flying so high at home abroad, the resistance's kind of hit a wall. I'm going to explain their latest wily coyote scheme in tonight's Angle next. Meet the real cultists, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. You have to hand it to the anti-Trump resistance, they've tried a lot of different things to stop Donald Trump. Well during the campaign, the chattering classes at various times called him a racist, xenophobe, he was a misogynist, he was stupid, a fraud in business, oh he wasn't as well read as the other candidates, oh he also didn't play nice in the sandbox, remember, with his fellow Republicans. He was brash, boring and an egomaniac, not fit for the presidency. And now that after this IG Report that came out yesterday, we know that burrowed inside the FBI were agents by day and activists by night who were working on an insurance policy to stop Trump from winning the presidency. And then, when that didn't work, fired FBI Director Jim Comey leaked his notes to a pal who in turn leaked them to the press, all to trigger the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller on that bogus Russia collusion theory. And now more than a year and $17 million later, well the special counsel's approval numbers shave gone down and Donald Trump's numbers have gone up, hey the economy is soaring and he unleashed the possibility of denuclearized Korean Peninsula. And of course Trump is enforcing our immigration laws after years of neglect. Wages are going up, unemployment is way down, and as a result, Americans are more confident about their future, yay. So now the Trump resistance, they got to try something new."

They probably didn't watch the debates, aren't fully educated on his policies and are stupidly wrapped up in his unmerited enthusiasm\". Nice. Well look, Donald Trump isn't perfect, none of us are but more Americans are seeing that his new and often unconventional approaches to governance ae paying off. And they're passed the constant sniping and criticism and are recognizing that through it all, Trump has focused on making life better, safer, more prosperous for the American people. That's not cultish, it's common sense. The closest thing to a cult that we've seen in politics over the past decade is the cult of Obama. Who can forget these gems?"

There's simply no broad constituency for the old Bush Republicanism of unaccountable trade deals, lax borders and perpetual military interventionism. Those days, my friends, are over. So let the good times roll until the Democrats and the bitter bushies come up with some other lame attack against this successful President and his hopeful, very optimistic supporters. And that's the Angle. All right joining me now to react host of \"MediaBuzz,\" here on Fox News Howard Kurtz and Dick Morris, former senior advisor to Bill Clinton. I've been dying to talk to you guys all day about this because when I started hearing this meme this week, `Oh it's the cult of Trump'. They tried to say that he was dumb, that he had dementia, remember that last year? They needed to remove him from office, the cabinet had to be activated and now it's like they're all just a bunch of cultist Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinkers. Dick Morris you've seen the cultish, lavish adulation of both Clinton and Obama. Is Trump more about policy or personality?"

We want a president that gets stuff done without prevaricating or waffling or with the winds blowing and Trump is a builder, he's a developer, that's what they do, he gets it built. And when he talks about Korea or Iran or the economy, the critics all say he can't do it, its' impossible but then he gets it done, he implements it. And even after he does they still say he didn't do it or it'll come apart and that creates a real sense that apart from ideology, apart from program, apart from party, this guy is somebody to follow because he gets it done. It's the same concept that inspired Reagan and even Churchill supporters that we don't care if he's left or right, Labor or Tory or Democrat or Republican, we love the way he acts, the way he gets it done and the way he expresses out innermost desires about what the government should do for us."

He spent like 45 minutes with just answering questions just out in the driveway, I've never seen anything like this, I thought it was great. But you just wrote a piece about the supposed cult phenomenon and the lines coming from the media all week, so tell us your thoughts about where the real cult phenomenon is today. HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, \"MEDIABUZZ\": Yes, the mead have a new four letter c- word for Republicans who support President Trump. And think about that word that's become so common now, \"cult,\" kind of spooky, kind if creepy, extremist overtones. Of course people who would follow such a leader are mindless, delusional whack jobs. And there's a sense here, you showed Bob Corker earlier who never misses a chance to kick the president, the media is just following Corker. But it took me about 15 seconds on the Google to find New York Times editorial last week, the cult of Trump, Axios in February, the cult of Trump, National Journal last year, Trump's cult overwhelms the GOP. I get the idea that this is President Trump's Republican Party and whether out of loyalty or out of fear many Republicans are falling into line. But to call it a cult, and nobody even gets upset about it just shows you the media mindset. They still don't quite grasp Donald Trump's appeal."

Sometimes, by the way, the kids say they kids and we have to do DNA tests and we find out they're 21 years of age. That's happening too and it's happening frequently. So are border people to be described as running concentration camps? And another well-known person using the word \"Nazi.\" The White House put out a statement tonight and said it is appalling for our federal agents to be referred to in this manner. And many of our agents, Joe Scarborough, would compare sworn federal law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day to keep American people safe to Nazis. And I completely agree. It's unacceptable rhetoric that puts a target on the backs of our great law enforcement, and I agree. We can debate this policy, but we have tens of thousands of people crossing our border, and we have veterans sleeping in the street about three blocks from where we're broadcasting here in San Francisco.

I mean, for starters, who wants six liberal Democratic senators in Congress? I don't think anybody wants that. The way these lines are drawn it's going to be two liberal states and one moderate state that will still probably vote liberal. So it's a nonstarter I think both for Democrats and for Republicans. And constitutionally also it has to pass through a number of hurdles. It isn't as simple as people voting for it.

Monday and Tuesday night. That's it for us tonight. We'll be back here. And remember, follow me on Twitter @IngrahamAngle, and you'll be seeing all our adventures on Facebook as well. Have a great weekend, everyone. Fly your flag. Now it's time for Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team. Have a good weekend.
