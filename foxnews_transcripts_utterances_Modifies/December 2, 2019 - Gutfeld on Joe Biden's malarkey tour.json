It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, speaking out for the first time since her anti-Trump text messages with Peter Strzok set off a political fire storm. All this coming as we await the release of the inspector general's FISA report. Page saying, \"When the president accuses you of treason by name despite the fact that I know there is no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that, to try to further destroy my life. It never goes away or stops, even when he's not publicly attacking me.\" The president responding with this Tweet, \"When Lisa Page, the lover of Peter Strzok, talks about being crushed and how innocent she is, ask her to read Peter's insurance policy text to her just in case Hillary loses. Also, why were the lovers' text messages scrubbed after he left Mueller? Where are they, Lisa?\" And before we get on to this, we see Air Force One touching down in London where the president's going to be attending a lot of NATO meetings. Greg Gutfeld --",

He's still up in the polls, yet there's a sense he's heading straight into the path of an orange tornado. So, how does he turn his darn tooting jalopy around? Maybe he doesn't have to. Fact is, Biden isn't really the party's nominee, impeachment is. The hearings are their answer to Trump rallies. The only thing that gives the Dems a hope above desperation that they might get Trump out of office, with or without gramps waving his cane at the kids on the lawn. So, Biden may seem out of time in more ways than one, but at least on tour he'll have plenty of jawbreakers to give to the kids, even if they smell like mothballs.  All right.

And so, I looked, and it said that he pled guilty to taking part in an al-Qaeda style attack way back when. Got 16 years plus five years of parole or whatever, and then appealed it.

So, here's the lesson: one's a hero, one's obviously a villain. Criminals who are terrorists can't be treated the same as criminals who aren't terrorists. Because, like you said, a terrorist is a death cult -- will employ the treats, the tricks to reach heaven, which means they trick the rehab conference into making them believe that he was rehabbing when in fact he had the fake suicide vest and planned this.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Former FBI lawyer, Lisa Page, speaking out for the first time since her anti-Trump text messages with Peter Strzok set off a political fire storm. All this coming as we await the release of the inspector general's FISA report. Page saying, \"When the president accuses you of treason by name despite the fact that I know there is no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that, to try to further destroy my life. It never goes away or stops, even when he's not publicly attacking me.\" The president responding with this Tweet, \"When Lisa Page, the lover of Peter Strzok, talks about being crushed and how innocent she is, ask her to read Peter's insurance policy text to her just in case Hillary loses. Also, why were the lovers' text messages scrubbed after he left Mueller? Where are they, Lisa?\" And before we get on to this, we see Air Force One touching down in London where the president's going to be attending a lot of NATO meetings. Greg Gutfeld --"

When you saw this story break, you saw the drooling fan base immediately Tweet the story out. And then you look at her follower -- the people she follows on Twitter. They're exactly the same. It was a -- and they all push to this and speak \"kill shod,\" [phonetic] right? They really got him. But you look, it's the same crowd regurgitating the same self-congratulatory bunch of crap. It was so sheeplike -- sheeplike in how everybody copied each other. It revealed to me that there were marching orders, right? Like it wasn't -- it wasn't like, \"Oh, I just decided to speak out.\" This was a fruition of a courtship between the press and Page for a while, that guaranteed that it'll make her look like the victim to evil, evil Trump. And because of people who -- the people who boosted this piece instantly are the same group of people that have been saying this stuff forever. So it was all planned. And when you see a coordinated effort like this involving the media, never-Trumpers, people who hate Trump, you see why his Tweeting, to him, and the rallies are so important, because they control all the other tools."

If you really love the FBI that much, you should be concerned about your unprofessional behavior damaging the reputation among a majority of Americans who are now concerned about the FBI doing things that are untoward and that they shouldn't be doing ethically or illegally. She says, \"I didn't do anything illegal.\" Well, it doesn't mean you didn't do anything wrong.

This is a guy -- I mean, he wants to somehow focus on the process because he can't deal with the facts that bribery, obstruction of justice meets the standard for impeachment. So, he's trying to tell his folks, \"Oh, you know, I'm so busy. I'm Bill Clinton back in --\" look, Bill Clinton, for all his busyness, he got impeached by Newt Gingrich.

It's like asking a tree to participate in a wood chipping.

And I think when they first heard the criticism about doing this in coordination -- at the same time as NATO, they might have been a little surprised. I think the president has a good point. He's there to represent America. It doesn't help if the president, all of the press is constantly focusing on, is he upset? Is he going to resign? Is he going to mad? What's he going to Tweet about? Because he has important business. And remember, there was a terrorist attack just on Friday in the UK.

He's still up in the polls, yet there's a sense he's heading straight into the path of an orange tornado. So, how does he turn his darn tooting jalopy around? Maybe he doesn't have to. Fact is, Biden isn't really the party's nominee, impeachment is. The hearings are their answer to Trump rallies. The only thing that gives the Dems a hope above desperation that they might get Trump out of office, with or without gramps waving his cane at the kids on the lawn. So, Biden may seem out of time in more ways than one, but at least on tour he'll have plenty of jawbreakers to give to the kids, even if they smell like mothballs. All right. We went out on the streets, sent a couple of producers out into the street today -- mainly because it was snowing, and I wanted to make them feel bad -- to find out if anybody knows what malarkey means."

And so, I looked, and it said that he pled guilty to taking part in an al-Qaeda style attack way back when. Got 16 years plus five years of parole or whatever, and then appealed it. And it boiled down to the eight years that he served. And what it what they call a license in Britain, where you wear an electronic tag and you also have to go in for some kind of training.

You know, you can't fight the war on terror with ankle bracelets and rehab. Rehab is for drug addicts and alcoholics. It is not for religious fanatic killers. This guy did appeal, Juan.

This is not a religious fundamentalism that has to be confronted and instead it can be changed, changed through some kind of programing or discussion. That's just not true and we see it over and over and over again. This is the reason why we have Gitmo. There is a reason why we put these people in these places far away where they cannot hurt other people. And this is only going to be a continuing issue as ISIS people continue to come back to places in Europe. And these governments have a choice: keep these guys in jail or let them out on the streets.

One of the men who stopped this terrorist was also a murderer who strangled and slit the throat of a young girl and left her to die in the woods. That's one of the heroes. So, you had a terrorist and a murderer, not in the same country, not in the same city, but on the same streets, at the same event -- the rehab the rehab conference. So that's worse than -- I would be willing to bet -- that that's worse than any street, any public street in the United States. That street, okay? So, here's the lesson: one's a hero, one's obviously a villain. Criminals who are terrorists can't be treated the same as criminals who aren't terrorists. Because, like you said, a terrorist is a death cult -- will employ the treats, the tricks to reach heaven, which means they trick the rehab conference into making them believe that he was rehabbing when in fact he had the fake suicide vest and planned this. So this event shows that maybe one can rehab, but one can't. And meanwhile, all of his terror pals are still free. This other guy is free."
