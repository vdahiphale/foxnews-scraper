House Democrats accelerating their impeachment inquiry of President Trump, as three committee chairmen subpoena the country's top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They want documents related to Ukraine in the wake of that whistle-blower complaint about the president's conversation with Ukraine's president.  One of the people mentioned in that conversation, my first guest this morning, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney.  Then we will hear exclusively from House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, along House Intel Committee Member Mike Turner. The two Republicans weigh in on the impeachment push, the Ukraine controversy, and whether there's a chance for bipartisanship on legislative issues that matter to the American people.  Also with us this morning, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey is here. He will join us on Speaker Pelosi's claims that Attorney General Barr has - - quote -- gone rogue.\" Then the former prime minister of Qatar is here, a very rare and unique interview. Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani is here exclusively on the tensions between the U.S. and Iran.  All those stories and a lot more right now, right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" All right, as Democrats accelerate their impeachment inquiry, we are getting new reaction this morning from the two people squaring off at the center of it all, President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  The president put out a video message on Twitter, arguing that the whole thing is politically motivated. Watch.",

We saw Speaker Pelosi abuse her oath of office, if you would, by abusing the role of the speaker by saying an impeachment inquiry had started. And they were sending it to the Intelligence Committee, where you have a gentleman who has a habit of lying about the facts, Mr. Schiff. And what that means is, though, is, they have decided to walk down a path in which they are in contrary to American values. They're not going to allow this president to have due process. They're not going to be fair. They're going to ramrod this thing through because -- and I heard a member of House leadership this morning say on another network that they wanted to -- he wanted to have an inquiry, but he wasn't ready to vote for impeachment. The reason is, if they were truly serious about that, they would bring it to floor, they would have a vote, and then there would be fairness, and the American people can know that this wasn't just simply a Democrat ramrod of this president.

There were -- the collusion was a false narrative, the conspiracies. All these things were false when you actually investigate.

One of the people mentioned in that conversation, my first guest this morning, Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney. Then we will hear exclusively from House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, along House Intel Committee Member Mike Turner. The two Republicans weigh in on the impeachment push, the Ukraine controversy, and whether there's a chance for bipartisanship on legislative issues that matter to the American people. Also with us this morning, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey is here. He will join us on Speaker Pelosi's claims that Attorney General Barr has - - quote -- gone rogue.\" Then the former prime minister of Qatar is here, a very rare and unique interview. Hamad Bin Jassim Al Thani is here exclusively on the tensions between the U.S. and Iran. All those stories and a lot more right now, right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" All right, as Democrats accelerate their impeachment inquiry, we are getting new reaction this morning from the two people squaring off at the center of it all, President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

And that's where a lot of the dirty information, including false information, came from. And if you think I'm just making this up, the American swamp media avoids the fact that, in December of 2018, a Ukrainian court found that there was illegal interference in the election. They named the particular parliamentarian who was guilty, and they say it was information illegally given to the Hillary Clinton campaign. That is a court decision, not Rudy Giuliani, but a Ukrainian court. And I have four more affidavits like this. These are people willing to go under oath that say that false information and dirty information about the Trump campaign was given to the American Embassy, the Democratic National Committee, operatives for Hillary Clinton, and The New York Times."

He's watched this president be attacked for over three years, and he is simply doing what an attorney is supposed to do. And he's presenting that. That's his job. But let me go back to what's going on in the House and where this is at right now. This week, we saw a dark day in the House. We saw Speaker Pelosi abuse her oath of office, if you would, by abusing the role of the speaker by saying an impeachment inquiry had started. And they were sending it to the Intelligence Committee, where you have a gentleman who has a habit of lying about the facts, Mr. Schiff. And what that means is, though, is, they have decided to walk down a path in which they are in contrary to American values. They're not going to allow this president to have due process. They're not going to be fair. They're going to ramrod this thing through because -- and I heard a member of House leadership this morning say on another network that they wanted to -- he wanted to have an inquiry, but he wasn't ready to vote for impeachment. The reason is, if they were truly serious about that, they would bring it to floor, they would have a vote, and then there would be fairness, and the American people can know that this wasn't just simply a Democrat ramrod of this president. That's the problem we're seeing right now, Maria."

This is something, from my position as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, all you had to watch is our committee completely fall apart under investigation. In fact, any time they have been allowed to have -- we have allowed to have investigations, whether it be the Mueller report or these ridiculous hearings that Chairman Nadler's had in Judiciary Committee, it has always tended -- has shown that the president has done nothing wrong. There were -- the collusion was a false narrative, the conspiracies. All these things were false when you actually investigate. So now they have decided, let's throw that out the window, because that's not working for us. Fairness is not working. Being on the right side of the American people is not all right.

      "utterance": "Look, I want to ask you about the whistle-blower and the rules around a whistle-blower. We know that, in the actual transcript, we see that -- and the actual complaint, rather, the whistle-blower says, I do not have direct knowledge of this. That is in the complaint. But I was told this and I trust the people who told me. What are the rules around the whistle-blower in terms of what that person can charge?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's what's really been interesting here in the last little bit, because we have been finding out that the whistle-blower rules, especially in the intelligence community, seem to have been changed. And they have been changed from requiring and demanding a firsthand account or an actual knowledge, firsthand knowledge of the abuse or the misuse of issues in the intelligence community, to now where they can have secondhand information. If you look at the whistle-blower report, even besides the transcript and everything else, comparing the two is really interesting, because it seems to be a very well-written document, multisourced. If this was a piece for The New York Times or The Washington Post, that's not -- be what you expect. But you don't expect this and what comes in the form as a legal document accusing the president of doing something in a legal fashion and doing so from secondhand information. Now, as we go forward here, is that going to be the standard that has been changed now in the intelligence community where basically anybody there can take any report that they want to over the watercooler, wherever, and decide to file a complaint? This is more serious than this. This president and our country deserves better than what we're seeing right here."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "They may deserve better, but, Congressmen, that's not what's happening. The Democrats are in charge, and they are going to be investigating this. And they want the president out of office. What are you going to do about it, as the ranking member of Judiciary?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Well, it's been a really interesting week, because it seems like the Judiciary Committee, as they -- again, in this ramrod that Speaker Pelosi, in, frankly, just degradation of the House rules, is saying now, well, we're going to do an inquiry with not being an inquiry into the Intelligence Committee. We're going to keep following the rules. But we're also going to say this. In just the next few weeks, I think we're going to see the inspector general report of the Department of Justice come out. We're going to go back to the real area that we need to be concentrating on here is how this actually got started. Hopefully, the Senate will be having hearings. And I know Lindsey Graham will be doing that. And we will be looking at this. And they're going to have to deal with the entire picture. They're rushing to judgment, Maria. Keep this clearly in mind. They're rushing to judgment because they know time is running out. And they're desperate for this president not to win next year."

      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Well, the accountability, I think, is coming. You see all of the major players are continuing to scramble, making up stories on how they were really just doing their job. It sounds very similar to, oh, I didn't do anything. Don't look over here. I think Bill Barr, the inspector general, Mr. Durham are all looking into this. And I do believe that this is coming. And this accountability will happen, Maria. We have been talking about it a long time, but it's time to stop the -- basically, the harassment of this president."

Meanwhile, we want to take a look at Iran right now. Iran is blasting the United States for restricting the movements of prime minister -- Javad Zarif during his visit to the United Nations. Tensions are escalating in the Middle East following the strikes on the Saudi Arabian oil facilities. The U.S., Saudi Arabia and other allies are blaming Tehran for that attack, and warning from President Trump during his address to the General Assembly last week, calling in world leaders to act against Iran's -- quote -- \"bloodlust.\" Joining us right now is the former prime minister of Qatar. He is Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. He's also the former minister of foreign affairs of Qatar. And, Mr. Prime Minister, it's good to see you again. Thanks very much for joining us."

    {
      "speaker": "AL THANI",
      "utterance": "I don't have the fact of this. But I think all the tension in the region, it is related to each others, from Yemen, to Lebanon, to Syria, to Iraq, to the tension between the U.S. and Iran. I think all this is related together. And there is acts from both sides."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "What -- if you were to find out definitively that Iran was behind that, would you push back against Iran? Because we know that one of the issues in terms of Qatar and the boycott that we have seen among the GCC countries was because of Qatar's support of Muslim Brotherhood, of Iran."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AL THANI",
      "utterance": "Well, let me tell you one thing. When all this started -- the boycott started again Qatar, the siege started, we have no ambassador in Tehran, and we have no diplomatic relation with Tehran, because we were supporting the Saudis at that time, and we pull our ambassador from Tehran. So anyone would like to say that we have a different relation with Iran than the other neighbors that's part of the lies which they did against Qatar, and, by now, everybody know that. I think there is many GCC countries have more -- better relation with Iran than Qatar, especially that we have a major difference with them about Syria. But we always, we always have been in opinion in that the problem with Iran have to be solved diplomatically and through negotiation between the GCC and Iran. I don't think that we should try to see if there is a tension with the United States and we ride in the same seat. I think this tension with the United States, it seems to me, it's an opportunity for the GCC to arrive to a solution with the Iranian, and that basic -- that no interference on both sides."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

Do you blame the United States in any way for Iran's provocations because of the pullout of the Iran nuclear deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AL THANI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think to pull out of agreement, it's not -- not something usually respected, because if you have done an agreement with Iran, I think both sides have to fulfill their agreements. And we know that United States pull out. And when they pull out, they say why they want to pull out. And I think with the Iranian and with their policy -- and we are talking about intelligent people in Iran dealing in this matter -- it should be done differently. I think if there's worries with the United States and the region about some of the points in this agreement, or they need to extend it for a few years, I think there is a different approach to the Iranians than the approach which has been taken now."

And I always say, we would like to see a peaceful neighborhood. And for us to touch anything against the law or international law is something not accepted and dangerous."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "AL THANI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, first of all, the -- serious diplomatic dialogue is important. Unity of the GCC could help. And there is no unity in the GCC now to lead negotiation, like what we did with Yemen when Ali Saleh stepped down. There was a GCC opinion in that, and there was an initiative from there. Our problem now, the GCC is broke down almost. And, also, we didn't have same understanding or same ideas about how we can tackle the problems in the region."

      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "That's outrageous. He's gone rogue? The whistle-blower complaint is basically a compilation of secondhand information from the press and secondhand information about what the man claims he was told, period. The notion that, somehow, he didn't handle that properly, there's a long memo saying, essentially, that the I.G., the inspector general, to whom this document was sent, had absolutely no obligation to transmit it to Congress, because he's the inspector general for the intelligence community. And the president is not a member of the intelligence community. He's not the Lone Ranger. He is the inspector general for the intelligence community."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "But why would the president say to the Ukraine president, I'm going to have Bill Barr call you? You know, even -- even Bill Barr was upset -- or, apparently, reportedly, annoyed that he was put into the same bucket as President Trump's personal lawyer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Look, why he said it, I have no idea. But he is known for having occasionally an indiscreet relationship with the English language. There's no doubt about that. But the point is Mr. Barr never talked to the Ukrainians. The president never talked to Bill Barr about talking to the Ukrainians. There's a press release from the Justice Department that came out the same day as the conversation that says that. It says also, by the way, that this matter and the underlying investigation of who provided information to the FBI about Manafort, and whether any of that was done unlawfully, that's being investigated by John Durham."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Correct. His first reference in the conversation, when he says, \"I need a favor,\" it wasn't a reference to Biden at all. It was a reference to the server, i.e., the Democratic National Committee server, and why that wasn't turned over to the FBI and so on. Had nothing whatever to do with Joe Biden."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "All right. We should take a short break. And then we're going to come back with Attorney General Michael Mukasey. I have got to get your take on how you see this in terms of, did the president do anything wrong? Did Hunter Biden and Vice President Biden do anything wrong? And, also, what about Horowitz and Durham? When are we going to see the latest there? So, stay with us. More with Attorney General Michael Mukasey next."

      "utterance": "Welcome back. As we told you earlier, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is slamming Attorney General William Barr over the DOJ's handling to have whistle-blower complaint. Earlier, I said she says he went rogue. She wants him to recuse himself. Should Bill Barr be recusing himself in all things related to Ukraine?"

      "utterance": "On what basis?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "I mean, her response is, I guess, because I said so. The president said in this -- in the transcript that he was going to talk to Barr, and ask him to call the Ukraine. There was a press release issued by the Department of Justice the same day that the conversation came out saying that the president never talked to Barr about the Ukraine, that Barr never talked to the Ukraine about Biden or anything else. That's the end of it. There is no basis for him recusing himself, based on a statement by the president that he was going to talk to him."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

      "speaker": "MUKASEY",

The fact is that his son apparently got a job with a Ukrainian gas company, a business he knew nothing about, with no demonstrable credential, other than that he was Joe Biden's son. Joe Biden also demanded that a prosecutor be fired who was investigating that company."
