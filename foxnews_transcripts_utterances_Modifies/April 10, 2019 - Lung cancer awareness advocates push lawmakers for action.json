Pietropola had been raped, strangled, and shot three times in the head. Seethaler had been strangled, slashed with a bottle and shot twice.

Then last year the Virginia Beach police cold case unit got a strong lead. And with the help of the FBI, naval investigators and New York police the evidence began to mount. And now our corporate cousin the New York Post is reporting that police have used advanced DNA technology to link 80-year-old Ernest Broadnax to the murders of the two 19-year-olds. Broadnax who lives in Queens reportedly also made admissions that connected him to the crime. In 1990, Broadnax was convicted for burglary and spent two years in an upstate New York prison. No word if he might also be connected to other killings in Virginia Beach. So far, he has been charged with two counts of murder, one count of rape. Martha?",

He is suggesting that an American political campaign was subjected to unfair tactics by either the FBI, the intelligence community. Let me just say quickly, he did try to walk back some of this. He said, it's not talking about the FBI, but the intelligence community more generally. And that he's really interested in the predicate. You said, he's talking about the elite."

And I want to get to something that you raised which Lindsey Graham also raised today in just a second. What I'm trying to figure out is why -- is how Bill Barr went so quickly from being someone that was sort of perceived on both sides as a straight shooter, a lawyer's lawyer, as you heard from Jennifer Rubin there who now says that he is a corrupt -- it has been corrupted by someone who wants to be a dictator. Now, what would Bill Barr's motivation be exactly? He's done this job before, he -- you know, took it on basically. He's -- you know, and probably not going to go from here to running for office or any other politically. What do you think his motivation would be to sort of throw his reputation out the window?"

And I think, Bill Barr is playing to Donald Trump. He is satisfying the Trump argument and this could be part of what's coming in terms of the Mueller report release. And it could be simply the spin here which is ignore the Mueller report. This is all trash and it was caused by people who were unfairly and for political reasons, going after Donald Trump."

And whether or not it backs up when he says. But another question was raised by Lindsey Graham that I want to get your thoughts on: is why -- if they started a counterintelligence investigation, which we know was started by FBI agent Peter Strzok in July of 2016, around the same time that the dossier showed up at the FBI. Why would they not have come to the Trump campaign and said, \"We got a problem here, Mr. Trump, and we'd like to let you know what we think might be going on because we want to stop it."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, we didn't -- that the American people, but also the FBI and the intelligence agencies did not know to what degree the Trump campaign had been penetrated by the Russians. So, it was an open question. So, you can't come and say, \"Oh, Mr. Trump.\" They wanted to try to help arguably Mr. Trump by finding out what they could prove before they went to him and said, \"Hey, we've got a problem.\" You can't just go stirring up suspicions without some foundation."

You know, for two years, Donald Trump and his reputation and taken a beating. Bang, bang, bang, punch after punch. Today, Bill Barr, turned the wheel and said there was spying going on. And it wasn't by the Trump administration it was maybe by the Obama administration, or the Obama FBI. But certainly, there are facts there, we know that Carter Page was wiretap by the FBI.

We all know that there was a surveillance going on. We know about Strzok and Page, and all that. What he is saying is based on what he has seen. And he's not done yet that there was spying going on.

I don't think if it was a foreign intelligence community or domestic, we'll ever know about it. That stuff is always kept below the radar. But if it was the FBI and it appears it was; if it was pursuant to a FISA warrant, and it appears it was, then it was lawful.

That's where he's going. He's a lawyer and he knows what door he is knocking on. I don't know how this is going to end obviously. There must have been some evidence or the belief on the part of some of Bob Mueller's team, of evidence of obstruction.

So Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez says that if you're trying to figure out the reasons behind the rush at our southern border, you need to understand this. She tweets, the far-right loves to drum up fear and resistance to immigrants. But have you ever noticed that they never talk about what's causing people to flee their homes in the first place?

But did you ever notice that the same leaders denying climate change are the ones drumming up fear and hatred against migrants, hatred with horrific consequences? We know their argument aligns in the real world. Immigration builds our economies. Wealthy countries are already facing age in populations and seriously taking on climate change will create millions more jobs than there are workers to fill them. But it's not about the truth.

What's happened in El Salvador and Honduras and in Guatemala, there's been a drought so there's been no harvest for the past year so the farmers have gone to cities, they're dealing with criminal gangs, and guess what they say, we're out of here. We're heading north. Is the United States the place that they need to go to kind of resolve their problems? No, or at least that's debatable.

It's almost impossible to get deported. Just last month there were more than 100,000 people who tried to cross our southern border that we either repelled or apprehended and the numbers are just staggering. But it's not because there was a drought. I understand that people are suffering and it's terrible to live down there. No doubt the United States of America is the greatest country on the face of the planet but you -- the messaging that the Democrats are putting out there is take this horrific trek, put your life at risk is the wrong message."

That's one of the arguments that's made. You can take a look at it at leap -- theleap.com and you know, see what you think of the argument. Another big development this week, Richard, is the shake-up that happened at Homeland Security. And staying with AOC as she's known for a moment here, this is something that she tweeted about that. She said in stealing thousands of children deporting their parents and refusing to provide info for reunification, Secretary Nielsen oversaw one of the largest human scale -- human rights violations in recent history. Awarding her a lucrative deal or prestigious post is to delegitimize and celebrate that abuse. And she was retweeting something from someone else with that.

On the day they were supposed to go back home to Pittsburgh the women missed their checkout time and an employee peeked inside the cottage and found their bodies. Pietropola had been raped, strangled, and shot three times in the head. Seethaler had been strangled, slashed with a bottle and shot twice.

And over the next 12 years, eight other women, all white, all attractive all between 18 and 25 were murdered in the same area. DNA was recovered from the original murder site and at least two others. Then last year the Virginia Beach police cold case unit got a strong lead. And with the help of the FBI, naval investigators and New York police the evidence began to mount. And now our corporate cousin the New York Post is reporting that police have used advanced DNA technology to link 80-year-old Ernest Broadnax to the murders of the two 19-year-olds. Broadnax who lives in Queens reportedly also made admissions that connected him to the crime. In 1990, Broadnax was convicted for burglary and spent two years in an upstate New York prison. No word if he might also be connected to other killings in Virginia Beach. So far, he has been charged with two counts of murder, one count of rape. Martha?"

Thirty-one-year-old Sergeant Benjamin Hines of York, Pennsylvania, a marine since 2006. He'd been deployed overseas multiple times including to Iraq. And 25-year-old Corporal Robert Hendriks of Locust Valley, New York. He joined the Marines right after high school and was set to come home this month. His mother notes that he loved what he did and was more than willing to die for his country. We thank them for their service. The three were hit with an improvised explosive device while conducting combat operations north of Kabul. That is our “Story” for tonight. Tucker Carlson is up next.
