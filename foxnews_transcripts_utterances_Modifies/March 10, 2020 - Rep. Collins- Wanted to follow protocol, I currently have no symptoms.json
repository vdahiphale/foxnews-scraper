You're looking at the Dow Jones industrial average closing above 1,100, even as the coronavirus fears continue to flare up and President Trump trying to calm things down.  Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"  President Trump meeting with the Republicans on Capitol Hill this afternoon and trying to hammer out a stimulus plan to keep the economy from slumping.  Senator John Kennedy wasn't convinced those tax cuts were needed going into that meeting. How does he feel now? We will ask him. We will also talk to Congressman Doug Collins. He's one of six lawmakers self-quarantined after coming in contact with the coronavirus. He also came in contact with the president.  That interview is just moments away. First, FOX team coverage with Jackie DeAngelis on the stock market staging a remarkable comeback, and John Roberts at the White House, where the battle against the virus is taking center stage.  We began with Jackie.",

      "sentences": "Good afternoon to you, Charles. Well, it was another roller-coaster day, but at least on the right side of the ride, right? Stocks finishing up more than 1,000 points higher, passing through those session highs, but not without bouncing around. This was all after a 2,000-point drop yesterday, that continued fear about the coronavirus, and a huge plunge in oil prices.   So let's look at the play-by-play here. The open was strong. Then we had some uncertainty creeping in, the Dow turning negative actually, but a midday rebound after Vice President Mike Pence said the biggest health insurers would cover coronavirus testing. Strong rally here into the close as well. Much of today's optimism, it was on stimulus hopes from Washington to help combat the economic fallout from the virus, things like a payroll tax cut, paid sick leave for hourly workers, help for small business owners, and even maybe a targeted approach for hard-hit industries like cruise lines and airlines, so watching for that. Then, of course, there's oil. So after that massive 25 percent plunge yesterday, it bounced back by more than 8 percent today, but lingering under $35 a barrel. So there's a question mark there. And gold giving back more than $20 of its recent gains. That's a little unwind of what we call the safety trade on Wall Street.  Finally, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note recovering slightly. It's a sign of a little pause, a gasp of air, if you will.   Now, for stocks today, technology, financials, consumer discretionary stocks, they all led the rally today. Half of the Dow's move higher came from Apple, Home Depot, McDonald's, Microsoft, all companies with very significant exposure to China. But, Charles, the uncertainty remains. That is the problem on Wall Street right now. And we're going to have to continue to watch this.",

He talked about a possible full exclusion of the payroll tax cut. That would be for employees and employers, basically taking the 12.4 percent payroll, or FICA withholding, is it's called, down to zero. The president also, I'm told, likes the idea of making that permanent. You say, well, wait a second. Where do you get the money from to replace that? Apparently, there's some idea there's some idea that they could backfill it from general revenues.  The president also talked about expanding paid leave, loans to small businesses and tax relief for industries hit hard, including potentially some relief for the shale oil and gas industry.  No real plans for senators to sign off on, though, at this point, just a series of ideas. Here's what the treasury secretary said about it:",

The city itself has activated its emergency operations center, so that we are ready to coordinate with the Guard and with other state authorities, to whatever degree they recommend and whatever degree would be constructive. Hand sanitizer. As you know, the state has created its own brand of hand sanitizer, and a significant shipment of that sanitizer has been brought to New Rochelle. The city is now coordinating with the state in order to deliver that sanitizer to large institutions in New Rochelle, principally those, but not exclusively those, that serve senior citizens.   However, the sanitizer is not as yet available to the general public. If and when that changes, we will certainly make an effort to get the word out. As you know, several days ago, it was announced that nursing homes and assisted living facilities within New Rochelle would no longer be able to accept visitors. We recognize this is a hardship for many people in our community. In fact, it affects my own family. My mother is presently at one of the nursing rehabilitation facilities in New Rochelle. My brothers and I are not able to visit her. It's painful for us, painful for her. But we all recognize it is in the service of critical public health goals.   We know that seniors, those with compromised immune systems, compromised respiratory systems are at the greatest risk as a result of this virus. We want to do everything possible to make sure that the virus doesn't spread to these vulnerable populations.  Our senior center, the Hugh Doyle Senior Center, will be closed until further notice for the same reason. However, we will be delivering cold meals to vulnerable seniors beginning on Thursday. That is one example of the fashion in which the city hopes to think comprehensively about how we can assist neighbors in need. Very important to reiterate the same reminder that we hear from the governor every single day. The vast majority of those who contract coronavirus will recover without difficulty and will recover without hospitalization.  It is a relatively small fraction of individuals, again, principally seniors and those with compromised health, who will face more difficult challenges. It is important to always to keep that in perspective. I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks and the thanks of all people in New Rochelle for the exceptional leadership that has been provided by Governor Cuomo, by County Executive Latimer, and by their respective public health officials.  We have been collaborating with them consistently since the beginning of this process. And we feel as though their attention and focus not only on the hot spot here in New Rochelle, but on the larger countywide and statewide challenges, has been exceptional.  I also want to express special thanks to the Young Israel of New Rochelle congregation. As many of you know, although this affects everyone in New Rochelle, the heaviest burdens have fallen upon the members of Young Israel.  And they have...",

They have been doing a little bit better today, but they have been tanking on news of the virus and have been the biggest threat to the economy since the 2008 financial crisis.

They're concerned about the election. They're concerned about tax policy.  And tax policy is something we're talking about today. And we know that most of the small businesses, most of Main Street, the last thing they want to see are higher taxes. That doesn't mean that lower taxes are going to solve all of our problems and they're going to deliver us the economic prosperity alone. They may not be the solution. But we want to see those combined with pro- growth policies. And I think everyone's concerned about how this is going to play out. What's going to be the impact on the deficit when this is all said and done, Charles? But I think, for now, we will relish on a positive note as the markets close today. And we're hoping this can be a start of some confidence coming back to the market. Uncertainty that you see on Wall Street shows up on Main Street.

Stocks finishing up more than 1,000 points higher, passing through those session highs, but not without bouncing around. This was all after a 2,000-point drop yesterday, that continued fear about the coronavirus, and a huge plunge in oil prices. So let's look at the play-by-play here. The open was strong. Then we had some uncertainty creeping in, the Dow turning negative actually, but a midday rebound after Vice President Mike Pence said the biggest health insurers would cover coronavirus testing. Strong rally here into the close as well. Much of today's optimism, it was on stimulus hopes from Washington to help combat the economic fallout from the virus, things like a payroll tax cut, paid sick leave for hourly workers, help for small business owners, and even maybe a targeted approach for hard-hit industries like cruise lines and airlines, so watching for that. Then, of course, there's oil. So after that massive 25 percent plunge yesterday, it bounced back by more than 8 percent today, but lingering under $35 a barrel. So there's a question mark there. And gold giving back more than $20 of its recent gains. That's a little unwind of what we call the safety trade on Wall Street. Finally, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note recovering slightly. It's a sign of a little pause, a gasp of air, if you will. Now, for stocks today, technology, financials, consumer discretionary stocks, they all led the rally today. Half of the Dow's move higher came from Apple, Home Depot, McDonald's, Microsoft, all companies with very significant exposure to China. But, Charles, the uncertainty remains. That is the problem on Wall Street right now. And we're going to have to continue to watch this."

The city itself has activated its emergency operations center, so that we are ready to coordinate with the Guard and with other state authorities, to whatever degree they recommend and whatever degree would be constructive. Hand sanitizer. As you know, the state has created its own brand of hand sanitizer, and a significant shipment of that sanitizer has been brought to New Rochelle. The city is now coordinating with the state in order to deliver that sanitizer to large institutions in New Rochelle, principally those, but not exclusively those, that serve senior citizens. However, the sanitizer is not as yet available to the general public. If and when that changes, we will certainly make an effort to get the word out. As you know, several days ago, it was announced that nursing homes and assisted living facilities within New Rochelle would no longer be able to accept visitors. We recognize this is a hardship for many people in our community. In fact, it affects my own family. My mother is presently at one of the nursing rehabilitation facilities in New Rochelle. My brothers and I are not able to visit her. It's painful for us, painful for her. But we all recognize it is in the service of critical public health goals. We know that seniors, those with compromised immune systems, compromised respiratory systems are at the greatest risk as a result of this virus. We want to do everything possible to make sure that the virus doesn't spread to these vulnerable populations. Our senior center, the Hugh Doyle Senior Center, will be closed until further notice for the same reason. However, we will be delivering cold meals to vulnerable seniors beginning on Thursday. That is one example of the fashion in which the city hopes to think comprehensively about how we can assist neighbors in need. Very important to reiterate the same reminder that we hear from the governor every single day. The vast majority of those who contract coronavirus will recover without difficulty and will recover without hospitalization. It is a relatively small fraction of individuals, again, principally seniors and those with compromised health, who will face more difficult challenges. It is important to always to keep that in perspective. I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks and the thanks of all people in New Rochelle for the exceptional leadership that has been provided by Governor Cuomo, by County Executive Latimer, and by their respective public health officials. We have been collaborating with them consistently since the beginning of this process. And we feel as though their attention and focus not only on the hot spot here in New Rochelle, but on the larger countywide and statewide challenges, has been exceptional. I also want to express special thanks to the Young Israel of New Rochelle congregation. As many of you know, although this affects everyone in New Rochelle, the heaviest burdens have fallen upon the members of Young Israel. And they have..."

But, again, we have seen this in the markets. The markets, well, they're up. They have been doing a little bit better today, but they have been tanking on news of the virus and have been the biggest threat to the economy since the 2008 financial crisis.

And I think we talk to small business owners all day long, and certainly they have become concerned. They're concerned about their health, their safety. They're concerned about the economy. They're concerned about the election. They're concerned about tax policy. And tax policy is something we're talking about today. And we know that most of the small businesses, most of Main Street, the last thing they want to see are higher taxes. That doesn't mean that lower taxes are going to solve all of our problems and they're going to deliver us the economic prosperity alone. They may not be the solution. But we want to see those combined with pro- growth policies. And I think everyone's concerned about how this is going to play out. What's going to be the impact on the deficit when this is all said and done, Charles? But I think, for now, we will relish on a positive note as the markets close today. And we're hoping this can be a start of some confidence coming back to the market. Uncertainty that you see on Wall Street shows up on Main Street. We got to stem that and keep people confident, because we live in a consumer-driven economy. And that's what's driven this economy so far, and that's what's going to drive it into the future."

I think you just had a previous guest that said the administration is not speaking with one voice. There couldn't be anything further from the truth. And I think what we got to do is, people who needs testing are the people who are sick. And they're -- anybody who is sick and showing symptoms are being able to be tested, and then we're taking appropriate measures from there. So, we wanted to make sure that we were doing what we needed to do. We're feeling good.

We were doing a lot of photos at that time. And we just wanted to make sure, though, that we took a precaution, because we are out in public.

I think Washington, D.C., has to continue. The administration has made a clear stance on what -- how we're fighting this virus, how we're doing in helping the states through the package that we passed last week of funding for this. But there is some concern on Washington, D.C., because in the week in which we're concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, unfortunately, the Democrats are putting a bill on there that would take the president's authority away to help do exactly what the president did, when he curtailed flights from China and other places. We have got to get better than this. And we have got to not use this as a politicized event, because people who are affected, especially seniors and vulnerable populations, are in a higher risk for long-term causes and death in this. So, we need to make sure that we're speaking with this, that people know what to do. Wash their hands.

There will be watched closely for the next 14 days, as will passengers who will be quarantined at three other military bases. This unused shipping terminal now a busy emergency triage site, with people lining up according to colors that they have been assigned.

What kind of preparation did they have? How many physicians were on there? And what was their specialty and what was their training? And were they prepared for respiratory ailments that would affect many dozens of passengers on that ship? And didn't they realize that, by keeping them confined in that environment, they would get sicker, rather than better? Or is it the fault of the government for not letting them land and disembark? Because the government is -- you're not going to like this, although Varney will -- immune from suing. The government has made itself immune. You can't sue the government for making a discretionary call, like, we're not going to let you come to San Francisco, but you're going to have to go to Oakland, where the dock is unused."

They're not doing this to keep healthy people in their home. They're doing this to help people who are ill and quarantined already to get essential items, like medicines, food, and for the National Guard to clean up public spaces.

What I think people in the United States we need to know is that this is very serious. We need to take this very seriously right now. Older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions, like heart disease, lung, or kidney disease, are really at risk for more serious illness or even death from COVID-19, which is the illness caused by coronavirus.

President Trump was supposed to speak today, canceled out. That's 45,000 people not taking flights, not taking cars from the airport, by the way, after possibly spending money at the airport, to the hotel, no hotel reservations, no revenues for the conference, no airplane back to home, or take an Uber back to their house also. So you're talking about a vicious cycle. And then fear tends to add up, and you have so many of these other conferences seeing the other conferences cancel, so they do it too. And you throw in the wealth effect, and you got some problems right here, and I suspect earnings are going to come down. And that's what you're seeing reflected in the market right now."
