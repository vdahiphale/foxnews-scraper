      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington tonight and as the New York Times reports, the possibility of a second whistleblower, two big revelations might be blowing holes into the first one 's case. A former CIA Station Chief will explain later on plus remember Burisma, that's the Ukrainian company that Hunter Biden got a sweetheart contract from. Well, it turns out that the Ukrainian government is interested in investigating them. Some breaking details on that tonight with Peter Sweitzer.  Also tonight AOC held a townhall in her district last night that quickly well, went off the rails. Raymond Arroyo has all the highlights and more in Friday follies. But first we want to explain to you exactly what is going on the very latest. In last night's “Angle,” we showed you how time after time, the Democrats hype and hyperbole keep blowing up in their faces.  Everything is a crisis, every minute of the day it's a new crisis. You've got to watch, this time the President - well, you know how it goes. It's almost as if we telegraph their next move last night though because they ramped up a new merit in just after we went off the air.  Late last night Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, Elijah Cummings and Eliot Engel raised a tranche of cherrypicked text messages from former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker. Now without a complete transcript of Volker's testimony, these partisan arsonists knew darn well that these texts were out of context. And by looking at them just in isolation, they would paint the most damning picture imaginable. They threw chime in the water and of course they watched the media and the deep state sharks circle.",

Well, sources are already telling Fox, it completely appends the left's narrative here. First, Volker testified that Ukraine wasn't pressured to investigate the Bidens. They never raise the issue of a quid pro quo and they didn't see Trumps July 25 call as in anyway inappropriate. \"At no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate Former Vice President Biden.\" And that's not all Volker also said Ukrainian led investigations of both the 2016 election and Burisma where Hunter Biden served on the board would not be improper. Finally he also testified that President Trump's concerns about Ukrainian corruption were completely valid, given the history of that country. Now we know full well, why Schiff and his pals released those text messages. They knew the narrative they were pushing was going to take a hit by Volker's own testimony.  As we said last night, these Democrats think it's fine to yell fire in a crowded theater and the theater is America so long as their political opponents get tarred in the process, no problem. Here to responds, Sol Wisenberg, former Deputy Independent Counsel, Fox news contributor and Robert Driscoll, former DOJ official.   Sol, how damaging is Volcker's testimony to just to focus for a moment on the quid pro quo narrative that was sold relentlessly?",

That's simply asserting a legal right and that right may have to be vindicated in court at some point but Sol's exactly right that the Democrats don't want to do that because it wouldn't be resolved until the next election anyway and the whole point of impeachment is to get impeachment out in front of the election.

Their power increases a little bit if it weren't an impeachment inquiry and so I think they're going to be on weaker ground. Part of Trump's defense in the tax return litigation collaterally has been that Congress is essentially trying to usurp law enforcement function and there's no legislative purpose to what they're doing.

Well, that's not all. Today Intel community IG Michael Atkinson revealed the whistleblower did not disclose the fact that he or she contacted Adam Schiff's aides. He also said the whistleblower had a prior working relationship with a \"prominent Democrat.\" What does that mean? I mean, does this damage the credibility of the entire complaint.

So I think that that's a positive spin on that. You're absolutely right, if any person said something based on statistics, if somebody said we should only police in black neighborhoods because they commit the majority of crimes, which by statistics would be accurate. Black Americans account for 13 percent of the population but commit over 50 percent of all the homicides in this nation, that fact would be called racist. If we said we should only have black police officers because we don't want white police officers getting killed when they are committing more of the homicides, that fact would be considered racist.

It's almost as if we telegraph their next move last night though because they ramped up a new merit in just after we went off the air.

They never raise the issue of a quid pro quo and they didn't see Trumps July 25 call as in anyway inappropriate. \"At no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate Former Vice President Biden.\" And that's not all Volker also said Ukrainian led investigations of both the 2016 election and Burisma where Hunter Biden served on the board would not be improper. Finally he also testified that President Trump's concerns about Ukrainian corruption were completely valid, given the history of that country. Now we know full well, why Schiff and his pals released those text messages. They knew the narrative they were pushing was going to take a hit by Volker's own testimony.

That's simply asserting a legal right and that right may have to be vindicated in court at some point but Sol's exactly right that the Democrats don't want to do that because it wouldn't be resolved until the next election anyway and the whole point of impeachment is to get impeachment out in front of the election.

There's some debate if that's what ultimately happens, if the White House says we don't - you know, we don't call this legitimate, you need to have a vote which basically they've said, is that risky gamble because they it may be force the hand and he definitely is impeached or do you think it doesn't matter?"

We authorize looking into it. What it says to me is, despite the head counts I see on television is that they don't have the votes to do that. Is it constitutionally required? No, but I think it really lessens the legitimacy and brings home the illegitimacy of what the Democrats are doing. I think they're going to lose - lose a lot not only in the public arena but if these matters do get litigated in court, I could very easily see a court saying you know what? Is this an impeachment inquiry or 5 different committees where you all the sudden sit up and say - you said, we're calling in an impeachment?

They can't just - they aren't free roaming investigators to just investigate whatever they want. Their power increases a little bit if it weren't an impeachment inquiry and so I think they're going to be on weaker ground. Part of Trump's defense in the tax return litigation collaterally has been that Congress is essentially trying to usurp law enforcement function and there's no legislative purpose to what they're doing. And I think that though you have that, we'll see that argument again if the House doesn't have a vote at least authorizing an impeachment inquiry, which also by the way would then give Republicans presumably certain rights to call their own witnesses."

We were years away from another Presidential campaign. We have a Presidential campaign a year away. That's why it smells of politics. If you don't like Trump, don't support him, don't vote for him.

First, former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker's testimony contradicted the whistleblower complaint against the President. Now we noted earlier that he told Congress, \"At no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden.\" But the whistleblower claimed Volker advised Ukrainians on how to navigate Trump's demand to do that. Well, that's not all. Today Intel community IG Michael Atkinson revealed the whistleblower did not disclose the fact that he or she contacted Adam Schiff's aides. He also said the whistleblower had a prior working relationship with a \"prominent Democrat.\" What does that mean? I mean, does this damage the credibility of the entire complaint. Joining me now is Scott , former CIA Station Chief who served for a dozen years at various really important overseas posts. Scott, you are back extremely worried that this entire ordeal could damage the CIA's credibility. Why?"

This individual a mid-level functionary thought he could basically put the President on report and not face any kind of professional examination afterwards. I think this shows that the climate of the CIA and other government agencies has become excessively partisan and liberal."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to say there's also now an attempt to completely cast off the need for a quid pro quo Scott. So initially it was quid pro quo - quid pro quo. Now that's completely falling apart so this is what Rachel Maddow said about the need for it, watch."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, he never said help me in my election campaign. He was talking about corruption in general. We've read the transcript like three times on the air.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "UEHLINGER",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Rachel Maddow has an extremely tenuous grasp on reality, I would say at this point. Exactly. The President was merely exercising his options as dictated by the constitution to conduct foreign policy. In fact nothing he said had anything to do with intelligence in any way, shape or form. And by definition that is the type of - that is the type of revelations that justify an intelligence IG report. This report should never have been made because Trump was not discussing intelligence."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Zelensky came to power with a strong financial backing of a Ukrainian oligarch named Kolomoyskyi. Kolomoyskyi is widely believed in Ukraine to be partly involved in fact own Burisma so the notion that the Zelensky government or prosecutors working for him would actually investigate a company that their chief backers involved in I think is remote. That's why we need to have the Department of Justice and Americans at the helm of this investigation to find out exactly what went on."

People have to also realize, they're not dealing with you know, extremely sophisticated developed countries with levels of checks and balances. These are still in some ways renegade you know, former Soviet Republics and they're trying to find their way."

      "speaker": "SCHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "No, that's a great point Laura. Both in the case of China and Ukraine, these two countries were Hunter Biden cashed in. They are two of the most corrupt countries in the world. Somebody made the statement once that what goes on Ukraine would make a Nigerian blush because of Nigeria's reputation for corruption. So the notion that there's going to be some kind of you know serious detached investigation is just simply not going to happen so I think that has to be factored in and that's why I think it's right to get the Department of Justice involved in this."

So that means that what she's saying -- and what she said actually later was no, I'm not saying that no white people should be involved in doing this job in this crime lab.

So I think that that's a positive spin on that. You're absolutely right, if any person said something based on statistics, if somebody said we should only police in black neighborhoods because they commit the majority of crimes, which by statistics would be accurate. Black Americans account for 13 percent of the population but commit over 50 percent of all the homicides in this nation, that fact would be called racist. If we said we should only have black police officers because we don't want white police officers getting killed when they are committing more of the homicides, that fact would be considered racist. Her comment was racist, her comment was inexcusable, and I'm really happy that black Americans are speaking out and saying I do not care if the show was on the other foot. Racism is racism."

This is not only tragic, it's an example of how the left's narrative is poisoning the minds of our kids. What happened in this case is a 12-year-old black girl claimed that three white boys pinned her to the ground, cut her dreadlocks with scissors. The girl's family admitted it wasn't true, they issued a heartfelt apology. To be clear, I do not blame the children. This is a child. I do take issue with adults who tried to use this hoax to push their agenda right off the bat with no investigation, like the NAACP tried to do. First, they tried to cover up the hoax, claiming the family reached a private resolution with the school. Next the group said in a statement that, regrettably, the assault turned out to be false. Regrettably? What is that regrettable? We should be happy she wasn't assaulted. Candace, why would the NAACP try to skate past this hoax or, as some would say, even cover it up?"

My heart genuinely goes out to this girl. She is watching all of her idles. She's watching a media narrative that is being spun that is telling black Americans that what they should aspire to is victimhood, and that is what needs to be reversed, and that's what needs to be talked about, and that is not a narrative that the NAACP ever wants to be talked about, because there would be no need for them to exist."

Most kids aren't even paying attention to skin color. They are beyond that. My kids are. They don't care about that. But what about this, Monique? What does this tell us about the reaction, that people want to be it's true, seems to be, on the left, they want t believe it's true, and they are disappointed when it's not true."

Not when they were in Africa, not when they were in the United States. This one time when this young girl said something happened to her and everybody jumped to her defense and believed her, I'm glad they jumped to her defense, I'm glad they believed her.
