So everything you walk back from that was the last half of it was a straw man as if we were debating about whether we should get out of Afghanistan or not.  That litigation has been done for quite some time. And he also presented a false choice of either you have to leave or you have to escalate and built around that straw man as well. So, for me, it was a lot of blaming. I mean, who did he blame? He spent a quarter of the speech blaming Donald Trump for where he is and then blaming U.S. citizens for not doing enough to get out of the country. I also go back to where he started. He talked about only the U.S. would have had the capacity to do something of this size and scale. And he emphasized the numbers time and time again although we'll get to the number of U.S. citizens because there is something very revealing there.  To which I think a lot of Americans looked into their television screen and said, only the United States would have had the capacity to not have to do it this way. There were so many decisions that led us to this point that we -- decision points we could have made.  And I keep going back to the consensus point that you made yesterday, Greg, as if this was a consensus for an extremely successful mission. White washing over the entire reality of how we got where we were to include the new revelation that the Taliban had offered us to secure Kabul. We had been given the opportunity to secure Kabul weeks ago before the Taliban entered and we declined. So there was no attrition -- contrition, meaning. There was no recognition that mistakes were made. Instead, he doubled down on what I believe is a false narrative and a false choice.",

And we talked about this. No one is upset with the troops and no one is upset with the decision. He was -- and, you know, with the thing that kind of, you know, talking about the casualties of war. He went through this. No one disputes. The cost of war is understood. We're focused actually on the cost of incompetence. Everybody understands that war is hell. We have friends that are missing limbs. We have missing friends. So when he goes through that, its lik, no, it's not about that. It's about your damned incompetence. It's like yes, we wanted to go on the maiden voyage of the Titanic. We didn't expect you to hit the iceberg, right?   He's conflating these things. And he also conflated like, it was a weird situation for him to take credit for this extraordinary success while at the same time blaming Trump. So he's got this weird thing -- he's got it all backwards. The decision that Trump made is correct. The follow through is abysmal.  What he's doing is the opposite. He's saying the decision is bad but look at what I did. I really got us out of this mess. You got us out of a mess that you created.

So what happened is, he had the expectations of the Taliban being confronted by the Afghan army, did not happen. Then he had already evacuated all the American troops, had the civilians or the most vulnerable people had been left behind, the warriors had been shipped out. Then they had to re-ship in other warriors to protect the civilians.

I know that they're trying to clean this up and figure out some kind of solution to this disaster they have created by, you know, their dispute about what the military generals said and did not say. A number of them would say that they told the president including a number of U.S. Senators that the Afghan army was not prepared. That's also part of this big question about being in Afghanistan for 20 years and this lie that was propped up that the Afghan army was capable of fighting off the military. But in terms of moving forward with diplomacy when it comes to talking to the Taliban through diplomatic channels that aren't even in Afghanistan, they're in another country, is just completely opposite of the reality on the ground.  They are hanging people from our helicopters. We have video of the Taliban going door-to-door to execute translators and interpreters who helped us. Women are at the very bottom of the list when it comes to -- especially girls -- when it comes to rights in Afghanistan. I was talking to a Marine friend today who said those -- a lot of the girls are probably being sold off to men as we speak. We know that as the Taliban was coming through all these villages. They were taking a number of women from their families and forcing them to get married including, of course, underage girls. So this idea that they can talk their way out of this in terms of diplomacy now, it's just a dishonest way of looking at it. I think, broadly speaking as we move forward with this, the administration talks a lot about diplomacy in a number of areas. Well, diplomacy is the way that we deal with nuclear Iran. Diplomacy is the way we deal with China and Russia without these conditions that we've seen. And I think the future for those girls, but also the future of a foreign policy and the safety of America is at stake if they're going to pin it on talking to people rather than having some kind of force behind the words.",

And now it's gone from stranded to abandon even though we say that we'll do everything we can, and I hope we do. And I'm glad for the Americans that were able to get here. I also understand that there might be some people that made some really tough decisions about what they might have to leave behind. Parents being one of them. And if they were targeted themselves, for example, some of these interpreters who -- that is the actually the number I think that is really abysmal. The administration won't give you any numbers on how many interpreters they got out. And I have a feeling it's because it's really, really small, talking to our Pentagon reporters today. You know, celebrating the withdrawal while seeking credit for it, but yet we have these Americans and allies left behind is just -- it's a very hard thing to thread.

But if you go back to what Obama's kind of policy was, in foreign policy, when Joe Biden was the vice president, you see this theme running through of denying the reality, focusing on diplomacy. You look at Iran and the nuclear agreement. They don't want to have conditions. You saw the Houthis in Yemen, which is another terrorist organization earlier this year. They took the terrorists label off of them to the State Department. And ever since then, all they've been doing is issuing statements about how they shouldn't be bombing people at airports. And so, I think that's where we are. We're back to this ideology of not accepting the reality that people want to kill us.

He started by -- he ended by saying we have a future that is safer, which anyone who is looking what's happening right now knows this is fundamentally not true. So everything you walk back from that was the last half of it was a straw man as if we were debating about whether we should get out of Afghanistan or not. That litigation has been done for quite some time. And he also presented a false choice of either you have to leave or you have to escalate and built around that straw man as well. So, for me, it was a lot of blaming. I mean, who did he blame? He spent a quarter of the speech blaming Donald Trump for where he is and then blaming U.S. citizens for not doing enough to get out of the country. I also go back to where he started. He talked about only the U.S. would have had the capacity to do something of this size and scale. And he emphasized the numbers time and time again although we'll get to the number of U.S. citizens because there is something very revealing there. To which I think a lot of Americans looked into their television screen and said, only the United States would have had the capacity to not have to do it this way. There were so many decisions that led us to this point that we -- decision points we could have made. And I keep going back to the consensus point that you made yesterday, Greg, as if this was a consensus for an extremely successful mission. White washing over the entire reality of how we got where we were to include the new revelation that the Taliban had offered us to secure Kabul. We had been given the opportunity to secure Kabul weeks ago before the Taliban entered and we declined. So there was no attrition -- contrition, meaning. There was no recognition that mistakes were made. Instead, he doubled down on what I believe is a false narrative and a false choice."

What they're trying to do is redefine the outrage against the president as directed against the decision to leave and the achievement of the troops so that if you are mad about this, you're actually scorning -- keeping scorn on the troops when it's really obvious. And we talked about this. No one is upset with the troops and no one is upset with the decision. He was -- and, you know, with the thing that kind of, you know, talking about the casualties of war. He went through this. No one disputes. The cost of war is understood. We're focused actually on the cost of incompetence. Everybody understands that war is hell. We have friends that are missing limbs. We have missing friends. So when he goes through that, its lik, no, it's not about that. It's about your damned incompetence. It's like yes, we wanted to go on the maiden voyage of the Titanic. We didn't expect you to hit the iceberg, right? He's conflating these things. And he also conflated like, it was a weird situation for him to take credit for this extraordinary success while at the same time blaming Trump. So he's got this weird thing -- he's got it all backwards. The decision that Trump made is correct. The follow through is abysmal. What he's doing is the opposite. He's saying the decision is bad but look at what I did. I really got us out of this mess. You got us out of a mess that you created. The bigger airlift in history is your way a papering over a mission that you screwed up for reasons that we can't begin to understand because you've screwed up on every decision point."

You know, this was, as the \"National Review\" says, a catastrophic success.

How could you be so confident conversely that the Afghan army would fight, that you would hang your entire policy on the expectation of a decent interval? That the Afghan army would fight, you get people out in an orderly fashion and then at some point the Afghan army would exhaust itself and the Taliban would ultimately win and they wouldn't blame Biden because it happened two years after he pulled the troops out. So what happened is, he had the expectations of the Taliban being confronted by the Afghan army, did not happen. Then he had already evacuated all the American troops, had the civilians or the most vulnerable people had been left behind, the warriors had been shipped out. Then they had to re-ship in other warriors to protect the civilians. So it was a real, you know, a massive, massive screw-up that they did a pretty good job of cleaning up by the end, but it doesn't undo all of the horror that happened initially."

You took away the air support. They did melt away and we are where we are. Katie, you can comment on that, but also, I just want to play this for you in terms of the issue about Afghan girls.

      "utterance": "It's a really naive point of view. I know that they're trying to clean this up and figure out some kind of solution to this disaster they have created by, you know, their dispute about what the military generals said and did not say. A number of them would say that they told the president including a number of U.S. Senators that the Afghan army was not prepared. That's also part of this big question about being in Afghanistan for 20 years and this lie that was propped up that the Afghan army was capable of fighting off the military. But in terms of moving forward with diplomacy when it comes to talking to the Taliban through diplomatic channels that aren't even in Afghanistan, they're in another country, is just completely opposite of the reality on the ground. They are hanging people from our helicopters. We have video of the Taliban going door-to-door to execute translators and interpreters who helped us. Women are at the very bottom of the list when it comes to -- especially girls -- when it comes to rights in Afghanistan. I was talking to a Marine friend today who said those -- a lot of the girls are probably being sold off to men as we speak. We know that as the Taliban was coming through all these villages. They were taking a number of women from their families and forcing them to get married including, of course, underage girls. So this idea that they can talk their way out of this in terms of diplomacy now, it's just a dishonest way of looking at it. I think, broadly speaking as we move forward with this, the administration talks a lot about diplomacy in a number of areas. Well, diplomacy is the way that we deal with nuclear Iran. Diplomacy is the way we deal with China and Russia without these conditions that we've seen. And I think the future for those girls, but also the future of a foreign policy and the safety of America is at stake if they're going to pin it on talking to people rather than having some kind of force behind the words."

I think it was two hours later that \"The New York Times\" headline with their story that night was Americans are going to be stranded. And now it's gone from stranded to abandon even though we say that we'll do everything we can, and I hope we do. And I'm glad for the Americans that were able to get here. I also understand that there might be some people that made some really tough decisions about what they might have to leave behind. Parents being one of them. And if they were targeted themselves, for example, some of these interpreters who -- that is the actually the number I think that is really abysmal. The administration won't give you any numbers on how many interpreters they got out. And I have a feeling it's because it's really, really small, talking to our Pentagon reporters today. You know, celebrating the withdrawal while seeking credit for it, but yet we have these Americans and allies left behind is just -- it's a very hard thing to thread. I also think that the hopes that you hear from Blinken last night and his - - Secretary of State -- in his speech, he quoted the Taliban and their commitments and the things that they have signed on to. And it has to be more than a hope and a prayer for that to get done. The other thing is, Jake Sullivan said it this morning. The White House press secretary just repeated it. They continue to say that there's nobody on the ground in Afghanistan, nobody, that has the capability or capacity to hit the American homeland. I hope that is true."

I thought that she really went over trying to convince us and I don't disbelieve her that the vast majority of Americans are out and that they are reasonably certain that through the Qataris and others, they can negotiate the release of any other Americans who want to leave. Just two quick other points I want to make. One is that Biden, during his speech, emphasized the hundreds of millions of dollars every day that we spend in Afghanistan, $2 trillion. And he also said pointing out and that's why we honor people like Major Hegseth, that only 1 percent of the American people serve in the military and that he does not want to send another generation of American G.I.'s overseas to put them in harm's way. These are things that the people of Americ care about.

He's been stuck in the SIV process. He was there for then Senator Joe Biden when he needed him. He fought a hundred firefights with U.S. forces.

They can plan a 9/11-style attack if they have the room to do it as they did before. It can also happen in places like United States and Europe as we saw all throughout the Obama administration when they refused to acknowledge this idea that we're fighting an ideology, not just a country or this enemy that is not traditional, right? But if you go back to what Obama's kind of policy was, in foreign policy, when Joe Biden was the vice president, you see this theme running through of denying the reality, focusing on diplomacy. You look at Iran and the nuclear agreement. They don't want to have conditions. You saw the Houthis in Yemen, which is another terrorist organization earlier this year. They took the terrorists label off of them to the State Department. And ever since then, all they've been doing is issuing statements about how they shouldn't be bombing people at airports. And so, I think that's where we are. We're back to this ideology of not accepting the reality that people want to kill us. They do -- there does have to be this balance between combating China and Russia and bigger traditional powers with Islamic terrorism. But you can't ignore that this is still going to be around."

And I wrote this down, then I just happened to pick -- I see you wrote it down too. This Yemen comparison is driving me absolutely up a wall. He used it with Peter Doocy the other day where, first of all, media tip, never answer a hypothetical if you're doing an interview. But it's a really strange thing for a president then to then ask the media a hypothetical.

Iran and Pakistan. You don't think the Taliban is willing to sell some of their equipment to Iran and Pakistan when they need to make money?

And he was putting out a call for help for this organization called Chuffed, which is C-H-U-F-F-E-D. It's a nonprofit charity. And their goal is to get these musicians and their families out of Afghanistan before they're murdered. If you go to that Web site, you can actually get information. So, it means that there's something that you can actually do to help them. So, they need donations, and they -- and I guess assistance. So far, they've held -- they've helped 20 different musicians and I think there are seven still waiting to get out. So, that's something maybe you could do. It's called Chuffed.
