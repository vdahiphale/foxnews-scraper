So, I think that process is the right process. But, Neil, I think, as we look at the overreach, the overreach with the Clean Power Plan, a war on a sector of our economy -- I mean, a week ago today, I was in Kentucky talking to folks there about the war on coal that the previous administration engaged in.  It was a real war. And the president said the war is over. And that's what I was there to announce to those folks there. You shouldn't -- as a regulator, you shouldn't engage in any kind of war on any sector of your economy. You should look at these issues, utility companies making decisions on stability, cost, using all forms of fuel, from natural gas to coal to renewables, in the generation of electricity.",

It was an abuse of the rule-making process, because the EPA would engage in discussions with these various third parties and they would agree to certain obligations, taking discretionary duties in the statute and making them non-discretionary, or changing timelines that Congress had put in a statute.  And then they would go to a court and say, put this within a consent decree. And then they would use that to go to states and citizens all over the country and say now you have to do this. And it didn't go through rule-making. That's a subversion of the rule-making process. It's called sue and settle and regulation through litigation.

When we look at what we have achieved in this country, Neil, with respect to CO2 reductions, we're at pre-1994 levels today, largely through innovation and technology, as you put earlier, a conversion to natural gas in the generation of electricity.

I can't create it out of thin air, forgive the reference, and make it up. That's what the previous administration did. The Clean Power Plan was re-imagined authority.
