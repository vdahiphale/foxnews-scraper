This time a man with a pipe bomb strapped to himself, set off the device in a subway tunnel near Times Square in the height of the morning rush.

The 27-year-old who was originally from Bangladesh apparently traveled frequently overseas according to sources since he arrived here on F-43 family immigration visa in 2011. He was a lawful, permanent resident thanks to a program that President Trump is trying to scale back. Authorities say Ullah detonated that improvise explosive device at 7:20 this morning in an underground pedestrian tunnel that connects the ports authority to Times Square. The device, a pipe bomb was attached to his body with Velcro and zip ties, but he was the only one seriously hurt with burns and lacerations to his midsection and hands.

This individual, in fact, was able to come in from an uncle, then through his mother, and be able to get in just prior, a couple of months prior to his 21st birthday. And if he had turned 21, then he would have been able to. So, quite interesting because you can see the loopholes in the law that the president and others are eager to close. And a situation like this where he's radicalized online, I mean, I really think that they should make even a larger push to shut down some of these radicalized sites that are really having such a powerful impact on people like this individual to come here to do harm, you know, to us. And it just takes one person with a pipe bomb, something like that. He was not very good at it. He injured himself, not enough, obviously, he should imposed the death penalty on himself right then and there. But thank God more people, you know, weren't injured or hurt. But it goes to shows you the complexity of the problem in combating terror in highly dense or urban areas like this and cities where you have a large population, a lot of people, and a potential for great numbers of harm in terms of fatalities, et cetera, because we live in such a densely pack communities.",

Thankfully there were only the five mild injuries that were reported, and bleeding in the ears which is consistent with this type of thing. But one of the things I think to point out, remember the truck attack a month ago, and then you have this. Anytime you have one of these incidents, look at how many resources we have to have in order to deal with any one of these events. It could be just this minor event, relatively minor for -- thankfully, for there are no other casualties. But we're spending a lot to train our emergency medical personnel, our law enforcement, our intelligence. We have made a really big commitment. And in the B-block, Greg is going to talk a little bit more about ideology and going forward, because there are certain things you can do to harden your defenses and even some of these are soft targets. You can try to harden them, but what we really have to do is deal with the generational war that we are in and we are on a war footing. And the other thing President Trump points out, not just about the chain migration -- I don't think that I've ever heard him talk about the death penalty before. There was no other casualty here except for this guy. This individual getting himself injured, to call for the possibility of the death penalty in a case like that. That is certainly different.

As long as there is an ideology, a technology and a loser seeking infamy that combines both, life itself is a target. It's a mistake to see the death of ISIS as a period at the end of a very ugly sentence, because once we killed a zombie, it returns in a different form.

It's all driven by religion. And so, because the religion emphasizes martyrdom, you're going to have people that are willing to kill themselves and willing to kill innocent people, not just in the battlefield, but all over the world, in malls, in Times Square, so there is only a few ways to defeat it. Yeah, you have to defeat them with law enforcement or with the military, but you also have say listen, we need your help. Whether it's see something, say something.

He tweeted it from his personal account, though he is affiliated, of course, with The Washington Post, works for them. And he immediately apologized. It's been 20 minutes. But then they have to pound him all weekend long. And I think that that, I think, is just over the line. My advice would be, if your performance numbers for your job do not directly tie to your Twitter account, set the thing down. Use it for a news source, but unless you are absolutely sure that something is a \"go,\" don't tweet about it.

The 27-year-old who was originally from Bangladesh apparently traveled frequently overseas according to sources since he arrived here on F-43 family immigration visa in 2011. He was a lawful, permanent resident thanks to a program that President Trump is trying to scale back. Authorities say Ullah detonated that improvise explosive device at 7:20 this morning in an underground pedestrian tunnel that connects the ports authority to Times Square. The device, a pipe bomb was attached to his body with Velcro and zip ties, but he was the only one seriously hurt with burns and lacerations to his midsection and hands.

And we're just getting new comments from the president of the United States, Donald Trump, Kimberly, and he says this, today's terror suspects entered our country through extended family chain migration, which is incompatible with national security. And he calls for congress to end chain migration and says that someone like this, convicted, should face the death penalty. What are your thoughts on today's event?"

      "speaker": "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST",

But this is very consistent with what he has been talking about, you know, previously, saying that he was against chain migration. And when you see a situation like this, this is difficult to vet. This individual, in fact, was able to come in from an uncle, then through his mother, and be able to get in just prior, a couple of months prior to his 21st birthday. And if he had turned 21, then he would have been able to. So, quite interesting because you can see the loopholes in the law that the president and others are eager to close. And a situation like this where he's radicalized online, I mean, I really think that they should make even a larger push to shut down some of these radicalized sites that are really having such a powerful impact on people like this individual to come here to do harm, you know, to us. And it just takes one person with a pipe bomb, something like that. He was not very good at it. He injured himself, not enough, obviously, he should imposed the death penalty on himself right then and there. But thank God more people, you know, weren't injured or hurt. But it goes to shows you the complexity of the problem in combating terror in highly dense or urban areas like this and cities where you have a large population, a lot of people, and a potential for great numbers of harm in terms of fatalities, et cetera, because we live in such a densely pack communities."

      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we're going to be finding out more about the two police officer, they're port authority police officers that were right on the scene immediately. Thankfully there were only the five mild injuries that were reported, and bleeding in the ears which is consistent with this type of thing. But one of the things I think to point out, remember the truck attack a month ago, and then you have this. Anytime you have one of these incidents, look at how many resources we have to have in order to deal with any one of these events. It could be just this minor event, relatively minor for -- thankfully, for there are no other casualties. But we're spending a lot to train our emergency medical personnel, our law enforcement, our intelligence. We have made a really big commitment. And in the B-block, Greg is going to talk a little bit more about ideology and going forward, because there are certain things you can do to harden your defenses and even some of these are soft targets. You can try to harden them, but what we really have to do is deal with the generational war that we are in and we are on a war footing. And the other thing President Trump points out, not just about the chain migration -- I don't think that I've ever heard him talk about the death penalty before. There was no other casualty here except for this guy. This individual getting himself injured, to call for the possibility of the death penalty in a case like that. That is certainly different. And I don't know if he's going to push forward on that. But it's something that might be more of a deterrent going forward."

Greg, to Dana's point that, you know, we've seen spectacular coordinated attacks, you know, right after 9/11, and obviously 9/11, and now we're seeing more crude and rudimentary attacks with just, kind of like -- they like to say lone wolves, but ISIS inspired individuals. Those are very hard to prevent."

I think the point is, you don't want chain migration to make up 70 percent of all the foreign nationals that come legally into this country, which it is now. Kimberly, I think the president wants to have an immigration system based on merit, which when they look at education, language skills, how good they are with their hands, how smart they are, things like that, that need to take a higher priority than if your uncle know somebody."

When you see a situation like this today, it really does strengthens the argument of the president is trying to make.

Yet, amidst this good news that we've beaten ISIS, a man sets off a bomb in the name of ISIS. Was he working with others? Who knows? Are we lucky it went the way it did? Hell yes. This is a lucky reminder that winning the war on ISIS isn't enough because the war is bigger than that. As long as there is an ideology, a technology and a loser seeking infamy that combines both, life itself is a target. It's a mistake to see the death of ISIS as a period at the end of a very ugly sentence, because once we killed a zombie, it returns in a different form. Even when we succeed in Iraq and they fail in the subway, ideology -- the zombie fuel -- persists. To ever ease up even a moment is idiotic. We keep being told however not to change our way of life."

I believe it's the next couple of weeks. I understand that it's finish. I think we have to talk about resources for state and local government, because of how much it takes in order to protect a city, especially like this one. This idea of see something, say something. I think that people in America need more information about this, like something specific. Because today when you're going through the underground passageway and there's a guy in a coat, everybody is in a coat, what are you supposed to see and who are you supposed to tell? The police officers at the ports authority are obviously extremely good. But I don't understand what seeing and saying something means, I actually think that's about who his family might have known he was socializing with prior to this. And the last thing I would say is that I do think the administration is lacking at this point a counter ideology strategy.

But now -- and we would defeat them militarily, you know, Germany and Nazism, the totalitarian state in Japan, and then communism in Soviet Russia, those were all defeated on conventional battlefields, and then their ideology was extinguished alongside with it. But radical Islamic ideology is completely different because there is no nation-state, and when they tried to create the caliphate, they got decimated. There's really no economic engine behind it. It's all driven by religion. And so, because the religion emphasizes martyrdom, you're going to have people that are willing to kill themselves and willing to kill innocent people, not just in the battlefield, but all over the world, in malls, in Times Square, so there is only a few ways to defeat it. Yeah, you have to defeat them with law enforcement or with the military, but you also have say listen, we need your help. Whether it's see something, say something. And then use tools that were always considered a little edgy, enhanced interrogation, enhanced surveillance, the travel ban, ending chain migration. Those are the types of tools that we need to use I think more aggressively, because we can't tolerate one innocent death. And that's what makes us different."

They were sometimes killing off people who were opposition to Assad, which the United States was supporting. I mean, Assad is still there. And the second thing to say about this is, you know, for all of the upset today and, you know, we see this terrible thing happen that could have been far more dangerous, as you pointed out wisely. I think to myself, well, gosh, in the last two months we've seen 58 people killed in Vegas, we've seen people killed in a Walmart in Denver. We've seen people at Texas Baptist Church, 26 just raked down. And yet, somehow, we don't say, hey, there's something going on in this country. We've got to immediately get tougher.

But the Democrats have put a lot of money into some very strong ads for their candidate, for Jones, to try to get him over the hump. The problem is, is that Roy Moore does not enjoy the support across the board of the Republicans, like you just saw saw in the statement by Shelby.

I believe a lot of people from Alabama, when they're asked who you're going to support, probably don't want to say, \"I'm going to vote for Roy Moore.\" I've said I have a big problem with Roy Moore. The combination of the explosive rhetoric out of him years ago and then to this day, when you add this to some of the credible allegations of inappropriate behavior. I think when he gets to the Senate, if he does, he's going to be a huge distraction. No one is even going to want to sit next to them at the Senate lunchroom.

And yet, it's not portrayed as this is his positions; this is what he stands for.

And I'm sure he still loves his daughter. So I think it's OK to say, even though Trump -- even though Trump is endorsing this guy, it's because he has to because it's his team. And I have to say, you know, I hope -- I hope the guy loses. And if you're upset that I say that, that's not on me. That's on a team sport ideology that's pernicious.

I believe it's even more than sloppy reporting, because there's not a lot of other sloppy reporting. I don't remember a lot of retractions during the Obama administration.

So there are things that are actually blatantly, like, false and totally abhorrent. That's what Brian Ross did at ABC News. It's not the first time. OK? So there's a pattern there. But then you take somebody like Dave Weigel, who at The Washington Post tweeted the picture of the crowd size. He tweeted it from his personal account, though he is affiliated, of course, with The Washington Post, works for them. And he immediately apologized. It's been 20 minutes. But then they have to pound him all weekend long. And I think that that, I think, is just over the line. My advice would be, if your performance numbers for your job do not directly tie to your Twitter account, set the thing down. Use it for a news source, but unless you are absolutely sure that something is a \"go,\" don't tweet about it. It doesn't help your bottom line for your company, and it might actually hurt your career."

The goal: collect 10,000 unwrapped toys to give to children, you know, who may go without because their parents don't have money this season. While the foundation is based in Virginia, you should know everyone is welcome to donate. If you want to support Toys for Tots, please go to www.toysfortots.org/donate. And I mean that with all my heart. These are good people."
