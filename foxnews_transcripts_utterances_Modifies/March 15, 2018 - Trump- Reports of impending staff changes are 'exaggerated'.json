Not sure exactly which report the president is referencing there as a false report, but Fox News was saying last night, and earlier today, that there were some expected staff changes ahead. They may number anywhere between two and four, depending on the timing. And we were been told by sources inside close to the White House, but outside, yesterday, that some of these changes were imminent. A couple of the changes that have been talked about, there's an awful lot of chatter about this one, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, may be removed from his post. We are told by numerous officials in the White House, saying people outside, that he has lost the confidence of the president to some degree based on the findings of an inspector general report, as well as the travel where he had taxpayers foot the bill to take his wife to Europe. He later reimbursed the treasury for that. But the president has always made Veterans Affairs a real priority. And if he's got somebody in there who he doesn't think is managing it as well as it could be managed, that he might make a change.  There were some rumors yesterday that Rick Perry, the secretary of energy, might be the replacement. But I'm told by White House officials that both the president and Perry have said he's not moving to the V.A. So another name that is floating to the surface, one that will be very familiar to viewers of Fox News, Pete Hegseth, who used to be the CEO of Concerned Veterans of America, and is well-versed in veterans issues and how to restructure the V.A. Fox & Friends' host, his name is making the rounds again here at the White House, as a possible replacement for Shulkin.   Couple of other items that may be in the offing sooner rather than later, H.R. McMaster, the national security advisor, has been rumored to not have a great relationship with the president for a long time. There's a possibility he could leave, and that John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, may take his place. When it comes to the V.A., Sarah Huckabee Sanders, earlier today, was asked about any staff changes. Here's what she said.",

I don't know if you can really derive that much of a pattern there. But the pattern to me, at least, seems he's putting in place people that he trusts and that like him. It's very important for the people that surround the president, to support the president's agenda, agree with the president's agenda, and then personally like the president. We've heard a lot of people that are kind of doing their duty and kind of rolling their eyes. And those leaks really, I think, hurt the president, and doing him a very big disservice. So he's consolidating the group of people around him. He still likes the diversity of opinion. So, still, kind of -- that serves him well, but at the same time, he wants to have people that surround him, that agree with him and like him. And it's safe to say Kellyanne is safe, and Stephen Miller is safe, and Sarah Sanders is doing an excellent job. But Trump is all about change, and I don't think that's ever going to stop.",

You've got to be interesting, funny, raw.  But also, it seems likability means less when assessing effectiveness. The fact is, you didn't have to like Trump to admit he's doing a good job so far. Sure, the way Trump handled Tillerson, that lacked appeal. His approach to critics can make you wince. But the tax plan, the renewal of our military, the decimation of ISIS, that offers some optimism. You don't have to like the boss to admit the company is doing OK.

Because basically, the whole world collapsed and gas prices were high and he was a pathetic mess. And Reagan came along just at the right time. So I don't think they have a chance at defeating him. I think it's going to be a lot closer than it was in 2016. But they do need someone that can throw haymakers with President Trump. But they have to do it in more of an aspirational way. Because if you get in the mud with Trump, you're going to get dirty and you're going to get bruised up. And it's going to be tough to recover. Elizabeth Warren's not going to be able to do it. Kamala Harris, Booker, Bernie. I just don't think they have the innate talent. You can't just draft someone out of the blue. Talent has to bubble up and arise from somewhere within the country.

      "utterance": "Kimberly, good afternoon to you. Not sure exactly which report the president is referencing there as a false report, but Fox News was saying last night, and earlier today, that there were some expected staff changes ahead. They may number anywhere between two and four, depending on the timing. And we were been told by sources inside close to the White House, but outside, yesterday, that some of these changes were imminent. A couple of the changes that have been talked about, there's an awful lot of chatter about this one, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, may be removed from his post. We are told by numerous officials in the White House, saying people outside, that he has lost the confidence of the president to some degree based on the findings of an inspector general report, as well as the travel where he had taxpayers foot the bill to take his wife to Europe. He later reimbursed the treasury for that. But the president has always made Veterans Affairs a real priority. And if he's got somebody in there who he doesn't think is managing it as well as it could be managed, that he might make a change. There were some rumors yesterday that Rick Perry, the secretary of energy, might be the replacement. But I'm told by White House officials that both the president and Perry have said he's not moving to the V.A. So another name that is floating to the surface, one that will be very familiar to viewers of Fox News, Pete Hegseth, who used to be the CEO of Concerned Veterans of America, and is well-versed in veterans issues and how to restructure the V.A. Fox & Friends' host, his name is making the rounds again here at the White House, as a possible replacement for Shulkin. Couple of other items that may be in the offing sooner rather than later, H.R. McMaster, the national security advisor, has been rumored to not have a great relationship with the president for a long time. There's a possibility he could leave, and that John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, may take his place. When it comes to the V.A., Sarah Huckabee Sanders, earlier today, was asked about any staff changes. Here's what she said."

So there's quite -- it's almost like a Broadway play at this point. The cast of characters that keeps developing in terms of, you know, who might be leaving, in what order, progression, and who the possible candidates and replacements are.

And if you want to force the media to cover your accomplishments, then you're going to have to, like, serve them vegetables.

And I guess in this Trump-era, I will take staff chaos over, you know, stylized videos of decapitations of westerners and journalist. I mean, if this is the kind of news that we are covering, I don't mind it. I'd rather hear about the staff changes. It's to me it's just part of life. It's better than seeing ISIS every day.

I don't know if you can really derive that much of a pattern there. But the pattern to me, at least, seems he's putting in place people that he trusts and that like him. It's very important for the people that surround the president, to support the president's agenda, agree with the president's agenda, and then personally like the president. We've heard a lot of people that are kind of doing their duty and kind of rolling their eyes. And those leaks really, I think, hurt the president, and doing him a very big disservice. So he's consolidating the group of people around him. He still likes the diversity of opinion. So, still, kind of -- that serves him well, but at the same time, he wants to have people that surround him, that agree with him and like him. And it's safe to say Kellyanne is safe, and Stephen Miller is safe, and Sarah Sanders is doing an excellent job. But Trump is all about change, and I don't think that's ever going to stop."

The Broward County Sheriff's Office has released the footage from outside Stoneman Douglas High as the shooter began slaughtering more than 17 inside the school on February 14. The tape confirms that Deputy Scot Peterson, the man assigned to protect the school, did not go inside while the massacre unfolded. So here's the thing. Kimberly, I want you to hear me out on this, because his lawyer, Joe DiRuzzo, says it's unfair to call him a coward, that he called in the shooting to the police department and then set up an outside perimeter, which is what the protocol established. On the other hand, people look at this, including the sheriff's department, and say his job was to go inside and confront the shooter. What does Kimberly Guilfoyle say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Well, it depends. Each different -- you know, departments have different protocol about how they secure a perimeter, what they do in terms of when they receive information. A 911 call about responding to the scene, who's first on scene, securing the perimeter and then approaching, as information develops, to go in. When you have an active, you know, shooter situation, what's really important, too, is also what is the procedure at the school? And are they aware of what that -- you know, the procedure is and what they're supposed to do? So are people there holding in place? They want to make sure that they don't increase any other casualties. They want to identify the location of the shooter. So you have to go in and you do a process by clearing room by room to be able to go identify, locate, and then eliminate or neutralize the shooter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "And Jesse, the sheriff, Scot Peterson [SIC], says basically that he gave the man the information, the protocol, and he should've handled it and he didn't. It's not the department's fault. What does Jesse say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, according to the protocol, which we have right here, it's not to set up a perimeter. The protocol says quickly engage the suspect, because every time you hear a gunshot, it says you have to assume that someone has been killed. They learned these lessons after Columbine. You do not set up a perimeter. You go in. If it's one person you go in. If it's two persons -- people, you go in immediately and neutralize the shooter. He didn't do that. And he stood outside and he waited. And if you listen to his radio transmission, the radio transmission, he says, \"This could be firecrackers, but I believe it's gunshots. And it's coming from, I believe, Building 2011 or 211.\" And that contradicts the statement that he released through his attorney, which said, \"Oh, we thought the shooting was from somewhere outside.\" So why would you contradict yourself and then why would you take up a defensive position outside the building that you heard the gunshots from? It doesn't make any sense. And, you know, people are calling him the coward from Broward, and this is why. I don't know what was going through his head. But he has -- he should have gone in there."

After missing all of those red flags and having an absolute viable way to prevent this from happening. And then when it does happen, not going in and trying to stop it. The media has devoted so much time to everything but the most glaring facts. We are enamored by the emotional aspects of this, but we overlook stuff like this. There are so many failures involved here. And there are a lot of solutions. There are two major solutions. And I've said before, the database, where you have a civil tag based on what officials at school and the police, when they see somebody who's law- abiding but there's something wrong, they can put them in the database. That's an offensive maneuver. And also, the hardening the schools which will never be totally perfect. You can't harden -- it will never be perfect, but you can improve it. And that's metal detectors and a trained staff. So there are things you can do. When you -- when you admit to yourself what the problems are. And there's a problem."

      "speaker": "What they mean is they want a fighter, someone who can throw punches instead of retreating to Gwyneth Paltrow's flat to mainline quinoa. A fighter isn't polite or normal -- formal but aggressive, blunt and sometimes even rude. Meaning they're looking for their Trump. For two reasons",
      "utterance": "One, we may never return to the way things were before Trump. It's not enough to tie the perfect Windsor knot or make the most tasteful toast. You've got to be interesting, funny, raw. But also, it seems likability means less when assessing effectiveness. The fact is, you didn't have to like Trump to admit he's doing a good job so far. Sure, the way Trump handled Tillerson, that lacked appeal. His approach to critics can make you wince. But the tax plan, the renewal of our military, the decimation of ISIS, that offers some optimism. You don't have to like the boss to admit the company is doing OK. So for the Dems, it may be time to nominate an adult with an actual plan, not simply a call for hope and change or an undergraduate's reliance on identity politics. A wish is no course of action, which explains why most places you find a Democrat in charge, you find an unholy mess. All right, Juan, go to you first. Do you agree with everything I had to say? Do you guys -- do Democrats need, like, some kind of their correlation to Trump? They need their Trump?"

You had Bill Clinton, who was extremely talented and kind of caught lightning in a bottle. And then you had Jimmy Carter, one term. Because basically, the whole world collapsed and gas prices were high and he was a pathetic mess. And Reagan came along just at the right time. So I don't think they have a chance at defeating him. I think it's going to be a lot closer than it was in 2016. But they do need someone that can throw haymakers with President Trump. But they have to do it in more of an aspirational way. Because if you get in the mud with Trump, you're going to get dirty and you're going to get bruised up. And it's going to be tough to recover. Elizabeth Warren's not going to be able to do it. Kamala Harris, Booker, Bernie. I just don't think they have the innate talent. You can't just draft someone out of the blue. Talent has to bubble up and arise from somewhere within the country. And if I'm looking at the list here, and I have a whole long list of Democrats, I don't see anybody with even a small amount of talent compared to this president."

That's -- I don't know if he was drafted so much as, in some ways, he was a phenomenon and he was the opposite. Often, people go for opposites. But you mentioned Bill Clinton and how he did well. One of the things that helped Bill Clinton so much is that he lost his congressional majorities in the first midterm."

But also, the Democrats benefit this year, because there's no one face of the party. Just like Republicans benefited in 2010 when there was no one face.
