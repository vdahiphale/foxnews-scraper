You're going have to grow the economy, and that is what this plan is designed to do. And I think on the corporate side, it would do that, as we see in the House proposal. You got something like $2 trillion sitting overseas, lowering the rate to 20 percent of corporate tax rate could bring a lot of that money back here. It could be invested in companies here. That's more hiring, that's higher wages. We've all seen that unemployment rate come down, but wages have not been growing like they should be. Corporate tax cut like that can get the ball rolling here. So, that's ultimately what you're going to do. The problem for me, however, is on the individual rate side. I think tax credits complicate the code, they are expensive, they do nothing for growth, and you have some senators like Mike Lee of Utah and Senator Rubio of Florida who want to put these credits in. They think it's good politics, but frankly, if you want to use -- if a voter is interested in using the tax code to redistribute wealth, they're going to vote -- they're going to vote for Democrats because that's what they specialize in doing.

I don't mind trying this guy in New York court, the New York terrorist, but want I wanted to do was hold him for a long period of time, let our military, CIA interrogate him about what he knows about terrorism, how he got radicalized. He said he was a soldier of the caliphate. ISIL says he was a soldier of the caliphate. We talked to him for one day in the hospital. We read him his Miranda rights. We throw him right in court and we can get any intelligence going forward because now he's been lawyered up. And that's exactly what Obama did.

This delivers that, and we really are convinced this is going to help get out economy growing and reaching its potential. You have to this in order to do that. And that's why we want to get it done this year so we can have a very good 2018 and get stronger economic growth. And so, yes. We're on track for moving this through the House before Thanksgiving.

I wish the ObamaCare bill would have passed, which would have been good fiscal responsibility, entitlement reform legislation, it didn't pass the Senate, it passed the House.

Right now, about 70 percent don't itemize. By doubling the standard deduction, we're making it so that people don't have to itemize their deductions. So, instead of having the first $12,000 that you don't pay tax on, it will be the first $24,000 for a couple you don't pay your tax on and we're lowering people's tax rates. The difference here is we're basically saying instead of using a tax deduction to lower your tax rate, lower your tax liability, we're just going to make it easier so you don't pay taxes in the first place. But this is a clear middle class tax cut. No two ways about it, even for people in those high tax states."

The investigation will take its course, and we will let it take its course. We're also doing our own investigations here in the House -- and the Senate has one as well -- into Russia and into Russia's meddling in our campaign.

I mean, Republicans, after failing to repeal ObamaCare, they are feeling this pressure right now that they really have to deliver on tax reform. I think I saw something this week on the Hill that bodes well for the plan, and that is the rollout went very fairly smoothly. I remember when they rolled out the ObamaCare replacement plan in the spring, and within two or three hours, we knew it was in some trouble because conservative groups started piling on, calling it ObamaCare light, and they've never recovered from that. And ultimately, the bill died. This time around, we saw those same conservative groups come out and applaud the plan, say they like it, and that puts pressure on the House Republicans that are often divided and fighting about specifics on legislation, to actually get this done."

However, Senator Cotton is really pushing this in the Senate. He's close with President Trump and my understanding is he took this to the president and got him on board and President Trump obviously tweeted about this this week. That puts pressure on Speaker Ryan and the Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady to actually consider this. So, right now, they are not panning it out right publicly. They don't like it privately.

You're going have to grow the economy, and that is what this plan is designed to do. And I think on the corporate side, it would do that, as we see in the House proposal. You got something like $2 trillion sitting overseas, lowering the rate to 20 percent of corporate tax rate could bring a lot of that money back here. It could be invested in companies here. That's more hiring, that's higher wages. We've all seen that unemployment rate come down, but wages have not been growing like they should be. Corporate tax cut like that can get the ball rolling here. So, that's ultimately what you're going to do. The problem for me, however, is on the individual rate side. I think tax credits complicate the code, they are expensive, they do nothing for growth, and you have some senators like Mike Lee of Utah and Senator Rubio of Florida who want to put these credits in. They think it's good politics, but frankly, if you want to use -- if a voter is interested in using the tax code to redistribute wealth, they're going to vote -- they're going to vote for Democrats because that's what they specialize in doing. I think Paul Ryan wants to focus on growing the economy and that's what I think this would accomplish, at least when it comes to corporate tax."

And any vacancies, staff vacancies in communications, tech and research, you're going to come to us and we have control over your budget. Anybody who has control over your budget has control over your operations, and anybody who has control over who you staff up in the committee has control over how that committee goes."

Which brings up another point I want to ask you about, Juan, and that's another revelation in the book. We got to back, let's play the tape, 9/11/2016. You could see Hillary Clinton, this is where she fainted because of pneumonia, leaving the event, the ceremony at Ground Zero. And Donna Brazile says in her book when she saw that, plus all the problems she had with the Clinton campaign, that she thought of getting the DNC to begin a process to replace Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on the national ticket with Joe Biden and Cory Booker. I have a couple of questions -- first of all, what to make of that revelation? And two, you and I know Donna Brazile. We've known her for years. She's a sharp, strong, tough Democratic operative. Why do you think she is saying this?"

I mean, she was essentially pushed aside by the Clinton operation, and I think she feels disrespected by the Clinton operation to that extent, because when she comes in, it's very apparent to her as we just heard Karl described it, they have bailed out a financially ailing Democratic Party. President Obama had created, you know, Organizing for America. He's taking money away. There wasn't really a fund-raising energy there. Debbie Wasserman Schultz had not been a success as the party chairman. Donna comes in in a rescue operation and finds gee whiz, guess what, this is being run out of Brooklyn. I don't have that power. So, I think that she has felt and she always felt, you know, some wise guys on the Democratic side who run the Democratic Party, they don't listen to her. They don't have value for people like her.

I don't mind trying this guy in New York court, the New York terrorist, but want I wanted to do was hold him for a long period of time, let our military, CIA interrogate him about what he knows about terrorism, how he got radicalized. He said he was a soldier of the caliphate. ISIL says he was a soldier of the caliphate. We talked to him for one day in the hospital. We read him his Miranda rights. We throw him right in court and we can get any intelligence going forward because now he's been lawyered up. And that's exactly what Obama did.

That is ridiculous. They're recruiting in cyberspace. They're trying to radicalize people in our own backyard. What makes you an enemy combatants is when you adopt radical Islamic philosophy and you act on it. When you kill in the name of ISIL, you're a soldier of the caliphate. The guy coming back from Libya was one of the masterminds behind the Benghazi attack and under the Obama administration, at least they interrogated him while he was on the ship before they put him in federal court. The Trump administration took this man from Libya, captured by our military, and sent him right into federal court without any efforts to gather intelligence.

I can only imagine how much intelligence could be gathered from one of the masterminds of the Benghazi attack.

We have a rule of law that's independent of political influence. And when you call on the attorney general to prosecute your former opponent, that is crossing a line. But here's what I would say about Russia. Massive involvement in our election. The idea that the Democratic Party would pay millions of dollars to a foreign agent to go to Russia to gather dirt on President Trump, then candidate Trump, allows the Democratic Party to be manipulated by Russian operatives inside of Russia. So I want to get to the bottom of Fusion GPS. And I'm really worried about what happened with the Uranium One deal because there was a woman in Clinton's inner -- inner orbit there in terms of campaign financing fundraising that was sent out of the country a suspected Russian spy. That needs to be looked at as much is the Trump campaign."

The idea that the Russians didn't know that Mr. Steele was in town looking for dirt on Donald Trump is zero impossible. I can't believe that they didn't know.

So we now know that somebody at a meeting, Mr. Papadopoulos, raise the idea of meeting with Putin. There's nothing wrong with Trump meeting with Putin if he wanted to. It would be wrong to have the Russians help the Trump campaign, or the -- or Hillary Clinton's campaign. And here's what nobody talks about, the Russians manipulated Comey in getting involved into the election. It was Russian information that Comey used to jump into the middle of the 2016 election, not a meeting between Lynch and President Clinton on the tarmac. But when it comes to Jeff Sessions, Jeff, you need to tell us everything you know about Russia. So, yes, he probably should come back and answer the question yet again, did you know anything about an effort by the Trump campaign to meet with Russia, not just collude with Russia?"

I think it's dangerous for President Trump because, look, this simply -- once you unsheathe this particular weapon, you can never sheath it again. Imagine what would happen if a Democratic Congress got in, a Democrat majority in the House and Senate, and used their disagreements with political disagreements with the president to push for impeachment. You know, and also it looks like he's got something to hide. Leave this whole thing alone. Move on. Be the president of the United States.

And, again, we say it a lot, the president is helping himself or not by publicly commenting on the investigation. I mean what we've seen in the cases of the court response to his executive actions is often turning his words back on him. So I think the lesson from that would be to just say, let the -- let the investigation play out. But I think this is going to be a headache for the administration for the foreseeable future."
