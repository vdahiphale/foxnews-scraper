I don't know if that is the view of Democratic Senator from West Virginia Joe Manchin, but he joins us right now.  You're familiar with these kind of protests, Senator. They happen all the time, but they're picking up the pace right now. And those against what Republicans are putting up are saying that it's cruel and inhumane.  Do you think what they're concocting is cruel and inhumane?",

Also, we have people that we have given 20 million people the wealth of health care, and no instructions of how to use it in the most effective and efficient manner. So, we know there's great savings there. But before you throw people off for the sake of saving, you ought to at least give them a chance to earn it and show them how to live a better quality of life. That's what we're trying to do, Neil.",

The tax on the wealthy, 3.8, is staying, because there's a few other ones. They are still removing some other taxes too.
