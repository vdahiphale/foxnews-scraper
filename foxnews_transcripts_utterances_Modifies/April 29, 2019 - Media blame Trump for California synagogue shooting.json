In just moments Trump campaign manager, Brad Parscale joins me for the 2020 teams' first response to Biden's Pennsylvania rollout. And another tragedy at a house of worship and the ghouls in the media are already blaming Trump. We put together an amazing panel, you're not going to see this anywhere else on television tonight. Christians, Jews, Muslims, the conversation you will not want to miss, straight ahead.  Plus why is Barack Obama running from the idea of Biden running? Well, Victor Davis Hanson thinks he knows and is here to explain and finally, Robert Francis O'Rourke has staked out dangerous positions on immigration but his latest language is just ridiculous.  It's despicable or irresponsible, take your pick. Someone was has followed his political career from the start will be here to explain what's going on behind this radical turn. But first, the Chuck, Nancy and Joe show. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Tomorrow Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer return to the White House for a meeting with President Trump. Now this time it's about an infrastructure deal but in a moment, I'm going to tell you what the showdown is really all about. And today the guy who spent eight years working there, Joe Biden. He tried mightily to convince you that this time he has all the answers. But what's in his pitch in this phenomenal Trump economy?",

Democrats also want to expand the definition of what infrastructure is beyond in other words, fixing bridges roads and airports to include things like enhancing broadband, water systems, schools and housing. Why not? Why stop there? And predictably, Democrats want the cost to be borne by people, meaning you by doing what? Raising taxes, of course.

And the Republican establishment had been sort of \"Wall Street Journal,\" Chamber of Commerce, Mitt Romney, Marquis of Queensberry type politeness. And when Trump comes in to do these things, he has no choice. There's not very many things you can do to get fair trade with people like the Chinese or the Germans or the Mexicans. And so they don't like the methodology. And the second thing is that he's polling about anywhere from 42 to make 44, depending on the poll, maybe 47, the Rasmussen poll.

Democrats also want to expand the definition of what infrastructure is beyond in other words, fixing bridges roads and airports to include things like enhancing broadband, water systems, schools and housing. Why not? Why stop there? And predictably, Democrats want the cost to be borne by people, meaning you by doing what? Raising taxes, of course. Well, that's a non-starter for this President because he believes a tax hike will slow this red hot economy and of course betray his campaign promises to be a tax cutter. My question is this, will there be any big kumbaya moment? Imagine if they were swaying back and forth, tomorrow. Caught on camera, either during or after the confab.

He was very good at convincing people that they have not felt the economic recovery that Obama had been delivering in his eight years as President and he was very successful in delivering that message home because most people in the middle did not feel the economy recover.

And then you say, well, there's a poll out now showing large majorities of Americans think the economy is good to very good and their answer is, no, other kids did it like it was a Beavis and Butthead episode. I mean you cannot get through to liberals, this is phenomenal. It's you know - they're so good at gaslighting people but you're right Joe Biden made an awful argument. The fact of the matter is again just facts here, I know these are troubling to some liberals out there. Barack Obama presided over and Joe Biden, the worst recovery from recession in modern American history based on any available metric. I mean, we measure economic growth by growth numbers, GDP numbers, they never - Barack Obama is the only President in modern American history in two terms - two terms to never reach annualized 3% growth.

They were like it's going to be a massive global sell off, it's going to be a disaster. Krugman is the creme de la creme for the left in economics. He was fantastically wrong. The man should never show his face in public again, if you ask me, given that single projection that he made. He's an economist and a Nobel Prize winning one. By every metric, if President Obama had reached this pinnacle of success, economically, he'd be on Matt Rushmore by now. But now somebody's going to change the rules of how we measure a good economy.

So the economy is not translating into people voting for the President and that's because there are people and I'm not saying, they didn't get a tax cut, Dan. I'm not saying economy is not good. There are some people who still feel insecure and whether that's because of the economy or the way the President behaves with Congress, we don't know but that's the question that the voters are going to decide next year and that's what Joe Biden's getting at in his speech."

On the contrary, Trump is always supporting the Jewish people. He's lauding the Jewish people. He did that before he was even President. We all know that from New York City.

      "utterance": "Yes, I think most presidents pick their vice presidents to begin with because they are sort of on the opposite ends of the political spectrum within their party, and they don't really like it when they run necessarily. Remember, Reagan didn't really endorse George H. W. Bush for a while. But I think there is something special about the reluctance with Biden.  Remember, Obama put up with Biden for eight years, and he got to know him as indiscreet and imprecise, and already he said he's going to take Trump behind the gym and beat him up. and I think Obama thinks he is a little imprecise. They were introduced in the national scene. Remember when Biden said that Obama was the first clean and articulate black politician, and that was sort of an insult to majestic figures like Shirley Chisholm or Barbara Jordan or Senator Brooke from Massachusetts. So there's not a lot of affinity. And then to win this thing, Biden is not going to be the identity, new blood politician that Obama promised when he recalibrated the Democratic Party into a progressive movement. He's got to go back to his 90s identity. He's having trouble doing it. And he's the man of Pennsylvania, the working man suddenly. But remember what Obama said about Pennsylvanians. They were clingers who were obsessed with religion and guns."

      "utterance": "Yes, they are clingers. So how can you say you recalibrated the Democratic Party, you've got all this new diverse blood in there, and you're a hardcore leftist entity now, and then Biden saying that doesn't include me. There's no place for me in this new family, and so I have got to go back to Joe Biden 1988 candidate, and that 1988 doesn't sit well with Obama and the other people in the party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, I also want to get your thoughts on this. Why is Trump still having to fight forces within his own party? I've been thinking a lot about this today. Three recent examples. Over the weekend Senate Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley issued this threat. He said \"If these tariffs aren't lifted, USMCA,\" the replacement for NAFTA, \"is dead.  There is no appetite in Congress to debate USMCA with these tariffs in place.\" Then there was Mitt Romney's reaction to the Mueller report, saying he is sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty, misdirection, blah, blah, blah. And of course, don't forget Mike Lee, one of a dozen GOP senators who voted against Trump's national emergency declaration at the border. Victor, these are Trump's friends at a critical point and juncture for this country. What's going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "I think a couple of things. Trump didn't say that he was going to drain the Democratic swamp. He said the swamp. And that means Republicans too. So if you recalibrate the Republican message, as he did in 2016 to restore industry and jobs to the interior of the country, to challenge China, to make our allies pay their fair share, to close the borders, what arrows do you have in your quiver but things like tariffs and talking tough to NATO and building a wall? And the Republican establishment had been sort of \"Wall Street Journal,\" Chamber of Commerce, Mitt Romney, Marquis of Queensberry type politeness. And when Trump comes in to do these things, he has no choice. There's not very many things you can do to get fair trade with people like the Chinese or the Germans or the Mexicans. And so they don't like the methodology. And the second thing is that he's polling about anywhere from 42 to make 44, depending on the poll, maybe 47, the Rasmussen poll. And so these guys have their finger to the wind, and they're thinking, I don't know what's going happen, but I'm not going to come out and get off the fence until he is up to 49 or 51, despite the great news."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

We've got to go, but they waited and waited and waited in 2016, and they all look like fools scrambling back on the Trump express after they all shunned him, including Paul Ryan, as I recall. So this how it all went down, and now they're going to make the same mistake again. They will make the same mistake again and I think in the last lap. All right, Victor."

Their immigration status used as leverage to keep them down from fully participating in this country's success and in our economy, an economy that works too well for too few, and not well enough for most Americans."

      "utterance": "What a moron. When he says the economy is not working, it works well for some but not for all Americans. Beto, they're not Americans. They are here illegally. And it's not slavery. The only slavery, as I've talked about on your show a few weeks ago, is what the Democrats are doing to those victims of sex trafficking. They are doing that, but for this to be slavery? Do you know what Beto went on to say, Laura? He said they are in slavery because they can't roam freely across the Texas border. This guy is unbelievable. And you know what, his crowds are really diminishing. He drew 35 people at an event in Nevada this past weekend. He is really out of the race, Laura. When he ran against Cruz, the Texas media never asked him one hard question, they never asked him one follow-up question. They guy has no substance whatsoever. And on reparations, not only slavery, but now he's talking about he supports Sheila Jackson Lee's bill for reparation.  Remember Sheila Jackson Lee who thought we landed on Mars and not the moon and argued about it. But listen to what he says. He says we need to get people, we need to force people almost into -- he didn't say reeducation camps, but that's what he means. So we can go face-to-face, eyeball-to-eyeball, and that we need to pay reparations. There are a lot of people in the northern part of the country who died to free slaves. Should they pay reparations in the south, they were fighting the war? Are we ever going to let it go? Are we ever going to let it go?"

And they are all pretty much a dead heat. He's tied with this new head to head polling that just came out. This is Emerson College? Just came out today. How can that --"

      "speaker": "PATRICK",
      "utterance": "Just name I.D. Just name I.D., Laura. And he's just now being exposed. And I don't like to be critical and call someone names, but when you say something so idiotic that he's talking about of tearing down the fences, letting people roam, they are in slavery, we need to force people.  He said in Virginia especially -- I guess he hates Virginia -- in Virginia especially we need them to go to communities face-to-face, eyeball-to- eyeball to work out these problems. We don't have problems in America. We have gone so far from where we were in the 50s and the 60s and the 70s in this country. And are there race issues? Of course there are, but we've gone so far, except the Democrats like Beto want to pull us back."

An Iraq War vet fearlessly rushed the shooter, chasing him out of the synagogue to the parking lot where an off-duty Border Patrol agent shot the gunman's car. Moments before that, Lori Gilbert, her final act on this earth was blocking her friend and rabbi from the shooter."

      "utterance": "To see Lori laying on the floor unconscious, and her dear husband, Dr. Howard Kaye, who is like a brother to me, is trying to resuscitate her. And he faints, and he's laying there on the floor next to his wife. And then their daughter Hannah comes up screaming, daddy and mommy, what's going on? It's the most heartwrenching site I could've seen. Lori took the bullet for all of us. She died to protect all of us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now, one person died in the attack, three were injured. But had these brave men and women not engaged the shooter, imagine how much worse this tragedy could have been. And during the Easter Sunday Sri Lankan bombings, we talked about earlier, Ramesh Raju didn't get the coverage he deserved. This father and husband noticed an unfamiliar man with a backpack trying to enter the Zion Church where he and his family worshiped. He questioned the man and blocked him from entering. Inside the backpack was a bomb. Ramesh died on the spot when the terrorist detonated himself. But he saved many, many lives. While the viciousness of 2020 has already alive arrived, remember that each of us has a responsibility to be one of those brave ones if the time comes.  But in the meantime, stand for what's right. Take action, and even sacrifice yourself, ourselves, when necessary. These men and women furnish us with the most important examples of what true courage, true heroism means, and why our Second Amendment here in the United States is so precious. God bless all the victims of these tragedies. May we never forget the witness of those willing to temper evil with hope and put themselves in the way of danger for the sake of others. That's a true sacrifice. We'll be right back."

And I suppose he was willing to ignore all the other horrible things that Sharpton has been responsible for. Look at them.
