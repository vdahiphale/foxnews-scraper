Her members think Hugo Chavez had the right idea.  Let's take a look at their agenda.  One universal health care - price tag $30 trillion dollars.  Math is hard when you're a socialist.  Two, a green new deal.  This is a government takeover of the entire economy.  The goal: Eliminate oil and gas.  Now for someone who flies all the time, solar-powered planes, it sounds a little risky to me.  How do they pay for it?  Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wants to raise taxes to 70%.",

When I was running for President and immediately decided that they were going to believe the accusers, never asked me.  They didn't want to believe me and I dropped out of the race.  So in 2012, I met with Governor Mitt Romney - candidate Romney who had - was about to get the nomination and I gave him advice on three separate sit down occasions. Do you know how much of that advice he used?  None.  One of them was, \"Mitt, your 27-point tax plan is never going to fly.\"  I said, \"Mitt, you need to develop some new talking points while you're out on the campaign trail.\"  His staff, I believe systematically talked him into not listening to me.

When I was running for President and immediately decided that they were going to believe the accusers, never asked me.  They didn't want to believe me and I dropped out of the race.  So in 2012, I met with Governor Mitt Romney - candidate Romney who had - was about to get the nomination and I gave him advice on three separate sit down occasions. Do you know how much of that advice he used?  None.  One of them was, \"Mitt, your 27-point tax plan is never going to fly.\"  I said, \"Mitt, you need to develop some new talking points while you're out on the campaign trail.\"  His staff, I believe systematically talked him into not listening to me. So what he did to basically flip-flop on the President is another indication that he is not a true leader.  He has been over managed by some of the people around him and that makes me even more disgusted not because he didn't listen to me.  I don't have all the answers, but because he doesn't appear to be his own man."
