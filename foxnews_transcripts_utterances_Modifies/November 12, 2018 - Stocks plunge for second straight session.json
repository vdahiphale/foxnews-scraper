And this is \"Your World.\"  And Fox on top of stocks down big time for a second straight session. This time, though, the Dow diving more than 600 points -- or 600 or close to it.  And the president was tweeting harassment by Democrats could cause big headaches for the stock market. And now some added worries about Apple.  The former high flyer is very close to bear market territory, or more than 20 percent from it highs, because the demand for those hot new iPhones might not be that spectacular after all. Whether the markets are getting ahead of themselves or bracing for something even worse, anyone's guess.  Let's go to Fox Business Network's Kristina Partsinevelos, keeping track of all of it. Hey, Kristina.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Neil.   And you're right. You're seeing accelerating losses just within the last minutes of the closing day. We saw the Dow down more than 600 points, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 literally wiping off their gains over the last little while. You're seeing them close down over the past three business days. Seeing it right on your screen, the Dow down 2 percent, Nasdaq 2.3 percent, the S&P 1.5 percent. But what is going on? Let's start with financials. You had Goldman Sachs, this report coming out that there's a scandal going on with Goldman Sachs that is deepening, bribery, kickback, and the Malaysian government. And so that's weighing heavily an all financials today, as well as the continuing talks of a trade war between the United States and China.   Another big drag on the Dow is Apple. Like you mentioned, Neil, you have reports coming out from an Apple supplier that demand could possibly be weakening. And that would be specifically demand towards its iPhones. You have many reports coming out, including J.P. Morgan issuing a statement saying that they believe the earnings report coming out will reflect lower demand. So that's weighing heavily across all technology today on the markets. Other big movers, I wanted to mention this today because Netflix -- I use Netflix. A lot of people use Netflix. Netflix shares are down today, but part of that reason too is that the company, the CEO announced to Bloomberg within the past few business days that they are looking at different pricing schemes, that they may consider lowering prices, but it may not mean you get all the benefits.  Think of bundling and tiered pricing.   We move on. Another big mover, GE, General Electric, unfortunately has seen as stock plummet below $8. You saw it at a nine-year low. That is the worst pace in a long while. Issues with the power business, the recent dividend cut to $1, and accounting scandals. And last but not least, we have got to talk about oil, WTI. You're seeing the price of oil fall below $59 U.S. a barrel. Three major reasons for oil falling in the bear market -- and bear market means it drops 20 percent from its most recent high -- that's because you're seeing weaker demand across the globe, pretty much paired with oversupply.  Then you have got the stronger U.S. dollar. So that makes oil more expensive for a lot of countries. And then last, but not least, the president tweeting at 1:30 p.m. Eastern time that he wants oil prices to be lower. So that's weighing on the markets as a whole.",

But at the end of the day, just like stocks can go up for no good reason, sometimes, they can sell-off for not that many great reasons too. So I am not that uncomfortable.   The 600 handle looks ugly, but the two and three -- two-and-a-third percentage is not that bad. And I look at a couple of things that I have done for the last 30 years. Gold is telling me that I don't have to be that worried. It's actually -- it was actually lower the last time I checked. And you would normally see in the face Armageddon and everybody panicking a rush into gold. So the dollar is stronger because the U.S. economy is doing well. There's the -- the backdrop here in the States is very, very good. I think the bigger question, Neil, is, can we continue to do what we're doing while the rest of the world erodes?",

And, Neil, I was starting to get the phone calls today, investors saying, I'm a little bit worried about this volatility. This isn't the happy-go- lucky, complacent, strongly bullish market that I saw in the beginning of the year. I'm concerned. So that investor psychology is very fragile. It can spread to the general economy if we're not careful about how we treat things in Washington.  Right now, I think this is Apple taking a bite out of the market.  And, look, Apple, some of the other tech names are becoming the forbidden fruit. Those were crowded trades. We knew they were vulnerable to that.  But I think we have to be very concerned that we maintain the small business confidence that has brought us here in this market.  That's the backbone of the economy. That's what's in place. And if Washington becomes dysfunctional -- gridlock is one thing. A traffic jam in Washington is something totally different. So we got to keep this as progressive gridlock. Keep things moving. Keep the agenda on track, so that the markets can move forward and get past this. There's no signs of recession right now. We want to keep it that way in this country.",

So I'm not too overly concerned, because you just look at a chart going back to 2016 or look at a five-year chart, we have had tremendous gains.  It's OK for stocks to go down sometimes.

But the judge did agree to add three more Broward sheriff's deputies inside just for security measures. Taking a look back live inside the tabulation and sorting center here in Broward County. The sorting is still continuing. The recounting of the key three races in question still has yet to begin in Broward County. That is because there are three-and-a-half million pages of ballots.   All of the recount races are on page one. So elections officials are taking up to page one, making a new stack of those.

Specifically, when you look at the fact that they were running progressive candidates in Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams -- Kyrsten Sinema ran more as a moderate -- the fact that two progressive candidates were able to do as well as they did and to get the share of the vote that they did in those particular states means that by energizing, electrifying the progressive base in those Southern states, Democrats are able to get a lot of people to the polls and pick their candidates.

Now, of course, we watched it unfold over the weekend, a very interesting dynamic between the president of this country and the French president. Let me take you to Twitter and share just a bit of what Mr. Trump had to say following that trip. He said: \"Just returned from France, where much was accomplished in my meetings with world leaders. Never easy bringing up the fact that the U.S. must be treated fairly, which it hasn't, on both military and trade. We pay for large portions of other countries' military protection.\" The president later adding: \"Look, either pay up, or maybe it's time to protect yourselves.\" Now, it was that and the president's insistence that he's a nationalist, well, that drew a stinging rebuke from the leader of France. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): As the very opposite of the selfishness of a nation which only looks after its own interests, because patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism.

And it's historically Republican. And right now, the Democrat is in the lead. The McSally campaign has not returned any calls or texts from the FOX News Channel. But on Saturday, they did release a statement. Her campaign said, \"The latest release provides compelling evidence that the remaining uncounted ballots are favorable to Martha, and we will continue our effort to make sure all lawful ballots are counted.\" And the verification of the signatures, or the curing of the ballots, continues. The statewide deadline for curing is 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, but the tabulating may still continue.

If you're in your country, it makes it a lot easier on our government to investigate that. But we know that what they're doing, they're -- they're crossing the border illegally because they know that, ultimately, they're going to be released, and they're not going to have to show up to their court appearances, which then puts out a warrant for their arrest and ties up the system even further.",

And this is \"Your World.\" And Fox on top of stocks down big time for a second straight session. This time, though, the Dow diving more than 600 points -- or 600 or close to it. And the president was tweeting harassment by Democrats could cause big headaches for the stock market. And now some added worries about Apple.  The former high flyer is very close to bear market territory, or more than 20 percent from it highs, because the demand for those hot new iPhones might not be that spectacular after all. Whether the markets are getting ahead of themselves or bracing for something even worse, anyone's guess. Let's go to Fox Business Network's Kristina Partsinevelos, keeping track of all of it. Hey, Kristina."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX NEWS BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. And you're right. You're seeing accelerating losses just within the last minutes of the closing day. We saw the Dow down more than 600 points, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 literally wiping off their gains over the last little while. You're seeing them close down over the past three business days. Seeing it right on your screen, the Dow down 2 percent, Nasdaq 2.3 percent, the S&P 1.5 percent. But what is going on? Let's start with financials. You had Goldman Sachs, this report coming out that there's a scandal going on with Goldman Sachs that is deepening, bribery, kickback, and the Malaysian government. And so that's weighing heavily an all financials today, as well as the continuing talks of a trade war between the United States and China. Another big drag on the Dow is Apple. Like you mentioned, Neil, you have reports coming out from an Apple supplier that demand could possibly be weakening. And that would be specifically demand towards its iPhones. You have many reports coming out, including J.P. Morgan issuing a statement saying that they believe the earnings report coming out will reflect lower demand. So that's weighing heavily across all technology today on the markets. Other big movers, I wanted to mention this today because Netflix -- I use Netflix. A lot of people use Netflix. Netflix shares are down today, but part of that reason too is that the company, the CEO announced to Bloomberg within the past few business days that they are looking at different pricing schemes, that they may consider lowering prices, but it may not mean you get all the benefits. Think of bundling and tiered pricing. We move on. Another big mover, GE, General Electric, unfortunately has seen as stock plummet below $8. You saw it at a nine-year low. That is the worst pace in a long while. Issues with the power business, the recent dividend cut to $1, and accounting scandals. And last but not least, we have got to talk about oil, WTI. You're seeing the price of oil fall below $59 U.S. a barrel. Three major reasons for oil falling in the bear market -- and bear market means it drops 20 percent from its most recent high -- that's because you're seeing weaker demand across the globe, pretty much paired with oversupply. Then you have got the stronger U.S. dollar. So that makes oil more expensive for a lot of countries. And then last, but not least, the president tweeting at 1:30 p.m. Eastern time that he wants oil prices to be lower. So that's weighing on the markets as a whole."

      "speaker": "SCOTT SHELLADY, TJM INVESTMENTS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, if you're retiring tomorrow, yes, you're probably in a little bit of an uncomfortable position. But at the end of the day, just like stocks can go up for no good reason, sometimes, they can sell-off for not that many great reasons too. So I am not that uncomfortable. The 600 handle looks ugly, but the two and three -- two-and-a-third percentage is not that bad. And I look at a couple of things that I have done for the last 30 years. Gold is telling me that I don't have to be that worried. It's actually -- it was actually lower the last time I checked. And you would normally see in the face Armageddon and everybody panicking a rush into gold. So the dollar is stronger because the U.S. economy is doing well. There's the -- the backdrop here in the States is very, very good. I think the bigger question, Neil, is, can we continue to do what we're doing while the rest of the world erodes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Larry, the president was arguing in a tweet that a lot of this has to do with the unsettled nature of the Democrats and already talking about pursuing investigations, that it's adding -- I'm paraphrasing here -- to the uncertainty out there, that a lot of that was sort of baked into the cake, that they assume control of the House anyway. But what do you make of that argument?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY GLAZER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS",
      "utterance": "Yes, look, there's some post-election digestion going on here. And, Neil, I was starting to get the phone calls today, investors saying, I'm a little bit worried about this volatility. This isn't the happy-go- lucky, complacent, strongly bullish market that I saw in the beginning of the year. I'm concerned. So that investor psychology is very fragile. It can spread to the general economy if we're not careful about how we treat things in Washington.  Right now, I think this is Apple taking a bite out of the market. And, look, Apple, some of the other tech names are becoming the forbidden fruit. Those were crowded trades. We knew they were vulnerable to that.  But I think we have to be very concerned that we maintain the small business confidence that has brought us here in this market. That's the backbone of the economy. That's what's in place. And if Washington becomes dysfunctional -- gridlock is one thing. A traffic jam in Washington is something totally different. So we got to keep this as progressive gridlock. Keep things moving. Keep the agenda on track, so that the markets can move forward and get past this. There's no signs of recession right now. We want to keep it that way in this country."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHELLADY",
      "utterance": "Well, this is 2.3 percent crazy. The 600 handle, as I say, yes, I agree, does look ugly. But at the end of the day, you will see those bond yields come in as we open up tomorrow, because they would have traded lower today had that been the case. So I'm not too overly concerned, because you just look at a chart going back to 2016 or look at a five-year chart, we have had tremendous gains. It's OK for stocks to go down sometimes. I mean, that's what markets do.  We just have to digest it."

But, on Apple, I mean, it -- because it has this curse of high expectations, just the notion that it might only sell in the approaching quarter 35 million units of anything, like the iPhone, for example, is deemed a disappointment, but -- and even though it's just a forecast. But what do you make of that and the highs sort of expectation game we play with this stuff?"

And we know China is really suffering, not just because of trade issues, but because of domestic issues and their own agenda. But I think, if we look at oil prices, there's a silver lining to this, Neil. As we get into the holiday shopping season, nothing helps the consumer better than a decline in oil prices. And I think that has the potential to save Christmas for so many investors..."

Today, the first courtroom defeat for Republican Governor Rick Scott, whose contest with incumbent Democrat Bill Nelson is currently under the recount order, that by a state statute. The judge ruled that Governor Scott's motion to staff state police officers inside this Broward tabulation center in order to impound all of the counting and sorting machines and ballots when they're not being used was overkill and not necessary. But the judge did agree to add three more Broward sheriff's deputies inside just for security measures. Taking a look back live inside the tabulation and sorting center here in Broward County. The sorting is still continuing. The recounting of the key three races in question still has yet to begin in Broward County. That is because there are three-and-a-half million pages of ballots. All of the recount races are on page one. So elections officials are taking up to page one, making a new stack of those. And as soon as they get that stack made, perhaps by tonight or first thing in the morning, they will then begin the tabulating of all of these votes. Meanwhile, the two Senate candidates in this race continue their verbal barbs."

In the meanwhile, new worries that the Republican majority in the Senate could shrink, as it looks like the Democratic majority in the House could get up to as many as 38 additional seats, from the roughly little more than two dozen that was thought to be the case last week at this time. With me now, The Federalist's Emily Jashinsky, Republican pollster Lee Carter, Democratic strategist Christy Setzer. Christy, to you. How important is it for Democrats to contain that Senate advance, that, in other words, if we're left with the same Senate that we had last session, it would -- it would confirm the Republicans still in control, but not as much in control, right?"

      "utterance": "That's true. I think the Democrats, however, can still be pretty excited about what happened last Tuesday, regardless of whether or not Republicans gained a seat or even two seats. The biggest reason that we care about it, of course, is the ability of the Republican Party to confirm judgeships if they have an expanded Senate.  That's the thing that the Democrats need to be most worried about with the Senate advantage. That said, that is one of the few dark spots of an otherwise really amazing night."

There are nine races that are still up in the air, Lee, last time I checked, including three in California, one in Georgia, one in New Jersey, another in Maine and New York -- two in New York, actually, one in Utah. Now, if just five of those nine seats were to go to the Democrats, they'd have 38 seats gained in the House. That does change the dynamics a bit, doesn't it?"

    {
      "speaker": "LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "A bit. And I think that the Republicans need to be really honest about this. Yes, Republicans expected to lose the House and win the Senate. But what does this really mean? When you look at some of the places that the Republicans lost, this should have been a map that was very, very kind to Republicans, and yet it wasn't. They lost in Pennsylvania, they lost in Michigan, they lost in Wisconsin.  These are places that carried Trump to victory in 2016, and they're going to need to be able to win in 2020 if they want to win it back. I think that people sent a very clear message to Republicans that, A, they want to get health care done, and, B, they don't like the tone and the rhetoric that's coming out of the right, right now and they want something different. So I think that Republicans really need to take this seriously right now and say, what is it the American public is telling us and how do we better serve them, so that we can win back in 2020?"

I mean, we're talking about states right now -- we're talking about Georgia, we're talking about Florida, we're talking about Arizona. Specifically, when you look at the fact that they were running progressive candidates in Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams -- Kyrsten Sinema ran more as a moderate -- the fact that two progressive candidates were able to do as well as they did and to get the share of the vote that they did in those particular states means that by energizing, electrifying the progressive base in those Southern states, Democrats are able to get a lot of people to the polls and pick their candidates. And that should alarm Republicans. Look, I'm a conservative. I was happy to see the victories that we were able to get away with in tough, tough states, tough races, Missouri. Josh Hawley had a fantastic victory there. But it's not all good news for Republicans, what we saw in the Senate. And the map was favorable to them. But the fact that some of these races were as close as they were with progressive candidates, I think that's a red flag."

Let's talk Christian Whiton on all of this, the former senior State Department adviser for President Trump and President George W. Bush. On this, President Trump has a valid point, does he not? This notion that, yes, it's one thing for you to criticize nationalism, but say what you will of this country and our approach, that nationalism, or whatever you want to call it, has saved your heinie a number of times, and saved this global community."

      "utterance": "Yes, this was really appalling by Macron.  The United States has bailed out France twice in the 20th century. Macron is really just cracking up here, I think. His popularity is absolutely in the toilet. It's in the 20s, a number of scandals. Like a lot of these French politicians who comes in -- come in under the banner of reform, the reforms seem awfully elusive. His economy is growing at 1.6 percent. It's anemic. That's half of the growth that we have. And, also, he's just flat-out wrong. Nationalism and patriotism, I mean, maybe it's different in the French language, but in English, those two things are synonyms. You can't have sort of the patriotism and love of country without love of the nation state via nationalism."

      "utterance": "And, by the way, the French are -- are leaders in that. And that's fine. They love their country. They love -- they love everything about their -- and that's fine. They should. But the fact of the matter is that, when pushes come to shove, and they have wanted that protected, the United States has been there to do just that. So what is so nationalistic or so territorial about the United States saying, all right, could we share the wealth here and the burden, that you talk a good game, now pay up, to prove you mean it, that the world order means something to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "Right. And I think that's what Macron is rebelling against, just this idea that, frankly, we want some changes to the way things are done. France does a little better than Germany. Germany pays 1.2 percent of its GDP on defense. France is at 1.8, but this is well below the 2 percent that NATO has promised itself to spend on..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "Right. And the 2 percent is a pretty low benchmark. If they really think that Russia is the threat that they're telling us, they want us to make sacrifices that they're unwilling to make. There's another thing going on here, though. I think Macron within the E.U. is under a lot of pressure. Frankly, Germany is willing to cut a deal on the trade changes that Trump wants to lower tariffs across the board. But what we need is the French to agree to agricultural reform. And they seem unwilling to do that. They're being pressured within the E.U., unwilling to give on that so far. So there's the combination of things. Macron and doesn't like that. He doesn't like the pressure. He doesn't like having to spend more on the military. He doesn't like the fact that Italy is, along with Britain, sort of peeling away from the E.U., not quite as directly yet, Eastern Europe not as kosher on the E.U. So a lot of these things just aren't going the way that this former investment banker would like them to go."

Mitch McConnell said when the Republicans took back the House that our number one priority is to make sure that Barack Obama doesn't win another term. That wasn't just wrong. That was un-American.

That's a vet and that's an American talking. It doesn't matter what your party allegiance is. We have got to get back to putting the country first, the parties working together to solve problems.

And it's historically Republican. And right now, the Democrat is in the lead. The McSally campaign has not returned any calls or texts from the FOX News Channel. But on Saturday, they did release a statement. Her campaign said, \"The latest release provides compelling evidence that the remaining uncounted ballots are favorable to Martha, and we will continue our effort to make sure all lawful ballots are counted.\" And the verification of the signatures, or the curing of the ballots, continues. The statewide deadline for curing is 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, but the tabulating may still continue.

In other words, legal immigration still is alive and well, and at the tune of a net gain to this country of better than a million citizens each year, darn near every year. Border Patrol union president Brandon Judd, though, on this caravan. We lose sight of that, don't we, that legal immigration is just fine and working just fine? This is another matter, huh?"

They can present themselves at ports of entry.  They can -- they can claim asylum at a port of entry, which is a legal process, which then will process them into the United States pending a credible fear claim. But the problem is, is that the vast majority of these individuals do not do it legally. They will end -- ultimately break the law by crossing the border illegally. And then they will claim asylum once they take Border Patrol resources out of the field. But what's really upsetting to Border Patrol agents about this is, they can accomplish this exact same thing in their own countries. If you're from Guatemala, you can go to an American Consulate and you can claim asylum there. We're ultimately going to have to do an investigation into your claim. If you're in your country, it makes it a lot easier on our government to investigate that. But we know that what they're doing, they're -- they're crossing the border illegally because they know that, ultimately, they're going to be released, and they're not going to have to show up to their court appearances, which then puts out a warrant for their arrest and ties up the system even further."

But the Mexicans don't seem eager to do that. So then what do we do? The president had mentioned building tents or tent cities that could house a lot of these folks while they're waiting for that, because, in the end, only a small percentage of asylum seekers from any nation are ultimately brought into the country on an asylum basis. So, what happens?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",

That's -- that's the reason that 80 percent don't show up to court. We can build tent cities, we can do all those different things. The problem is, is, we have this Ninth Circuit court of appeals case, the Flores decision, which says we can only hold children in custody for 20 days. And if you can only hold them in 20 days, we just don't -- we cannot adjudicate an asylum claim within 20 days.

Kat Timpf is joining us right now. Kat, I think he played it brilliantly, and bygones were bygones for everyone."

      "utterance": "I thought that this was just handled so wonderfully. And I wish that if everything could only be handled this way. We had Pete Davidson being humble enough to admit that he made a mistake. And then Dan Crenshaw, he not only accepted the apology, but he accepted it with humor.  We saw civility and humor. Those are two things that we don't see enough of these days. And you put them together. And, look, look what can happen. We can all get along."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, you're right about that. I was thinking to myself, I don't know the last Republican who has been portrayed well on that on -- that show. But, obviously, both came through this with flying colors. And Crenshaw, a lot of his friends, I know that, for a fact, were telling him to be appalled and angry and everything. But here's a combat veteran who lost his eye in battle in a third tour in Iraq and said, no, no, I'm not going to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I think, with this climate now, it's just been really a lot of hostility. I think that people are almost waiting for a chance to say, oh, now I can get them. Now I can get the left, or people on the left saying, oh, now I can get the right. And he had every opportunity to do that. And I think a lot of people would have even stood behind him if he would have decided to do that. But he said, you know what? I'm going to choose to get along instead. And he came out looking super likable and even, like you said, to an \"SNL\" audience, actually, as a Republican. That's no small feat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, it isn't. And, Kat, I'm just reminded, though, despite the progress that seemed to be to made on a very popular late-night comedy show, the fact of the matter is, divisions are still real. You experienced it yourself, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Mm-hmm. Yes. Over the weekend, I was at a bar, and a girl started -- she realized I worked at Fox News, started screaming at me, telling me to get out. I tried to move to a different area of the bar. She kept screaming at me, telling me to get out. I kept trying to say, like, what did you -- what did I say that you had a problem with? Or maybe I thought it was one of my views that was so offensive. She said, it doesn't matter. I don't think she knew a single thing that I ever said on TV. She just knew where I worked. And that was enough for me to be run out of the bar."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I was afraid she was going to hit me or throw a drink on me. She was super belligerent. Like I said, I tried to move to a different area of the bar. But the yelling continued. So I didn't really see as I had a choice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Man, oh, man, sorry to hear that, Kat. But we see it again and again. And I'm just wondering, though, maybe this \"SNL\" back and forth is a reminder that cooler, calmer, self-effacing heads can prevail here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Because that's what worked in this particular skit. And I think it reminded people you could be petty or angry, or you can just admit you goofed and move on and make amends and make friends."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes, and you can use your sense of humor as well. A sense of humor is something that really can unite people, bring people together, and really can heal all wounds. So I'm really glad to see that that's what it looks like happened here."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I fully agree with you. Kat Timpf, thank you very, very much. Is it coincidental or actually special that it was a veteran involved in that, a man who kept his anger to himself, after he experienced so much, and decided it wasn't worth it? That's what you really admire about veterans. And, on this Veterans Day, that's what we as a country admire about all of you who serve this country nobly, bravely, quietly, and with great character.
