It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" You are looking live at Capitol Hill where we are awaiting a senate foreign relations committee vote on the nomination of Mike Pompeo for secretary of state. No Democrat on the panel supports his nomination. Neither does Republican, Rand Paul, meaning Pompeo won't have enough support for a favorable recommendation. But, majority leader Mitch McConnell still intends to hold a full confirmation vote this week on the floor. Three senate Democrats, so far, had said that they will back him, Manchin, Donnelly and Heitkamp. The White House praised them, but blasts the, quote, pointless obstruction of the rest of their party.",

And sadly, just out of pure politics, there is no other good answer, motivation. They are objecting to him. Why? To try to prevent President Trump from putting through his agenda. And this is despite the fact that President Trump has made tremendous inroads in foreign policy and national security, showing strength and resolve in Syria. Showing strength and resolve with Iran. Showing strength and resolve in North Korea, really making a manifest change, no other administration has been able to do to quite be able to, kind of, figure that situation out and cause this course correction in national security history.  Nevertheless, this is someone that he needs to be able to continue for with this mission to be able to do this and serve the CIA, and now can do this with -- in the state department, which is sorely in need of some, you know, structure, some discipline, some focus for all the people hardworking there to get some order and put it in place.

Mike Pompeo is the guy who can get the job done, essentially, no matter what it is. He's done that throughout his history. Whatever position he's in, he's been successful at all of those professional responsibilities. He knows what it's like to be responsible for human life, what's at stake for the country. And, this is an issue that has been severely politicized for the sake of being against the president. And Democrats want it both ways. They've been criticizing the Trump administration for destroying the state department, for not having diplomats in place, we're having a bunch of empty post around the world, and yet the president has sent a number of nominations that had been obstructed around the world. And then you have him saying -- or nominating Mike Pompeo, who at his confirmation hearing said that he as a priority wanting to make sure those posts were filled. So, Democrats have to make a choice. You either backing the state department and national security by confirming Pompeo and allowing him to do the job, to make sure those diplomats are in place, or you have to take a step back and understand that if you don't allow them to get into place to do the job for America to represent our country and the interests of the United States, then you can't criticizing on both of those levels.",

He offered no statements to police other than to immediately request an attorney. They took him to a nearby hospital for evaluation. He was no stranger to law enforcement.  In 2016, authorities in Tazewell County, Illinois, reported that Reinking was delusional and claimed he was being stalked by singer Taylor Swift. And then, the following year he was arrested by secret service for refusing to leave a secure area near the White House.

His dad is an idiot for giving him back the guns after they're taken away from him. There's nothing you can do to take that human error out of the equation, and it is infuriating to go back to the idea that regular, every day Americans who just want to defend their families have to be paying the consequences for other people's -- especially in government, bad behavior. And when you look at the issue as a whole, yes, AR-15's are used in a lot of these crimes, but handguns are actually used in the majority of mass shootings according to the Department of Homeland Security. So, you're vilifying a weapon instead of actually dealing with the issues that we've seen over and over again in terms of human failure. Evil cannot be legislative against, but we have to do something about not preventing people from getting firearms to defend themselves, but we have to do something about people who are screwing up every single time and then regular people are blamed for their mistakes.",

His career as a world heavyweight champion was subsequently destroyed by this criminal conviction. And then sadly, he later died in a car accident in 1946. His great-grand-niece along with Senator John McCain and former Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid have been pushing for him to be pardoned for years.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" You are looking live at Capitol Hill where we are awaiting a senate foreign relations committee vote on the nomination of Mike Pompeo for secretary of state. No Democrat on the panel supports his nomination. Neither does Republican, Rand Paul, meaning Pompeo won't have enough support for a favorable recommendation. But, majority leader Mitch McConnell still intends to hold a full confirmation vote this week on the floor. Three senate Democrats, so far, had said that they will back him, Manchin, Donnelly and Heitkamp.

They just want to be able to step in the way of a fine American that should be serving this country and continuing in this capacity. And sadly, just out of pure politics, there is no other good answer, motivation. They are objecting to him. Why? To try to prevent President Trump from putting through his agenda. And this is despite the fact that President Trump has made tremendous inroads in foreign policy and national security, showing strength and resolve in Syria. Showing strength and resolve with Iran. Showing strength and resolve in North Korea, really making a manifest change, no other administration has been able to do to quite be able to, kind of, figure that situation out and cause this course correction in national security history. Nevertheless, this is someone that he needs to be able to continue for with this mission to be able to do this and serve the CIA, and now can do this with -- in the state department, which is sorely in need of some, you know, structure, some discipline, some focus for all the people hardworking there to get some order and put it in place.

I mean, he's been in the position, not officially, but he's done the diplomacy at the highest level possible when everybody is criticizing him and saying that should be done at lower levels. Mike Pompeo is the guy who can get the job done, essentially, no matter what it is. He's done that throughout his history. Whatever position he's in, he's been successful at all of those professional responsibilities. He knows what it's like to be responsible for human life, what's at stake for the country. And, this is an issue that has been severely politicized for the sake of being against the president. And Democrats want it both ways. They've been criticizing the Trump administration for destroying the state department, for not having diplomats in place, we're having a bunch of empty post around the world, and yet the president has sent a number of nominations that had been obstructed around the world. And then you have him saying -- or nominating Mike Pompeo, who at his confirmation hearing said that he as a priority wanting to make sure those posts were filled. So, Democrats have to make a choice. You either backing the state department and national security by confirming Pompeo and allowing him to do the job, to make sure those diplomats are in place, or you have to take a step back and understand that if you don't allow them to get into place to do the job for America to represent our country and the interests of the United States, then you can't criticizing on both of those levels."

They ordered him to hit the ground, and he obeyed without any violence. They say that they searched his backpack. They found a handgun inside along with some ammunition. He offered no statements to police other than to immediately request an attorney. They took him to a nearby hospital for evaluation. He was no stranger to law enforcement. In 2016, authorities in Tazewell County, Illinois, reported that Reinking was delusional and claimed he was being stalked by singer Taylor Swift. And then, the following year he was arrested by secret service for refusing to leave a secure area near the White House. After that, authorities seized his weapons, put him in the custody of his father, but police say the father later returned the weapons to his son. For that reason, the father may also face some potential criminal charges. Back to you guys."

They knew about it. Secret service knew about him. They gave the guns back to his dad, which was idiotic, and the dad gave it to him. So, it's about the mentally ill having guns, not about law-abiding citizens having guns. So, you don't tell the law-abiding citizens you can't have guns, because right now they're the only -- that's the only way to separate yourself, protect yourself from that guy. I know that people say there's just too many guns, but I need a mathematical equation to tell me what to many is because if the amount of guns is directly correlated with violent crime, why is violent crime decreasing, which means, to me, that it is correlated.

It's extremely frustrating over and over again to see the government -- number of levels, if it's the FBI, with all due respect, the secret service, I don't know what else they could have done. His dad is an idiot for giving him back the guns after they're taken away from him. There's nothing you can do to take that human error out of the equation, and it is infuriating to go back to the idea that regular, every day Americans who just want to defend their families have to be paying the consequences for other people's -- especially in government, bad behavior. And when you look at the issue as a whole, yes, AR-15's are used in a lot of these crimes, but handguns are actually used in the majority of mass shootings according to the Department of Homeland Security. So, you're vilifying a weapon instead of actually dealing with the issues that we've seen over and over again in terms of human failure. Evil cannot be legislative against, but we have to do something about not preventing people from getting firearms to defend themselves, but we have to do something about people who are screwing up every single time and then regular people are blamed for their mistakes."

And he tried to talk to President Trump, but you don't do that by breaching the White House gate. And so, they pick him up there. He had an AR-15. This guy has been in a public swimming pool. He came in with a woman's dress on, took the dress off, swam in the pool and exposed himself to the lifeguards. He also, like, left the house with a gun strap, wearing a pink dress, threw it in the car, threaten somebody else. This guy was a danger to himself. He was suicidal. He, obviously, had mental illness. The fact that the father was given custody of the weapon, and then knowing all you know about your own son, to allow the guns to get back in the son's hand is a dereliction of duty. The guy is an idiot. I would agree. And you're exactly right too.

And West must be punished, too, for the strategy is to ruin everyone by connection. If you like Candace, you're worse than Candace. When in reality, both transcend the orbit that their critics still live in. Kanye is extra dangerous to the left. For blacks leaning right, he's confirmatory. They've got to shut him down. And he didn't even endorse Candace's beliefs, just her guts. In attacking him, they're attacking the very concept of free speech. Because there's nothing scarier to a leftist that a freethinker.

They say, \"Why are you so conservative? What's wrong with you? You know, you can't, you know, think for yourself,\" et cetera. And I said, \"These are my thoughts. These are my opinions. These are my beliefs based on my life experience.\" And I think it's so courageous when you're able to come forward and step up and say what you think and what you mean, especially in a minority community where people want to prejudge you, categorize you, label you and put you in a certain category and say this is how you should think. This is how you should feel. This is how you should vote. This is where you should put your money, et cetera, et cetera, based on perhaps what they think is their prejudged determination of where you belong, essentially, like in a box.

      "utterance": "Thank you, Jesse. I'm a big fan of boxing in American history. And President Donald Trump considering a possible pardon for famous boxer Jack Johnson after actor Sylvester Stallone brought the story to his attention. Take a picture of him there. He was boxing's first heavyweight champion, and in 1913 he was convicted of taking his white girlfriend across state lines, and he went to prison for a year. His career as a world heavyweight champion was subsequently destroyed by this criminal conviction. And then sadly, he later died in a car accident in 1946. His great-grand-niece along with Senator John McCain and former Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid have been pushing for him to be pardoned for years. So it's a story of triumph and tragedy, but it's not over yet. And President Donald Trump hopefully will pardon this fine American and put him back in the ranks where he belongs, one of boxing's greatest."

The photo, four generations of American presidents and their wives, was taken Saturday at Barbara Bush's funeral in Houston. We have her husband, former president H.W. Bush; her son George W. and his wife Laura. The younger Bush has his arm around Hillary Clinton. President Bill Clinton stands behind them. And joining them is President Obama and his wife, Michelle, and current first lady, Melania Trump. The only living presidents missing, Jimmy Carter, Donald Trump. This is one way American politics ought to be. One country, one family, one people out of many."

He had to go in for what they thought was cancer surgery. His name is Mazie (ph), by the way. Eight years old. Brought him in and they found it wasn't cancer at all. He had been eating teddy bears. We all know that teddy bears have lots of carbohydrates. And they don't digest easily. So I would say do not eat teddy bears, dog!"
