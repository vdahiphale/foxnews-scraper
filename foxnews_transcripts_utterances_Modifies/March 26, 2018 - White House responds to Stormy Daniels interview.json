Stormy Daniels broke her silence on \"60 Minutes\" last night about her alleged affair with the president in 2006. There were a few bombshells, but this story caught some attention. The adult film star claimed she struck a deal with Mr. Trump's lawyer to keep quiet after getting a mysterious warning back in 2011.",

There wasn't anything there that shocked me. And I think Trump is like any choice you make, with the flaws understood beforehand. And this is important because Trump's follies or how he was as a man are well documented for decades. The election proved that they were factored in by half of the population already. So, to continue to scream about the fact that he may not have been a good husband or he cheated on his wife, which are the same thing, that's like moving to Seattle, and then every day complaining about the rain. You moved there. The election happened. It is like the -- it is like how conservatives complained about President Obama's inexperience after he'd been elected, and just kept complaining about it. He won. So that debate is over. So, I think, the one thing I would do is, unlike Hillary Clinton and the media, I'm not going to trash a woman because of sexual claims, but it's safe to say that America can accept a billionaire extrovert with unlimited options in New York City, and wasn't a great husband.",

So she's counter punching when it comes to that. When it comes to the lawsuit, so, apparently, she would owe $20 million as of today because, apparently, she's broke the NDA so much that that would be worth $20 million back to Cohen.

And they're letting the media go on the attack. And that's fine. It's just interesting back in the '90s, the media was defending the president and going after the women, and now they're defending the women and going after the president. But that's fine. You know, Republicans did overplayed their hand in the '90s, and Bill Clinton wind up in a pretty good position politically at the end of his second term.  But, to going back to what Greg said, I mean, if it's true when the president did have an affair, consensually, with this person over a decade ago, I don't think the American public cares that much. It wasn't a Me Too thing. It was consensual. And just technically, she hasn't provided any evidence to prove that it actually happened. And 60 Minutes, I don't think enlightened us that much of anything. We heard a lot of it before. The only substantive issues are, one, was a threat made. Two, was there a campaign finance law violation with the payment before the election. And then, three, did she have any pictures or video to blackmail the president with? CBS didn't do anything to show us any of that information, and that's fine. And right now, it looks like sex sells because they'd got a great rating, but a lot of that had to do with the anticipation, and the fact it came off of the Duke-Kansas overtime game. But, you know, politicians, usually, can get away with this, but if they can it's for a few reasons. One, they're holy rollers, you know. And then, there's the hypocrisy thing. You know, you're pro-life. You pay for the abortion for the mistress. Two, if there's scandalous video that's going to come out. Three, if it's an out of the closet situation like a Larry Craig. And then, lastly, if there's public taxpayer money that's used to facilitate the affair. Right now, Marc Thiessen had a really nice piece in Dot.com where he said the reason why evangelical voters are sticking with the president is because he's defended religious liberty. He's been very pro-life. He spoke to the March for Life march. And he appointed Gorsuch. And he's been very, very good on those issues. So, he's kept his promises.

And, even today, when I was looking, I thought to myself, wait a minute, she's only one of three. Because then, you've got the Karen McDougal. You've got Summer Zervos. And now in the Summer Zervos' case, the judge has allowed that charge to go forward. And, potentially, the president will have to be deposed, and that will put him on the record. Again, this is tremendous danger in terms of his political stability. And I think that's where this is going.

Not really, because by criticizing him, I'm complementing him. He's now a revolutionary, like other well-organized and well-funded revolutionaries. Not challenging revolutionaries will be patronizing. But if you're asking me, the students of Parkland had a real gripe. A craven sheriff didn't do his job as well as an insane killer did his, so 17 people died. The students thought their school should be a safe space, not like the safe spaces of older college kids who weep at the hint of painful truths. But a real safe space protected from madmen and when necessary shielded by grown-ups with guns.  The same goals of sensible students should not be ignored by the NRA. But if the other truth is ignored by parents, well, go on blaming guns for acts of evil instead of actual evildoers. And in four years, you'll end up with cowering undergrads majoring only in sanctimony and sign-making. There was a great story after this.

Stormy Daniels broke her silence on \"60 Minutes\" last night about her alleged affair with the president in 2006. There were a few bombshells, but this story caught some attention. The adult film star claimed she struck a deal with Mr. Trump's lawyer to keep quiet after getting a mysterious warning back in 2011."

So, obviously, continued developments in this case, where an affair that has alleged to have occurred quite some years ago.

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Interesting thing, I mean, for me, I thought it was a big letdown. The verifiable information is well- established and old news. I mean, finding out again that Trump might have slept with a porn star is as shocking as Mike Pence not sleeping with one. I've heard better tell-all from Harpo Marx. There wasn't anything there that shocked me. And I think Trump is like any choice you make, with the flaws understood beforehand. And this is important because Trump's follies or how he was as a man are well documented for decades. The election proved that they were factored in by half of the population already. So, to continue to scream about the fact that he may not have been a good husband or he cheated on his wife, which are the same thing, that's like moving to Seattle, and then every day complaining about the rain. You moved there. The election happened. It is like the -- it is like how conservatives complained about President Obama's inexperience after he'd been elected, and just kept complaining about it. He won. So that debate is over. So, I think, the one thing I would do is, unlike Hillary Clinton and the media, I'm not going to trash a woman because of sexual claims, but it's safe to say that America can accept a billionaire extrovert with unlimited options in New York City, and wasn't a great husband."

      "utterance": "Well, so, Raj Shah do the briefing today during the 2 o'clock show, and I was watching it thinking, wow, he's doing a great job of basically not giving the story any more oxygen, so starving it from being able to advance. But his answer to the MSNBC or the NBC reporter in which they deny all underlying claims, just ensures that they will continue to -- they, meaning the media, everyone is going to continue to cover the story because what she said on 60 minutes is that I don't want to be called a liar. So she's counter punching when it comes to that. When it comes to the lawsuit, so, apparently, she would owe $20 million as of today because, apparently, she's broke the NDA so much that that would be worth $20 million back to Cohen. But then, they countersued for defamation. So, I, legally -- legally, I don't see where this ends. It does remind me a bit of the John Edwards story that comes out because of the National Enquirer's investigation."

I don't think it is as important as other things. I also can understand why Democrats are thinking, oh, look at these Republican hypocrites. They cared so much in the 1990's. Why don't they care now? Yes, but also, aren't the Democrats, in some way, dealing with what they did during the 1990's when they ignored it and excused it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Yeah, because it's back and forth. It's a million dollars for each time she violates it, so that's why it's up to 20, so good luck with that. Yeah, Jesse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Democrats, politically, are laying low on the Stormy Daniels thing because they defended Bill Clinton for doing much more than this allegedly. And they're letting the media go on the attack. And that's fine. It's just interesting back in the '90s, the media was defending the president and going after the women, and now they're defending the women and going after the president. But that's fine. You know, Republicans did overplayed their hand in the '90s, and Bill Clinton wind up in a pretty good position politically at the end of his second term. But, to going back to what Greg said, I mean, if it's true when the president did have an affair, consensually, with this person over a decade ago, I don't think the American public cares that much. It wasn't a Me Too thing. It was consensual. And just technically, she hasn't provided any evidence to prove that it actually happened. And 60 Minutes, I don't think enlightened us that much of anything. We heard a lot of it before. The only substantive issues are, one, was a threat made. Two, was there a campaign finance law violation with the payment before the election. And then, three, did she have any pictures or video to blackmail the president with? CBS didn't do anything to show us any of that information, and that's fine. And right now, it looks like sex sells because they'd got a great rating, but a lot of that had to do with the anticipation, and the fact it came off of the Duke-Kansas overtime game. But, you know, politicians, usually, can get away with this, but if they can it's for a few reasons. One, they're holy rollers, you know. And then, there's the hypocrisy thing. You know, you're pro-life. You pay for the abortion for the mistress. Two, if there's scandalous video that's going to come out. Three, if it's an out of the closet situation like a Larry Craig. And then, lastly, if there's public taxpayer money that's used to facilitate the affair. Right now, Marc Thiessen had a really nice piece in Dot.com where he said the reason why evangelical voters are sticking with the president is because he's defended religious liberty. He's been very pro-life. He spoke to the March for Life march. And he appointed Gorsuch. And he's been very, very good on those issues. So, he's kept his promises. And right now, it hasn't moved the needle in terms of the base."

And I think there're lots of questions, is this woman a truth teller or she's simply self-aggrandizing, or taking advantage of this moment? All she's is a stripper or whatever. And, you know, and he's the president now, so she's trying to make something of it. But you notice that Trump hasn't said much about it. And, even today, when I was looking, I thought to myself, wait a minute, she's only one of three. Because then, you've got the Karen McDougal. You've got Summer Zervos. And now in the Summer Zervos' case, the judge has allowed that charge to go forward. And, potentially, the president will have to be deposed, and that will put him on the record. Again, this is tremendous danger in terms of his political stability. And I think that's where this is going. The other point is if she's telling the truth about the payments and being threatened, well, then you have a, potentially, a federal election commission violation in terms of, you know, contribution to a campaign because it was done to advance President Trump's campaign at a critical moment just before the 2016 election."

So, a lot of these have to be viewed in the political context, and he's teasing this information that's going to be coming out. I mean, if you're going to bring out the information, why not put it out on 60 Minutes, when the whole country is watching? So, I don't know exactly what he has. It could be that he has nothing. And, you know, the whole Stormy Daniels thing, a lot of these people think on the right that this is like the new Russia thing. First it's Russia, then he's racist, then he's a traitor, and that he's mentally I'll. And now he's this, you know, lying cheater.

Well, the other woman said they had several months affair. But I don't get it. But to my mind, the trouble and the issue here, it doesn't move the political needle, the base.

Not really, because by criticizing him, I'm complementing him. He's now a revolutionary, like other well-organized and well-funded revolutionaries. Not challenging revolutionaries will be patronizing. But if you're asking me, the students of Parkland had a real gripe. A craven sheriff didn't do his job as well as an insane killer did his, so 17 people died. The students thought their school should be a safe space, not like the safe spaces of older college kids who weep at the hint of painful truths. But a real safe space protected from madmen and when necessary shielded by grown-ups with guns. The same goals of sensible students should not be ignored by the NRA. But if the other truth is ignored by parents, well, go on blaming guns for acts of evil instead of actual evildoers. And in four years, you'll end up with cowering undergrads majoring only in sanctimony and sign-making. There was a great story after this.

What happened at Virginia Tech, Newtown. That's what we're talking about. And to me, you know, I'm just struck that people will try to diminish the power of what happened over the weekend. The incredible turnout, the incredible numbers, not just in Washington, but around the country of people trying to express, you know, something is wrong and we need to really have honest discussions and confront it. Like, I was on \"Fox News Sunday\" yesterday with Newt Gingrich. The former speaker says to me, who's paying for this? And I think, so you question the authenticity and the sincerity of these young people. Or to say -- as you're saying today, why aren't they mad at Sheriff Israel? And I think to myself, well, you can be mad but that's the heart and soul of it is that we see repeat occasions in this country of this kind of incident. And also, don't forget, the ongoing attacks in places like Chicago that we often discuss where handguns are used by the gang bangers and the like to kill people. And I just think it's time for us as a society to be willing and daring enough to stand up and say we're going to deal with this. We're going to stop having easy access to guns everywhere."

Or there's one of these guys, Cavett Phillips, who's like a younger version of me that went out and asked questions, what's an assault rifle? And no one knows what an actual assault rifle is. And all of these people are being protected by heavily armed security guards. That's fine. The guy -- is it David Hogg or Hoggs? He started off and I've seen him on Fox News. He started off as this balanced, nice kid who was reporting the facts about what was happening at the school. And he's just now become a real bomb thrower. And someone like this, I think, isn't helping the conversation. It makes people get their backs up. This guy makes people think you're coming for my guns. You're going to say that Rubio is -- you know, has blood on his hands because he takes money from the NRA? Maybe he takes money from the NRA because he supports the second amendment. It would be more scandalous if the NRA was buying off Democrats and they were voting for NRA legislation, even if they didn't believe in it. So, that doesn't make any sense to me. I also think that whenever there's a scandal in this country, the left and the media blame Republicans. It's the NRA, it's Fox News, it's Trump, it's Bush, no matter what happens because in this particular situation, the guy had a rifle because the bill of rights said an 18-year-old with no criminal record can have a rifle. And it was the police, and the school, and the FBI, those are the people that failed. Let's just take a broader look and not just target the NRA."

Almost now to the point where it's boomeranging to help the NRA because the March for our Lives is becoming a little-bit tangled in with a gun grab motivation, which is palely problematic. So there's, you know, interesting dialogue and rhetoric going back and forth and communication, which is fantastic. And they were marching now, you know, here in New York. In front of my apartment this weekend, the whole deal. And, you know, it's good to see people getting involved. That's what we want. That's what we fought for our freedoms for this country.

And so, one of the things that the president did so well, he's got that power to convene. And no one is going to turn down an invitation to come and talk. And it might be that he could be the one to bring some NRA folks together, and some of these March for our Lives folks together, saying let's get in a room and let's talk about it.

To let them know that this isn't business as usual. So these are significant advancements that really were not present during President Obama's administration.

Then you have banning criminal background checks at work. That just meant fewer blacks being hired. The companies that had criminal background checks hired more blacks.

In fact, I thought you guys were going to attack him on the fact that he said a lot of our problems are caused by old men. And then he had to apologize and he said no offense to men who are old. But here's the situation where, you know, we talked about the march this weekend on the guns and Obama saying this. I think what you're seeing is Democratic political leaders hungry to keep the energy up going towards the midterms. And thinking that, if you can get young people engaged, whether it's on the gun issue, health care, education, that you will get a change in terms of response during the midterms, when Democrats typically are indifferent."

And we could go into all the reasons I think that John Bolton will be a very good national security advisor. But the question here is that Van Jones is giving very good advice to the Democrats. And they would be wise to take it, his advice. He was one of the only Democrats who publicly said early on that Donald Trump could win the election. He grew up in Tennessee, in a small town. He recognized what was happening in America, not just on the coasts. And so, you know, they are getting free advice there on CNN. They should take it."

I like Van Jones, too. I think Van Jones is -- he's right sometimes when he says that Russia is a nothing burger, and then he's so wrong sometimes when he says Trump's election was a white-lash. But I like him, because he's right half the time and for a Democrat, that's pretty good. You have to save your outrage, though, because the Democrats will get outraged over Trump retweeting a video of him body-slamming a CNN logo. And then Trump will repeal the Obamacare mandate. And they're just exhausted at that point. So just, you know, save your ammunition for stuff that really matters."

And I think the big step for Democrats, and it's something that Van Jones could do, is that they have to stop holding the sins of the dead over that of the living. Because that's the big problem here. The oppressor versus the oppressed argument. It's reducing their party to a loose union of grievance mongers. And I think there's -- it's time for some kind of new enlightenment on race. So that -- because right now, we're operating on so many half-truths and exaggerations and faulty logic.
