Obviously President Trump there just wrapping up another extraordinary campaign rally for the second night in a row, this time in Lake Charles, Louisiana, the President making a last-minute appeal to pelican state voters to get out to the polls tomorrow for the jungle primary for the gubernatorial race in an effort to unseat Democrat Governor John Bell.  But he also spent a lot of time hilting the Democrats, the Bidens, and the phony impeachment inquiry. Let me just say, I think you might agree, we have got Ellison Barber coming up here. But this is a man who has seems not to have lost any of his energy compared to the 2016 campaign clearly still in it. The crowd is even more remarkable. Let's go to Fox's Ellison Barber now live in Lake Charles, Louisiana with more. Ellison?",

This was the long speech that the President covered a lot of ground. He's trying to convince voters in Louisiana to head to the polls tomorrow and vote for one of two Republican candidates hoping to unseat the current Democrat Governor.  We got about ten minutes so the President talked about the impeachment inquiry, attacking Joe Biden as well as his son Hunter Biden. At one point he talked about the Democratic led impeachment inquiry it's valid on constitutional and he used the word BS. That got the cheers from the crowd here. When there was a recent Fox News Polls that showed the highest amount of Americans removing the President from office - they feel like President Trump is being attacked. The President set off that interview tonight at times has told getting very angry talking about the impeachment inquiry.  You heard a lot of words we did here last night, doubled down on that tonight. That became the biggest focal point of the speech tonight. So, again, the purpose of him being in Louisiana, Tammy, was to try to get voters to head to the polls and he said any Republican in the jungle primary gubernatorial race that's happening. That election taking place tomorrow, Tammy?",

And what's really interesting is that he doesn't just go there to spread his message, but he also goes and hears from the actual attendees, how they feel about what he's doing, the enthusiasm that they have for his agenda? And I'll say it's really amazing to see people on a Friday night to be able to attend - to wait in line, the day of - as you noted, the day after a long rally that happened yesterday. There's something so special, because each one of those individuals that attends that rally feels as if they're playing their part in a broader movement to reclaim government from a corrupt institution or corrupt practice in the past.

He's got a House of Representatives that is coming to impeach him.   And he knows that he knows that. I agree with you 100 percent he doesn't look tired, he doesn't look worn down.

They see a President that looks younger today than before he took office, which is a rather new phenomenon, especially in recent Presidents. They see the crowd sizes, his presidential campaign sitting over $125 million in cash, an extraordinary figure.   They see all of this. They now look to that word that was said, \"Impeachment,\" because for them, that's now a political tool to try to stop the President's enthusiasm and movement.

That it appears quite directly that it was likely Biden.   So, with that, Anthony, this is - what's interesting is that the messaging that this approach would - would, you know, put a wet blanket on the President's support, that it would depress his supporters, that it would give somehow the boost to the hopes of the Democrats to take the White House.

If you want to know how unpopular Bush's foreign policy is among Republican voters? Remember, Jeb could not win his home primary in a state where he was a great Governor in Florida and George W. hasn't been invited to speak at a Republican National Convention since he left office. Every dollar we send overseas is a dollar that we cannot spend here at home fixing our schools, our bridges, updating our airports, all of our priorities. And we have a lot of them. The same GOP wise me and women who told us Iraq was a slam dunk are the same ones who thought by the way that allowing China in the World Trade Organization was a grand idea. Stupid trade policy only helping communist regime like China that hell bent on global domination ultimately become more powerful. We also lost millions of manufacturing jobs in much of our precious intellectual property to the Chinese. Remember the people who green lit this Obama nation are called the elites, the foreign policy elites. Please, just as they did in Iraq. The so-called China trade experts failed the American people. Trump was elected to pick up the pieces. His trade maneuvers with China including terrorists have been courageous in the face of especially Wall Street option. And while I believe personally that we should be decoupling our interests from the Chinese regime, Trump has done more than any other President in the face of what can only be described now as a generational threat. In fact, because of Trump, there was a major breakthrough in the Chinese. They're going to grant us concessions on agriculture and we're going to give them some tariff relief. Trump has got a long way to go getting China to play fair. But this small deal suggests a bigger one may eventually be made.  But the big question now for America isn't whether we're going to be able to keep the Kurds free? The big question for America is whether we'll be able to keep ourselves free here at home? It is tragic what the so-called elites were allowed to do to this country, what happened to our country under their leadership? But the definition of insanity would be to continue down the road toward false promises of mission accomplished once again. And that's the angle. Here to respond is Retired U.S. Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor. Colonel, this is a messy situation no doubt about it. But were we ever on an easy path after the war in Iraq?",

In December of 2013, Hunter Biden travelled aboard Air Force Two with his father on an official visit to Beijing. Two weeks after that trip, Hunter Biden's investor fund became a partner with a Chinese private equity firm called Bohai Harvest, or BHR, which is primarily owned and controlled by the Chinese government. The Bidens have repeatedly denied any connection between the vice president's visit to China and his son's business deal, but this year, \"The New Yorker\" reported that during the visit, Hunter Biden introduced his father to a man named Jonathan Li, who a short time later became the CEO of BHR. And our corporate cousin, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" says Hunter Biden still owns 10 percent of BHR. President Trump has insinuated time and again that Hunter Biden's deal is not on the up and up.

We got about ten minutes so the President talked about the impeachment inquiry, attacking Joe Biden as well as his son Hunter Biden. At one point he talked about the Democratic led impeachment inquiry it's valid on constitutional and he used the word BS. That got the cheers from the crowd here. When there was a recent Fox News Polls that showed the highest amount of Americans removing the President from office - they feel like President Trump is being attacked. The President set off that interview tonight at times has told getting very angry talking about the impeachment inquiry. You heard a lot of words we did here last night, doubled down on that tonight. That became the biggest focal point of the speech tonight.

And what's really interesting is that he doesn't just go there to spread his message, but he also goes and hears from the actual attendees, how they feel about what he's doing, the enthusiasm that they have for his agenda? And I'll say it's really amazing to see people on a Friday night to be able to attend - to wait in line, the day of - as you noted, the day after a long rally that happened yesterday. There's something so special, because each one of those individuals that attends that rally feels as if they're playing their part in a broader movement to reclaim government from a corrupt institution or corrupt practice in the past.

And the President's charisma is outside of this world. I'm not going to take that away from him. But, that said, he's got a lot to deal with. He's got a lot on his plate. He's got a House of Representatives that is coming to impeach him. And he knows that he knows that. I agree with you 100 percent he doesn't look tired, he doesn't look worn down. He looked young, he looked relatively vibrant tonight. But I haven't seen him looking that way all week. So it's good to see him looking that way.

But it - it ranges from - you know, him moving his agenda, talking about the politicians that are there and the political goal, but then even like the moment of bringing up the Little League Champions. This is - this is - the sense of Americana that are at these rallies compared, Charlie, to what we saw outside in Minnesota yesterday, it's a - it's a serious juxtaposition that is troubling.

I think it's a really interesting previous point that was made because a lot of other Democrats are seeing the same thing. They see a President that looks younger today than before he took office, which is a rather new phenomenon, especially in recent Presidents. They see the crowd sizes, his presidential campaign sitting over $125 million in cash, an extraordinary figure. They see all of this. They now look to that word that was said, \"Impeachment,\" because for them, that's now a political tool to try to stop the President's enthusiasm and movement.

That it appears quite directly that it was likely Biden. So, with that, Anthony, this is - what's interesting is that the messaging that this approach would - would, you know, put a wet blanket on the President's support, that it would depress his supporters, that it would give somehow the boost to the hopes of the Democrats to take the White House. It may be having an opposite effect. I don't doubt they'll impeach him. They've got the votes. But that seems like a political act at this point, would you agree?"

So make no mistake, the Democrats were not worried that Donald Trump was going to fail, they were really terrified he was going to succeed. He is succeeding now because that put them at political risk. You said it so best Tammy. The mandate of the 2018 elections that got Nancy Pelosi the gavel was won on moderation, won on infrastructure and most importantly healthcare.

Unwise, unwinnable wars trigger unanticipated aftershock, both at home and abroad. Let's not forget strong opposition to the Iraq War helped Obama win the White House in 2008. And a noninterventionist platform also propelled Trump to victory. Americans in both parties smartly saw the more we extended ourselves in the Middle East, the weaker we became. As the President said, look, all these years later, 18 years later, we still have troops in Afghanistan. And of course the suffering falls only on a small percentage of Americans."

If you want to know how unpopular Bush's foreign policy is among Republican voters? Remember, Jeb could not win his home primary in a state where he was a great Governor in Florida and George W. hasn't been invited to speak at a Republican National Convention since he left office. Every dollar we send overseas is a dollar that we cannot spend here at home fixing our schools, our bridges, updating our airports, all of our priorities. And we have a lot of them. The same GOP wise me and women who told us Iraq was a slam dunk are the same ones who thought by the way that allowing China in the World Trade Organization was a grand idea. Stupid trade policy only helping communist regime like China that hell bent on global domination ultimately become more powerful. We also lost millions of manufacturing jobs in much of our precious intellectual property to the Chinese. Remember the people who green lit this Obama nation are called the elites, the foreign policy elites. Please, just as they did in Iraq. The so-called China trade experts failed the American people. Trump was elected to pick up the pieces. His trade maneuvers with China including terrorists have been courageous in the face of especially Wall Street option. And while I believe personally that we should be decoupling our interests from the Chinese regime, Trump has done more than any other President in the face of what can only be described now as a generational threat. In fact, because of Trump, there was a major breakthrough in the Chinese. They're going to grant us concessions on agriculture and we're going to give them some tariff relief. Trump has got a long way to go getting China to play fair. But this small deal suggests a bigger one may eventually be made. But the big question now for America isn't whether we're going to be able to keep the Kurds free? The big question for America is whether we'll be able to keep ourselves free here at home? It is tragic what the so-called elites were allowed to do to this country, what happened to our country under their leadership? But the definition of insanity would be to continue down the road toward false promises of mission accomplished once again. And that's the angle. Here to respond is Retired U.S. Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor. Colonel, this is a messy situation no doubt about it. But were we ever on an easy path after the war in Iraq?"

That's what happened with the Kurds. Remember, they're communists in Northern Syria. They're Maoists they want to build their own state. They've been in a war against the Turks that lasted almost 40 years and kill 55,000 people. So this is a life or deaf question from Mr. Erdogan, it isn't for us. Our mission there is over.

Everything east of that is in contention. Everything west of that has to be stable and orderly. We're responsible for that because we have a strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia. Now, the forces that are going in there are all defensive. There's not enough combat power there to launch any offensive operation. But remember, we just watched as the Saudis proved to be totally incompetent and incapable of defending their oil fields, which you would think given the billions that they've spent would have been their top priority.

The Bidens have repeatedly denied any connection between the vice president's visit to China and his son's business deal, but this year, \"The New Yorker\" reported that during the visit, Hunter Biden introduced his father to a man named Jonathan Li, who a short time later became the CEO of BHR. And our corporate cousin, \"The Wall Street Journal,\" says Hunter Biden still owns 10 percent of BHR. President Trump has insinuated time and again that Hunter Biden's deal is not on the up and up. Watch."

      "utterance": "The $1.5 billion the president refers to was apparently the fundraising target of BHR, and it's unclear if that target was ever hit. But over the past six years, the company has invested more than $2 billion on behalf of its financial backers. Hunter Biden's spokesperson says Biden still hasn't recouped his original investment in BHR, though his 10 percent stake appears to be a valuable asset. And Hunter Biden has also dabbled in other Chinese companies that reportedly invest in sensitive assets in both the U.S. and China. There is no firm evidence that Hunter Biden has done anything illegal, but experts say politically, the optics are poor. Laura?"

Each day, it seems like we see some embarrassing new developments for the NBA. Now early this week, \"The Ingraham Angle\" was the first, proud to say, to call out the NBA for bending on, well, down for this communist Chinese, all the while happily trashing Trump's America. And it gets even more pathetic. The league now has announced they are cancelling all press conferences from teams in China after this embarrassing exchange."

Joining me now, Clay Travis, FOX Sports host, radio host, author of the book, \"Republicans Buy Sneakers Too.\" Clay, I have to say, I am both saddened but not surprised that this is where it's going given China's outsized influence now in American commerce, and, of course, with the money that the NBA is making over there in China with franchise fees. But, man, the NBA has a lot to say about Trump and what he does. But seems like they have no spine when it comes to what happens in China."

This is I believe the worst week that any pro sports league has ever had in my life because, I know you've covered a lot of this, but the NBA bans the word \"owner\" because they decide it's racially insensitive. They replace it, ironically enough for people who remember the civil rights movement, with the word \"governor\" which actually has worse connotations in some states given the way things have gone. They also decide that they're going to pull their all-star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, because of a local state transgender bathroom law. I don't know about you, Laura, but I don't think transgender people have a lot of rights in China, just like the entire population of 1.4 billion people does not have a lot of rights there. Steve Kerr was asked whether or not --"

And that's a gray area for Mr. Kerr because almighty dollar is involved."

When these people claim they care about all of these social justice issues and they get all offended when someone even nicks them with criticism at home, I'm calling them on all of their you know what, because I think they care about one thing primarily. They want to win, but it's about money. So let's just say it's about money and we all know where we're coming from now. It's about money, so just lose the idea that you're all about your moral principles. Give me a break. The whole thing is ridiculous. Another American company, by the way, Clay, is now caving in to the communist Chinese. Houston Rockets' merchandise has reportedly disappeared off the shelves of Nike stores in China. \"Reuters\" reporting that managers of five Nike stores in Beijing and Shanghai say they've been told in recent days via memo from management that all Rockets merchandise had to be removed. Now, this is the same company, by the way, that uses Colin Kaepernick to represent them. So maybe the new slogan for Nike, Clay, should be, believe in something as long as Beijing approves."

The irony on this is mind blowing, because, again, these guys have said over and over again, LeBron James, for instance, is trying to market himself as the Muhammed Ali of his generation. More power to him for marketing purposes, but Muhammed Ali went to prison and fought against a war. LeBron James, if he really wanted to take a stand, could, right? He could say I believe that the 1.4 billion people in China deserve the exact same rights that many Americans take for granted -- freedom of speech, freedom to get on the Internet without censorship, all of these issues. But I think a big part of this, Laura, growing and going forward is, China is moving. And this is important, this is an important distinction, from, hey, if you want to play \"The Avengers\" movie in our country, we're going to edit two minutes of it, but it's for out country inside of the country. What they are trying to do now is they are trying to propagate their communist world view into America, and they are using the sports leagues like the NBA as a conduit to do it. And the NBA is allowing them to do it. It's absolutely pathetic that this is allowed to be taking place."

So the owners now are far away in Beijing whose tentacles reach right across the ocean into the United States and into the psyche and mindset, apparently, of these players. But I'm just glad this has all been revelatory for us. We now know what everyone stands for, and the masks are off. So I think this is a sad moment, but it's very revealing, I think, to all of us. Thanks so much. And coming up, earlier this week, we showed you Dean Cain and Kristy Swanson's dramatic reenactment of the Strzok and Page texts. Someone new might be joining the cast. We're going to reveal who that is in the Last Bite, next."
