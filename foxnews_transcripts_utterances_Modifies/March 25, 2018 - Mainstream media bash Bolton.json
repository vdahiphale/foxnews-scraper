The network said in a statement Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he's choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention. We are extremely proud of our top rated primetime host, and all of our opinion programming. And I agree with that, but let's tone down a little. He says I deeply respect the hard news reporters at Fox, calling them among the best men and women in the business. He says his blast doesn't totally apply to fox business, quote, where numerous hosts retain and respect for facts, and maintain a measure of integrity. He says not every host at Fox News have propaganda mouth piece. Some have shown courage. So this is really about Ralph Peters strongly disagrees with Fox News primetime host on Trump. He even says outright, he doesn't like their attacks on the FBI, the Justice Department, the courts, and the intelligence community in which I served. Now I get the Fox' primetime hosts have joined flock because they generally, but not always support a controversial president. Laura Ingraham just the other night, criticize them for signing that massive $1.3 trillion budget. Now we debated some of the harsh rhetoric against the FBI and the Mueller investigation on this program. But these people are paid for their opinions. Fox' rivals were crypt to adopt Peters' language. CNN President Jeff Zucker, can anyone dispute that he's taken his network in a largely anti-Trump direction? Picked-up on the propaganda machine line, but then allow that there are a lot of handful good journalists at Fox. Thanks a lot, Jeff. I'm glad Ralph Peters made those distinctions but that came after the incendiary language that he knew would make big headlines. Bottom-line here, don't lump everyone of the network together when there are separate news and opinion divisions here, both of which play a vital role just like at most of newspapers in America. Ahead on \"Media Buzz,\" a hidden camera investigation plunges Cambridge Analytica into scandal. Was that ethical?

Guy, John Bolton is a controversial person, big boost to the Iraq War, talks about military options against North Korea to stop the regime from getting nukes, became a recess appointee as U.N. ambassador because a Republican Senate wouldn't confirm him as George W.

I am not sure the President would have known much about him, where he's not a Fox News contributor, but that's not the reason for the left to be frustrated with him. I think it is because of the fact that -- what's interesting to me is one, he is incredibly hawkish, he was one of the architects of the Iraq War. The President says he always the Iraq War, that will be an interesting dynamic. And at a time when we are trying to figure out what this President's approach to North Korea is, to have guy who says, who makes irrational for military action against North Korea, it is worth examining."

But I don't think we do anyone a service by setting our hair aflame immediately, and assuming this is going to mean World War III, because we have heard so many hyperbole predictions about this administration, and this President, many of which have not come true.

He was going to hire Joe DiGenova, and his wife Victoria Toensing to experience Washington lawyer's and foreign prosecutors.

And look, a huge turnout, about 800,000, maybe less than that, but hundreds of thousands in D.C., wall to wall on cable news. I thought CNN and Fox handled it professionally. MSNBC, I have to say was sort of cheering for the march at times. One news anchor said, well, the NRA just buys people off. Joy Reid is one of those liberal voices. There was a street reporter and she asks bunch of kids who were there who is in favor of banning assault weapons, and they said, yes, we are.

Peters said Fox has become a mere propaganda machine for a destructive and ethically looniest administration. The network said in a statement Ralph Peters is entitled to his opinion despite the fact that he's choosing to use it as a weapon in order to gain attention. We are extremely proud of our top rated primetime host, and all of our opinion programming. And I agree with that, but let's tone down a little. He says I deeply respect the hard news reporters at Fox, calling them among the best men and women in the business. He says his blast doesn't totally apply to fox business, quote, where numerous hosts retain and respect for facts, and maintain a measure of integrity. He says not every host at Fox News have propaganda mouth piece. Some have shown courage. So this is really about Ralph Peters strongly disagrees with Fox News primetime host on Trump. He even says outright, he doesn't like their attacks on the FBI, the Justice Department, the courts, and the intelligence community in which I served. Now I get the Fox' primetime hosts have joined flock because they generally, but not always support a controversial president. Laura Ingraham just the other night, criticize them for signing that massive $1.3 trillion budget. Now we debated some of the harsh rhetoric against the FBI and the Mueller investigation on this program. But these people are paid for their opinions. Fox' rivals were crypt to adopt Peters' language. CNN President Jeff Zucker, can anyone dispute that he's taken his network in a largely anti-Trump direction? Picked-up on the propaganda machine line, but then allow that there are a lot of handful good journalists at Fox. Thanks a lot, Jeff. I'm glad Ralph Peters made those distinctions but that came after the incendiary language that he knew would make big headlines. Bottom-line here, don't lump everyone of the network together when there are separate news and opinion divisions here, both of which play a vital role just like at most of newspapers in America. Ahead on \"Media Buzz,\" a hidden camera investigation plunges Cambridge Analytica into scandal. Was that ethical?

But I'm going to take back since Hollywood taped not the man I knew. So you knew he was a married man, shame on you. But at the same time, you have got to get more about the money. Because I think we all know the money at the end of the day is the motivation if you are quiet for so long, and then you come out and a check being written."

      "utterance": "That is exactly the view of the people at American Media Inc., who says she's trying to get out of the contract is she voluntarily signs so she can go out and make a lot more money. And by the way, you know the contract calls for her doing other things. But she's not totally fulfilling it if she's supposed to have two cover stories. I know about emails where they've asked her to do the photo shoot and she wouldn't commit to doing the photo shoot for the second one. So this is about -- unlike with Stormy Daniels who has the $130,000 payment. It looks like hush money from the President's lawyer, Michael Cohen. This is really about her and this tabloid firm. So Emily, when as you said, when 60 Minutes airs this tonight -- And 60 Minutes didn't even put out a preview clip knowing the great interest here. We know what she is going to say about the relationship because she gave a 2011 under interview to In Touch Magazine, which was only recently published about her, what she says was this intimate relationship. The only real news will be about the hush money and what her lawyer said in a tease was a physical threat."

      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Well, that is obviously huge because the story is in two different parts. You have the allegations about the affair and the allegations about the cover-up. And I think the public's interest varies on both of those topics. The affair is probably a less interesting to the public than campaign finance violations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Possible violations."

      "utterance": "Yeah, exactly, possible violations. And all of this -- After Karen McDougal's interview, the big question is will they -- was actually raised by Karen McDougal when she said I don't know how this could've happened at this Lake Tahoe golf event because I was with him the whole time. So you have Stormy Daniels saying part of their affair occurred there and you have another person saying part of their affair occurred there. So there is a very fair reason that the media is asking these questions. And I hope we get some answers tonight."

I think he's done kind of a masterful job of driving this stormy, because one day he tweets a picture of himself, there he is, and Stormy Daniels and Anderson Cooper before and after the interview. And then another day he puts out a picture of Stormy Daniels, he says she passed a lie detector test on this or she may have photos. So he has really kept this in the news day after day, your thoughts."

Are the media using these cases and there is another suit by a former Apprentice contestant, that's been allowed to go forward by the judge charging Donald Trump with defamation, to sort of pile on Trump about what he did and of course, there is a real aspect now, but what he did in his days as a celebrity businessman, beauty pageant owner, in contrast to Bill Clinton who had sex with a White House intern while he was in office. Are the media rather gleeful in covering these stories?"

      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "That was actually the exact word I was going to use, and it doesn't take away, and you have the validity of the stories but I think sometimes there is a lack of perspective that is exhibited by the media in covering this story, which is unfortunate because there is some serious stuff, you know potential campaign finance violations to get to the hear of it and it can take away from that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And Leslie, there has been a little contrast -- CNN and MSNBC have covered the Stormy Daniels story very extensively. In fact, Stephen Colbert joked about Anderson should change the name of his show to Anderson Cooper 36DD. And Fox has covered it far less. Who do you think is closer to the mark -- in half a minute of fair coverage on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Well, quite frankly, you know even though I work here and am on the payroll, I would have to say Fox because, as Emily pointed to, there are other issues that are just as serious. But of course, the other networks are going to go for what their audience wants, and they certainly want ratings. And quite frankly, Monica Lewinsky did very well for the networks many years ago during the Clinton presidency. So I am not surprised."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that he was afraid of saying yes outright because he would actually have to show up and testify, right. So he comes out and he says hey, I am open to do it if I am the best person for the job. And we saw this late last year when they had to testify on the Russian ad stuff. The company sent their head lawyer instead of Mark Zuckerberg to do it. So I think he wants to come across as being open to it and helpful. At the same time, he doesn't want to lock himself in to having to show up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The correct answer would have been yes. Now, in my view, Zuckerberg has never wanted to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars it would take to root out fake news and foreign propaganda. But in your interview with him, he said something really interesting. He said I feel fundamentally uncomfortable sitting hear in California in a office, making content policy decisions for people around the world, things like, where's the line on hate speech? I mean who chose me to be the person who did that? I guess I have to because we're here now but I'd rather not. But in this age where Facebook is under so much attack, whether it's him or people around him, somebody has got to police the content, true or false?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "utterance": "I think that's very true. I mean he is the person that created Facebook, right. He talks often about the community. He calls Facebook a community. It's a group of people, and those people should be you know living by certain rules, right. And who is to make the rules but the person who created it. I think its Mark Zuckerberg's responsibility. I think there are a lot of people who believe that. They've always been very hesitant to come out and be very forceful one way or the other. But I think from the interview that we had it sounded like he's finally realized he might not have a choice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. And I can see where this is finally starting to dawn on him. Now, when you were sitting down with him and Zuckerberg doesn't do a lot of interviews. He said on CNN he doesn't like doing interviews. Did you have the impression this was once again, as with the Russian meddling, a situation where after the fact, after the damage has been done, he's been silent for a few days, he does a Facebook post or reluctantly does a couple of interviews and says he's going to fix it but offers only vague promises about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It was very reminiscent, right. And I think for people who don't know Mark, it's very hard to feel any sympathy for him, right? He's a billionaire. He's created this business based off of a lot of user data. And here he comes once again saying, hey, I'm sorry that I screwed up. There are not a lot of people out there who feel bad for Mark Zuckerberg today. But at the same time, as someone who has talked to him multiple times in the past, I do think that he comes out and he wants to fix things. I believe that a lot of this started because as he said himself, he was too idealistic. He thought that Facebook was going to be this wonderful place where everyone was going to play nice and play by the rules. That's not always necessarily the case, as we've learned. And so I think he does feel legitimately bad about what happened. But there are not a lot of people who feel bad for him because Facebook keeps doing this over and over again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And he's so close there than if I was the company -- it is a media contact company whether he likes to admit it or not. Now he was asked in a CNN interview about the possibility of the feds stepping in. Let's take a listen."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that he knows that it's probably coming, so there is no point in coming out and pushing against it, right? Facebook has also started to already put some stuff in place around its political advertising business to say, hey, we're trying to get ahead of this regulation. We want to already have the tools, this dashboard where people can go and see who is paying for the political ads. So I think right now it's very much a, hey, we're open to this because we see the writing on the wall."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I've got about half a minute. With several investigations and this Cambridge Analytica mess, do you think Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg himself, who you know finally, have to change their media strategy, be a little more open with the press and be a little bit more aggressive in driving their message?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGNER",
      "utterance": "I think they will have to. I mean the biggest thing from this that there were five days between us finding out about Cambridge Analytica and first hearing from Mark. And I think that they would say maybe they should have come out a little bit earlier. So I would expect you know Facebook to do a lot more outreach in the background with the press. Hopefully, we'll see mark on TV more often, doing these kinds of interviews, taking questions from journalists, not just posting to his Facebook page. I think what we've learned is that you know we need to hear more from them and I think they realize they need to be held to a higher standard."

Now I've seen a lot of headlines that called Cambridge Analytica a Trump-linked firm. Now it did used to work for Trump's Presidential campaign, but no evidence that the campaign knew it was getting anything illicit or even that it did get anything illicit from Cambridge Analytica, your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHELBY HOLLIDAY, WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Yeah, that subject, I think, we'll see covered in the news a lot in the next few weeks. Cambridge Analytica is a company that does get involved in elections and it worked with the Trump campaign. Prior to working with Trump, they actually worked for Senator Ted Cruz in his Presidential bid. But this firm is under fire because it used so-called dirty tricks and they violated Facebook's policies in getting the information of Americans. What they did was they purchased a ton of Facebook data from a researcher who unethically obtained it, unethically sold it to Cambridge Analytica. And Alexander Nix, the former CEO who has now been demoted is on camera saying they used this information to target Americans in the election, and use these psychographic methods to target voters in swing states, to target voters in rural areas, to get out vote."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What I don't understand -- I understand that this Cambridge Analytica broke the rule, that's why it's been suspended from Facebook. But how different is that, to judge, from -- advertisers do with Facebook which has tried to get information about people's preferences so they can target advertising, or what the Barack Obama campaign did, apparently legally, in 2012."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLLIDAY",
      "utterance": "That's a good question. And there is a big distinction that it's tricky to understand when there is so much news about this particular firm. What campaigns do, President Trump's campaign did this, and President Obama's campaign did this. They worked with Facebook above board openly to target voters to help get out the vote. There are a lot of useful that things you can do on Facebook, so campaigns partner with Facebook to do these things. What Cambridge Analytica did was go behind Facebook's back, pay a researcher for data they shouldn't have had. And then when Facebook approached them in 2015 and said we understand you have data you shouldn't have it. Can you please certify that you've deleted it? They certified they deleted it, yet, in 2016 we hear Alexander Nix saying they used that data. So they didn't delete it."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

But here, you have Britain's Channel 4, you had to have a reporter working with the channel. Lie and pose as a perspective political clan and got great information, but isn't that kind of unethical."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOLLIDAY",
      "utterance": "Well, its undercover journalism and you know there are sort of ethical rules that various organizations have set out undercover journalism. This is of vital interest to the public. So you could justify that it was a good investigative journalism, seeing if you will. Because this firm, Cambridge Analytica was at the center of the Brexit campaign in the U.K. and at the center of the U.S. election here, so it was vital to the public interest. It was also information that we wouldn't get otherwise."
