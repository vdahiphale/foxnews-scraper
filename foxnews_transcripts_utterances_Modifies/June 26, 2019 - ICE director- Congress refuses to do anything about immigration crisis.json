We're sitting in front of the Hozu River, really one of the prettiest places in the world. This was for more than a thousand years the capital -- the Imperial Capital -- of Japan before it moved to Tokyo. We're here because the G20 Summit in just a few days will be coming to Osaka nearby. We will be interviewing the President. You'll see it right here.  But first tonight, the Democratic debate, less than an hour from now. A dozen candidates are so, 10 Democrats will take the stage. Some of them potentially could become President. Many others: Bill de Blasio, Cory Booker are merely making fools of themselves for reasons that aren't exactly clear.  But it's interesting to see them all gathered together because you get a sense of what the Democratic Party cares about, what its priorities are. And this season, the candidates will be trying hard to become the most extreme on the question of immigration, which one can attack the idea of borders most aggressively?  Keep in mind it was only a few months ago that as a group, they were telling you there was no crisis at all on the border. In fact, they were saying it was manufactured by the Trump administration.

It's not the President who decided not to enforce them. He was elected to enforce them. No, it's the Democratic Party, which has staked its entire political future on the dysfunction you're watching right now on importing a new class of voters to replace the American middle class, which it no longer serves or cares about.   Its Democrats who erected sanctuary cities. It's Democrats who halted deportations. It's Democrats who are telling you even today, we have to shut down I.C.E. Not everything about the Democratic Party is bad. Not everything they say is a lie. But when they tell you that it's Trump's fault that the border is out of control. That is a lie.

You're right, because among the 10 Democrats on stage tonight, none of them are saying what Barack Obama said, which is that at least parents have some responsibility for what is happening at the border, the kids that are coming across. Back in 2014, it was about unaccompanied minors. The photo you're talking about that is captured, though with less attention right now. And it should capture everyone's attention, because the tragedy that a father and daughter die, but no one among these Democrats on stage tonight are talking about the father's responsibility, parents in general.   And I'll take it a step further. At least two Democrats on stage tonight, you mentioned beta O'Rourke, as well as Cory Booker, they both served in Congress. O'Rourke, a former House member; Booker, a current senator. They're both out tonight, blaming the President for the death of this father and daughter when they have been and were in Congress and did virtually nothing about the border crisis.  I will say, Cory Booker, at least a few months ago, we checked the record, he did say it's a crisis and his party should not deny it's a crisis. But in fact, when you look at it, Nancy Pelosi called it a fake crisis. Chuck Schumer said it's a crisis that does not exist. And then look at people in the media. Don Lemon on CNN, back a few months ago, said this was an imaginary Latin American conspiracy, put together by the President. Well, last night, Don Lemon was holding up this photo that you showed a moment ago on CNN and saying, \"Anyone who wants to deny it's a crisis, I'll show you this photo.\" Anyone like Don Lemon? Or Nancy Pelosi? Or Chuck Schumer? They've all denied previously that it was a crisis.",

They did some of it, but there's a whole bunch of they didn't follow up on, right? So you have that issue on the table. So now, Byron York was pointing this out today. You have Democrats and Republicans in Congress fighting about a few billion dollars to deal with the border crisis. Everyone should admit now it's a crisis as the President from declared it.  They're fighting over a few billion dollars to deal with this crisis, and yet we have thousands of people crossing illegally every day, and while they fight, there's nothing that they're doing. By the way, Cory Booker who is on stage tonight, he is going even further. He wants to decriminalize the idea of crossing the border illegally. How exactly will that work? So if you come here illegally, he as President is going to say, \"I'm decriminalizing that. You could break our laws. It's okay.\"",

That's why the President declared a national emergency because it's a humanitarian crisis and a national security threat crisis as well. And this is a great example.   And this is where Homeland Security Investigations, HSI, the investigative element of I.C.E., this is where they're pushing the borders out. They are working with other countries, and they've come up with these great systems where when we get an alert on somebody, these countries, we're helping them do biometrics on these people and we're identifying who they are well before they get anywhere near our borders to do damage. And in this case, that's exactly what they did.  Now, it came out -- we call it \"no derog.\" So there wasn't any derogatory information about these individuals.

He has to try to make money for his shareholders. It's against the law for him to do what she wants him to do, to turn down business, especially given the fact that the company is losing money. Now let's talk about the Elizabeth Warren and this other proposal that we're going to hear more about tonight at those debates, if you tune in, where they're saying if you cross the border, it shouldn't be illegal. Guess what? If somebody is coming here to seek asylum, it's because the rule of law in their home country has broken down to the point where they no longer feel safe.  They are coming to this country, because the rule of law works and keeps them safe. So how is breaking the law helping those people who are coming here for laws and security? These are both really stupid ideas.  How does taking away furniture help children? How does taking away laws help children? It doesn't. You know what? Our lawmakers have massively failed us. This is a huge problem that is enormous. Because it has festered for so long. There is no easy way to solve it. It's going to take a whole bunch of solutions. And here's the thing, Tucker. I mean, what if every time we interviewed a lawmaker, what if you and I took this pledge and everybody else and Shep and Sean and Rachel and Anderson, what if we all said that every time you interview a lawmaker, you say: Name one thing you've opposed before that you're willing to give and put on the table as a gesture to get the ball rolling? You can't name what you want in return. Because you know what? Everyone' is going to have to work together to come to a solution, and that picture of the dead child is really heartbreaking. But everybody looks at it and they see someone different to blame.  We can all look at it and see that it's total failure on the part of America. So look at that picture and ask lawmakers, what is it that you're willing to put on the table with nothing in return? You won't look weak. You look strong. What do you think?

A Russian man in Siberia was mauled by a brown bear then dragged back to its den to be kept for later like a plate of leftovers. He was suffering from a broken spine and yet he managed to stay alive for a month, apparently without food or water until he was found by a group of hunters who rescued him. He is now in a hospital recovering. How did this happen? Is it a real story? Could you do it if you were grabbed by a bear? Dr. Marc Siegel is Fox's medical correspondent who joins us tonight.

But if he attacked the cubs or he put the cubs at risk, the bear might get angry, and those brown bears do sometimes store food and they wait for a while until their food decomposes, and then they eat it. So it's possible he would be in this cave for a month. He can survive without food, Tucker. You can survive weeks and weeks without food. Mahatma Gandhi survived on a fast for 21 days without food. You need water though. And you're not going to survive by drinking urine the way he says he did. That's the part of the story I don't believe because urine is very salty, it's going to make you more dehydrated. You could survive with the broken bones, you might look like that because areas of your of your skin are going to slough off from insufficient blood flow. The body will protect its vital organs and blood and glucose and oxygen goes to the vital organs. But here's how you could survive. If you were drinking from the rock icicles in the cave. If the water that was dripping down in a cave, it has minerals in it and if you're drinking that, you could survive and it's cold there. Now Tuva, which is near Mongolia is about 27 to 28 degrees. The colder it is, the more likely you might survive because your organs stay alive longer including your brain. I think it's possible. I think it's plausible but not the urine part of this.

We will be interviewing the President. You'll see it right here. But first tonight, the Democratic debate, less than an hour from now. A dozen candidates are so, 10 Democrats will take the stage. Some of them potentially could become President. Many others: Bill de Blasio, Cory Booker are merely making fools of themselves for reasons that aren't exactly clear. But it's interesting to see them all gathered together because you get a sense of what the Democratic Party cares about, what its priorities are. And this season, the candidates will be trying hard to become the most extreme on the question of immigration, which one can attack the idea of borders most aggressively? Keep in mind it was only a few months ago that as a group, they were telling you there was no crisis at all on the border. In fact, they were saying it was manufactured by the Trump administration.

It's not the President who decided not to enforce them. He was elected to enforce them. No, it's the Democratic Party, which has staked its entire political future on the dysfunction you're watching right now on importing a new class of voters to replace the American middle class, which it no longer serves or cares about. Its Democrats who erected sanctuary cities. It's Democrats who halted deportations. It's Democrats who are telling you even today, we have to shut down I.C.E. Not everything about the Democratic Party is bad. Not everything they say is a lie. But when they tell you that it's Trump's fault that the border is out of control. That is a lie.

You're right, because among the 10 Democrats on stage tonight, none of them are saying what Barack Obama said, which is that at least parents have some responsibility for what is happening at the border, the kids that are coming across. Back in 2014, it was about unaccompanied minors. The photo you're talking about that is captured, though with less attention right now. And it should capture everyone's attention, because the tragedy that a father and daughter die, but no one among these Democrats on stage tonight are talking about the father's responsibility, parents in general. And I'll take it a step further. At least two Democrats on stage tonight, you mentioned beta O'Rourke, as well as Cory Booker, they both served in Congress. O'Rourke, a former House member; Booker, a current senator. They're both out tonight, blaming the President for the death of this father and daughter when they have been and were in Congress and did virtually nothing about the border crisis. I will say, Cory Booker, at least a few months ago, we checked the record, he did say it's a crisis and his party should not deny it's a crisis. But in fact, when you look at it, Nancy Pelosi called it a fake crisis. Chuck Schumer said it's a crisis that does not exist. And then look at people in the media. Don Lemon on CNN, back a few months ago, said this was an imaginary Latin American conspiracy, put together by the President. Well, last night, Don Lemon was holding up this photo that you showed a moment ago on CNN and saying, \"Anyone who wants to deny it's a crisis, I'll show you this photo.\" Anyone like Don Lemon? Or Nancy Pelosi? Or Chuck Schumer? They've all denied previously that it was a crisis."

They did some of it, but there's a whole bunch of they didn't follow up on, right? So you have that issue on the table. So now, Byron York was pointing this out today. You have Democrats and Republicans in Congress fighting about a few billion dollars to deal with the border crisis. Everyone should admit now it's a crisis as the President from declared it. They're fighting over a few billion dollars to deal with this crisis, and yet we have thousands of people crossing illegally every day, and while they fight, there's nothing that they're doing. By the way, Cory Booker who is on stage tonight, he is going even further. He wants to decriminalize the idea of crossing the border illegally. How exactly will that work? So if you come here illegally, he as President is going to say, \"I'm decriminalizing that. You could break our laws. It's okay.\""

TVPRA which allows us that we are forced -- kids from the northern triangle countries, we have to let in the United States. We've told them, that's the incentive. That's the pull factor.

That's why the President declared a national emergency because it's a humanitarian crisis and a national security threat crisis as well. And this is a great example. And this is where Homeland Security Investigations, HSI, the investigative element of I.C.E., this is where they're pushing the borders out. They are working with other countries, and they've come up with these great systems where when we get an alert on somebody, these countries, we're helping them do biometrics on these people and we're identifying who they are well before they get anywhere near our borders to do damage. And in this case, that's exactly what they did. Now, it came out -- we call it \"no derog.\" So there wasn't any derogatory information about these individuals. So right now, we don't have any connections to terrorist groups or terrorist activities. But that's not the point.

He has to try to make money for his shareholders. It's against the law for him to do what she wants him to do, to turn down business, especially given the fact that the company is losing money. Now let's talk about the Elizabeth Warren and this other proposal that we're going to hear more about tonight at those debates, if you tune in, where they're saying if you cross the border, it shouldn't be illegal. Guess what? If somebody is coming here to seek asylum, it's because the rule of law in their home country has broken down to the point where they no longer feel safe. They are coming to this country, because the rule of law works and keeps them safe. So how is breaking the law helping those people who are coming here for laws and security? These are both really stupid ideas. How does taking away furniture help children? How does taking away laws help children? It doesn't. You know what? Our lawmakers have massively failed us.

Robert Mueller wants to go into retirement. He said so in public. Democrats won't let him though. The Russia probe must continue. So he is being forced to testify. I'll tell you when and where. Yesterday, by the way, we were broadcasting live from Tokyo and now we're along the Hozu River in a remarkable city called Kyoto, Japan. Take you to the journey, how we got here.

The Mueller report has been out for two months. If you've read it, you know that there is no evidence contained inside of it. This is the result of two years of investigation that Russia helped the Trump campaign with the knowledge of the Trump campaign. In other words, that there was collusion between the two. No collusion. But it doesn't matter. Democrats cannot allow this story to die. It has to last until -- let's see -- November of 2020.

What Jerry Nadler is hoping is that 99 percent of Americans have not read the report, they've relied on media to tell them what they should think, and that they're not good to go read the report now. Now, can you imagine somebody like Robert Mueller, who has made it as far as he has made it in life by being a professional, just throwing all of that out of the window, and sitting in the witness chair and coming up with some sort of new revelation that nobody has known about that he hadn't written about?

He said, and I saw this on all of the news networks in the last day or so that he only agreed to testify because he didn't want to spend the money on an attorney fighting a subpoena. And so what he's going to do -- and I would bet a paycheck on this -- what he is going to do is he is going to sit in the witness chair, and he is going to repeat everything that he concluded in that report.

And what they do with their power is they surveil you, they learn all your secrets and then they run large advertising businesses and manipulate users. You, other businesses, and the flow of information across the web to serve themselves and this diverts advertising money that used to go to publishers into the pockets of Google and Facebook. So that, you know, these people know why all the journalists are being laid off. It's because that money that used to go -- and by the way, this is a post 2009 phenomenon. So it isn't the internet.

But because Google and Facebook appear to be free, you don't pay any cash for using their services, enforcers and antitrust regulators tend to say, \"Oh, well, there's no market power problem there.\" It's an absurd philosophy. It's crazy. It's not really in the law. It's in a bunch of made up court decisions.

If you are a communication network that people have to use, so if you are a monopoly that people have to use to get information from them, to you know, their friends or family or other businesses, you should not also be able to run an advertising business.

So it's possible he would be in this cave for a month. He can survive without food, Tucker. You can survive weeks and weeks without food. Mahatma Gandhi survived on a fast for 21 days without food. You need water though. And you're not going to survive by drinking urine the way he says he did. That's the part of the story I don't believe because urine is very salty, it's going to make you more dehydrated. You could survive with the broken bones, you might look like that because areas of your of your skin are going to slough off from insufficient blood flow. The body will protect its vital organs and blood and glucose and oxygen goes to the vital organs. But here's how you could survive. If you were drinking from the rock icicles in the cave. If the water that was dripping down in a cave, it has minerals in it and if you're drinking that, you could survive and it's cold there. Now Tuva, which is near Mongolia is about 27 to 28 degrees. The colder it is, the more likely you might survive because your organs stay alive longer including your brain. I think it's possible. I think it's plausible but not the urine part of this.

At six -- six of these hospitals -- charity hospitals, the head guy, the administrator makes more than $10 million a year, which is hard to believe. Adam Andrzejewski is the founder of Open the Books and he joins us tonight. Adam, more than $10 million a year for running a Charity Hospital. How does that work?"

      "utterance": "Well, it's outrageous. The top guy last year at Banner Health based in Phoenix, Arizona made $21.6 million. The second highest paid executive at Banner made $12.4 million. That means two executives at Banner last year cleaned off $34 million."

      "utterance": "Wait. Can I stop you there? Do you have any idea what percentage of the billing to that hospital comes from Federal or state government? Probably the majority, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDRZEJEWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a lot of money. Out of the 82 charitable hospitals, $2 billion worth of research grants flowed from the Federal agencies and we estimate that the 82 charitable hospitals did $83 billion last year in Medicaid and Medicare billings. So it's a substantial amount of money, probably about one third of their revenues comes directly from government."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "And they're rewarding themselves over $10 million a year. I mean, that's -- am I missing something or is that like disgusting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDRZEJEWSKI",
      "utterance": "No, no, you got it and we found charities, operating hospitals all over the country participating in this. So in Chicago, Northwestern Memorial, their CEO made $11 million. Ascension Healthcare in St. Louis, Missouri last year, their chief made $13 million. We looked at the last four years of his compensation and we were able to quantify that he pulled out $60 million of cash compensation."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I want to put his picture, I wish we had his picture for the screen because that's really -- it's a charity hospital."

      "utterance": "In Houston, Texas --"

      "utterance": "It's unbelievable, and by the way --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDRZEJEWSKI",
      "utterance": "They justified --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Keep going."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDRZEJEWSKI",
      "utterance": "They justified an $18 million payout because the CEO was in his last year. It was a golden parachute retirement payment. Look, this is patient money. The average family in America is paying nearly $20,000.00 in healthcare costs. Congress needs to crack down and there's a lot that Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary can do to start enforcing rules on these charities."

We will see you tomorrow, 8:00 p.m., the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. We leave you from Kyoto, truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
