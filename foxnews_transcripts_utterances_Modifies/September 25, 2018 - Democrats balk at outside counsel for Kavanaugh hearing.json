So, I want to remind how this is working -- to the public how this works, instead of driving deep on a specific case, what you do is you find a number of specific examples that alone are not sturdy, one, Ford, two, Ramirez, three, yearbook, four, Avenatti -- Avenatti's claims. Avenatti's claim is, alone, what does it mean? The yearbook, it's just a yearbook, what does that mean? The other case has no corroboration, no witness. So, individually, they don't match. They're not strong. So what do you is you create an environment of guilt by using these little things. That's what the Democrats are doing. It seems to be working with the help of the media.",

They've said Romney killed a cancer patient. They're very, very rough-and-tumble. And right now the Republicans are teetering because they haven't funded the wall and they've only partially repealed Obamacare. The reason why the favorability is up to its highest level in three years right now is because they have hung tough on certain things like judges, like safety and security, and like middle class wages. And Donald Trump is leading that charge for the party. He'll not cave to political correctness and he won't back down when Democrats get hysteria and start making unsubstantiated allegations.

Why is there Republican optimism right now? It's all about the economy. It's all about the economy and families believing that they've got more at stake invested in their future, and more economic mobility, and that means more opportunity for them and their children. Is that reality? Not quite yet. Some of this is still very much optimistic and theoretical and Republicans have to make good on that promise if they're going to see long term wins. But in the short term, the midterms is still a tossup, it's still anyone's game, and I think that's why people like Rush Limbaugh are tongue lashing some voters because they need to increase that passion and turn that optimism into action if Republicans want to maintain the house and senate, which, you know, it's a 50-50 shot right now.",

Not to the media who think American audiences don't see Moore's films because we're all rubes. Meanwhile, the coastal elites use Moore's screeds as a virtue signal: You lie and say you saw it. The friends say the same thing, so the lie stands. Moore's films are like vitamin supplements: Most offer zero benefit, but you still say nice things about him. But to his credit, Moore's movies are overtly political, unlike the rest of Hollywood's dreck where producers inject politics as a way to get crummy stuff made. The script sucks but on page seven there's that part about climate change. At least Moore wears his politics on his sleeve. God knows there's plenty of room. Now, I'm sure the media expected the film to open big: a rejection of Trump and you. It didn't and it wasn't. The lessons: Ideology as entertainment is as loony as a colonoscopy for recreation. Plus, America doesn't need a lecture from a rich dude about how bad things are especially when things are good. We know a lie when we see it. Our country's metrics look great which turns Moore's cinema into a fairy tale for wounded liberals. Yet, as usual, when Moore flops the media ignores it. If the movie was number one you can bet he'd be everywhere. There's that old saying about the media, you don't report on planes that don't crash, but you also don't report on your favorite beliefs that do. You know, Judge, we just want an escape.

They're basically admitting that we can crucify you without evidence or any kind of corroboration because let's keep it out of the court of law, and so you lose -- what you learn now is you lose your rights if you're up for a job.

So, I want to remind how this is working -- to the public how this works, instead of driving deep on a specific case, what you do is you find a number of specific examples that alone are not sturdy, one, Ford, two, Ramirez, three, yearbook, four, Avenatti -- Avenatti's claims. Avenatti's claim is, alone, what does it mean? The yearbook, it's just a yearbook, what does that mean? The other case has no corroboration, no witness. So, individually, they don't match.

If they can't get Kavanaugh through, they're toast. And here's why, they need to be more Machiavellian like the Democrats. Remember when Obama was in charge you have FISA abuse, dirty dossier, IRS targeting, street violence. You remember how Harry Reid accused Romney of not paying any taxes? They've said Romney killed a cancer patient. They're very, very rough-and-tumble. And right now the Republicans are teetering because they haven't funded the wall and they've only partially repealed Obamacare. The reason why the favorability is up to its highest level in three years right now is because they have hung tough on certain things like judges, like safety and security, and like middle class wages. And Donald Trump is leading that charge for the party. He'll not cave to political correctness and he won't back down when Democrats get hysteria and start making unsubstantiated allegations.

And I agree with Rush. If they don't step up, the Republicans are going to totally lose their support. By the way, the numbers are the highest they've been in seven years, the GOP support. I mean, everyone is anticipating and anxiously awaiting a success and it's got to happen. Look, Mitch McConnell can take this vote to the floor. He doesn't even have to do this in the committee.

Why is there Republican optimism right now? It's all about the economy. It's all about the economy and families believing that they've got more at stake invested in their future, and more economic mobility, and that means more opportunity for them and their children. Is that reality? Not quite yet. Some of this is still very much optimistic and theoretical and Republicans have to make good on that promise if they're going to see long term wins. But in the short term, the midterms is still a tossup, it's still anyone's game, and I think that's why people like Rush Limbaugh are tongue lashing some voters because they need to increase that passion and turn that optimism into action if Republicans want to maintain the house and senate, which, you know, it's a 50-50 shot right now."

And so, the thing is what party is going to have an edge in the future? A party just for women, or a party for men and women?

Our country's metrics look great which turns Moore's cinema into a fairy tale for wounded liberals. Yet, as usual, when Moore flops the media ignores it. If the movie was number one you can bet he'd be everywhere. There's that old saying about the media, you don't report on planes that don't crash, but you also don't report on your favorite beliefs that do. You know, Judge, we just want an escape.

But then I thought, wait a second. He's not speaking in a black community, and he's not speaking to blacks. He's talking to whites about black people in this way, in much the way that he talked about the Mexicans and the immigrants, rapists, criminals, all that. But in this case, he's saying to the -- to whites that he, Donald Trump, is the hero who will protect them against the chaos and dysfunction that threatens them. I thought two things, Kennedy. One, most black people don't live like that. I think 22 percent of black America lives in poverty, but I think it's 40 percent of black America makes between, like, $35,000 and $100,000. Another 12 percent, between 100 and 200. So a majority, more than 50 percent --"

So when he went and said, \"What do you have to lose?\" he was talking to African-Americans. And the pitch, it was a sales pitch. He's a salesman. The sales pitch is exactly the same that Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, Shelby Steele, have echoed in the past, which is if you don't offer a competitive product to the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party doesn't have to try. So all Trump is saying and all the black intellectuals have been saying is, once the Republicans offer a competitive product, finally, the Democrats will stop taking blacks for granted."
