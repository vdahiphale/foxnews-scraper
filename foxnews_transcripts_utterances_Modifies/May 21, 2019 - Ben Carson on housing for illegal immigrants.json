      "sentences": "Tucker, in the past seven months ending in April, the Border Patrol in just the El Centro sector has apprehended 293,000 migrants, that's a 400 percent increase from a year earlier. And because housing facilities are overflowing and because of legal limits on how long migrant children can be held, Border agents are now loading migrants into vans and buses and driving them 150 miles away to a Greyhound bus station in San Bernardino.  We saw the drop offs firsthand in San Bernardino last week. The migrants are released pending court dates, but of course the vast majority never show up for court. Critics say the migrants shouldn't be dumped at the bus station with no resources. But migrants interviewed by Reuters say they feel safe in the U.S. and were treated well by Border agents.  Remember, El Centro is one of nine sectors along the U.S.-Mexico border and it's like this at all of them. Customs and Border Protection calls the situation both a humanitarian and operational crisis.  Meantime, about 30 miles from San Bernardino, an unknown number of migrants were flown to the Border Patrol facility in Murrieta, California. But some members of the community were quick to stand in front of the Border Patrol gates to let the migrants know they were not welcome to stay. Murrieta residents say they heard the migrants would eventually be dropped off at strip malls and bus stations, but the Murrieta Police now say none of the migrants are being released, though it is very unclear where they will go next -- Tucker.",

Our system is in total collapse. Nobody is even trying to protect you or our country.  Kirsten Gillibrand is a U.S. senator and a Democratic presidential candidate.

Our leaders are decadent and narcissistic. They care only about themselves, they will never defend our nation. That's obvious and the rest of the world knows it.   The American pinata has been getting pummeled for decades, and now it has finally come apart. Our national wealth is up for grabs by whomever gets here first, and they are coming. Over just the past year, 1 percent of the entire population of the nation of Guatemala has moved to the United States. A \"Wall Street Journal\" piece in the last month described the plight of that country's villages, some of them are literally de-populating as people stream north to America's generous welfare state.  Meanwhile, a new study from the Federation for American Immigration Reform - FAIR given exclusively to this show, shows the scale on which the United States is being plundered. Every year, FAIR found foreign born workers send about $150 billion in remittances to their friends and family overseas. That's more than the GDP of 18 American states. Illegal aliens alone are emitting $28 billion a year. That's $28 billion leaving this country going abroad every year from people who don't even have the legal right to work here in the first place, but are and are benefiting of course from all the extras -- free healthcare, free education, subsidized housing, food stamps -- who knows what else.  The remittances are not taxed. In the case of illegal immigrants working under the table, their original earnings have never been taxed either. So this is a disaster, but it's not a natural disaster. We could have prevented it with a wall, a mandatory e-verify, remittance taxes and efficient deportation process. You could easily fix this crisis. It wouldn't take much.  It's not fixed because Congress doesn't want to fix it. Just today, HUD Secretary Ben Carson faced a hostile reception on Capitol Hill. Why? Because he dared to suggest that illegal aliens should be ineligible for public housing. Watch this exchange with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York.",

Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 specifically states that the Secretary of HUD is prohibited from providing housing assistance to people who are in the country illegally.   And what people sometimes don't understand is that we have millions of legal Americans in line waiting for these very scarce resources. What the Congresswoman and many others also don't realize is that we have provided a mechanism whereby people who are affected -- illegals who are affected -- and can't find housing can have delayed action for six months, which can be renewed twice for a total of 18 months, which, of course, is plenty of time for Congress to do its job. So you know, for them to suggest that I should break the law, what is the real implication? That we can just pick and choose the laws we want to enforce and embrace? Of course, we feel sympathy for people. Of course, we don't want anybody out on the streets.  But the real thing that is hurting people is our failure to address this immigration system, the rules that are drawing people here and keeping them here, and that are so unfair to American citizens who have been paying taxes and working here.  We take in 1.1 million people legally through our immigration system, which is far more than any other country and let that system work. But it can't work when we have all these perverse incentives, which are drawing people here.",

You're a racist, a white supremacist. That's the lesson being taught in New York City's Public School System right now. The Chancellor of that school system, Richard Carranza says his monolithically progressive school system is in fact, a hotbed of secret racism. Carranza is spending some unknown, but doubtless enormous amount of money forcing his administrators to attend workshops, where they're warned about the hallmarks of quote, \"white supremacy culture.\" Those are the words we just read to you. Those are white supremacist ideas. This culture includes all the things we just named, but much more. According to Carranza, white supremacy is everywhere and every white person participates in it and if you disagree with him at all, you're fragile, you're of course, a racist -- just part of the problem. Right now, by the way, four women are suing the school district in New York. They say they were demoted entirely because of their skin color.

Millennials are entering adulthood with more debt, worse career prospects and far less hope that they'll be able to own their own homes or start their families, get married, even, and thanks to that, many of them are giving up on America's economic system entirely.  A new Gallup poll finds that 43 percent of all American adults think that quote, \"some form of socialism would be a good thing for this country.\" Among those aged 18 to 34, fifty seven percent support socialism.

They never tell you that socialism was more than just Denmark or Sweden that ultimately ends up like Venezuela and Cuba. And because it's contrary to human nature, it requires a degree of coercion. That's pretty scary. The great murderers of the 20th Century are Stalin and Mao all had the word socialist in their descriptions of their government. Also, Tucker, I think we had 10 years from 2007 to 2017, as you alluded to a flat economic growth, and this new generation piled up a trillion and a half dollars in student debt, and they prolonged their adolescence.

It impoverished us.  And then they redefined free trade as unfair trade. So when the entire Midwest was hollowed out, it was almost a callous message of, \"Go learn coding\" or \"Go to the fracking fields\" or \"China is getting us cheap stuff that we can afford, even if we don't have good wages,\" or \"It will make us leaner and meaner and more competitive,\" or \"It's unsustainable for China,\" but there was never any empathy. There was never any compassion to say, \"Look, free market capitalism is the only system that works, but we have to have protections in place to protect the working classes and young people.\" And we didn't do that as Republicans and conservatives, so we're at fault, too.",

Liberalism is a religion that of course, relies on people being unhappy and bitter and miserable and jealous. And it makes you unhappy and envious of other people who may be just -- or don't believe the way you do. But then of course, you're a blasphemer. And this is what the left has problem with.

So shortening of attention spans, addiction, polarization, outrage-fication of politics, call-out culture, teen isolation, mental health -- these are all connected issues, because there's only so much human attention out there, right? It takes nine months to grow new human attention, and so it's this finite race for a finite resource and the companies sort of have to get more and more aggressive to get that attention out. So that means short, simple phrases work better than long, complicated, nuanced things. It means that short words of moral outrage. For every word of moral outrage you add to a tweet, it increases your retweet rates by 17 percent. So if you say it's abominable, it's a disgrace, you get more and more attention, but it's filling up more and more of the channel. So our whole society feels like it is going crazy all at once. And this is happening with Facebook, with YouTube, with teen mental health. It's not enough to just get people's attention, we have to get -- the tech industry has to get people addicted to getting attention from other people, so this is what has created influencer culture. So now you have teenage girls who have to have more followers and likes and you have to have the beautification filters. Fifty five percent of plastic surgeons said last year in a survey that they saw at least one patient who was a teen girl who wanted to look like their Snapchat beautification filter, to get plastic surgery. So this is actually a connected system of harms that we think of almost like the climate change of culture. Frank Luntz actually calls it that. We call it human downgrading, which is that while we're extracting attention from people, we are crawling down the brainstem to get the attention. To upgrade the machines, it's downgrade people, downgrading attention spans, downgrading civility, downgrading decency, and there's a better way to do it. And that's why, you know, we are trying to catalyze this transition. We're a group of former technology insiders, who used to be the people who know how these products are working and are designed and we know we need to change the incentives.",

      "utterance": "Tucker, in the past seven months ending in April, the Border Patrol in just the El Centro sector has apprehended 293,000 migrants, that's a 400 percent increase from a year earlier. And because housing facilities are overflowing and because of legal limits on how long migrant children can be held, Border agents are now loading migrants into vans and buses and driving them 150 miles away to a Greyhound bus station in San Bernardino. We saw the drop offs firsthand in San Bernardino last week. The migrants are released pending court dates, but of course the vast majority never show up for court. Critics say the migrants shouldn't be dumped at the bus station with no resources. But migrants interviewed by Reuters say they feel safe in the U.S. and were treated well by Border agents. Remember, El Centro is one of nine sectors along the U.S.-Mexico border and it's like this at all of them. Customs and Border Protection calls the situation both a humanitarian and operational crisis. Meantime, about 30 miles from San Bernardino, an unknown number of migrants were flown to the Border Patrol facility in Murrieta, California. But some members of the community were quick to stand in front of the Border Patrol gates to let the migrants know they were not welcome to stay. Murrieta residents say they heard the migrants would eventually be dropped off at strip malls and bus stations, but the Murrieta Police now say none of the migrants are being released, though it is very unclear where they will go next -- Tucker."

      "utterance": "It goes without saying that functioning societies don't operate like this. Countries that care about their people enforce their own laws. Our leaders are decadent and narcissistic. They care only about themselves, they will never defend our nation. That's obvious and the rest of the world knows it. The American pinata has been getting pummeled for decades, and now it has finally come apart. Our national wealth is up for grabs by whomever gets here first, and they are coming. Over just the past year, 1 percent of the entire population of the nation of Guatemala has moved to the United States. A \"Wall Street Journal\" piece in the last month described the plight of that country's villages, some of them are literally de-populating as people stream north to America's generous welfare state. Meanwhile, a new study from the Federation for American Immigration Reform - FAIR given exclusively to this show, shows the scale on which the United States is being plundered. Every year, FAIR found foreign born workers send about $150 billion in remittances to their friends and family overseas. That's more than the GDP of 18 American states. Illegal aliens alone are emitting $28 billion a year. That's $28 billion leaving this country going abroad every year from people who don't even have the legal right to work here in the first place, but are and are benefiting of course from all the extras -- free healthcare, free education, subsidized housing, food stamps -- who knows what else. The remittances are not taxed. In the case of illegal immigrants working under the table, their original earnings have never been taxed either. So this is a disaster, but it's not a natural disaster. We could have prevented it with a wall, a mandatory e-verify, remittance taxes and efficient deportation process. You could easily fix this crisis. It wouldn't take much. It's not fixed because Congress doesn't want to fix it. Just today, HUD Secretary Ben Carson faced a hostile reception on Capitol Hill. Why? Because he dared to suggest that illegal aliens should be ineligible for public housing. Watch this exchange with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "That's correct. Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 specifically states that the Secretary of HUD is prohibited from providing housing assistance to people who are in the country illegally. And what people sometimes don't understand is that we have millions of legal Americans in line waiting for these very scarce resources. What the Congresswoman and many others also don't realize is that we have provided a mechanism whereby people who are affected -- illegals who are affected -- and can't find housing can have delayed action for six months, which can be renewed twice for a total of 18 months, which, of course, is plenty of time for Congress to do its job. So you know, for them to suggest that I should break the law, what is the real implication? That we can just pick and choose the laws we want to enforce and embrace? Of course, we feel sympathy for people. Of course, we don't want anybody out on the streets. But the real thing that is hurting people is our failure to address this immigration system, the rules that are drawing people here and keeping them here, and that are so unfair to American citizens who have been paying taxes and working here. We take in 1.1 million people legally through our immigration system, which is far more than any other country and let that system work. But it can't work when we have all these perverse incentives, which are drawing people here."

Instead, they rather just say to you, why don't you break the law, so that we can feel good about ourselves? Why don't they do their jobs? That's what they were elected to do. The American people have a real choice to make here. They need to decide what kind of people do they want representing us? And it can't just be somebody whose name you recognize, it needs to be people who are willing to roll up their sleeves and do the tough things that need to be done in order for our country to prosper. And when our country is prosperous, I think we can then turn our attention to some of these other countries and see what we can do to help them, but we need to get ours in order first."

You're a racist, a white supremacist. That's the lesson being taught in New York City's Public School System right now. The Chancellor of that school system, Richard Carranza says his monolithically progressive school system is in fact, a hotbed of secret racism. Carranza is spending some unknown, but doubtless enormous amount of money forcing his administrators to attend workshops, where they're warned about the hallmarks of quote, \"white supremacy culture.\" Those are the words we just read to you. Those are white supremacist ideas. This culture includes all the things we just named, but much more. According to Carranza, white supremacy is everywhere and every white person participates in it and if you disagree with him at all, you're fragile, you're of course, a racist -- just part of the problem. Right now, by the way, four women are suing the school district in New York. They say they were demoted entirely because of their skin color. So it turns out Carranza is right in a way, New York City School System really is racist. And he is the reason why. We'll have more on his reign of terror later this week. It's a fascinating story that hasn't been covered much, it should be, and of course, as we said, we will.

      "utterance": "\"America will never be a socialist country,\" says the President. It's hard to imagine this a socialist country. But if you're having trouble imagining it, maybe because you're old. The number of Americans who think we should bring some socialism into our system is growing and they are mostly young people. Millennials are entering adulthood with more debt, worse career prospects and far less hope that they'll be able to own their own homes or start their families, get married, even, and thanks to that, many of them are giving up on America's economic system entirely. A new Gallup poll finds that 43 percent of all American adults think that quote, \"some form of socialism would be a good thing for this country.\" Among those aged 18 to 34, fifty seven percent support socialism. A shocking number. Victor Davis Hanson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks very much for coming on. You hear those numbers. And this is not the only poll to reach this conclusion. And what's your reaction?"

I think that there's a lot of ignorance of socialism, I think our public school system and the universities or popular culture, they sort of glorify it as a fuzzy-wuzzy Robinhood like taking from people who really didn't build that and giving it to more deserving victims. They never tell you that socialism was more than just Denmark or Sweden that ultimately ends up like Venezuela and Cuba. And because it's contrary to human nature, it requires a degree of coercion. That's pretty scary. The great murderers of the 20th Century are Stalin and Mao all had the word socialist in their descriptions of their government. Also, Tucker, I think we had 10 years from 2007 to 2017, as you alluded to a flat economic growth, and this new generation piled up a trillion and a half dollars in student debt, and they prolonged their adolescence. It was a life of Julia or pajama boy culture. And they did not have children. They did not marry. They did not buy homes. Those are all the traditional stimuli that make somebody take the attention off themselves and on to nobody else. They are conservative stimuli."

It impoverished us. And then they redefined free trade as unfair trade. So when the entire Midwest was hollowed out, it was almost a callous message of, \"Go learn coding\" or \"Go to the fracking fields\" or \"China is getting us cheap stuff that we can afford, even if we don't have good wages,\" or \"It will make us leaner and meaner and more competitive,\" or \"It's unsustainable for China,\" but there was never any empathy. There was never any compassion to say, \"Look, free market capitalism is the only system that works, but we have to have protections in place to protect the working classes and young people.\" And we didn't do that as Republicans and conservatives, so we're at fault, too."

      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "What we see? Well, Tucker, five years ago, Bernie Sanders was a joke. And now he's a serious contender for the presidency. So that proves your point. And that's what's happened. We are discussing a wealth tax right now, at least the Democrats are. That has been rejected throughout Europe as something that destroys wealth and initiative, and yet, why would we even consider it? The whole premise of the Green New Deal is socialism, and yet we have mainstream candidates that embrace it, not because they believe in it, but because as you say, they think there's poll data that suggests support, especially among young people. But it's sad because history suggests every time we go down this trajectory, and you think you're going to get something for free or you're going to be humanitarian, you're going to virtue signal, somebody decides that they have to use coercion and authoritarianism to stop people like you and I from suggesting it doesn't work and we don't want to be a part of it.

It turns out that across the country, research shows the happiest women aren't the most progressive and liberated ones. Instead they are married, religious, conservative women. This is the group that reports consistently the highest quality marriages, the happiest lives in America. That's what researchers found. \"New York Times\" readers were enraged to hear about this. They unleashed a torrent of bitterness mostly on Twitter. In so doing, they bolster the report's findings, of course. They're not aware of that. They live in an irony free world.

      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, happiness is a subjective thing, right? We all have a different perspective, different life experience. And I don't like organized religion, but I'm a woman of faith. And that gives me -- it helps me get a perspective separate and beyond myself, which inevitably, when we go beyond ourselves, we end up being a little bit happier in life. So it makes sense to me. And that's a wonderful thing. But I'm not surprised because really, even when I was on the left, and what we see now is liberalism is a religion. Liberalism is a religion that of course, relies on people being unhappy and bitter and miserable and jealous. And it makes you unhappy and envious of other people who may be just -- or don't believe the way you do. But then of course, you're a blasphemer. And this is what the left has problem with. If you do not agree with their line or their narrative of what's important, you will be shunned, you will be punished. And those are the things that they complain of other people, right? And they don't see it, they don't realize that their own misery and anger at people being happy, whether it's because of their faith or not, who knows? Maybe it's just that they're comfortable enough with themselves to feel comfortable with, with God and an entity beyond themselves. They don't know. But the rage that we saw confirms the fact that the left itself is a religion that really has no tolerance for anyone else."

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Well, look, and this is the problem with who the left is attracted, and I come from the left and, and I know why I was attracted to it. I grew up in a difficult scenario, I grew up somewhat poor. My mother was not exactly necessarily meant for motherhood to some degree. And it was a difficult childhood, and you grow up with an expectation that things are not good, and that you must fight for yourself and that there's victimhood. And then that becomes, of course -- you can elevated based on your victimhood, and that becomes the thing to strive for in a way. And then they are saviors, and other people are going to save you. So it appeals to some degree, the damaged, and then what we should do in life. And for me it was therapy, is be able to move -- recognize that damage, and move beyond it, be able to transcend that with the help of the community and your extended family with whatever the dynamic is. But the left now and leftist leadership preys on people who've been injured, and they rely on that damage to move people forward. Cults do that as well. And so you're looking at kind of a cultic behavior. And so yes, it's disappointing, and it's sad. But of course, it's, I think, quite telling with the state of certainly leftist politics today and the Democratic Party in particular."

People in Brooklyn deeply care that somewhere in Alabama, somebody disagrees with them. Why do they feel the need to control other people like that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",

You can't have people thinking, \"Well, wait a minute, there are other options for me to live. There's other ways for me to find a way out of what my situation is,\" or a way to find happiness or to remind people that happiness is possible. And that something beyond ourselves can actually enhance and illuminate your life and remind you of the glory of life and to be grateful for it. And the difference between, let's say, the Middle Ages, and the Modern Age, the fact that happiness is a choice, and that we can choose to look at things in a certain way. And that of course, is a threat to a side of politics that relies on fear and suspicion because it's easier to organize you when you're afraid."

Restrictions on abortion, she said are quote, \"Not just to attack on women, but an attack on anyone who can or might get pregnant, including transgender men, and gender non-conforming people.\" Got that? Laura McQuade who runs Planned Parenthood says that men can get pregnant. How does that work? NBC, a former news organization ran a piece over the weekend making exactly the same claim. They claim, a man delivered a baby. Keep in mind that no man in human history has ever done that. It seems like a big story. It seems like all of a sudden, it's happening everywhere. Men delivering babies. What has happened? Has biology been reordered? No. In fact, it's still true. It will always be true that only women can bear children. What has changed is that the left has decided to impose its fantasy life on the rest of the country. To do that it must get the rest of us to lie about science. Amazingly, most of our leaders appear happy to do that to go along with it. We're not going to go along with that. Not because we begrudge other people their fantasies, but because reality is worth defending. Well, around the world millions of Christians live in fear of genocide.

Nobody ever says it, but it's true. What happened in Iraq is now happening in countries across the region and around the world.

Our community in the Middle East, we, Christians have faced this for over 1,400 to 1,500 years and I believe, Tucker what has pushed this more at least a little bit more that the world is talking about this is because of the savagery of ISIS was put on display through social media.

It is -- genocide really is not just about spilling blood, it is really destroying our community, our history. Our history is thousands of years old before Christianity.

Persecution really looks different in different parts of the world. Some places, social media is used to provoke radical Islamists. In other places, the country is exporting terrorism like Iran.

So we don't know the long-term health risk, and I'm not willing to take that off the table, especially since 5G is closer to you because it doesn't -- it's faster and it's higher definition.

And not only that, I want to tell you medically, this is a huge home run because 5G has very high definition, which means we're probably going to be able to operate robotically -- that's right, robotically -- from other places in the world finally, remotely, robotically, telemedicine. So there's a lot of big advances in higher definition. We've got to study -- Tucker, we should have been studying it already and the latest studies in rats make me want to see more and more in humans at the same time.

I don't think the increased radiation from 5G, in the phone itself is what bothers me because actually five 5G, it doesn't penetrate as much as 3G and 2G, you know, but the towers are going to be much closer to you and they're going to be transmitting all day and night. So I want them studied. That hasn't been studying and there's going to be a lot of them sprouting up. That's what the risk is. And I'm not talking about cancer necessarily, I'm talking about preliminary changes to cells in the brain. You know, not to mention what we've talked about previously on this show, which is more and more technology means more and more teens not talking to each other, which means more and more depression and anxiety.

So shortening of attention spans, addiction, polarization, outrage-fication of politics, call-out culture, teen isolation, mental health -- these are all connected issues, because there's only so much human attention out there, right? It takes nine months to grow new human attention, and so it's this finite race for a finite resource and the companies sort of have to get more and more aggressive to get that attention out. So that means short, simple phrases work better than long, complicated, nuanced things. It means that short words of moral outrage. For every word of moral outrage you add to a tweet, it increases your retweet rates by 17 percent. So if you say it's abominable, it's a disgrace, you get more and more attention, but it's filling up more and more of the channel. So our whole society feels like it is going crazy all at once. And this is happening with Facebook, with YouTube, with teen mental health. It's not enough to just get people's attention, we have to get -- the tech industry has to get people addicted to getting attention from other people, so this is what has created influencer culture. So now you have teenage girls who have to have more followers and likes and you have to have the beautification filters. Fifty five percent of plastic surgeons said last year in a survey that they saw at least one patient who was a teen girl who wanted to look like their Snapchat beautification filter, to get plastic surgery. So this is actually a connected system of harms that we think of almost like the climate change of culture. Frank Luntz actually calls it that. We call it human downgrading, which is that while we're extracting attention from people, we are crawling down the brainstem to get the attention. To upgrade the machines, it's downgrade people, downgrading attention spans, downgrading civility, downgrading decency, and there's a better way to do it. And that's why, you know, we are trying to catalyze this transition. We're a group of former technology insiders, who used to be the people who know how these products are working and are designed and we know we need to change the incentives."

It's harder to have a civil conversation. It's harder to feel good about, you know, where we're spending our time and how much we're looking at our phones. But I think what we need is language. We need to have language for what's happening. And I think when you have phrases like, you know, the race to the bottom of the brainstem to get attention out of people, it helps people see that there's a problem. And what we've seen is that, by giving language to something, we've actually gotten advocates inside the companies to change their behavior. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg adopted \"Time Well Spent,\" which is our phrase for the mission of the company. Apple and Google launched the Screen Time Management features. But these are tiny little baby steps in what really needs to happen. And I want to say that, you know, Apple actually is the company that's almost like the government of the attention economy. If they wanted to, their business model is not maximizing how much you're hooked to your phone, they just have to get you to buy it every two years. And they could change the design to be more like a GPS, that's just taking you out the world to the next life experience. If you think about it, like the point of a GPS isn't to addict you to the GPS, you sit there fiddling with it and getting sucked into it for as long as possible, or taking you somewhere you don't want to go."
