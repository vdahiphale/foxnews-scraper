He's going to visit his brother, who has been very, very sick. We will try to get the latest there on that.  Following some fast-moving developments, meanwhile, on COVID-19. Right now, California has just hit better than 600,000 cases. And the governor there saying he's on top of this. He has not hinted at what new actions he might take to address this.  All of this as, in the United States, we're getting word for two days running 50,000 new cases each day. Have not seen that in a while, even though some other trends point to positive developments on the COVID-19 front.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And what a visit \"Your World,\" focusing on the virus, focusing on stimulus around the virus, and the president outlining plans to provide still more stimulus on his own, talking up a $3,400 check relief program that still technically needs Congress to give the OK.  But Congress is out of session. The Senate and the House won't be back until after Labor Day. So, how far can he go? We are on that, and also on this with James Clyburn, of course, a big help to Joe Biden to put him over the top, get him a South Carolina win, and then move on toward the Democratic nomination, now weighing in, not only on that newly minted ticket also featuring Kamala Harris, but what he thinks the Democrats have to do now to respond to what the president's doing on his own. So, man, oh, man, have we got a lot to cover in the next hour.  So let's get right to it first with Steve Harrigan on the latest count of the virus nationally and in some of these problematic states, I guess, Steve, like California.   To you, my friend.",

Of course, concerns ahead too, with a heat wave approaching California, triple-digit temperatures expected in the Central Valley. Problems are, that could lead to wildfires. It could also lead to crowds on the beaches without social distancing. Here in Georgia, the mask fight continues. The governor of Georgia has dropped his lawsuit against the mayor and the city council. They tried to put in a mask mandate. He fought it. Instead, he's going to issue an executive order which basically does the same thing, allow businesses to opt out, not force their customers to wear masks -- Neil, back to you.",

He needs Congress to do what he wants to do, but he's letting the American people know, this is what I'm prepared to do. Now it's up to Congress to do it.   Let's show you some of the tweets that the president sent out just a little while ago, the president saying he is prepared to send direct payments, $3,400 for a family of four, to all Americans. He's directed the Treasury secretary to get ready to do that. He's also prepared to send additional PPP payments to small businesses he says have been hurt by the China virus. And in the third tweet, the president says that he's ready to send more money to states and local governments to save jobs for police, firefighters, first responders and teachers, including $105 billion dollars for schools. But there you see at the end, he says Democrats are holding this up.  One of the big sticking points is cost-cutting measures that have been implemented at the U.S. Postal Service over the last few months. In fact, the Postal Service, according to The Washington Post, sent out a warning letter to 46 states, saying all of the mail-in ballots for November's election may not make it, in time to get counted.  So Democrats are asking for $25 billion a month, including $3.5 billion for mail-in votes for the Postal Service to get it back up to speed. The president has resisted that idea. He doesn't like the idea of mail-in voting to begin. And he says another $25 billion, what else do you want? But I asked him this afternoon in his press briefing, if the Democrats were to come over to your side and give you some of what you're asking for, would you be willing to sign off on that $25 billion and the $3.5 billion to handle mail-in voting?

In the meantime, this comes on the same day we have learned for the CDC director that, if you think things are a little problematic now when it comes to COVID-19, it could get really, really funky this fall, indicating that America could be bracing for the worst fall, from a public health perspective, that we have ever had.  Dr. Roshini Raj joins us right now, the NYU Langone associate professor of medicine, much, much more. Doctor, what do you think the CDC director meant by that? Normally, we have been led to think, in the warmer weather, this would mitigate somewhat. Just the opposite has happened. And now, when people look at the fall, they think, well, maybe things will stabilize then.  He seems to be saying no. Do you agree?",

And when you think about it, when the temperatures start to drop, those outdoor dining options are no longer going to be there. People are going to be in closer quarters more or in smaller groups.  And this is a potential for some spread. We also have the great experiment of schools reopening in some parts of the country and what's going to happen with that. And then, of course, you add flu season, and the fact that this is the time where people get the flu and pneumonia.  All of these are going to be taking up hospital beds, maybe having confusing symptoms that could be confused with COVID. So there is a lot of potential there for things to get worse. And that's why he's really warning us to stay very vigilant and really stick to those four simple measures, as much as we can, which is wearing masks, washing your hands, social distancing and being aware of crowded places.",

It's not a perfect system or a perfect safeguard, but it definitely can decrease the number of cases and the number of deaths. So I do think that would be a good idea. And I really quite -- can't quite comprehend why people are resistant to that, certain people. It seems to become a political issue. There are certain groups who can't wear a mask and children under the age of 2 not recommended to wear a mask, because they may not be able to tell if they're not breathing properly to take it off.

So, increasingly, with this virus, my friends, it remains like a Whac-A- Mole situation, under control in one place, moves on to another place. Than that old place where it was under control has problems again. That has been the story that the CDC directors seemed to be hinting at when he said, this fall could be a problem. All right, could be a problem when it comes to getting Congress and the president to ever agree on relief triggered to dealing with the virus right now. The president is acting on his own, because he says Democrats and Republicans couldn't cobble something together.

We have a health care crisis, but we have an economic crisis. And we ought not deal with this as if there are silos here, because the health care crisis affects the economic crisis.

If you got a $1 trillion program that is totally inadequate, that doesn't make it a good program because it's small.

Again, this is the first result we have seen from that investigation today. The defendant, his name is Kevin Clinesmith. He's a former FBI attorney in the General Counsel Office. Now, the document he admitted to falsifying part of a larger collection of documents used to issue a warrant to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Now, Clinesmith altered the e-mail to say Page was not a source for the CIA. But Page indeed was at some point in time. It's not clear the exact point in time. The FBI never disclosed that CIA-Page relationship because of Clinesmith's e-mail change. Now, Clinesmith's attorney, Justin Shur, at least a statement to FOX News: \"Kevin deeply regrets having altered the e-mail. It was never his intent to mislead the court or his colleagues, as he believed the information he relayed was accurate. But Kevin understands what he did was wrong and accepts responsibility.\" Neil, legal experts say it's unlikely that Clinesmith will spend time behind bars because he will be pleading guilty, in fact, in this case. Meanwhile, the Durham probe continues. There could be indictments. Attorney General Bill Barr, who I guess largely is overseeing this, has come under a lot of criticism, because we're just about two-and-a-half months out from the election. He says, of course, this is not political. I'm in, as you mentioned, Bridgewater, New Jersey, not far from the president's golf club in Bedminster. He will be here this weekend.

He's going to visit his brother, who has been very, very sick. We will try to get the latest there on that. Following some fast-moving developments, meanwhile, on COVID-19. Right now, California has just hit better than 600,000 cases. And the governor there saying he's on top of this. He has not hinted at what new actions he might take to address this. All of this as, in the United States, we're getting word for two days running 50,000 new cases each day. Have not seen that in a while, even though some other trends point to positive developments on the COVID-19 front. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And what a visit \"Your World,\" focusing on the virus, focusing on stimulus around the virus, and the president outlining plans to provide still more stimulus on his own, talking up a $3,400 check relief program that still technically needs Congress to give the OK. But Congress is out of session. The Senate and the House won't be back until after Labor Day. So, how far can he go? We are on that, and also on this with James Clyburn, of course, a big help to Joe Biden to put him over the top, get him a South Carolina win, and then move on toward the Democratic nomination, now weighing in, not only on that newly minted ticket also featuring Kamala Harris, but what he thinks the Democrats have to do now to respond to what the president's doing on his own. So, man, oh, man, have we got a lot to cover in the next hour. So let's get right to it first with Steve Harrigan on the latest count of the virus nationally and in some of these problematic states, I guess, Steve, like California. To you, my friend."

That has the governor saying that this could be a possible turning point, the mayor of Los Angeles saying there are signs of light now. Of course, concerns ahead too, with a heat wave approaching California, triple-digit temperatures expected in the Central Valley. Problems are, that could lead to wildfires. It could also lead to crowds on the beaches without social distancing. Here in Georgia, the mask fight continues. The governor of Georgia has dropped his lawsuit against the mayor and the city council. They tried to put in a mask mandate. He fought it. Instead, he's going to issue an executive order which basically does the same thing, allow businesses to opt out, not force their customers to wear masks -- Neil, back to you."

      "utterance": "Well, he can't go very far on these particular demands by himself. He needs Congress to do what he wants to do, but he's letting the American people know, this is what I'm prepared to do. Now it's up to Congress to do it. Let's show you some of the tweets that the president sent out just a little while ago, the president saying he is prepared to send direct payments, $3,400 for a family of four, to all Americans. He's directed the Treasury secretary to get ready to do that. He's also prepared to send additional PPP payments to small businesses he says have been hurt by the China virus. And in the third tweet, the president says that he's ready to send more money to states and local governments to save jobs for police, firefighters, first responders and teachers, including $105 billion dollars for schools. But there you see at the end, he says Democrats are holding this up. One of the big sticking points is cost-cutting measures that have been implemented at the U.S. Postal Service over the last few months. In fact, the Postal Service, according to The Washington Post, sent out a warning letter to 46 states, saying all of the mail-in ballots for November's election may not make it, in time to get counted. So Democrats are asking for $25 billion a month, including $3.5 billion for mail-in votes for the Postal Service to get it back up to speed. The president has resisted that idea. He doesn't like the idea of mail-in voting to begin. And he says another $25 billion, what else do you want? But I asked him this afternoon in his press briefing, if the Democrats were to come over to your side and give you some of what you're asking for, would you be willing to sign off on that $25 billion and the $3.5 billion to handle mail-in voting? Here's what he said."

So all we know is that his brother Robert, with whom he says he's very close and cares a lot about, is very sick in the hospital.

But, as John Roberts pointed out, that he has not commented beyond that. So, again, we will monitor this for you. In the meantime, this comes on the same day we have learned for the CDC director that, if you think things are a little problematic now when it comes to COVID-19, it could get really, really funky this fall, indicating that America could be bracing for the worst fall, from a public health perspective, that we have ever had. Dr. Roshini Raj joins us right now, the NYU Langone associate professor of medicine, much, much more. Doctor, what do you think the CDC director meant by that? Normally, we have been led to think, in the warmer weather, this would mitigate somewhat. Just the opposite has happened. And now, when people look at the fall, they think, well, maybe things will stabilize then. He seems to be saying no. Do you agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. ROSHINI RAJ, NYU LANGONE HEALTH",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think it is a very appropriate message, because so much of this virus, we know, is dependent on being in close quarters. And when you think about it, when the temperatures start to drop, those outdoor dining options are no longer going to be there. People are going to be in closer quarters more or in smaller groups. And this is a potential for some spread. We also have the great experiment of schools reopening in some parts of the country and what's going to happen with that. And then, of course, you add flu season, and the fact that this is the time where people get the flu and pneumonia. All of these are going to be taking up hospital beds, maybe having confusing symptoms that could be confused with COVID. So there is a lot of potential there for things to get worse. And that's why he's really warning us to stay very vigilant and really stick to those four simple measures, as much as we can, which is wearing masks, washing your hands, social distancing and being aware of crowded places."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "RAJ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think, at this point, we're seeing that, in many parts of the country, we're going in the wrong direction, not the right direction. And masks do help prevent the spread and prevent you from transmitting it to other people and you contracting the virus from other people. It's not a perfect system or a perfect safeguard, but it definitely can decrease the number of cases and the number of deaths. So I do think that would be a good idea. And I really quite -- can't quite comprehend why people are resistant to that, certain people. It seems to become a political issue. There are certain groups who can't wear a mask and children under the age of 2 not recommended to wear a mask, because they may not be able to tell if they're not breathing properly to take it off. But for everyone else who can, I certainly think it's the right thing to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Doctor, thank you very, very much. We're monitoring all of this very, very closely here. This comes on the heels of reports we're getting out of Europe, by the way, I want to pass along that the rising virus infection rate across Europe has already triggered some travel restrictions, that, and in New Zealand, which had this under control, Auckland pretty much under new lockdown procedures. So, increasingly, with this virus, my friends, it remains like a Whac-A- Mole situation, under control in one place, moves on to another place. Than that old place where it was under control has problems again. That has been the story that the CDC directors seemed to be hinting at when he said, this fall could be a problem. All right, could be a problem when it comes to getting Congress and the president to ever agree on relief triggered to dealing with the virus right now. The president is acting on his own, because he says Democrats and Republicans couldn't cobble something together. We have someone who's going to put this in some perspective here, what obviously is happening that has James Clyburn, the House majority whip, worried the president's going too far. What would his guy Joe Biden do, and what does he recommend? We will ask the congressman who put Joe Biden over the top back in South Carolina -- after this."

But the fact of the matter is, the president's still going along on his own, because, he says, well, Congress isn't. James Clyburn joins us right now, the South Carolina Democratic congressman, also the House majority whip, the man who everyone, obviously, would readily acknowledge put Joe Biden in the driver's seat after winning that state's primary, going on to take the Democratic nomination, just picking his running mate.

People have jobs in state and local governments. Banks in little towns here in my congressional district, they are dependent upon the accounts that come from state and local governments. This whole notion of not funding state and local governments is crazy talk. And I would wish that they would get serious about what the real issues are. We have a health care crisis, but we have an economic crisis. And we ought not deal with this as if there are silos here, because the health care crisis affects the economic crisis. And you cannot solve one without the other. So, this whole notion of having, I got a $1 trillion program, the question is, what does it do? If you got a $1 trillion program that is totally inadequate, that doesn't make it a good program because it's small. What makes it a good program is if it gets the economy back up and running, if it gets us beyond this pandemic, which we know we got to get beyond. If your program will not do that, come to the table, and let's develop one that will."

Now, he's added to that, as you know, on top of a payroll tax cut that he's looking at those who earn up to $104,000 a year, extending unemployment benefits at $400 a week, $100 coming from states to kick in. And there are -- the devil in the details of that and how states could afford to do that. I get that, Congressman. But by opposing what he's offering and coming up and trying to come up with another measure, do you risk looking callous, that he's -- there he is with an offer to get that aid out to people right away, and you're blocking it?"

The fact of the matter is, how do we keep judging the health care or the health of the economy by what's happening on Wall Street?

Dick novel of the worst kind of darkness you can imagine, these folks showing up at your house because you made money in California nine years ago. But, again, I think it gets to something else here. They're talking about this raising $7.5 billion. California, it is a rich state. And it's an overwhelmingly rich state. So why are they mismanaging all of the taxes they already take in? Why do they keep making promises to a whole lot of people, citizens and non-citizens, that are so onerous and so expensive? The main folks who are getting hurt there are the middle class.

But it's significant, Neil, because it's the first tangible piece of a result that we have seen from this John Durham investigation. You have heard it many times over the last year-plus, John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, tapped by U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr to look at the origins of the Russia investigation, John Durham, the man for the job. Again, this is the first result we have seen from that investigation today. The defendant, his name is Kevin Clinesmith. He's a former FBI attorney in the General Counsel Office. Now, the document he admitted to falsifying part of a larger collection of documents used to issue a warrant to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Now, Clinesmith altered the e-mail to say Page was not a source for the CIA. But Page indeed was at some point in time. It's not clear the exact point in time. The FBI never disclosed that CIA-Page relationship because of Clinesmith's e-mail change."

But Kevin understands what he did was wrong and accepts responsibility.\" Neil, legal experts say it's unlikely that Clinesmith will spend time behind bars because he will be pleading guilty, in fact, in this case. Meanwhile, the Durham probe continues. There could be indictments. Attorney General Bill Barr, who I guess largely is overseeing this, has come under a lot of criticism, because we're just about two-and-a-half months out from the election. He says, of course, this is not political. I'm in, as you mentioned, Bridgewater, New Jersey, not far from the president's golf club in Bedminster. He will be here this weekend.

I would note that he worked with Page, Lisa Page, the attorney that expressed so much animus towards Trump. He himself expressed a great deal of animus towards the president in various e-mails.

None of this would go anywhere if the president loses the election, unfortunately, because I think this needs to see sunlight."

      "utterance": "All right, you probably are sick of getting a lot of poll news. Of course, you heard about the latest FOX one that has the president trailing Joe Biden by seven points. He had trailed him by 12 a couple of months ago. But this was the one that caught my attention. We asked these subset questions, if you will. The message you would send to the government, right now, 36 percent would say, leave me alone, but 57 percent would say, lend me a hand. The group saying lend me a hand is up from 34 percent who felt that way a year ago. Heather Zumarraga on this, the Zuma Global president, a great read of the economy and the markets, Gary Kaltbaum, practically an institution when it comes to following the markets, or we should put him in an institution."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I kid you, but welcome, both of you. Let me get your thoughts, Heather, all kidding aside, on that. If I'm the Republican candidate, right, no matter where, on the presidential level, all the way down, I'm hearing that a lot of people are saying, lend me a hand, what do I do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Of course. Who wouldn't want a free handout or during the coronavirus pandemic? Even Larry Kudlow has said that heavy government spending and borrowing was necessary with those that lost their jobs, for example, due to no fault of their own. But post-pandemic, I really think policy-makers should focus on cutting back on some of these subsidies, freeing up the nation of really big government that we're creating right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, the fact of the matter is, that might be all well and good. Deficits, debt might be a worry, Gary, but it could explain why the president was talking up the relief he was, acting unilaterally in extending it today to $3,400 or up to $3,400 stimulus checks for families of four. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARY KALTBAUM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think the president sees the poll numbers. And let me be clear, Neil. The economy is getting better. Corporate America is doing pretty darn well, new yearly highs at FedEx and UPS and things like that. But underneath that, small business not so great, service industry not so great. So many people still don't have a job. And those people continue to need a bridge. And you know me. I hate debt. I hate deficits. I hate too much spending. But there are moments in time where government has to stand up and look at the people and see, because of a pandemic, there is a problem. I work with these families all the time. There's still a lot of trouble out there. So I think those poll numbers are for real. And, hopefully, both parties can get together and do the right thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, there are all sorts of ideas out there about how you can give people things. Republicans generally favor tax cuts. And Democrats have been talking about more stimulus and spending, Heather, although neither party is unique to sort of blowing away spending levels and deficits and debt. But I am wondering, for the American people, especially given some of the improving economic stats we have seen, is it necessary, or does a party risk the wrath of voters if it does nothing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZUMARRAGA",
      "utterance": "Well, as you stated in the survey, in the statistics, the American people as a whole, 150 million received the direct stimulus payments and 25 million were relying on the $600-per-week supplemental bonus employment -- unemployment claims. So, I do think the data is getting better. Almost half of those that were unemployed during the pandemic have gone back to work. The retail sales data this morning, ex-auto, means people are out there spending. That means that the stimulus is working. But I do worry about debt and deficits in the future. And many other congressmen, Senator Rand Paul, Mitch McConnell, are all sounding -- Ted Cruz -- sounding the alarms on the debt and deficits in the future. That's why gold is up. And that's why you're seeing signs of inflation, with the dollar at the lowest levels since 2008."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Gary, very quickly here. The president has been arguing, Republicans have been saying -- Larry Kudlow echoed it again with me yesterday -- that the trend is the president's friend, that the data that's been coming in has steadily been getting better. Claims -- who believed we would say that it's good news that we're at 963,000 jobless claims, but it had been over a million -- well over a million for 20 consecutive weeks. Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KALTBAUM",
      "utterance": "It's definitely much better. But it's got to keep getting better. We're still a 10 percent unemployment. That's a big, big number, up from where we were when we were 3.5 percent."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, final word, Gary. Want to thank you. Heather, I want to thank you. In the meantime, we will be exploring this a lot more tomorrow, when we explore how this is all reverberating with voters, and, right now, with those who think they have a stake in this action.
