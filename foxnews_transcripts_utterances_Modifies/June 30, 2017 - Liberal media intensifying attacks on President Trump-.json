He said that on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" Fast forward to 9/11, shortly after that Michael Moore does a town hall at the U.K. And a columnist there said she almost walked out with her son because Michael Moore when on a rant about the puny white men on those planes were afraid of a handful of hijackers with box cutters.

And what we're seeing now is that you have to think like them or be like them in order to be accepted. And I think the bully aspect of Hollywood needs to be outed. And one thing that I'm encouraged by, Kimberly, is that social media, specifically Twitter, is really changing this. Republicans and conservatives are organized. So when an actor mocks us and then turns around and asks us to go to his premiere movie, we can have a choice there. And I think that that is having a chilling effect. I'm seeing this less and less, and hopefully social media will continue the pressure so that we can stop and end all this intolerance.",

John Solomon and I at Circa, we broke those stories on unmasking, and it wasn't based on gender or race. It was based on documented fact, actually declassified documents that John and I obtained that showed that the Obama administration actually loosened the rules in 2011 and did so again in 2015. And what we saw was an increase in unmasking from 2011 until after the election all the way through December, over 300 percent increase, and exponentially from November to December. So this had nothing to do with race or gender. This has to do with documented fact and the fact that the Obama administration had loosened the rules so much that they would allow them, their officials like Susan Rice, Samantha Power, and John Brennan to unmask."

So the only people that are actually seeing them are the people in the House Intelligence Committee that have the clearance to see them. And what we know from people and lawmakers who have been briefed on it is, Gregg's right, some of those unmasking requests had nothing to do with Russia, had nothing to do with national security.

Michael Moore has argued for years, Kimberly, that the reason Americans have this proliferation of guns is because of an irrational, unfair fear of black men. He said that on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" Fast forward to 9/11, shortly after that Michael Moore does a town hall at the U.K. And a columnist there said she almost walked out with her son because Michael Moore when on a rant about the puny white men on those planes were afraid of a handful of hijackers with box cutters. Had there been more black men on the plane because of how aggressive they are, they would have been able to deal with this. My goodness, talk about somebody perpetuating a racist stereotype of black men, the same stereotype that Michael Moore said was embraced unfairly by white America as for why they have so many guns. Now, I've written about this and posted it on Twitter and on Facebook if you want to read more about it. My point is that the left is always playing the race card, always calling Republicans racist whether it's Trump or George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan. Here you have the leader of the movement making a blatantly racist comment which would have been career ending had I made such a comment."

They've been at the forefront of so much. But unfortunately yesterday's champions of diversity have become today's intolerance. And what we're seeing now is that you have to think like them or be like them in order to be accepted. And I think the bully aspect of Hollywood needs to be outed. And one thing that I'm encouraged by, Kimberly, is that social media, specifically Twitter, is really changing this. Republicans and conservatives are organized. So when an actor mocks us and then turns around and asks us to go to his premiere movie, we can have a choice there. And I think that that is having a chilling effect. I'm seeing this less and less, and hopefully social media will continue the pressure so that we can stop and end all this intolerance."

But if you have a polluted river that's Hollywood, it's no mystery that the Democratic Party is in shambles and is really radioactive right now. They have no message. Their message is to be protesters in state capitals yelling at senators. That's their message summed up in Michael Moore's tweet. It's not to get jobs or health care, better trade deals like President Trump. It's to just be agitators. And the American people don't want that.

This is the first incumbent president coming into office to say that same-sex marriage was settled law. His daughter Ivanka wants several weeks of paid maternity leave. No Republican said something like that. And during the debate when Donald Trump was asked to name the three most important functions of government he said national security, which is proper, then he said health care and education, which is not. But these are the kinds of things that one would have thought would be embraced by people who normally can't stand Republicans. So it's totally irrational when you look at his views.

      "utterance": "I've waited a long time to have a Republican president that's really focused on the working class. That's what Donald Trump is doing. And I really think that he's flipping the script on some of these Democrats who had a corner on working-class Americans, union workers, miners, and suddenly now Donald Trump has taken the Republican Party and made us focus on the workers. This is really causing the Democrats to have a crisis. And I want to say one thing is that the media should focus on this crisis. When Republicans didn't have any of the House, the Senate, or the White House during the first two year of President Obama, there were nonstop stories about the death of the Republican Party, where are they going. That actually helped us. It helped us look at ourselves and look at our message. That's not happening with the Democrats yet."

      "utterance": "I agree completely. And isn't it refreshing that a Republican president is now the champion of old class Democrats, the working class. It's growing the party. And look, the Democrats are now the party of the coastal elites, not the American people."

OK, guys, you're the best, don't go anywhere because you're coming up with me again. Coming up, liberal college campuses are exploding with anti-Trump rage. Our panel will be back with us for reaction, that and much more as this special edition of \"Hannity\" continues. Stay with us."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to the special addition of \"Hannity: The Left's War on Trump.\" There's one group in America that might actually have more contempt for President Trump than the media, and even the elites in Hollywood. I'm talking about America's leftwing college professors and other snowflakes on campus who have been in complete meltdown mode since Election Day. In April one Fresno State professor was placed on leave for calling for President Trump's execution. And earlier this month there was a central Connecticut State University professor who argued that the Congressional baseball shooter was driven to go on a rampage by President Trump. Back with me for reaction are Larry Elder, Ric Grenell, and Charlie Kirk. OK, Larry, you can't even believe some of these stories. I know we've covered a lot on Fox, and Tucker does it as well, but it's really remarkable to me what's going on across college campuses, the hysteria, the disinformation, the censorship, it's unbelievable. Places of education where they are closing minds."

      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And it was bad even before Donald Trump. When you have people like Condoleezza Rice, for crying out loud, who was invited to speak at a commencement at Rutgers, a petition was passed around, signed by both professors and students, urging them to not invite her. She with her classy self said I don't want to be a distraction, so she withdraws. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the former Scandinavian Muslim politician is invited to speak to Brandeis, was given an honorary degree. They take back the honorary degree, uninvited her. For crying out loud, this was before Trump. And right now this kind of stuff is on steroids. People are absolutely irrational. I call it the Trump derangement syndrome, and academia is part of what I call the axis of indoctrination. It's one-third of the axis of indoctrination, and these kids are not being educated. They're being indoctrinated and parents are paying for this. It's outrageous. And some colleges or universities, you can't find a conservative in the department of political science or economics or history. And so kids are getting a one-sided education and their parents are paying for it. And it is an outrage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "It's very disturbing to me, Ric, to think that this is what parents are paying for or students are taking out student loans to be able to get an incredible education in this country, and they are being programmed and brainwashed it seems. It's really like a groupthink situation at these college campuses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRENELL",
      "utterance": "This is where we have got to get the word out because college students need to understand that during this period of their lives, the four years that they're going through the process of being educated, that it's incumbent upon them to listen to a whole bunch of different views, to go to classes that they don't really think that they like, but to challenge themselves, to look beyond what they think they know. And unfortunately we have adults at these schools who are not encouraging young people to actually expand their thought process, o be tolerant, to reach out and attend a class or a lecture from a subject matter that they think they know nothing about. And that's where I think the adults in the room, the professors on college campuses and the leadership, need to be able to understand that they are not educating individuals if they're trying to limit the education process to one partisanship."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Unbelievable. Charlie, what do we do about this? What do parents do to make sure that their children get a good education, like Ric said, that opens their minds, that makes them think about what other people are saying and actually become very good listeners, engage in critical thinking and analysis, and not just have this one-sided views that's being pushed down their throat every day in lectures."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "Great question. And I commonly say colleges have become a place where they want everyone to look different but think the same. And that's what you talked about with the professors and cataloguing them. We started a project a couple months ago, right after the election, actually, called Professor Watch List, ProfessorWatchList.org. We document these radical anti-American, anti-conservative professors, and we have dozens of examples of professors calling for the death of the president of the United States, calling for the public execution of GOP Congressmen before Steve Scalise. And so it needs to be documented and spread out, and that's what we're doing."
