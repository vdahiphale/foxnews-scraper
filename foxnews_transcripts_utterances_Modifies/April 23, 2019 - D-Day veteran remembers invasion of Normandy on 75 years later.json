      "sentences": "Thanks, Bret. All right everybody. Breaking tonight, my exclusive interview with Rush Limbaugh who was with President Trump this weekend as he began to move past the Mueller report, and look ahead. And now, Joe Biden believes if he can beat the president in the race for the White House, he's reportedly just days from jumping into the race now, but the start is looking a little bit rocky. The date may be a moving target. We'll speak to someone later in the show who was close to his campaign.  Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.”  The president tweeting up a storm. Here is the latest one from just moments ago. He says, \"You mean the stock market hit an all-time record high, and they're actually talking impeachment? Will I ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal Dems? No collusion!\"  Just for good measure with an exclamation point there. Here now exclusively tonight on “The Story,” Rush Limbaugh, host, of course, of the \"Rush Limbaugh Show\". Rush, thank you for being here tonight. Great to see you this evening.",

Here is the thing, Joe Biden is probably the best chance they've got, and he doesn't have a chance. They're probably -- I mean, Joe Biden and crazy Bernie, and Mayor Pete? Then we get three white guys, two of them are brontosauruses from Jurassic Park, and that isn't going to sit well with the rest of this party which has gone so far left.

And they're in a contest to who can give away the most. But with Elizabeth Warren forgiving college loans, forgiving that debt. And then, promising free college and Medicare for all in a Green New Deal. Why is anybody going to need to go to college because nobody's going to need a job because the Democrats are going to be giving everybody a universal basic income? So why does any of this matter?  None of this is real. None of this can happen. This is disinformation and it's really -- I think it's an indication of just how little they think of their own voters. That their own voters don't even want to work. They don't even want to achieve, they don't even want to pursue excellence, they just want to have their hands out, and vote for whoever is going to give them the most. What a way to ruin a life. Nobody would raise kids this way, why in the world does the Democrat Party think? Well, I can answer that too. Sometimes the best questions I get are those I ask myself. And why do they care? Because they can't win on policy. They can't win on anything of substance. So they have to demonize, they have to criticize, they have to impugn and destroy the credibility of all of their opponents, and then, promise to give everything away. Promise to be Santa Claus.

If you would go to the areas that Donald Trump won the election, traditional Democrat, white working class, and even blue-collar neighborhoods, you're not going to find that kind of attitude. These are the people that Democrats used to rely on. They are the people the Democrats have lost. These are the people that vote for Trump and they love Trump even more than they did in 2016.   The majority of this country is not yet at the place where it wants everything given to them. Of course, young people want things given to them. Kids always do. People that are not yet mature, haven't lived enough. But we're doing a great disservice to our kids by shortchanging their humanity, shortchanging their opportunities to excel. To become something, to become larger than themselves. They're nothing more than pawns that can be bought with votes. And I don't think that there is a majority of our population that -- up against Donald Trump is the key element here. I don't think there's a majority population that is serious about thinking this is the way the country ought to be run. You know, the student -- the student loan forgiveness. What about people who took loans and paid them back? What are we going to do? Give them reparations? Are they going to ask for refunds? I mean, where does all of this stop?  It isn't going to happen in the first place. That's -- it's all of this is disingenuous and dishonest, and it doesn't get anywhere near the heart of the problems that we are having in this country which I happen to think to revolve around the dissipation of our culture, the dissolution of our society, and so forth. And they are the culprits for this, and they need to be stopped. And this kind of stuff is not their route back.  And the fact that they're talking about Joe Biden or crazy Bernie who is leading everybody at this stage, I think is a testament to how bankrupt they actually are.",

You talk about sour grapes. This is a woman who's been rejected by the American people twice. Rejected by her party in 2008, she had to rig the primaries against crazy Bernie in 2016 to get the nomination.  She is the last person who ought to be listened to about what ought to happen to Donald Trump. She hasn't accomplished anything, anywhere near what Donald Trump has accomplished. She is in no position here to sit here and say what she saw in the Mueller report. She can say it, she's an American.

Donald Trump accomplished one of the greatest achievements of his life against all odds with no assistance. His own party wasn't even that much behind him. He has done something that few Americans will ever do, and they're trying to take it away from him, and they're trying to sully his reputation, simply because they don't like him.

This is a battle between the Washington establishments, some of the deep state, I call it the administrative state, and outsiders and Americans who feel disenfranchised or unattached, and it's -- the fact that the Republican Party, there's still many people in there just like Mitt Romney says he was sickened. He was sickened by what he read in the Mueller report. This is the same guy, Mitt Romney, who they said didn't care when an employee's wife died of cancer, same guy that they said didn't pay his taxes for ten years, the same guy who they said beat up somebody in prep school, the same guy who said he had a file of nothing but women.

He makes everybody the focus of attention. Everybody has a great time. He is a tremendous host. He's funny.

He's just -- he's a -- he's just -- that lake, that lake, that's better than anything they got at Pebble Beach, everybody knows it. He encourages you when you don't hit the ball well.

Anyway, I was in five campaigns throughout France, Belgium, and Germany, including the Battle of the Bulge, and then we ended up about 100 miles from Berlin, where we had a temporary cemetery there that was disinterred right after Memorial Day.

These are the poles that actually are the most interesting, I think, when you look at New Hampshire, when you look at Ohio -- at Iowa.

The date may be a moving target. We'll speak to someone later in the show who was close to his campaign. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” The president tweeting up a storm. Here is the latest one from just moments ago. He says, \"You mean the stock market hit an all-time record high, and they're actually talking impeachment? Will I ever be given credit for anything by the fake news media or radical liberal Dems? No collusion!\" Just for good measure with an exclamation point there. Here now exclusively tonight on “The Story,” Rush Limbaugh, host, of course, of the \"Rush Limbaugh Show\".

They don't understand how he won. They don't understand how he's going to win again in 2020. They don't understand the people who voted for him or why. They hold all of that in contempt. Here is the thing, Joe Biden is probably the best chance they've got, and he doesn't have a chance. They're probably -- I mean, Joe Biden and crazy Bernie, and Mayor Pete? Then we get three white guys, two of them are brontosauruses from Jurassic Park, and that isn't going to sit well with the rest of this party which has gone so far left. I don't think -- you know, Biden's putting off this announcement. I don't know how badly he really wants this. And you have to really want this if you're going have any chance of winning it."

There's way too much that's going to happen. Pocahontas is not going to be the nominee. But you know, these Democrats are all in the process are trying to out left this throughout liberal each other. And they're in a contest to who can give away the most. But with Elizabeth Warren forgiving college loans, forgiving that debt. And then, promising free college and Medicare for all in a Green New Deal. Why is anybody going to need to go to college because nobody's going to need a job because the Democrats are going to be giving everybody a universal basic income? So why does any of this matter? None of this is real. None of this can happen. This is disinformation and it's really -- I think it's an indication of just how little they think of their own voters. That their own voters don't even want to work. They don't even want to achieve, they don't even want to pursue excellence, they just want to have their hands out, and vote for whoever is going to give them the most. What a way to ruin a life. Nobody would raise kids this way, why in the world does the Democrat Party think? Well, I can answer that too. Sometimes the best questions I get are those I ask myself. And why do they care? Because they can't win on policy. They can't win on anything of substance. So they have to demonize, they have to criticize, they have to impugn and destroy the credibility of all of their opponents, and then, promise to give everything away. Promise to be Santa Claus. And it's not going to work against Trump. It might work against to Romney, or it might work against a traditional Republican, but it won't work against Donald Trump."

There's a feeling in this country among a lot of people that this is the way we should -- we should live. So, you know, it really breaks down the country in terms of those who think that we should be given all of these things and the people who are Trump supporters."

If you would go to the areas that Donald Trump won the election, traditional Democrat, white working class, and even blue-collar neighborhoods, you're not going to find that kind of attitude. These are the people that Democrats used to rely on. They are the people the Democrats have lost. These are the people that vote for Trump and they love Trump even more than they did in 2016. The majority of this country is not yet at the place where it wants everything given to them. Of course, young people want things given to them. Kids always do. People that are not yet mature, haven't lived enough. But we're doing a great disservice to our kids by shortchanging their humanity, shortchanging their opportunities to excel. To become something, to become larger than themselves. They're nothing more than pawns that can be bought with votes. And I don't think that there is a majority of our population that -- up against Donald Trump is the key element here. I don't think there's a majority population that is serious about thinking this is the way the country ought to be run. You know, the student -- the student loan forgiveness. What about people who took loans and paid them back? What are we going to do? Give them reparations? Are they going to ask for refunds? I mean, where does all of this stop? It isn't going to happen in the first place. That's -- it's all of this is disingenuous and dishonest, and it doesn't get anywhere near the heart of the problems that we are having in this country which I happen to think to revolve around the dissipation of our culture, the dissolution of our society, and so forth. And they are the culprits for this, and they need to be stopped. And this kind of stuff is not their route back. And the fact that they're talking about Joe Biden or crazy Bernie who is leading everybody at this stage, I think is a testament to how bankrupt they actually are."

They are the ones that gave us this entirely totally bogus Steele dossier. For Hillary Clinton, but irony, for Hillary Clinton to be talking about impeaching Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton needs to be investigated, she needs to be indicted, and she needs to be in jail. And many of her co- conspirators in this whole sordid affair which amounted to nothing more than a silent coup to overturn the election results of 2016. Hillary Clinton demanding at Trump? You talk about sour grapes. This is a woman who's been rejected by the American people twice. Rejected by her party in 2008, she had to rig the primaries against crazy Bernie in 2016 to get the nomination. She is the last person who ought to be listened to about what ought to happen to Donald Trump. She hasn't accomplished anything, anywhere near what Donald Trump has accomplished. She is in no position here to sit here and say what she saw in the Mueller report. She can say it, she's an American.

But the Russians -- when Mueller announced the indictments of the Russian troll farm, what action was Rosenstein and without -- and announced him. And nobody pay the attention to this. But he said at the end of the announcement, nothing in these indictments suggests a single vote was changed. Nothing suggests the outcome of any election was changed. No American is named in the indictment having to do with it. But that there was never any evidence for this. There was never -- Mueller never -- when he got the file from Comey, it was empty. All they have was the dossier."

In the Mueller investigation, I believe was actually many things including a cover-up, and a distraction to keep people from understanding what really happened. Donald Trump accomplished one of the greatest achievements of his life against all odds with no assistance. His own party wasn't even that much behind him. He has done something that few Americans will ever do, and they're trying to take it away from him, and they're trying to sully his reputation, simply because they don't like him. This is a sordid situation. I think our country was at great risk during this whole thing, and there needs to be an investigation. I hope the attorney general, serious. Because these people need to be investigated, we need to be told who they are what they did even though we already know. And they need to be indicted.

And I think they're frustrated. They've thrown every weapon they have in their arsenal at Donald Trump, and nothing's worked. Things that they have used over the years that have been readily available to get rid and take out any Republican they want, they have bounced off of Trump. And I think they're really frustrated. The Republican (INAUDIBLE), Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Tucker Carlson, we are not in politics. We are media titans but we're not in politics.

Where is the Republican Party with the celebratory e-mails to their voters, even fundraising or just celebrating the victory? Where are they? You don't hear them? The reason is, Martha, that this is a battle not between the two parties. This is a battle between the Washington establishments, some of the deep state, I call it the administrative state, and outsiders and Americans who feel disenfranchised or unattached, and it's -- the fact that the Republican Party, there's still many people in there just like Mitt Romney says he was sickened. He was sickened by what he read in the Mueller report. This is the same guy, Mitt Romney, who they said didn't care when an employee's wife died of cancer, same guy that they said didn't pay his taxes for ten years, the same guy who they said beat up somebody in prep school, the same guy who said he had a file of nothing but women. They destroyed Mitt Romney and here he is on their side. What does that tell you? It's strange and I think the Republican Party -- I know the first nine months of Trump's term they all thought this Russian stuff was real, they're afraid to get behind him. Now that's gone, there's no reason not to get behind Trump unless you don't like his voters. And that is I think where the key to understanding this is."

He knows people are reluctant to speak. They're going to be respectful and so he anticipates things that they're thinking or wondering about and he will provide answers to things. But mostly it's -- he didn't at any time sit down and tell me what he thought of Mueller or what he thought of this or that. He doesn't -- he can't tell who's going to leave there and speak and who isn't. But it -- that wouldn't -- that wouldn't go along with the recipe for these things which is fun, but he doesn't hide from any of this. I mean, he was telling at lunch after the round, he was telling Lexi about the golden shower story and how as it is and everybody was laughing about it. And the fact that the media believed it, the fact that people actually thought that Trump went to hire some prostitutes to urinate on a bed because Obama had slept in, we're laughing ourselves silly over this as he tells the story.

She certainly knows what that - - what that feels like. Philip Bump today in the -- in the Washington Post says why impeach.

But I think what they're trying to do is gradually drive his numbers down so he's unelectable by the stretch run of the campaign next year. And therefore you don't really have to make a choice.

We've never otherwise had an impeachment. We've now just had a two-year investigation where a federal prosecutor found no crimes against Trump. Now, I know we're going to have this argument about obstruction but we're only having it because Congress has a different standard when they're looking at impeachable offenses than federal prosecutors do.

We initiated about 17 temporary cemeteries and handled about 75,000 dead soldiers, that's American and German because the Germans didn't pick up their dead. So, it was a -- I don't have much time to talk, I understand, so I will just tell you it was a very frightening experience because I was a nervous little kid growing up, trying to get into the air corps. My eyes weren't quite good enough, and so I got put in security registration company as a replacement for the company that was short one guy. So, I ended up over there in England for a couple of months, and then we lost 18 of our guys on an exercise just before the invasion. We had six survivors, lost 18 of our first platoon, and so then we knew there was a war on when we heard that, there was no dry run. And so, then we had a few moments, frightening moments on the way over to Normandy, I almost got torpedoed by a torpedo plane, and a navy gunner shot them down before we could release the torpedo. But that was a big explosion and we're done in a whole sleeping and the ship rocked and rolled, we all went up on deck and find out what happened. Anyway, I was in five campaigns throughout France, Belgium, and Germany, including the Battle of the Bulge, and then we ended up about 100 miles from Berlin, where we had a temporary cemetery there that was disinterred right after Memorial Day. Our government didn't want any cemeteries left over there, no temporary cemeteries, so those bodies had to be disinterred. I know we had German prisoners digging the graves, we had re-identify the remains, and they were putting in boxes and send back to Holland and Belgium. So, --"

      "utterance": "So as White House hopefuls jockeying to position on the Democratic side, one name is surging a bit right now ahead of the pack, and the new polls shows Pete Buttigieg, Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, kind of moving up into a solid third place right now in the first primary states. These are the poles that actually are the most interesting, I think, when you look at New Hampshire, when you look at Ohio -- at Iowa. So, he is in third place at 15 percent right now, trailing only behind the political heavyweights of Bernie Sanders, and just barely, Joe Biden, who is supposedly going to announce later this week. Now Buttigieg garnered attention on the national stage as well, establishing himself as a smooth political operator and one to watch. Watch this."

People susceptible to xenophobia and racism, when they feel out of touch with political environments that they are in, overall, and we better pay attention to that. I would not be running for president today if I hadn't come out. We get that one of the things about scripture is different people see different things in it, but the very least, we should be able to establish that God does not have a political party."

      "utterance": "I do. I don't know that he will have enough to go all the way this time around, but I think the 37- year-old Mayor Pete is a very big talent, and I think you got a taste of that in the clips that you just showed, he is self-possessed, he's confident, he seems thoughtful, he has kind of a different take on Trump. Yes, he thinks he deserves impeachment, but he is not going to urge that on the House or Senate, that's up to them. And then you heard him talk about some reasons why people would feel alienated and might have gone for Trump. And he has repeatedly said, you know, Martha, that he thinks it's more important than attacking Trump for people to try to figure out why so many people voted for him. I think that's a shrewd bit of political analysis, it's the right way to look at this, from the point of view of Democrats. You know, his off-the-cuff responses, Martha, seem to me to be -- you know, signal some real -- you know, he's a very, very good on his feet. I mean, he was asked, he was at a rally in Iowa the other day, I'm sure you saw the clip, where somebody that peeps yelled Sodom and Gomorrah at him, you know, he is gay."

So, look, personally, I have all kinds of disagreements about him on the issues, but I'm just trying to assess him just in terms of pure talent. He seems intelligent to me. He seems knowledgeable. He seems thoughtful. He seems pleasant, somebody you like him. And you got Bernie Sanders out there, he's got a big following, but he seems to make no effort whatever to be pleasant or likable. Buttigieg seems to me to be likable."

Look, I don't think that was -- when Pete Buttigieg went after Mike Pence who had, you know, they were both in Indiana when Pence was governor. And they had a good relationship, and Pence had praised Buttigieg and called him patriot or whatever. And then he went after Pence. I think he was trying to purchase himself a little bit of victim status, which doesn't hurt when you're a Democrat. I think it was a bad moment for him. I think the question that he got there was inevitable, and I don't think he had a good answer. But I think, I mean, to the substance of the question, but I think the answer he gave there was pretty darn clever."
