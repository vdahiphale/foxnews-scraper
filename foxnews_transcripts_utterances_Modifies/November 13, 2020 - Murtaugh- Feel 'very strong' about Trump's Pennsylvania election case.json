It is not over until it is over, especially with so many questions about ballot security and frankly, a number of questions about the election software program involving dominions still swirling about and so sources here at the White House say listen, take it easy, we're going to keep working our way through this process.  However they want to work their way through the courts but the courts have not been a safe haven for the numerous challenges issued by the campaign in fact they've been a few setbacks including in Pennsylvania and Michigan and there have also been a couple of withdrawals in places like Nevada and Arizona.   So the question now becomes can the campaign prove or at least convince the court that that was enough fraud to make a difference in the states that were closed on election night and did Dominion software change ballots for example and were there thousands of ballots cast unlawfully in this election or is there sufficient evidence again to convince a judge at say the federal level that the counts need to be examined or better yet fully audited? White House officials tell me they are checking every lead and that's the right thing to do, not just for this race but for the integrity of our elections, moving forward.",

The appeals court in Philadelphia has denied five of your claims here regarding your campaign's claims there, regarding the election meaning that those campaign, those votes are going to stand. Your reaction.  TIM MURTAUGH, DIR OF COMMUNICATIONS; TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Those are just individual claims with local boards of elections in counties and we were arguing that those ballots were defective. This is not part of our larger case in Pennsylvania where we're arguing that it was unconstitutionally applied. Depending on where you were in the state, if you were a voter in Philadelphia versus being a voter in a more rural county, you were treated differently during that election. That's a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment John. In Philadelphia for example, people who voted by mail and then they had defects in their ballots, either they didn't sign the envelope, they didn't have a date on it, didn't have a date of birth on it, things like that.  The local elections people called those voters and said come on in and cast a provisional ballot just in case your other one gets kicked out. People who voted in other parts of the state did not receive those phone calls that is unequal treatment based on where you live in Pennsylvania. That is an unconstitutional violation of the Equal Protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. So those cases that you're talking about, those are individual fights over ballots at the county level, it's not connected to our overall case which we feel very, very strongly about.  Also, in Pennsylvania there almost 700,000 ballots that got counted while our observers were not able to be there with meaningful access to watch and so all of those ballots are an issue to. Well mania there almost 700000 ballots that got counted while our observers were not able to be there with meaningful access to watch and so all of those ballots are an issue too and we're going to be asking for the state not to certify the election until all of those things are resolved.",

People sworn affidavits under the penalty of perjury, they saw stacks of ballots being fed into the scanners, multiple times, being counted 3,4 and 5 times over and over again.  Batches of ballots that all bore the same signatures. These are not just irregularities. These are votes being wrongfully and illegally counted multiple times. We absolutely know they are going to be able to find these things. In Georgia, for example, we're going to be able to find felons who voted, illegal aliens who voted. We're going to be able to do signature matching to make sure that the voters who actually voted were the people who are registered to vote. We're going to be able to detect illegal ballots harvesting in Georgia which is you know, the concept in this country is one person one vote, it is not one person and as many votes as you can carry and so we're going to be weeding out those things so we have great confidence in our recount in Georgia, in our legal case in Pennsylvania and what we have filed in Michigan and we are absolutely - absolutely still pursuing this thing.

It also was concerning that we allow Dominion to have such a strong impact on the election process and the concerns about Dominion aren't just Republican concerns. As a matter of fact, in December of 2019, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden and Amy Klobuchar sent letters expressing their concerns with Dominion's propensity to potentially switch the result of a cast ballot. And so I think we should just have a bipartisan look at this and however the result comes down, we'll move forward. One thing I won't to do is delegitimize a president, the way the Democrats did President Trump the last four years if Joe Biden is ultimately deemed the winner, I'm sure that we'll recognize him as the president.

Of course we should make sure there's no fraud but almost everything Tim Murtaugh just said, almost everything Donald Trump has said about this election is not true. There is no evidence of widespread fraud and what's so dangerous about it is that Donald Trump is trying to convince his supporters that the election was stolen from him, that it was illegitimate when in fact it was not. That is very concerning for a moment in our country when we are so divided and there are real world implications to this. Right now Joe Biden should be receiving his intelligence briefing as the president elect. We know that he needs to be ready on Day 1 to confront the threats were facing because Donald Trump won't recognize the math that is sitting in front of him because he's encouraging his administration not to participate in the transition yet. That isn't happening. He is hampering Joe Biden's ability to be president on Day 1 and that's why John Kelly, Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff came out today and said exactly that, said that the Joe Biden needs to have access to this information for national security and public health reasons to fight COVID.",

But what we're not here for are payments to illegal aliens, payments that would not be able to be properly traced and permanent changes to our voting system so if we have open amendments to actually legislate, we would have a sincere effort to come to some agreement on behalf of the country but the tell for Speaker Pelosi is that this isn't really a sincere effort, she won't let us offer amendments. She just wants to use coronavirus to try to bludgeon Republicans but that didn't really work as Marie noted on this very network. There were problems for Democrats down ballot and I think that their unwillingness to engage in sincere negotiation and discussion for coronavirus relief package in the weeks leading up to the election probably didn't help them in a lot of those swing districts, specially in Orange County where it looks like Republicans just continue to flip seats.",

One, having the vaccine and therapeutics out to urban and rural areas alike. I saw a disturbing story this morning on one rival network of this network saying that rich people in this country have been in on getting the vaccine first. I hope that is not true and I hope that Joe Biden and trusted Joe Biden his team will stop that. And two, they want an economic recovery that will propel every American forward. I think when politicians lose sight of the very basics, and I would argue that what's going to happen in Georgia, Republican or Democrats winning those Senate races, will pivot and revolve around which party, which candidates are able to suggest and confirm to the American people that they are ready to do these things for them.

And that is with the current president and the current administration is to work together through this transition period so that do we do not waste 68 days fighting this pandemic. We've got to get it under control. The economy is dependent upon that, actually our standing in the world is dependent upon that. And going into the next administration, which I'm confident will be the Biden administration, we need to not lose the next 68 days. But rather to make progress along the way and there's all of the things that have been discussed, the transition period, the stonewalling by the current administration hopefully that will change in the next few days. But (AUDIO GAP) directly relates to the economy and going forward, Mr. Ford, Congresswoman Ford was so correct. It's what do we do with a Democratic president, Democratic House and a slim Republican majority in the Senate. Can we really deal with this pandemic and get the economy going? The answer in my mind is yes. If we follow what Biden has laid out. Can we rebuild the infrastructure? Yes. Can we deal with climate change? Yes. All of those programs have been laid out by Biden during the campaign and then the days since the election. If we do that in coordination with the Republicans, no, we're not going to get everything we want on the Democratic side, we understand that. But we know that these are critical issues that we need to move forward on. And by the way, could someday please tell me just what among any of those issues is socialism? None of them. Not one of them. But they are critical issues in which we must address. The critical problems facing not only our country but this entire world.",

It is not over until it is over, especially with so many questions about ballot security and frankly, a number of questions about the election software program involving dominions still swirling about and so sources here at the White House say listen, take it easy, we're going to keep working our way through this process. However they want to work their way through the courts but the courts have not been a safe haven for the numerous challenges issued by the campaign in fact they've been a few setbacks including in Pennsylvania and Michigan and there have also been a couple of withdrawals in places like Nevada and Arizona. So the question now becomes can the campaign prove or at least convince the court that that was enough fraud to make a difference in the states that were closed on election night and did Dominion software change ballots for example and were there thousands of ballots cast unlawfully in this election or is there sufficient evidence again to convince a judge at say the federal level that the counts need to be examined or better yet fully audited? White House officials tell me they are checking every lead and that's the right thing to do, not just for this race but for the integrity of our elections, moving forward."

The appeals court in Philadelphia has denied five of your claims here regarding your campaign's claims there, regarding the election meaning that those campaign, those votes are going to stand. Your reaction. TIM MURTAUGH, DIR OF COMMUNICATIONS; TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: Those are just individual claims with local boards of elections in counties and we were arguing that those ballots were defective. This is not part of our larger case in Pennsylvania where we're arguing that it was unconstitutionally applied. Depending on where you were in the state, if you were a voter in Philadelphia versus being a voter in a more rural county, you were treated differently during that election. That's a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment John. In Philadelphia for example, people who voted by mail and then they had defects in their ballots, either they didn't sign the envelope, they didn't have a date on it, didn't have a date of birth on it, things like that. The local elections people called those voters and said come on in and cast a provisional ballot just in case your other one gets kicked out. People who voted in other parts of the state did not receive those phone calls that is unequal treatment based on where you live in Pennsylvania. That is an unconstitutional violation of the Equal Protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. So those cases that you're talking about, those are individual fights over ballots at the county level, it's not connected to our overall case which we feel very, very strongly about. Also, in Pennsylvania there almost 700,000 ballots that got counted while our observers were not able to be there with meaningful access to watch and so all of those ballots are an issue to. Well mania there almost 700000 ballots that got counted while our observers were not able to be there with meaningful access to watch and so all of those ballots are an issue too and we're going to be asking for the state not to certify the election until all of those things are resolved."

Our people were ejected from those rooms. Their view was obstructed. They were made - when they were allowed back in, they were made to stand 25 or 50 feet away. SOME of our people had the use binoculars to try to see what was going on at the count tables and we have done a calculation and during those hours where we did not have people in the rooms in Philadelphia and in Pittsburgh, almost 700,000 ballots were counted at that time. They were improperly counted, they were not witnessed and that's against the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania so we absolutely believe that if we can review those, the president can make up the gap and actually win Pennsylvania. Yes."

People sworn affidavits under the penalty of perjury, they saw stacks of ballots being fed into the scanners, multiple times, being counted 3,4 and 5 times over and over again. Batches of ballots that all bore the same signatures. These are not just irregularities. These are votes being wrongfully and illegally counted multiple times. We absolutely know they are going to be able to find these things. In Georgia, for example, we're going to be able to find felons who voted, illegal aliens who voted. We're going to be able to do signature matching to make sure that the voters who actually voted were the people who are registered to vote. We're going to be able to detect illegal ballots harvesting in Georgia which is you know, the concept in this country is one person one vote, it is not one person and as many votes as you can carry and so we're going to be weeding out those things so we have great confidence in our recount in Georgia, in our legal case in Pennsylvania and what we have filed in Michigan and we are absolutely - absolutely still pursuing this thing. The idea is that we want to count every legal vote and not count the illegal votes."

Your thoughts on that, Matt."

      "speaker": "REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL)",
      "utterance": "Oh, we will have a certification of the Electoral College in this election and when that happens, we'll have a peaceful transition power. I am concerned about the voter fraud and I'm glad President Trump is fighting against it even if it's not enough to impact the outcome of an election in one state, it pollutes the legal votes of all of us when tens of thousands of people have signified an intent to change their address in the national change of address database and yet, they're still voting in their states. It also was concerning that we allow Dominion to have such a strong impact on the election process and the concerns about Dominion aren't just Republican concerns. As a matter of fact, in December of 2019, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden and Amy Klobuchar sent letters expressing their concerns with Dominion's propensity to potentially switch the result of a cast ballot. And so I think we should just have a bipartisan look at this and however the result comes down, we'll move forward. One thing I won't to do is delegitimize a president, the way the Democrats did President Trump the last four years if Joe Biden is ultimately deemed the winner, I'm sure that we'll recognize him as the president. I'm also pretty sure that Donald J. Trump will be running against him in 2024."

He has won five states that Donald Trump won in 2016 and what is so dangerous Jon isn't just this idea that we should make sure there was no fraud. Of course we should make sure there's no fraud but almost everything Tim Murtaugh just said, almost everything Donald Trump has said about this election is not true. There is no evidence of widespread fraud and what's so dangerous about it is that Donald Trump is trying to convince his supporters that the election was stolen from him, that it was illegitimate when in fact it was not. That is very concerning for a moment in our country when we are so divided and there are real world implications to this. Right now Joe Biden should be receiving his intelligence briefing as the president elect. We know that he needs to be ready on Day 1 to confront the threats were facing because Donald Trump won't recognize the math that is sitting in front of him because he's encouraging his administration not to participate in the transition yet. That isn't happening. He is hampering Joe Biden's ability to be president on Day 1 and that's why John Kelly, Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff came out today and said exactly that, said that the Joe Biden needs to have access to this information for national security and public health reasons to fight COVID."

But what we're not here for are payments to illegal aliens, payments that would not be able to be properly traced and permanent changes to our voting system so if we have open amendments to actually legislate, we would have a sincere effort to come to some agreement on behalf of the country but the tell for Speaker Pelosi is that this isn't really a sincere effort, she won't let us offer amendments. She just wants to use coronavirus to try to bludgeon Republicans but that didn't really work as Marie noted on this very network. There were problems for Democrats down ballot and I think that their unwillingness to engage in sincere negotiation and discussion for coronavirus relief package in the weeks leading up to the election probably didn't help them in a lot of those swing districts, specially in Orange County where it looks like Republicans just continue to flip seats."

Why did we learn about this six days after the election and why did the Biden staff according to Biden's statement know about this on Sunday, five days after the election when Secretary Alex Azar said he found out about it through the media the next day. And also, if there was a 90 plus percent efficacy in the 94 cases that they read out, there certainly would have been a greater than 50 percent efficacy in the 32 and 64 cases which would have been looked at an interim analysis weeks prior. The Pfizer CEO sold 62 percent of his stock, the day of the announcement and Lily also had a very funny story of announcing the antibody therapy was extremely effective, reducing hospitalizations by 70 percent after the FDA authorized it, after it was shipped out.

So you put the data points together, people wonder if there's been political interference with the normal scientific process, there has been but it's not been in favor of President Trump, it's gone the other direction."

Now you can't say with a 100 percent certainty but to have anything be more than 90 percent and they didn't say 90 percent efficacy, they said - Pfizer said greater than 90 percent efficacious. For it to be that effective and that announcement to come, that late, certainly the interim analysis would have shown a greater than 50 percent efficacy rate.

My neighbors got, he put up his house for rent. Some scammers found out he's got a dozen cards in here. Dozen, what do call these, debit cards, Mike? Debit cards. For unemployment. Man, this is screwed. We need unemployment, we need some stimulus, we don't have any money. The working people are being overtaxed and what are we going to do? Leadership.

Right now, Republicans have picked up ten, probably 15 seats. Now I love that Nancy Pelosi has tried to put a smile on her really slim majority. But what happens is, Republicans ran against socialism, defund the police, open borders, and ran against a party that is in favor of big business of Wall Street banks, of billionaire, of big tech. And Republicans are working for the working men and women of America. And I think that that message carried the day. And Jon, that's with Democrats spending tens of millions of more dollars against Republicans in many of these hotly contested seats. Republicans had less money and still won. Not only that, Democrats were supposed to pick up all of these state chambers, Senate for assemblies across the country. They didn't pick up one state chamber. This was a total drumming of the Democrat Party in this last election."

      "utterance": "first, thanks for having me on. I think that either party that tries to view the results from last week is some sort of referendum on what may happen in 2022. It's behaving foolishly, unproductively and not listening to the American people. I think the two things that the American people said the most loudly and clearly last week was that they want a political class in the Washington class of politicians who will focus on two things. One, having the vaccine and therapeutics out to urban and rural areas alike. I saw a disturbing story this morning on one rival network of this network saying that rich people in this country have been in on getting the vaccine first. I hope that is not true and I hope that Joe Biden and trusted Joe Biden his team will stop that. And two, they want an economic recovery that will propel every American forward. I think when politicians lose sight of the very basics, and I would argue that what's going to happen in Georgia, Republican or Democrats winning those Senate races, will pivot and revolve around which party, which candidates are able to suggest and confirm to the American people that they are ready to do these things for them. So, I'm not willing to predict what will happen in two years. I know that's what we do and what I used to do and what political people do in Washington, but I think that's the wrong way to look at it. Let's look at what people want now and try to deliver for them."

And we have a new president. The country is right down the middle and I contend what I started with. The people want answers and they want relief."

The Post writes, the thinking behind the move was that it would be a way for Biden to highlight the importance of that position in his administration and that placing her there would raise the prestige of the U.N. itself at a time when global cooperation and the U.S. role on the world stage, has ebbed.

However, the great part (AUDIO GAP) precisely this, who is going to get what positions? And that will play out over the next six months maybe even into the next 12 months. In any case, Clinton certainly is a skilled individual. She certainly knows the international scene and she is quite right about the United States standing around the world. We've suffered mightily over the last four years and our relationships with our allies are end with others. So, yes, we do need to rebuild that and it will take a strong team to do that."

And that is with the current president and the current administration is to work together through this transition period so that do we do not waste 68 days fighting this pandemic. We've got to get it under control. The economy is dependent upon that, actually our standing in the world is dependent upon that. And going into the next administration, which I'm confident will be the Biden administration, we need to not lose the next 68 days. But rather to make progress along the way and there's all of the things that have been discussed, the transition period, the stonewalling by the current administration hopefully that will change in the next few days. But (AUDIO GAP) directly relates to the economy and going forward, Mr. Ford, Congresswoman Ford was so correct. It's what do we do with a Democratic president, Democratic House and a slim Republican majority in the Senate. Can we really deal with this pandemic and get the economy going? The answer in my mind is yes. If we follow what Biden has laid out. Can we rebuild the infrastructure? Yes. Can we deal with climate change? Yes. All of those programs have been laid out by Biden during the campaign and then the days since the election. If we do that in coordination with the Republicans, no, we're not going to get everything we want on the Democratic side, we understand that. But we know that these are critical issues that we need to move forward on. And by the way, could someday please tell me just what among any of those issues is socialism? None of them. Not one of them. But they are critical issues in which we must address. The critical problems facing not only our country but this entire world."
