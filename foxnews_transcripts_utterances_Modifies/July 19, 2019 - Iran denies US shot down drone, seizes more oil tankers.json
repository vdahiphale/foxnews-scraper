As you take a look at a map, it's a critical area, critical region where a lot of tankers go through. This British tanker, the Stena Impero, captured essentially by Iranian Revolutionary Guard in swift boats. The British foreign secretary saying they are extremely concerned. The seizures are completely unacceptable. And obviously this is in addition to the tensions we have already seen in the region.  So what now? Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times\" and author of the new book \"Still Winning, Why America Went All In on Donald Trump and Why We Must Do It Again,\" Anna Palmer, senior Washington correspondent for \"Politico,\" and Jonah Goldberg, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. All right, Jonah, obviously this is an escalation. It's a continuation, but it's tense.",

The thing is Iran was a bad actor when it was under the deal, too. My friend Eli Lake at \"Bloomberg\" makes this point. He said in the 1990s we used to criticize Bill Clinton, at least conservatives used to criticize Bill Clinton for what we called cruise missile diplomacy. But cruise missile diplomacy actually was very effective in terms of boxing in Iraq when it was a bad actor, boxing in other places when they were bad actors.  I don't think anybody wants to go to war, but the United States has an enormous ability to project power, to make life more difficult for Iran than Iran can make for us in order to push them to getting a better deal. And I think it may just be a while of this kind of thing, of brinksmanship and tit for tat, and that's better than a war, and it's better than letting them have a nuclear weapon.",

And then when you have complete pirates of the high seas, that is not very popular in the global community.   But the other thing that I think is interesting is the fact that Iran is denying that there drone was even shot down. That to me suggests -- they know that the United States knows. They know that the allies know whether or not -- they are producing evidence that the drone was shot down. And so it makes me wonder, are they not -- is that not a message intended for their own people? And if it is a message intended for their own people, it suggests that maybe they really are in a lot more trouble than maybe even we realize domestically.",

There is something about that going on in Iran as well, and it's a tension -- I don't think. I would love it if we had some spontaneous democratic uprising there. I think that is probably unlikely for the foreseeable future, but if you did have more and more discontent, that would be another reason for putting pressure on the regime there.

I don't agree with a word that comes out of her mouth, but she got elected by constituents in her district.

This British tanker, the Stena Impero, captured essentially by Iranian Revolutionary Guard in swift boats. The British foreign secretary saying they are extremely concerned. The seizures are completely unacceptable. And obviously this is in addition to the tensions we have already seen in the region. So what now? Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times\" and author of the new book \"Still Winning, Why America Went All In on Donald Trump and Why We Must Do It Again,\" Anna Palmer, senior Washington correspondent for \"Politico,\" and Jonah Goldberg, fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

The thing is Iran was a bad actor when it was under the deal, too. My friend Eli Lake at \"Bloomberg\" makes this point. He said in the 1990s we used to criticize Bill Clinton, at least conservatives used to criticize Bill Clinton for what we called cruise missile diplomacy. But cruise missile diplomacy actually was very effective in terms of boxing in Iraq when it was a bad actor, boxing in other places when they were bad actors. I don't think anybody wants to go to war, but the United States has an enormous ability to project power, to make life more difficult for Iran than Iran can make for us in order to push them to getting a better deal. And I think it may just be a while of this kind of thing, of brinksmanship and tit for tat, and that's better than a war, and it's better than letting them have a nuclear weapon."

But this latest of taking the oil tankers, that is not succeeding at doing that. If anything, it drives -- it takes the wedge out and drives them together. And then when you have complete pirates of the high seas, that is not very popular in the global community. But the other thing that I think is interesting is the fact that Iran is denying that there drone was even shot down. That to me suggests -- they know that the United States knows. They know that the allies know whether or not -- they are producing evidence that the drone was shot down. And so it makes me wonder, are they not -- is that not a message intended for their own people? And if it is a message intended for their own people, it suggests that maybe they really are in a lot more trouble than maybe even we realize domestically."

The problem is, it is a little bit like China. There is a rule of thumb in China that the Communist Party is more afraid of the people than the people are of the Communist Party. There is something about that going on in Iran as well, and it's a tension -- I don't think. I would love it if we had some spontaneous democratic uprising there. I think that is probably unlikely for the foreseeable future, but if you did have more and more discontent, that would be another reason for putting pressure on the regime there.

The squad, as they call themselves, they are not backing down.

I don't agree with a word that comes out of her mouth, but she got elected by constituents in her district. And you can make the argument that attacking her for degrading America and degrading American values, which I think she does, without getting into -- without getting quite as ugly as things have gotten.
