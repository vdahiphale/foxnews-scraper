They don't want this green policy agenda, they don't want these liberal crazy policies, which have frankly opened up our southern border, have created the gas lines like the leader has talked about, like the whip has talked about, excuse me, Steve, don't want to give you a promotion quite yet because you're going to get it soon.

Joe Biden is talking about giving away not just the vaccine, but the entire technology, the mRNA technology to China for free. You are talking about intellectual property theft from China, Joe Biden is going to give it to China. He inherited the hottest economy we've ever seen. He's talking about raising taxes right now that would kill middle-class jobs. And oh, by the way, Laura, today there's over 8 million job openings and Joe Biden is paying people, borrowing from our kids to pay people not to work.

It will be a wipeout for the Republicans against the Democrats. It often is when the Republican is able to win in an off-year election, as happened in 2009.

You really can forget freedom if you don't fight to reclaim it. You just get used to it. While 72 percent of the country says they are still going to socially distance even when they get the vaccine, at least for six months, according to that recent full. I read that and I almost fell over."

So a lot of these rules and regulations, they don't make sense. I think people are ready to live their lives again. I was in New York City earlier this week. It felt so different, felt so dreary. People seemed depressed there. Here everyone is happy, living life, enjoying life, because life is meant to be lived."

And speaking of the mask issue, the CDC's big announcement today was heralded by Biden as a big win, but what science is clear now that wasn't clear a month ago, and for many of us like a year ago. Why doesn't this go far enough? Dr. Jay Bhattacharya is here next. He's going to answer those questions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Did you see this today? Biden and the poodles in the media, they want you to think that it's somehow a huge victory that the CDC is now saying that if you're vaccinated, you can actually drop your mask, OK. But here is my question. Has the science really changed in the last month? Of course, it hasn't. In fact, it was just a couple of days ago, right, that Fauci was spewing his usual nonsense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, BIDEN CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER",
      "utterance": "I think people have gotten used to the fact that wearing masks clearly, if you look at the data, diminishes respiratory diseases. We have had practically a nonexistent flu season this year merely because people we're doing the kinds of public health things that were directed predominately against COVID-19."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It's completely false. Here is what the CDC own research says. CDC is not aware of any randomized controlled trials that show that masks or double masks, or a clothed face coverings are effective against COVID- 19. That is in response to a FOIA request of the CDC. Joining me now, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Stanford University professor of medicine and epidemiology. Dr. Bhattacharya, this mask thing has been a charade from almost day one. Fauci actually was right the first time he said that it might make people feel a little better, maybe a little around the edges, but that wasn't going to be a key tool in ending the pandemic. So what about this new announcement today?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. JAY BHATTACHARYA, STANFORD UNIVERSITY EPIDEMIOLOGIST",
      "utterance": "In a sense it was a good first step, but I have no idea why it's taken this long. They should have told people that are vaccinated that they didn't need the mask to begin with. It's amazing. And as a result, they created vaccine hesitancy. They signaled through their behaviors and their words that the vaccines don't work by saying we'll keep wearing masks. So I'm glad they finally did this, and I hope states and businesses take it to heart and get rid of these mask requirements that have done very little good to slow the spread of the disease."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We've seen kids under the age of 10, I believe, in France never had to wear masks. Sweden, they never mandated masks. Texas, when they dropped their mask mandate, they didn't see any increase in cases. South Dakota never had a mask mandate. So the mask mandate versus non-mask, they showed no difference in the transmission in the states. But Fauci, by the way, still thinks that kids should not really be able to enjoy life unmasked. Watch."

      "speaker": "DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, BIDEN CHIEF MEDICAL ADVISER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Dr. Bhattacharya, is there any real scientific proof that supports Fauci's recommendation that kids would still be in masks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BHATTACHARYA",
      "utterance": "No, there is not. Kids spread the disease very inefficiently. Thank God for that. We don't fully understand why, but it's absolutely true. Lots of scientific evidence backs that up. And furthermore, you'll have to balance the potential benefits, which are very low, against the harms to kids. Masking kids potentially harms their emotional and social development. It does not make sense to mask children. We should not be asking them to do that, especially when adults everywhere are going to be taking their masks off as a result of the vaccination campaigns. I think the problem is in public health messaging, when you go far outside what the science is actually saying, you make these confusing kinds of orders, people will stop trusting public health. It has real consequences."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "No one believes them. When people say the CDC says, it's not exactly considered the good housekeeping seal of approval anymore, Dr. Bhattacharya. There is a medical analyst, Leana Wen, over at CNN, who thinks that vaccinated people not wearing masks is somehow extremist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "I was shocked by this announcement. I think they went from one extreme to another, and the major step that's missing here is how do we know that people are telling the truth? Who is going to be checking to see if others are also vaccinated? So what does that mean, if I'm bringing my son, my four-year-old who is not fully vaccinated, now he's going to be in a grocery store potentially exposed to people who are not vaccinated who could be of danger to him."

      "speaker": "BHATTACHARYA",
      "utterance": "It's just bad public health messaging. She's spreading fear were it doesn't belong. Children are incredibly low risk for bad outcomes from this disease. More children died of the flu last year than died of COVID. It's not close. I just don't understand the thinking behind that. If you are an adult and you are scared of COVID and you haven't had COVID before, get vaccinated and you don't have to worry about other people around you being vaccinated or not. If your child is not really at high risk from severe disease from COVID, don't spread fear to your children where it doesn't belong."
