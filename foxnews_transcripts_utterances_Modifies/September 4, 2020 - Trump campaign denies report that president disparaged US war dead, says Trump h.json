      "sentences": "Hey, Bret, thank you. A short time ago, President Trump giving a full-throated denial of a report in \"The Atlantic\" that he made disparaging comments about those who serve in our nation's military.   It's just a continuation of the witch hunt so that it can hopefully affect the election. But the American people are too smart. You look at what I've done for the United States military. I love those people. I've gotten them pay raises when they didn't get anything near what I've been able to do. And I've rebuilt $2.5 trillion I've rebuilt the United States military.  The pushback against the report, which cites unnamed sources who claim the President called American soldiers killed in combat during World War I \"suckers and losers\" is getting significant pushback tonight. Several members of his staff who were present on the 2018 trip when those comments purportedly were made, flatly deny them, with one slamming the story as being, quote, \"dropped just as the President begins to campaign and surge.\"  And a senior White House official telling the \"Washington Examiner\" the President was, quote, \"livid\" when he was unable to attend the military ceremony due to bad weather, contrary to the reports claimed that he didn't want to go, and didn't think it was important. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton, a man who wrote an entire book keeping scorn on President Trump, told Fox News this today.    Pete, you have tweeted some pretty strong words about the article about the President today in \"The Atlantic.\" You wrote, \"There are no words for how disgusting and dishonorable this is.\" My question to you is, how do you know it's accurate? How do you know it's true?",

When he was a young man, he faked a disability so he could avoid serving when it was his turn. We've watched him refer to prisoners of war like John McCain as losers with our own eyes. Look, if you're watching this at home, here is how willing Donald Trump is to insult your intelligence. Today, he denied that he ever called John McCain a loser. Now, again, if you're watching this at home, grab your phone, go on Google, you can see video of him doing it, you can see a tweet of him doing it.   So I think it's pretty easy to figure out who to believe. And indeed again, I'm looking at the Internet right now, Fox News itself has confirmed many of the details of this story. So, here's the bottom line. The President thinks people who play by the rules or people who sacrifice for others are suckers. He thinks people who pay their taxes are suckers. He seems to think Christians are suckers. He'll just hold up the Bible as a prop without ever seeming to look into it. This is part of a clear, consistent, repeated pattern of behavior, although I will say, these revelations about just how much this President disrespects the military do represent a new look (ph).  SCOTT: There are five current and former members of the White House staff, though, who say they were with the President that day and that nothing of the kind ever happened.

And you had a cut on there from John Bolton, who obviously is no great fan of the President these days. He said if he had heard the President say those things, he would have written an entire chapter in his book about it.   But here's what's actually going on. I don't know what happened to journalism where they've got these four anonymous sources. They won't come forward and put their names on it, but \"The Atlantic\" is happy to run the story. And it happens to come out exactly at the moment where Joe Biden is in free fall in the polls.  If you want to know what's true about the military, look at what President Trump has done. He's rebuilt the military that he inherited in a decimated state from Obama and Biden. That's exactly what happened. And when Biden was Vice President, the scandals in the VA were tremendous and heartbreaking. People were waiting months, even years, on waiting lists, dying on the waiting list, left to die on gurneys in the hallway. And that's what President Trump cleaned up. Now the veterans are getting the care they deserve, and that's how the President shows his reverence for military veterans. He has built the American military back up to where it should be, and it's standing as the mightiest in the world, and he has restored veterans' faith in the healthcare they receive, getting better access, better choices, and better treatment. That is how President Trump approaches the military. He shows his respect and reverence for members of the military every single day. And this story was dropped. By the way, this was already handled two years ago, right after the Paris trip. It was fake then. It's fake now. It's being repackaged, regurgitated, old news that has already been debunked because Joe Biden is an enormous trouble and his allies in the media are pushing this.",

He interrupted everything and came out of his basement for once to have an above-ground excursion to go make a speech in Pittsburgh the other day. And he actually said these words. \"Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters?\"  Now, why would any candidate for any office ever say such a thing? Well, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you why, Jon. It's because, to most Americans, he looks like a radical socialist who does have a soft spot for rioters. That's Joe Biden's big problem, and that's why he's coming out now, because he knows that it is sticking to him. He is a tool of the radical left who is afraid to stand up to the antipolice wing of his party, and Americans don't like it.

With us now, Victor Davis Hanson, a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and author of \"The Case for Trump.\" Victor, you say that essentially we should throw out everything that we have heard or read about the polls and the election up until now because you think everything basically resets after Labor Day, which is, after all, this coming Monday. VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW AT HOOVER INSTITUTION & AUTHOR OF \"THE CASE FOR TRUMP\": Yes, I think so. I think Trump will point to the Emerson poll, the Zogby Poll, the Rasmussen poll, and others, and say, and the Trump tabular poll, and say in the state level and national level, he is about even come a pretty good record in 2016, and Biden will try to reassure himself with a Reuters or Politico, the traditional polls that show him ahead. But it doesn't really matter what we say or what they say, it's with the reality is, and you can tell by the internal polling on both sides that they are getting out and waging a traditional campaign. It's no longer going to be a Zoom campaign, and the Biden strategy of the last 90 days, by his own admission, is no longer operable, it's inert. So he is coming out now and he's going to have to have tarmac rallies, he's going to have -- I don't think the scripted interviews are going to have a very long shelf life, they are not genuine. He's going to have to have regular press conferences. There's going to be debates, he's not going to get out of that.  Nancy Pelosi's ruse did not work, and the issues have been re -- they're recalibrated. Nobody is talking about the violence and the context as they did in June and July about George Floyd. Tragically so, it's now anarchy and chaos and whether you are going to condemn it unequivocally. And that's going to be the issue. And the virus is not any longer, as it was in May and June, did Cuomo do this or that, or do we do not as well as Germany but better than the U.K.? But it's what's the status of the virus over the next 60 days? Is it waxing, is it waning, are there better treatments, is there vaccination in the short term? And is it going to end? And the same thing with the lockdown. It's no longer Nancy Pelosi's hairdresser and this, it's our 50 million kids going to go back to school quicker or later? And the same thing with the economy. It's not a question that it crashed, it's coming back, it's just a question of how fast. So, these are going to be September and October issues. The polls, the beggars in Vegas have us about even, and we are not going to have a virtual campaign anymore, and I think it's going to be very unpredictable, very wild, but very exciting, too.",

Who has been doing that the longest? And the voters will make their decision on that basis. And they are not isolated, extraneous issues. They are connected because people know if you can't go downtown or your shopping center is inoperative or you are afraid to go out in your car, then you are not going to get back economically. And so that shows you they want to go back to normal and take some measurable risk with COVID, but they can't do it if there is not order in the streets, so the two issues reflect and they enhance each other, and I think in both cases it favors Trump. And I will be the first to say that the Zoom virtual candidacy of Biden, 90 days in his basement, given some cognitive issues he's had, was ideal for him, and that's, I think that was reflected in his poll leads, which I think was genuine, but I don't think that's true any longer. I think it backfired. I think maybe after 30 or 40 days, he should have gotten out and preemptively weighed in on these riots and looting and arson before it's too late. But as I said, he is kind of a prisoner of his own paradox, he's made a devil bargain with the hard left and it's very hard for him to unequivocally condemn them.

You see it in the unemployment numbers that came out today. While the unemployment numbers for the America -- for the American people has ticked down to 8.4 percent, for African Americans, that number still sits at 13 percent unemployment. This is happening in big cities. This is happening in rural communities, and this is all happening under Donald Trump's watch. He is the person who says he is the best president for African Americans, but if you look at the numbers, the numbers don't say that.

Because when I'm out on the streets and I have my campaign team talking to people, there a lot of black people that are afraid to even admit that they support Trump, or even myself, because of the backlash. Look, Joe Biden, I understand he's got a tough road ahead of him. He has to act as if he actually cares about black Americans, even though he hasn't and he has proven that he hasn't for 50 years, but I understand that he has to do that now, but it's not going to sell, right? This is a guy, President Trump has been here for four years and has done much more, and I understand that Joe Biden is going to, you know, he's going to push and fight all he wants.

The Thurston County sheriff said the team was surveilling Reinoehl at an apartment in Lacey, Washington about two hours north of Portland, when Reinoehl came out of the apartment yesterday and got into a car.

A short time ago, President Trump giving a full-throated denial of a report in \"The Atlantic\" that he made disparaging comments about those who serve in our nation's military. It's just a continuation of the witch hunt so that it can hopefully affect the election. But the American people are too smart. You look at what I've done for the United States military. I love those people. I've gotten them pay raises when they didn't get anything near what I've been able to do. And I've rebuilt $2.5 trillion I've rebuilt the United States military. The pushback against the report, which cites unnamed sources who claim the President called American soldiers killed in combat during World War I \"suckers and losers\" is getting significant pushback tonight. Several members of his staff who were present on the 2018 trip when those comments purportedly were made, flatly deny them, with one slamming the story as being, quote, \"dropped just as the President begins to campaign and surge.\" And a senior White House official telling the \"Washington Examiner\" the President was, quote, \"livid\" when he was unable to attend the military ceremony due to bad weather, contrary to the reports claimed that he didn't want to go, and didn't think it was important. Former National Security Advisor John Bolton, a man who wrote an entire book keeping scorn on President Trump, told Fox News this today. Pete, you have tweeted some pretty strong words about the article about the President today in \"The Atlantic.\" You wrote, \"There are no words for how disgusting and dishonorable this is.\" My question to you is, how do you know it's accurate? How do you know it's true?"

When he was a young man, he faked a disability so he could avoid serving when it was his turn. We've watched him refer to prisoners of war like John McCain as losers with our own eyes. Look, if you're watching this at home, here is how willing Donald Trump is to insult your intelligence. Today, he denied that he ever called John McCain a loser. Now, again, if you're watching this at home, grab your phone, go on Google, you can see video of him doing it, you can see a tweet of him doing it."

He seems to think Christians are suckers. He'll just hold up the Bible as a prop without ever seeming to look into it. This is part of a clear, consistent, repeated pattern of behavior, although I will say, these revelations about just how much this President disrespects the military do represent a new look (ph).  SCOTT",

Now, maybe they're using weasel words, saying it's because of bad weather, because if he didn't want to go because the weather would have messed up his hair, then I guess technically, you could say it's because of bad weather. But the bottom line is, if he wanted to be there, he would have been there. Look, this is a lot bigger than whether the President went to a ceremony or not. This is a fundamental disrespect that we have seen the President show. We've seen it with our own eyes in the statements he's made in public. It just turns out that we've got a lot of people from inside the administration willing to reveal that behind the scenes it's even worse."

And there are others who were there in Paris, as well, Jon, and that includes the Head of the President's Secret Service detail, who said it also didn't happen. And you had a cut on there from John Bolton, who obviously is no great fan of the President these days. He said if he had heard the President say those things, he would have written an entire chapter in his book about it. But here's what's actually going on. I don't know what happened to journalism where they've got these four anonymous sources. They won't come forward and put their names on it, but \"The Atlantic\" is happy to run the story. And it happens to come out exactly at the moment where Joe Biden is in free fall in the polls. If you want to know what's true about the military, look at what President Trump has done. He's rebuilt the military that he inherited in a decimated state from Obama and Biden. That's exactly what happened. And when Biden was Vice President, the scandals in the VA were tremendous and heartbreaking. People were waiting months, even years, on waiting lists, dying on the waiting list, left to die on gurneys in the hallway. And that's what President Trump cleaned up. Now the veterans are getting the care they deserve, and that's how the President shows his reverence for military veterans. He has built the American military back up to where it should be, and it's standing as the mightiest in the world, and he has restored veterans' faith in the healthcare they receive, getting better access, better choices, and better treatment. That is how President Trump approaches the military. He shows his respect and reverence for members of the military every single day. And this story was dropped. By the way, this was already handled two years ago, right after the Paris trip. It was fake then. It's fake now. It's being repackaged, regurgitated, old news that has already been debunked because Joe Biden is an enormous trouble and his allies in the media are pushing this."

I mean, they invite him, you know, why don't you tell us the worst thing that you think about President Trump, about Mr. Vice president? What kind of journalism is that? And then they ask him a bunch of softballs and some layups from him. These are journalists who don't get to ask Joe Biden questions for weeks at a time. And then when they finally get access to them, this is what they ask? I mean, why not ask him what his favorite color is? Why don't you say, Mr. Vice president, if you were a tree, what kind of a tree would you be? Those would be slightly more challenging, I think, than the questions that he got today.

And so, the science has changed. And I'll tell you what it is. It's the political science. He interrupted everything and came out of his basement for once to have an above-ground excursion to go make a speech in Pittsburgh the other day. And he actually said these words. \"Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters?\" Now, why would any candidate for any office ever say such a thing? Well, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you why, Jon. It's because, to most Americans, he looks like a radical socialist who does have a soft spot for rioters. That's Joe Biden's big problem, and that's why he's coming out now, because he knows that it is sticking to him. He is a tool of the radical left who is afraid to stand up to the antipolice wing of his party, and Americans don't like it. That's why he's coming out on the campaign trail, not because any science has changed, but because the political science has changed. And he's in big trouble in the polls and he knows it."

Keep in mind, when the crime goes up in these cities, it's not the responsibility of the President, it's the responsibility of the mayor and the governor. And if they can't do their job, the President is going to try to put them in a position to hold them accountable to do their job. As for the numbers, 175, 180 versus the 355,000 in the FOP. The National Association of Police Organizations has 241,000. They've supported him. The New York City PBA, 40,000, they've supported him, and a number of others. So I'd say he's got about 800,000 versus Biden, who has about 175."

There's correctional officers that died as a result of COVID. None of that had anything to do with the President himself. Bottom line is, the law enforcement in this country support the President overwhelmingly compared to Biden and the Democratic Party because they get to see on a daily basis they're not supported, they're not indemnified, they're not given the resources they want. The Democratic Party and Joe Biden wants to defund, diminish their authority, their responsibility. And that continues in Joe Biden's Democratic Party."

With us now, Victor Davis Hanson, a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and author of \"The Case for Trump.\" Victor, you say that essentially we should throw out everything that we have heard or read about the polls and the election up until now because you think everything basically resets after Labor Day, which is, after all, this coming Monday. VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW AT HOOVER INSTITUTION & AUTHOR OF \"THE CASE FOR TRUMP\": Yes, I think so. I think Trump will point to the Emerson poll, the Zogby Poll, the Rasmussen poll, and others, and say, and the Trump tabular poll, and say in the state level and national level, he is about even come a pretty good record in 2016, and Biden will try to reassure himself with a Reuters or Politico, the traditional polls that show him ahead. But it doesn't really matter what we say or what they say, it's with the reality is, and you can tell by the internal polling on both sides that they are getting out and waging a traditional campaign. It's no longer going to be a Zoom campaign, and the Biden strategy of the last 90 days, by his own admission, is no longer operable, it's inert. So he is coming out now and he's going to have to have tarmac rallies, he's going to have -- I don't think the scripted interviews are going to have a very long shelf life, they are not genuine. He's going to have to have regular press conferences. There's going to be debates, he's not going to get out of that. Nancy Pelosi's ruse did not work, and the issues have been re -- they're recalibrated. Nobody is talking about the violence and the context as they did in June and July about George Floyd. Tragically so, it's now anarchy and chaos and whether you are going to condemn it unequivocally. And that's going to be the issue. And the virus is not any longer, as it was in May and June, did Cuomo do this or that, or do we do not as well as Germany but better than the U.K.? But it's what's the status of the virus over the next 60 days? Is it waxing, is it waning, are there better treatments, is there vaccination in the short term? And is it going to end? And the same thing with the lockdown. It's no longer Nancy Pelosi's hairdresser and this, it's our 50 million kids going to go back to school quicker or later? And the same thing with the economy. It's not a question that it crashed, it's coming back, it's just a question of how fast. So, these are going to be September and October issues. The polls, the beggars in Vegas have us about even, and we are not going to have a virtual campaign anymore, and I think it's going to be very unpredictable, very wild, but very exciting, too."

Because it benefits the candidate who has been railing the longest -- you have to stop this violence, can't burn police alive and their precincts in Portland, you can't have looting in the million mind. Who has been doing that the longest? And the voters will make their decision on that basis. And they are not isolated, extraneous issues. They are connected because people know if you can't go downtown or your shopping center is inoperative or you are afraid to go out in your car, then you are not going to get back economically. And so that shows you they want to go back to normal and take some measurable risk with COVID, but they can't do it if there is not order in the streets, so the two issues reflect and they enhance each other, and I think in both cases it favors Trump. And I will be the first to say that the Zoom virtual candidacy of Biden, 90 days in his basement, given some cognitive issues he's had, was ideal for him, and that's, I think that was reflected in his poll leads, which I think was genuine, but I don't think that's true any longer. I think it backfired. I think maybe after 30 or 40 days, he should have gotten out and preemptively weighed in on these riots and looting and arson before it's too late. But as I said, he is kind of a prisoner of his own paradox, he's made a devil bargain with the hard left and it's very hard for him to unequivocally condemn them. And that's coming home to roost, I'm afraid, for him."

Everybody has noticed it, and they are contrasting that with the press treatment of Trump, and that was -- he was expecting the American people for the next 60 days to put up with that. But finally, it's going to be embarrassing where people say, we've never done that Republican or Democrat on either side, nobody has been not overtly partisan and scripted, and you are enabling somebody and you are not helping them. And it's going to backfire. They can't do that during the debate. He'll be all alone out on that stage and all it's doing is in feeble him rather than training and toughening him up for the debates. I think the American people are going to see through that, and they already are, that's why the polls are tightening."

I think what you are hearing from the vice president -- the former vice president, rather -- is somebody who understands that we have problems left to be fixed and there's not one president that is going to solve the impacts of systemic racism because systemic racism is internalized in many of our laws and our policies. You see it when black women go to the hospital and try to give childbirth, right, an average African-American woman is three times more likely to die than their white counterparts while giving childbirth, and if that college -- if that black woman has a college degree, then she is five times more likely to die. You see it in the unemployment numbers that came out today. While the unemployment numbers for the America -- for the American people has ticked down to 8.4 percent, for African Americans, that number still sits at 13 percent unemployment. This is happening in big cities. This is happening in rural communities, and this is all happening under Donald Trump's watch. He is the person who says he is the best president for African Americans, but if you look at the numbers, the numbers don't say that. The numbers say that African Americans are three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than their white counterparts. I'm not making this stuff up, the statistics speak for themselves."

OK? Donald Trump has been in office for four years. He passed prison reform, he did the First Step Act, he's adding money to HBCUs, and I have to say that poll is probably not accurate. Because when I'm out on the streets and I have my campaign team talking to people, there a lot of black people that are afraid to even admit that they support Trump, or even myself, because of the backlash. Look, Joe Biden, I understand he's got a tough road ahead of him. He has to act as if he actually cares about black Americans, even though he hasn't and he has proven that he hasn't for 50 years, but I understand that he has to do that now, but it's not going to sell, right? This is a guy, President Trump has been here for four years and has done much more, and I understand that Joe Biden is going to, you know, he's going to push and fight all he wants. I'm excited to see the debates, honestly, because I don't think Joe Biden has what it takes to even explain why he would sign and sponsor the 1994 crime bill which locked up many African-American men and took them away from the families. Family structure is important. President Trump understands that, and Joe Biden has to fight that, and I don't think he can."
