The president also used the visit to meet with Afghanistan's president and announced the U.S. and Taliban have restarted peace talks. Pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong are celebrating legislation signed by President Trump supporting their movement. China, meanwhile, says the implementation of the bills will undermine cooperation in important areas. Ousted Navy Secretary Richard Spencer says the commander-in-chief, President Trump, has very little understanding of how the military works.
