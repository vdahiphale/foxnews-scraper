We have been talking about that for days. But historically, as we stand here at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, if you look at poll numbers of presidents inviting primary challengers, President Johnson, 42 percent, 41 for President Ford, 32 percent for President Carter, 35 percent approval for President Biden. That's where it stands right now. And now you have the additional added situation with this mask mandate and what's really happening. Let's bring in our panel, former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and Byron York, chief political correspondent of \"The Washington Examiner.\" So we get word tonight that the DOJ, Ari, says that they are going to appeal if the CDC says the mask mandate is necessary. Some circles say the CDC is going to say that it's necessary. But the bottom line is that the Biden administration didn't take the victory lap when this judge, a federal judge who clerked for Clarence Thomas, gave them the federal ruling.",

I think it's fair to say that the Department of Justice is masking what it's doing. They are in a very uncomfortable position. Nobody wants to take this political hot potato. And you know why? Because everybody in America is sick and tired of wearing masks, because everybody knows it. This should have ended on airplanes, trains, train stations, airports, months ago. There is no good health reason. And the statistics, Bret, the states that did not have mask mandates, their incidences getting COVID are identical, almost identical to the states that did have mask mandates. Same for death rates.
