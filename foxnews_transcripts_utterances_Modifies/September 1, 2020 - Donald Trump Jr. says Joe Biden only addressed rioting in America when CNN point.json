Congrats on the book. We'll get to that in a moment for sure. But it's apparent what the left is trying to do here. They want to stand in the way of your father offering support for the cities that Democrat leaders refuse to address.  DONALD TRUMP JR., \"LIBERAL PRIVILEGE\" AUTHOR & EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: 100 percent, Pete. I mean, it's disgusting. You've seen Democrat states with Democrat governors, Democrat-run cities with Democrat mayors and Democrat city councils. But it's Donald Trump's fault that they had 100 years of failure. It's really crazy. I mean, this is the first time in modern American history and probably American history where you get in trouble, you get arrested or you get fined or you could lose your business license for opening up your business to put food on your family's table. But if you loot someone else's business, that's fine, that's totally acceptable.

They're pretending like there is nothing there between the brain aneurysms, which could probably explain why he can't remember where he is 50 percent of the time. We can't touch that. The terrible decisions on racial issues, the terrible decisions on trade, TPP, NAFTA, permanent trade status for China in the World Trade Organization, Joe Biden has done more damage and destruction to the American middle class and American manufacturing than likely any human being alive. And yet he is treated as though he's somehow a hero of those people. It's liberal privilege at its finest.  So the book was there to talk about all of the things that the media should be doing, should be telling the American people. But they refuse because they realize it's - it would work against their leftist narrative. So I figured someone has to put pen to paper and write it for Americans.

Congrats on the book. We'll get to that in a moment for sure. But it's apparent what the left is trying to do here. They want to stand in the way of your father offering support for the cities that Democrat leaders refuse to address. DONALD TRUMP JR., \"LIBERAL PRIVILEGE\" AUTHOR & EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION: 100 percent, Pete. I mean, it's disgusting. You've seen Democrat states with Democrat governors, Democrat-run cities with Democrat mayors and Democrat city councils. But it's Donald Trump's fault that they had 100 years of failure. It's really crazy. I mean, this is the first time in modern American history and probably American history where you get in trouble, you get arrested or you get fined or you could lose your business license for opening up your business to put food on your family's table. But if you loot someone else's business, that's fine, that's totally acceptable. I saw - for one week, I watched the DNC, that sort of I-hate-America Zoom call that was the DNC, and I didn't see one person, not one - and they can fact-check me on this - that condemned the riots, that condemned the looting--"

There must be tacit acceptance because these are Biden voters. These are Democrat voters that are out there doing this. You don't see the conservatives burning down businesses. You don't see conservatives getting attack - attacking others for doing - wearing a MAGA hat. Imagine wearing a MAGA hat in Portland. Now, you could wear a Biden hat in any city in the country, and no one would do anything. That's the difference. That's the double-standard. Joe Biden himself said the other day. Well, he was going to stay in his basement bunker for another 10 days before addressing it, until the polling issue came out.

They don't even have a pretense about objectivity anymore. So when you look at Joe Biden's 50-year career in Washington, D.C., Pete, 50 years, that's a half a century. They're pretending like there is nothing there between the brain aneurysms, which could probably explain why he can't remember where he is 50 percent of the time. We can't touch that. The terrible decisions on racial issues, the terrible decisions on trade, TPP, NAFTA, permanent trade status for China in the World Trade Organization, Joe Biden has done more damage and destruction to the American middle class and American manufacturing than likely any human being alive. And yet he is treated as though he's somehow a hero of those people. It's liberal privilege at its finest. So the book was there to talk about all of the things that the media should be doing, should be telling the American people. But they refuse because they realize it's - it would work against their leftist narrative. So I figured someone has to put pen to paper and write it for Americans. So this is more for independents, people who haven't made up their mind.

You just heard the Attorney General talk about the fact that over half of the arrests in Kenosha are not from Kenosha. And in fact, many of those - most of those are from other states. And so, yes, if you're crossing state lines, if you're communicating across state lines for the purpose of setting up rioting, that does invoke federal jurisdiction. And the Department of Justice has advanced over 200 officers to Kenosha. We have some from DHS there. But that's - that's a major factor in expanding federal opportunities for investigation.

If you take a look at what's going on with that, where they are sending unsolicited - I came up with a new name because they call them universal, they call them Lyva (ph). They are unsolicited. You're sending out 80 million ballots unsolicited. Then you have solicited ballot. That's absentee ballot. It's the biggest problem. You look at New York, Carolyn Maloney, they gave her a victory. They don't even know where the ballots are. You look at - you take a look at what's happening in New Jersey. You take a look at what's happened in Virginia. You take a look at what's happening all over. These are small little races that are easy. They can't find the ballots. The ballots are a fraud. Now we're sending 80 million ballots out."

She wanted to get it again this time, as you know, and she got defeated then too. She wanted it very badly behind the scenes. She worked - - she wanted to be vice president behind the scenes. Hillary is a sick person. She should just take it nice and easy, relax. Go out, vote. Maybe she should go to the poll instead of sending out an unsolicited ballot. But the biggest problem we have in this country is going to be this election with the unsolicited ballots, because even a small little district race, a small little congressional race -- Carolyn Maloney. They should do that race over again. They should do that race over again. There's fraud. There's deception. What they've done with the ballots, there are seven different things are happening.

And they didn't like my narrative, so they made up a narrative, because if you look, Michigan is closed. All the states that are closed. North Carolina is close. These states that are closed are run by Democrats. And the reason they are closed is because we have an election on November 3rd, and they don't want the opening of the states and they don't want the income. They want to keep it nice and close. But you take a look at what, the states that are close, it's terrible what they've done. And those people, and you discuss it a lot, so do I. There's a lot of death, depression, drug addiction on the other side. When you keep it closed, I think you're losing more people than -- it's terrible what you're doing to people than when you open it. So I'm the football guy. I'm the one that wants to have football.

Let's see how it all turns out. It's a very sad thing. I will say this. We have tremendous potential. We closed it up. We're opening it up. We're doing record numbers. As you saw, over 9 million people employed now over the last three months, that's a record in the history of our country. We have a chance of having one of the best years we've ever had next year. Unless somebody comes in and wants to raise your taxes, put back on regulations. I'm not sure. I gave the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country, and we're going down lower.

Here now is someone who is doing just that. Joining me now exclusively is University of Nebraska football player Brig Banks. Also with me, his attorney, Mike Flood. Gentlemen, welcome. Thank you. Brig, do you think a majority of Big Ten players feel the same way you do, they want to get back on the field and playing?"

And so basically it does boil down to transparency. What was the vote? Who made the motion? Who made the second? How did each individual president and chancellor vote, and what information did they use to make that decision? Six days after they had issued the fall football schedule everything changed. And you have got these football players that were spending the better part of four or five months following every rule, staying low to the ground, doing with their coaches said, doing what the University of Nebraska Medical Center's guidelines were. And suddenly the rug was pulled out from underneath them. And I don't think it's too much to ask, how did all of that work? How did they vote?"

He said \"From a source, if conference can pass updated safety measures and procedures, Big Ten targeting October 10 to start the football season.\" Mike, if I could, the Nebraska athletic director said there is no truth to this report.

And they will tell you, the football players will tell you they've never felt more safe. In fact, during the time when they were getting ready to play, they were being closely monitored. Now because of this decision, the training has been closed down. A lot of the services have been closed down. And they are on the dorm floor with all the other athletes. So the question is, what's more safe? Is it more safe to play football in a very strict environment, or to not play football?
