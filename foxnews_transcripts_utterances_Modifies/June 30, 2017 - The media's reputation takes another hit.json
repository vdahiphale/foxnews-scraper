The only way you're going to do that is with low cost plans that allow for more risks. And I always say this, to have a low cost plan with more risk, the government handles the big stuff. You talk about catastrophic or the insurance company -- you handle the big stuff and then we handle the little things. The poor get help with both. But you have to have these low cost plans where you handle the doctor's visits and some of the pharmaceuticals. And then the big stuff. You get hit by a car, you get cancer. That's taken cared off. Catastrophic health insurance is the way to go. Interesting thing too, you talk about diversity, Republican reaction to this bill is like hurting cats on Ritalin.

It's 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" The news media is one of the least popular institutions in America. And some other things seems to get even worse this week. Three CNN journalists resigned Monday over retracted story about a Trump advisor's ties to Russia. And much of the media went into a collective meltdown over President Trump's tweets yesterday about two cable news hosts. Watch as MSNBC guests dramatically change his point of view in just a year's time."

The settlement was announced on the same day that the House passed Kate's Law which gets tougher on illegal immigrants who repeatedly defy deportation.

The only way you're going to do that is with low cost plans that allow for more risks. And I always say this, to have a low cost plan with more risk, the government handles the big stuff. You talk about catastrophic or the insurance company -- you handle the big stuff and then we handle the little things. The poor get help with both. But you have to have these low cost plans where you handle the doctor's visits and some of the pharmaceuticals. And then the big stuff. You get hit by a car, you get cancer. That's taken cared off. Catastrophic health insurance is the way to go. Interesting thing too, you talk about diversity, Republican reaction to this bill is like hurting cats on Ritalin.

When Fox was created, our Washington bureau was pretty small and Betsy came along and helped to herd all the cats, that means journalist are a top bunch to control, you know. with studios, office space, parking, finances. And tonight, when I say, Betsy, we really appreciate all that you've done to make Fox into one of the best news bureaus in the nation's capital.

The actor was spotted driving in Brodsville, Pennsylvania where he delivered a scholarship to Hayley Grace Williams who is studying to become a nurse. Her father was injured during a training exercise before \"Operation Desert Storm.\" So wonderful he's giving scholarships to a woman who's family unfortunately passed in \"Desert Storm.\""
