The Biden administration is desperately trying to spin a new narrative after the \"defund the police\" move blew up in the Democrats faces. Big surprise there. The White House us actually trying to claim now it's the Republicans who support defunding the police. But if only we had a flashback montage of numerous Democrats expressing their explicit desire to cut money from the cops. Oh, we do.",

I don't believe that he did but she has never actually been an advocate for defunding the police, i.e. taking away their budgets. The rest of the montage had members of the squad and then who are our most liberal branch. And the man who won the election, Joe Biden, was vehemently against defunding the police consistently throughout the election and certainly came out forcefully for that over the summer. Now, what Jen Psaki did from the podium, it was definitely some good wordsmithing there. We do know that the Trump 2021 budget did take $515 million away from police programs including Obama-era policies that were going to get more body cameras, et cetera, to police officers. But I think that people are going to identify Democrats with the term defund the police and that we need voices like with Clyburn, like Joe Biden, like police chiefs to be out there as forcefully as possible saying we need all of our funding, we need to be smarter about the way that we police, but certainly ripping budgets away is not the answer.",

Notice how they're not playing the race card. The Democrats are only good at that, at playing the race card. They either will censor conservatives or they will throw the race card down. When they actually have to debate a policy which they triggered, the substance of it, they're having a hard time and they are scrambling. And notice when Trump is now not there, this isn't about Donald Trump anymore. He was such a crutch for the left linguistically during the last four years because every policy was personal. It was about him. Either for something because he was against it or vice versa. He's not there. So now defund the police has to stand on its own and it's been exposed as dangerous and causing death throughout the country. And they don't have a real solution for it and that's why they are blaming Republicans, they're blaming guns and it's sad. Right now, if you look at all the montages we played, some Democrats are saying, yes, dismantle the police and the other Democrats, they are dancing around it. They are saying, oh, you know, let's tweak the police departments, let's reimagine police departments. Joe Biden actually said let's redirect funding from police departments, So there was never like, oh, the strong Democrats stare down the far left last year. No. They were beholden to them and could not come out and say the truth. I had Johnny research a list of all the cities, 22 cities defunded the police to the tune of over a billion dollars.

There's no coincidence that the people that are -- the pro-lock heads are, you know, in the media, academia and entertainment. Because what's another two to four months to them, right? Their investments are doing great. You know, they don't run a dry cleaner, they don't run a diner, they don't run a massage parlor, I know that. So, they don't have to worry about it.

I stayed at home. I gave up my life. I gave up my business. I sacrificed everything. I got the vaccine or I had now true immunity and now they are still telling me that they may re-impose these restrictions. And it comes from people who quite frankly, blown basically all of their credibility, whether it's people in the media or whether it's Dr. Fauci who, you know, was asked to come testify today again about COVID, but doesn't want to talk about the origins of where it came from. You know, we were told to mask up, told not to mask up. There's a lot of mixed signals. And especially in California with Gavin Newsom, people in charge making it really scary for everybody else about how this is going to be, but then going off and living their lives as if there isn't a pandemic. So, I think some people will be fine with moving forward or backward I guess, back into what we saw last year, but I think a lot of people are thinking there is a bait and switch and life comes with risks.

And if something does get unanimous consent in the Senate when we are holding the majority there, you can pretty much feel safe that this is something that people should be looking into and I hope that that happens. As far as the delta variant goes, I think the fear factor which Greg referenced is really important in this. There was a really great \"New York Times\" piece by David Leonhardt -- I might have mispronounced that, which I did not mean to do -- which went into the study that was done by an economist at Dartmouth about the fear that was perpetrated by the American media about COVID versus other countries. And are pressed exponentially more scare people and we know how the click bait society works. We know about that by, whether it's online T.V., all of it. And I think that it's really informed how a lot of people are planning their future lives and that scares me. When you see kids, there was a story about an 11-year-old who was like, I don't want to go to camp, right. His camp is outside, he's scared about not being able to be masked up.

Everybody is so scared to talk about obesity. Oh my god, you're fat-shaming. No, it's harmful. If you have loved ones who are overweight, you should help them lose weight.",

I don't believe that he did but she has never actually been an advocate for defunding the police, i.e. taking away their budgets. The rest of the montage had members of the squad and then who are our most liberal branch. And the man who won the election, Joe Biden, was vehemently against defunding the police consistently throughout the election and certainly came out forcefully for that over the summer. Now, what Jen Psaki did from the podium, it was definitely some good wordsmithing there. We do know that the Trump 2021 budget did take $515 million away from police programs including Obama-era policies that were going to get more body cameras, et cetera, to police officers. But I think that people are going to identify Democrats with the term defund the police and that we need voices like with Clyburn, like Joe Biden, like police chiefs to be out there as forcefully as possible saying we need all of our funding, we need to be smarter about the way that we police, but certainly ripping budgets away is not the answer."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Let me continue. Let me continue, if I may. This is why the Democrats are having a hard time with this argument because they can't play the race card here. Notice how they're not playing the race card. The Democrats are only good at that, at playing the race card. They either will censor conservatives or they will throw the race card down. When they actually have to debate a policy which they triggered, the substance of it, they're having a hard time and they are scrambling. And notice when Trump is now not there, this isn't about Donald Trump anymore. He was such a crutch for the left linguistically during the last four years because every policy was personal. It was about him. Either for something because he was against it or vice versa. He's not there. So now defund the police has to stand on its own and it's been exposed as dangerous and causing death throughout the country. And they don't have a real solution for it and that's why they are blaming Republicans, they're blaming guns and it's sad. Right now, if you look at all the montages we played, some Democrats are saying, yes, dismantle the police and the other Democrats, they are dancing around it. They are saying, oh, you know, let's tweak the police departments, let's reimagine police departments. Joe Biden actually said let's redirect funding from police departments, So there was never like, oh, the strong Democrats stare down the far left last year. No. They were beholden to them and could not come out and say the truth. I had Johnny research a list of all the cities, 22 cities defunded the police to the tune of over a billion dollars. Every single city was run by Democrats and all the Democrat mayors signed off on it. It's not a Republican issue. It's a Democrat issue."

So, they are making those decisions and nobody in the Democratic Party was like stop. What are you doing? This terrible. I will lead to terrible consequences, no. There was appeasement. And I don't think anyone is going to be fooled by this and I think it's really disrespectful to the American people because what happened to the clarity and honesty and integrity that was going to come back to White House communications?

You have Democrat police chiefs now begging Democrat-run city councils to stop inflicting harm on their communities because they are the ones who are getting called for the homicides that are happening more and more. The final thing is that it's funny how they are now basically admitting inadvertently that \"defund the police\" is bad.

So we're not going to sit here and be terrorized by the media. You can't spell crackdown with crack, Dana. And the media is addicted to fear. There's no coincidence that the people that are -- the pro-lock heads are, you know, in the media, academia and entertainment. Because what's another two to four months to them, right?

I stayed at home. I gave up my life. I gave up my business. I sacrificed everything. I got the vaccine or I had now true immunity and now they are still telling me that they may re-impose these restrictions. And it comes from people who quite frankly, blown basically all of their credibility, whether it's people in the media or whether it's Dr. Fauci who, you know, was asked to come testify today again about COVID, but doesn't want to talk about the origins of where it came from. You know, we were told to mask up, told not to mask up. There's a lot of mixed signals. And especially in California with Gavin Newsom, people in charge making it really scary for everybody else about how this is going to be, but then going off and living their lives as if there isn't a pandemic. So, I think some people will be fine with moving forward or backward I guess, back into what we saw last year, but I think a lot of people are thinking there is a bait and switch and life comes with risks. And given the data that we are seeing in the delta variant, it's not deadlier than all of the other strains as the White House said today. And so, we'll see what happens, but --"

And if something does get unanimous consent in the Senate when we are holding the majority there, you can pretty much feel safe that this is something that people should be looking into and I hope that that happens. As far as the delta variant goes, I think the fear factor which Greg referenced is really important in this. There was a really great \"New York Times\" piece by David Leonhardt -- I might have mispronounced that, which I did not mean to do -- which went into the study that was done by an economist at Dartmouth about the fear that was perpetrated by the American media about COVID versus other countries. And are pressed exponentially more scare people and we know how the click bait society works. We know about that by, whether it's online T.V., all of it. And I think that it's really informed how a lot of people are planning their future lives and that scares me. When you see kids, there was a story about an 11-year-old who was like, I don't want to go to camp, right. His camp is outside, he's scared about not being able to be masked up. Things like that really need to be combated. And the delta variant is serious and when you look at -- I look at Israel for a lot of the examples for how to deal with things like that. They are masked up indoors. It's legitimate and they are all vaccinated."

Gwen Goldman fulfilled her 60-year-old dream of being a Bat Girl for the New York Yankees. In 1961, Goldman was just 10-years-old and wrote to the Yankees asking to be a Bat Girl. GM Ron Hamey rejected her request writing, I'm sure you can understand that it's a game dominated by men, a young lady such as yourself would feel out of place in a dugout. That kind of thinking has no place in baseball, like no crying in baseball also. Current GM Brian Cashman to the rescue, who upon hearing about Goldman from his daughter, rectified the error. So, it was great to see her out there."
