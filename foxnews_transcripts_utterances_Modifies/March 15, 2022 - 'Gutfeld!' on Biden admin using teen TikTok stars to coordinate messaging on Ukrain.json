In Britain, the guy with fish and chips on his head, actually met with oil and gas industries yesterday to figure out his country's energy plan as it looks to move away from Russian gas. Now compare that to us with the remedial class known as the Biden administration looks to teenage TikTokers talkers to coordinate messaging on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blame Putin for rising gas prices. Not surprising in a White House where the only adult thing are the diapers.",

I had the opportunity to ask the White House why gas down the street is $7.00 and here's what they said. Russia is one of the top three producers of oil and it is actually their number one revenue source. Now with Putin starting this horrific fight between Ukraine and Russia, nobody wants to work with him during international trade.  So, with people being scared of war and limited resources, prices are bound to go up as well.",

So, while Ukrainians die, and Americans raised their 401(k)s to buy groceries, our leaders are chatting up obnoxious brats about how to lie to the American people.  But maybe that's the White House's emotional level. And rather than try to figure out a way to stop the next World War, they fret about rising gas prices, ruining their political chances. Because with Libs it only comes down to holding power. But this is also what happens when there are no adults in the room. Back in the day, serious people took serious things seriously. Last time I checked during the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK wasn't getting his military advice from the Mickey Mouse Club. What the hell did Annette Funicello know about war anyway? Now we go to TikTok which is used to gaslight the American people, but they're not even good at gaslighting unless you're talking about Joe with a Bic lighter after a bowl of beans. Meanwhile, be careful if you dare question joining the war. Then you become a trader.

Even if you're a combat veteran like Tulsi. Disagree with her not you got to admit she has more balls than a bucket of title lists. So, what happened to free thought? What happened to avoiding World War III? I guess it's easy to push war when you're here, far away from the mess. It's why I don't do it. It's a lot like all those T.V. hosts telling you to stay home and definitely during COVID because they still got paid. They could do their show from home. This is no different. But since I'm not going anywhere, I'm sure as hell not going to tell you to go somewhere and die.  Meanwhile, the president moles whether he should fly to Europe after sending the town Cackler in. He's probably worrying about those tricky stairs that he has to navigate to get up on Air Force One. That appears now he may be going to Europe next week. Next week. Great. What's the hurry?

Google anything about Vietnam protesters.   I mean, did we really run out of Afghanistan so we could run headfirst into war in Europe? I mean, at least give us a little in-between war palate cleanser, like a dish of sorbet or an invasion of Cuba. The number one goal should be to end this thing as fast as possible, which calls for some audacious diplomacy, not mulling it over, not sending Kamala, not indulging Tik Tok, which is owned by China.

In Britain, the guy with fish and chips on his head, actually met with oil and gas industries yesterday to figure out his country's energy plan as it looks to move away from Russian gas. Now compare that to us with the remedial class known as the Biden administration looks to teenage TikTokers talkers to coordinate messaging on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and blame Putin for rising gas prices. Not surprising in a White House where the only adult thing are the diapers."

I had the opportunity to ask the White House why gas down the street is $7.00 and here's what they said. Russia is one of the top three producers of oil and it is actually their number one revenue source. Now with Putin starting this horrific fight between Ukraine and Russia, nobody wants to work with him during international trade. So, with people being scared of war and limited resources, prices are bound to go up as well."

And they definitely influenced me throw up all over my lap. What's Joe going to do next? Hit up the half-naked soccer moms on only fans for immigration tips? So, while Ukrainians die, and Americans raised their 401(k)s to buy groceries, our leaders are chatting up obnoxious brats about how to lie to the American people. But maybe that's the White House's emotional level. And rather than try to figure out a way to stop the next World War, they fret about rising gas prices, ruining their political chances. Because with Libs it only comes down to holding power. But this is also what happens when there are no adults in the room. Back in the day, serious people took serious things seriously. Last time I checked during the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK wasn't getting his military advice from the Mickey Mouse Club. What the hell did Annette Funicello know about war anyway? Now we go to TikTok which is used to gaslight the American people, but they're not even good at gaslighting unless you're talking about Joe with a Bic lighter after a bowl of beans. Meanwhile, be careful if you dare question joining the war. Then you become a trader.

Even if you're a combat veteran like Tulsi. Disagree with her not you got to admit she has more balls than a bucket of title lists. So, what happened to free thought? What happened to avoiding World War III? I guess it's easy to push war when you're here, far away from the mess. It's why I don't do it. It's a lot like all those T.V. hosts telling you to stay home and definitely during COVID because they still got paid. They could do their show from home. This is no different. But since I'm not going anywhere, I'm sure as hell not going to tell you to go somewhere and die. Meanwhile, the president moles whether he should fly to Europe after sending the town Cackler in. He's probably worrying about those tricky stairs that he has to navigate to get up on Air Force One. That appears now he may be going to Europe next week. Next week. Great. What's the hurry? It's only women and children being slaughtered. Why not go tomorrow or today? What's the delay? You're too busy choosing a flavor of ice cream for the right over? Let's see what Joe's mulling."

And yet they're patriotic. But if you want this war, then what's the next step? You OK with more dead, including Americans? These are questions the left used to ask. Google anything about Vietnam protesters. I mean, did we really run out of Afghanistan so we could run headfirst into war in Europe? I mean, at least give us a little in-between war palate cleanser, like a dish of sorbet or an invasion of Cuba. The number one goal should be to end this thing as fast as possible, which calls for some audacious diplomacy, not mulling it over, not sending Kamala, not indulging Tik Tok, which is owned by China. But we live in a time where it seems war is preferable to mediation. And if you don't go with the flow, you might be called a trader. I call it McCarthyism.

And what worries me is do we offer such concessions, we meaning sort of the freedom loving west. Such concessions that it rewards what he's done. That is one side of this, but you also need to give him potentially something where he can basically lie to his people and say, I've achieved this and now finally, the killing can stop.
