      "sentences": "All right, we're continuing to monitor this Jen Psaki press briefing. You can see that our own Jacqui Heinrich got right to the heart of a matter that is sort of triggering a lot of controversy right now, a retweet by the chief of staff, Ron Klain, of some comments made by Jason Furman, who was a Council of Economic Advisers chair under Barack Obama, saying that most of the economic problems we're facing, inflation, supply chains, et cetera, are high-class problems. We wouldn't have had them if the unemployment rate was still 10 percent. We would instead have had a much worse problem. But what got the attention was his retweeting the fact that this was a high-class problem, that inflation and where we're feeling it is impacting presumably only the well-to-do. The fact of the matter is, of course, that gas prices have gone up, chicken prices have gone up. Pork prices, bacon, these are all staples that it's fair to say go well beyond the high class to pretty much every class. Everyone pays more for gas. Everyone is paying more for bacon and chicken and a host of other goods that are now in and out of better-than-one-decade highs. Today, FOX on top an over-the-top reaction that is limited, we're told, from the White House to only the well-to-do. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And, again, you saw Jen Psaki try to calm the firestorm here, but to little avail, an inflation pinch that all Americans are feeling sort of relegated to just a few in the Grey Poupon crowd, well, complaining. The fallout from this right now from Edward Lawrence at the White House -- Edward.",

But let's run down some of the things that we all buy, meat, eggs, poultry, fish up 10.5 percent year over year. Fruits and vegetables are up, all types of gas you alluded to 42.1 percent of the past 12 months. Now, that last one seeps into everything we buy, which is why some are saying, as you talked about at the top of, this retweet could be the let me eat cake moment for White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. Now, the White House press secretary you heard put some context to it, but still the -- retweeted not once but twice three hours apart saying that it's high-class problems, because if it would not have inflation of 10 percent, that this would not be a problem. But the president has not taken questions directly about inflation or the supply chain issues in the last week. This is what happened when he talked today about vaccines and his COVID response. Listen. Now, you see him walking away there. In fact, then the president -- or the press was ushered out of a meeting. This was within the last 15, 20 minutes or so with the Kenyan president here at the White House, not answering questions again. Now, the vice president for Consumer Brands Association says that the administration looks -- needs to look at some of the relaxing of rules. And we're talking about truck driving.

His latest proposal came yesterday when he proposed that ports, for example, a big one outside Los Angeles, stay open 24/7. The problem is finding workers and the problem is dealing with the higher costs to keep them doing that job, which might exponentially lead to higher costs supposedly that this is supposed to address.

This is basically a floating warehouse because there's no other room basically onshore; 60 ships like this right now are being off-loaded within the ports, but there are 78 anchored offshore, are in a holding pattern near Catalina Island. Now, this is the shortest distance between here and Shanghai, but we are told shippers are beginning to divert cargo through the Panama Canal to avoid this bottleneck.

If you look at inflation, wealthy people are the people that have the least amount of problem with it, because they have got that excess cash and capacity. They're not having to make a choice between whether or not to buy a gallon of gas or whether or not to buy a gallon of milk. Some wealthy people, you could argue, even benefit from inflation, like if they're in the business of financial assets or real estate. Inflation can help those areas. Inflation always fundamentally hits the average joe, it's terrible on. These are the guys that they got 50 bucks to get to the next paycheck, and they have to decide they can't buy some of the groceries because they need to buy gas to get to work. And to suggest that you don't understand that looks so disconnected from the issues that are out there with America. That was the real gaffe.",

Now, I understand what Furman was saying, the former Council of Economic advisers chief, talking about this problem, that it wouldn't be this bad if we had 10 percent unemployment. But you're saying the only way to have or to address that is to have a lousy economy, which, of course, raises the issue of stagflation, an issue that bedeviled another Democratic president named Jimmy Carter.

It's why we have that old gotcha question, do how much a gallon of milk costs? Because voters don't think that people who live in these bubbles really do understand that. And it could be worse is not a positive message. Now, I understand why this White House is doing this. They want to pretend that the problem is not there, because they know that it imperils their $3.5 trillion agenda and that Washington spending is considered one of the problems behind this inflation.

If you have to pay for premium, you're paying over $5 a gallon. This is a lot of money. We have been talking to people at this station. They said that they're trying to budget, maybe do half-a-tank or less than that. But the bad news is, we're seeing high numbers all over the U.S. and this is a lot higher than this time last year. Take a look at this comparison that we have for you. So, today, the national average for gas is about $3.30 a gallon. Last year, it was $2.18 a gallon. That's over a 50 percent increase. There are only a couple states in the U.S. that are under the $3 mark today. And that number is dwindling. There were eight states on Monday. So, you can see the trend. And it's not trending in the right direction, Neil. And the states where you're going to pay the most for gas, you're looking at California, Hawaii, and Nevada. Now, we did that comparison from today last year. But, of course, the pandemic was still going on to that point. So we have seen some changes in gas during that time, still an increase. But it's not just during the pandemic. These are really high numbers. Take this, for instance. In January of 2020, before the pandemic hit us really in the U.S., Neil, the average price of gas was $2.60 a gallon, nowhere near the prices that you're seeing behind me.",

But will the energy crunch overseas get worse? Will China get coal? Will they get more coal? Will the natural gas issues in Europe continue? I think, for now, there's more upside of the price of oil, which again today was back up to $81. We could be talking about $85 or $90.

      "utterance": "All right, we're continuing to monitor this Jen Psaki press briefing. You can see that our own Jacqui Heinrich got right to the heart of a matter that is sort of triggering a lot of controversy right now, a retweet by the chief of staff, Ron Klain, of some comments made by Jason Furman, who was a Council of Economic Advisers chair under Barack Obama, saying that most of the economic problems we're facing, inflation, supply chains, et cetera, are high-class problems. We wouldn't have had them if the unemployment rate was still 10 percent. We would instead have had a much worse problem. But what got the attention was his retweeting the fact that this was a high-class problem, that inflation and where we're feeling it is impacting presumably only the well-to-do. The fact of the matter is, of course, that gas prices have gone up, chicken prices have gone up. Pork prices, bacon, these are all staples that it's fair to say go well beyond the high class to pretty much every class. Everyone pays more for gas. Everyone is paying more for bacon and chicken and a host of other goods that are now in and out of better-than-one-decade highs. Today, FOX on top an over-the-top reaction that is limited, we're told, from the White House to only the well-to-do. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And, again, you saw Jen Psaki try to calm the firestorm here, but to little avail, an inflation pinch that all Americans are feeling sort of relegated to just a few in the Grey Poupon crowd, well, complaining. The fallout from this right now from Edward Lawrence at the White House -- Edward."

      "speaker": "EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, first, everyone loves bacon, right? The price of bacon is going up on this. Now, the CPI inflation is at 5.4 percent. And the reason -- part of the reason for that falls squarely on the supply chain issues that we have been talking about. But let's run down some of the things that we all buy, meat, eggs, poultry, fish up 10.5 percent year over year. Fruits and vegetables are up, all types of gas you alluded to 42.1 percent of the past 12 months. Now, that last one seeps into everything we buy, which is why some are saying, as you talked about at the top of, this retweet could be the let me eat cake moment for White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. Now, the White House press secretary you heard put some context to it, but still the -- retweeted not once but twice three hours apart saying that it's high-class problems, because if it would not have inflation of 10 percent, that this would not be a problem. But the president has not taken questions directly about inflation or the supply chain issues in the last week. This is what happened when he talked today about vaccines and his COVID response. Listen. Now, you see him walking away there. In fact, then the president -- or the press was ushered out of a meeting. This was within the last 15, 20 minutes or so with the Kenyan president here at the White House, not answering questions again. Now, the vice president for Consumer Brands Association says that the administration looks -- needs to look at some of the relaxing of rules. And we're talking about truck driving.

But it's fair to say he is trying to get ahead of it, but having little success doing so. His latest proposal came yesterday when he proposed that ports, for example, a big one outside Los Angeles, stay open 24/7. The problem is finding workers and the problem is dealing with the higher costs to keep them doing that job, which might exponentially lead to higher costs supposedly that this is supposed to address. Let's get the read right now from William La Jeunesse, who is at the Port of Long Beach, California -- William."

But it is turning the Pacific off of L.A. and Long Beach into this parking lot that you see now. This is basically a floating warehouse because there's no other room basically onshore; 60 ships like this right now are being off-loaded within the ports, but there are 78 anchored offshore, are in a holding pattern near Catalina Island. Now, this is the shortest distance between here and Shanghai, but we are told shippers are beginning to divert cargo through the Panama Canal to avoid this bottleneck. They're out here waiting two to three weeks, right? And time is money. And if they're paying for it, so are we. But the president's port czar said about two or three hours ago that he's optimistic this new plan is going to make a difference."

Now back to the big quote, misquote, bad tweet, bad retweet of the day, and that is the chief of staff, Ron Klain, for President Obama -- for President Biden, I should say, essentially agreeing with the former Council of Economic Advisers chief under Barack Obama, Jason Furman, who has said essentially we're facing these inflation supply chains, other issues, but they're high-class problems, in other words, that the high class, the upper class are the only ones having to deal with this. Kim Strassel is The Wall Street Journal editorial board member, also a FOX News contributor. Kim, this is a major oops moment for the administration.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIM STRASSEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, what was remarkable about it, Neil, is how it completely and utterly gets it backward. If you look at inflation, wealthy people are the people that have the least amount of problem with it, because they have got that excess cash and capacity. They're not having to make a choice between whether or not to buy a gallon of gas or whether or not to buy a gallon of milk. Some wealthy people, you could argue, even benefit from inflation, like if they're in the business of financial assets or real estate. Inflation can help those areas. Inflation always fundamentally hits the average joe, it's terrible on. These are the guys that they got 50 bucks to get to the next paycheck, and they have to decide they can't buy some of the groceries because they need to buy gas to get to work. And to suggest that you don't understand that looks so disconnected from the issues that are out there with America. That was the real gaffe."

This is something that is not really hitting you. It's hitting someone else. It's hitting the rich. It just has an elitist dismissiveness to it that's hard to take back. Now, I understand what Furman was saying, the former Council of Economic advisers chief, talking about this problem, that it wouldn't be this bad if we had 10 percent unemployment. But you're saying the only way to have or to address that is to have a lousy economy, which, of course, raises the issue of stagflation, an issue that bedeviled another Democratic president named Jimmy Carter. Where's this going?"

They want to know that people are fixing their problems. And that's why voters have had a pervasive view over the years that politicians are disconnected. It's why we have that old gotcha question, do how much a gallon of milk costs? Because voters don't think that people who live in these bubbles really do understand that. And it could be worse is not a positive message. Now, I understand why this White House is doing this. They want to pretend that the problem is not there, because they know that it imperils their $3.5 trillion agenda and that Washington spending is considered one of the problems behind this inflation. But the American people see what is going on. And there's a certain point at which you have to address it, not close your eyes and pretend it isn't happening."

And it's because, on the one hand, we have been paying people to stay home and those benefits are still going, whether it be the child tax credit or whatever it is. And on the other hand, we have all of these government mandates and restrictions that are actually discouraging people from working, whether it's vaccine mandates or others. You can argue about that from a public policy and health perspective. But the reality of it is, they're out in the work force. And until we change government incentives and disincentives to work, this is not going to get better."

Clearly, the administration isn't taking the hit for this, but to dismiss the fact that it's really happening and that everyone's affected, particularly the middle class, lower classes, and, oddly enough, the impact on the higher class not nearly so much, tends to compound the problem. And in case you have any doubts that this inflation is still a problem, take a look at any gas station, because some eye-popping figures are passing us by as we speak.

These are numbers that are going to impact that middle-income family deciding whether to full -- fully fill up their tank or just go for that half-tank and hope that it gets better, but not very good news. It's not looking like those prices are going to come down anytime soon. I will give you the full report coming up."

And some big numbers hit today that are spreading way the numbers we have seen over the last decade. Madison Alworth has a lot more from us -- for us in New York City -- Madison."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALWORTH",
      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Yes, I mean, you said it. Look at the numbers over my shoulder. When you're going for regular gas at this gas station in the city, you're going to be hitting near $5. If you have to pay for premium, you're paying over $5 a gallon. This is a lot of money. We have been talking to people at this station. They said that they're trying to budget, maybe do half-a-tank or less than that. But the bad news is, we're seeing high numbers all over the U.S. and this is a lot higher than this time last year. Take a look at this comparison that we have for you. So, today, the national average for gas is about $3.30 a gallon. Last year, it was $2.18 a gallon. That's over a 50 percent increase. There are only a couple states in the U.S. that are under the $3 mark today. And that number is dwindling. There were eight states on Monday. So, you can see the trend. And it's not trending in the right direction, Neil. And the states where you're going to pay the most for gas, you're looking at California, Hawaii, and Nevada. Now, we did that comparison from today last year. But, of course, the pandemic was still going on to that point. So we have seen some changes in gas during that time, still an increase. But it's not just during the pandemic. These are really high numbers. Take this, for instance. In January of 2020, before the pandemic hit us really in the U.S., Neil, the average price of gas was $2.60 a gallon, nowhere near the prices that you're seeing behind me."

Of course, OPEC, will they increase production eventually? Last week, they said, no, we're on our own schedule. Keep in mind, OPEC is increasing every month until 2022. But will the energy crunch overseas get worse? Will China get coal? Will they get more coal? Will the natural gas issues in Europe continue? I think, for now, there's more upside of the price of oil, which again today was back up to $81. We could be talking about $85 or $90. And we could be talking about a national average that $3.35, $3.45 or so, before we see any relief."

      "speaker": "DE HAAN",

But a lot of my friends, anecdotally, say premium here in Chicago, for example, is $1.25 a gallon more than regular. What can we do? Now, some of these cars, some of the late model cars don't always require it. So check that very carefully in your owner's manual. Is it recommended or required? If it's only recommended, you can go back down to 87. The beauty about modern cars is knock sensors can hear that pinging if you fill up with a lower grade, and they can adjust your car engine accordingly. Having said that, Neil, just looking at some of the numbers here, to your point, one in eight stations in the U.S. is now over $4. It's never been too hard to find those extremely high prices, California, even Orlando, Florida, for those going to Disney World, a station there charging hear $6. But I think bottom line here, Neil, it's going to get worse before it gets any better."

And that's when you started to see an inability for some of these stations, given the trucker shortage, to replenish their tanks as quickly as Americans are filling up. But that's going to be the exception here."

We have gasoline. But there's been a lot of strain on getting into the station in time."

It is weird, but it's playing out just as you said it would. Patrick, thank you, Patrick De Haan. And we weren't making stuff up about what's going on abroad, particularly in Britain, where long gas lines have become very, very common. Some of these images you're seeing actually are present-day. What you're seeing on the left side of your screen is, well, another day, in the 1970s. I remember those gas lines. I remember the odd and even days you could get gas.

I'm not talking leisure suits and bell-bottoms, though, even though I didn't have a problem with them back then, but the problem right now that is being lived out every day in large swathes of Great Britain, where long gas lines are forming, because they can't get the petroleum, as they like to call it, to gas stations throughout the country and the region. It's spreading beyond just those countries, which is reminiscent of what we experienced what seems like a generation ago, about 50 years ago, in the early '70s and later again in the late 1970s, where you had OPEC embargoes, and then you had the compounded problem of inflation-ravaged recession, stagflation, as they used to call it, that produced record long gas lines that might not be entirely forgotten now, if historian Burt Folsom is right, the Hillsdale College distinguished fellow, kind enough to join us now.

Now, President Biden, by contrast, in his first day in office, revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. And we saw gas prices rise. And they have been rising ever since. Messy -- when the government interferes in the free production of oil, often, there are big problems. And we're seeing that again, as we did with Jimmy Carter."

But we quickly learned that there is a domino connection to not only the way goods make their way to us, but the oil and these synthetic fuels that are that are part of these everyday items from toys to you name it. And it affected the food supply and all of that, the same thing playing out now that hints to me this is not just a Johnny one-note on oil. This is pervasive enough to spread and take in everything else."

And it did lead to a slowdown in the economy and this stagflation where you have a weak economy, but prices are still reading amok. And it took Paul Volcker, the Central Bank chairman at the time in the late Carter years and then into the Reagan years, to raise interest rates, sometimes a full point at a time, to deal with the crisis. I hope we don't get to that, because that's a whole 'nother can of worms."

I remember quite well, because a lot of people were paying the green and really losing a lot, including jobs, one of the biggest recessions we had back to back in the 1970s. Let's hope it doesn't happen again. But history indicates it certainly won't be brief. All right, in the meantime, here, we just told you right now that Verizon is clamping down with vaccine mandates of its own, but they're also signaling it won't be for everybody.

I think the official pronouncement is going to come shortly. But there's nothing wrong with mixing and matching. I mean, if you put the mRNA in a patient who's had the J&J vaccine, which is a viral vector vaccine, the immune system is going to recognize the fact that the spike protein is again boosting immunity. So, neutralizing antibody and cellular immunity increases, regardless of the source of the vaccine. So, mixing and matching, as far as I'm concerned, is a great -- it's a great idea.

That's a lot of distraught families and a lot of grief. And so children are really, really important to cover. The vast majority of the cases are between the ages of 25 and 54, where most of the deaths occur, but children can get infected, and they can do poorly. So parents have got to realize that.

January 6, I'm covering it that day on Dana Perino's show as I'm finishing up this book. And so I thought starting it that way, to give us a perspective on things, was the way to go. The book ends, by the way, after the George Floyd protests and Grant statues being pulled down in the San Francisco park. And a reporter says, why are you pulling this down? And they say, well, he's part of the Civil War. He had a slave. And Grant spends his whole life fighting slavery, fighting for Black equality, for the right to vote.

They thought that the wrong guy was winning and all of this.

And I don't want to put you on the spot, but I love putting on the spot. What you seem to buy there is that President Grant rose to the occasion. Different case because the election this time directly involved President Trump. Did he?"

But until some legislature acts, until some court actually moves on evidence, until something's turned, the election is over. And Republicans, most of them want to talk about the future and how they can change it."

      "utterance": "In looking back at Grant, I was most impressed -- he had a very scandal-plagued administration, but his predecessor was even worse, in fact, laid the groundwork for this disaster that he had to solve. But I always wonder about his post-presidency. He -- he did a lot. And I'm just wondering. He was always very fearful of what the country could become, and it weighed on him. How was that man leaving office?"

But it did bring on 100 years of racism and cruelty that went on and on and on. I understand what you're saying, obviously, about getting the country forward, but did you get from your notes -- and I know you went to get Grant letters and all the research, personal or otherwise -- that he ever regretted it, that it was a deal, yes, it kept the country together, but at a huge price?"

      "speaker": "BAIER",

He was so well-respected, a million people turned out here in New York for his funeral, lining the streets in Union uniforms, Confederate uniforms. He has two Confederate generals and two Northern generals as his pallbearers. I mean, he was really quite a man."

They will say right now that if your fries are cold, they will replace them with hot and crispy fries, but you might want to park somewhere else to deal with that while they're getting it to you.

So, listen, anything that can better the fast food experience, because, listen, the lines to get the food a lot longer no matter where you go, whether you go inside to restaurants or diners or bars, but even in the drive-throughs. But, yes, the Wendy's fries definitely good. Good job."
