We are one week from election night. 69 percent of Americans say this is the most important of their lifetime. This is a hard-fought race and one of the most tumultuous times in American memory. And when those numbers start rolling in on Tuesday night, we'll start to see and break down the trends that we see among voters. One group which will be closely watched are black voters, particularly young black men. President Trump got 13 percent of the black male vote in  2016 that was more than any GOP candidate before him. Both sides seen movement in this group and the campaign spoke directly to them today, starting with the former president who campaigned for Joe Biden in Florida.   BARACK OBAMA, 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: President for black folks since Abe Lincoln. Man, their son-in-law says black folks have to want to be successful. That's the problem. Who are these folks?",

They just assume we're just going to line up and vote for him, which usually is the case. And in 2016, Donald J. Trump came out and said, vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose? I think there's a lot of black folks still asking that question. Only now he has a whole record to run on.  For example, he's been very supportive of school choice. He's provided funding for the D.C. school voucher program, which Joe Biden wants to kill. Steady stream of income for the historically black colleges and universities, among other types of support. The first step back, this is a criminal justice reform measure that's benefited 3100 or so former prisoners who are now back to their normal lives trying to make something of themselves, many of them black. And you've got to put real emphasis on entrepreneurship and opportunity zones. 8700 opportunity zones, about $75 billion in private capital flowing in to create jobs and American dreams in minority communities, many of them black.   That sort of thing is very positive. This is actual achievement, actual accomplishment. We saw the lowest black unemployment rate in the country and the lowest black poverty rate in the country. First time in America, we've had black poverty below 20 percent in 2019 before the COVID-19 virus came in and wrecked everything. And now we're bouncing back from that. And I think if the president's four more years of economic growth and booming economy, I think there'd be very good things to come for black people. None of this was achieved under Obama-Biden, they had eight years to do these things and they did none of the above.",

I just don't see that from President Trump. Deroy makes the case about unemployment, which is something that the president often trumpets. But I think for most black people, you look at the record and you say, wait a minute, at the start of the recession, remember, President Obama came in and the rate there of black unemployment was nearly 18 percent, 17 plus something percent. And then it went down to about 6 percent before President Obama left office. And then as it went down further, President Trump said the lowest unemployment. I think people see that as kind of an empty balloon full of hot air. It's not real, but he likes to trumpet it and say that's evidence of what he's done for the black community. Similarly, he says, I've helped the historically black colleges and universities and people say, well, let's look at the record. And it's pretty much where other presidents have done.

It's my taxes for these black celebrities. I think that's a separate issue.  But it doesn't speak to what most young black men feel, which is alienated. And the biggest threat is they won't vote.

It's up at 47 percent as of the second quarter of 2020. Again, steady growth. This is a very big positive. There was a reduction in unemployment under Obama- Biden, it continued under President Trump because of deregulations, because of tax reductions, a greater more positive pro-business tone out of Washington rather than the Obama-Biden tone, which was, you didn't build that, terrible thing to say to entrepreneurs.

Most abortions in this country are not to, you know, sexually indiscriminate teens making. I mean, these are two married women, often women with other children who are making a determination about what's best for their families and for themselves, oftentimes in relationships. So, to me, I just think, again, you're trying to racialize an abortion issue. That to me, is a bigger issue for women of all colors.

He wasn't, he was out of office by that time and had been for some time. These are the kinds of things that elderly people run into. And there's no use pretending otherwise, which is why I think that the strategy that the Biden campaign has engaged in of keeping him campaigning to a minimum is wise because it gives him - he prepares well for debates.  He's done well in the debates, in my view. He's had a few moments, but he's done pretty well. And it keeps the focus on Trump and away from any of the kinds of senior moments that Biden might characteristically have makes sense.",

But later on, in his presidency, there was a lot of issues raised and reporters were fairly aggressive about it. They didn't have a medical diagnosis. But senility is not a medical term. It's an ordinary garden variety colloquialism, meaning, exhibiting the signs of old age, such as forgetfulness. But this doesn't get - the press will not touch this. They will not touch this, which, of course, makes the Biden strategy work even better. And that has been - that has been the effect of it. And I think that, this boils down to one thing, Martha. Many in the media regarded the election of Donald Trump as a kind of national emergency. And it was up to them, they felt to so treat Trump as to hopefully they saw it, get him out of office, but if not, make sure he didn't get re-elected.

Mr. Trump is extremely immature, he is not presidential and some of his ideologies are mind-boggling, especially when it comes to women and women of color. And as I thought about his last behavior regarding calling Kamala Harris a monster, there was no way in the world as a colored woman I could actually support anything that Mr. Trump would do. Now looking at Mr. Biden, Mr. Biden, like I said, I'm not a fan of his and I had to go back to 1991 and look at the Anita Hill case when he was the chair of the judiciary committee and she had accused Justice Clarence Thomas when he was nominated by George Bush to be on the Supreme Court and how he shunned a lot of women who were going to support the stories of Anita Hill, so that didn't register with me. So what I looked at, I looked at the debate between Pence and Harris and I had to say to myself, who would be more coachable, who would have an open ear to actually deal with issues regarding (Inaudible) and who would deal with women issues and that would be Kamala Harris. Who would be the most approachable? Kamala Harris. Who would have the ear of the president? Kamala Harris.

Both sides seen movement in this group and the campaign spoke directly to them today, starting with the former president who campaigned for Joe Biden in Florida.

They just assume we're just going to line up and vote for him, which usually is the case. And in 2016, Donald J. Trump came out and said, vote for me. What the hell do you have to lose? I think there's a lot of black folks still asking that question. Only now he has a whole record to run on. For example, he's been very supportive of school choice. He's provided funding for the D.C. school voucher program, which Joe Biden wants to kill. Steady stream of income for the historically black colleges and universities, among other types of support. The first step back, this is a criminal justice reform measure that's benefited 3100 or so former prisoners who are now back to their normal lives trying to make something of themselves, many of them black. And you've got to put real emphasis on entrepreneurship and opportunity zones. 8700 opportunity zones, about $75 billion in private capital flowing in to create jobs and American dreams in minority communities, many of them black. That sort of thing is very positive. This is actual achievement, actual accomplishment. We saw the lowest black unemployment rate in the country and the lowest black poverty rate in the country. First time in America, we've had black poverty below 20 percent in 2019 before the COVID-19 virus came in and wrecked everything. And now we're bouncing back from that. And I think if the president's four more years of economic growth and booming economy, I think there'd be very good things to come for black people. None of this was achieved under Obama-Biden, they had eight years to do these things and they did none of the above."

Older black men seem to be more in the Biden camp, at least according to some of the numbers out there.

      "utterance": "I think there's always reason to consider a Republican candidate, Martha, because you're looking for different ideas, ideas that might work for you and your family. I just don't see that from President Trump. Deroy makes the case about unemployment, which is something that the president often trumpets. But I think for most black people, you look at the record and you say, wait a minute, at the start of the recession, remember, President Obama came in and the rate there of black unemployment was nearly 18 percent, 17 plus something percent. And then it went down to about 6 percent before President Obama left office. And then as it went down further, President Trump said the lowest unemployment. I think people see that as kind of an empty balloon full of hot air. It's not real, but he likes to trumpet it and say that's evidence of what he's done for the black community. Similarly, he says, I've helped the historically black colleges and universities and people say, well, let's look at the record. And it's pretty much where other presidents have done. So, I think that there's a real issue."

And especially you look - you mention the celebrities. They're really talking about taxes. I think, one of them said, so what if he doesn't like black people? It's my taxes for these black celebrities. I think that's a separate issue. But it doesn't speak to what most young black men feel, which is alienated. And the biggest threat is they won't vote. That's why you see Obama on the campaign trail saying to people, get out and vote. That's why you see the NBA athletes, the NFL athletes, even the Major League Baseball players saying get out and vote."

      "utterance": "Yes, I would say, look, one key variable you've seen is at the end of Obama, -Biden's term, black homeownership was at 41.7 percent. It's up at 47 percent as of the second quarter of 2020. Again, steady growth. This is a very big positive. There was a reduction in unemployment under Obama- Biden, it continued under President Trump because of deregulations, because of tax reductions, a greater more positive pro-business tone out of Washington rather than the Obama-Biden tone, which was, you didn't build that, terrible thing to say to entrepreneurs. This is all very, very positive thing. And if it were not for the Chinese virus, which came in and caused such havoc, I think he'd be well on his way to a huge victory, including a large victory among black Americans."

So, school choice is a big issue. The other one that has come up quite a bit lately is the question of abortion. And, I was listening last night on Tucker show, Candace Owens was talking about this with respect to the Amy Coney Barrett ceremony and swearing in. And here's what she - she was speaking directly to black voters and here's what she had to say about this. Watch this."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right, I think everybody in the world would say that's a shocking number. But the reality is that abortion is under the Supreme Court and in our country is a right. It's a matter of privacy. People can make that decision on their own. We shouldn't be telling them; big government shouldn't be intervening in people's lives. Most abortions in this country are not to, you know, sexually indiscriminate teens making. I mean, these are two married women, often women with other children who are making a determination about what's best for their families and for themselves, oftentimes in relationships. So, to me, I just think, again, you're trying to racialize an abortion issue. That to me, is a bigger issue for women of all colors. And certainly, if you ask the American people, it's close to two-thirds who say that they believe Roe v. Wade and abortion rights should be upheld by this court."

And the campaign, though believes that this state is competitive, and it could become part of the path to 270. The local activists out here really laid the groundwork after a series of narrow losses in 2017 and 2018, including Stacey Abrams, who lost the governor's race by about 55,000 votes.

You can't call things to mind as quickly as you once did. Some of his mistakes, I think of the classic kind of gaffes that Biden has always made. For example, that comment he made, remember about if you can't, he said if you can't figure out whether you're going to vote for me or Trump, you're not black. That was a classic Biden gaffe of the kind of he's made since he was a young man. He's always made a lot of those gaffes. More recently though, we hear that he has these moments where he kind of forgets where he is. Remember earlier this year he was in New Hampshire, in New Hampshire. And he said, what's not to like about Vermont? And then at one point, he couldn't remember that he had met with the Parkland students. He said he'd done it while he was in the White House. He wasn't, he was out of office by that time and had been for some time. These are the kinds of things that elderly people run into. And there's no use pretending otherwise, which is why I think that the strategy that the Biden campaign has engaged in of keeping him campaigning to a minimum is wise because it gives him - he prepares well for debates. He's done well in the debates, in my view. He's had a few moments, but he's done pretty well. And it keeps the focus on Trump and away from any of the kinds of senior moments that Biden might characteristically have makes sense."

After a particularly funny news conference, he relayed the assessment of a friend watching the press handle Joe Biden is like watching someone make sure a three-year-old wins a candy land. So, you have covered presidential elections for decades, Brit. I mean, why is this happening. Both candidates need to be scrutinized and scrutinized well, I mean that's what this coverage is all about. But he really has not had any."

      "utterance": "This coverage of Biden's loss of cognitive function is something he would certainly be expected of any other candidate. Remember, there was a lot of discussion about Ronald Reagan, even back during his reelection campaign as to whether he'd lost it. And he managed to recover after a bad first debate and put those put those matters to rest. But later on, in his presidency, there was a lot of issues raised and reporters were fairly aggressive about it. They didn't have a medical diagnosis. But senility is not a medical term. It's an ordinary garden variety colloquialism, meaning, exhibiting the signs of old age, such as forgetfulness. But this doesn't get - the press will not touch this. They will not touch this, which, of course, makes the Biden strategy work even better. And that has been - that has been the effect of it. And I think that, this boils down to one thing, Martha. Many in the media regarded the election of Donald Trump as a kind of national emergency. And it was up to them, they felt to so treat Trump as to hopefully they saw it, get him out of office, but if not, make sure he didn't get re-elected. And they're doing the best they can in that regard. He gets relentless painless scrutiny and Biden gets very little."

I remember Martha, very well what happened four years later when the key battleground state that was in play that night was Ohio. And we came on before anybody else did and called Ohio. You saw just briefly there the face of Michael Barone before I popped up in that in that clip you showed and Michael Barone was with us that night in 2004, four years later, when we were pretty apprehensive about being first again, was it call that Bush had won the presidency? And we went to Michael and he reeled off a discussion about the state of Ohio and its demographics and so forth. It was dazzling.

That is what the liberal voices on the left want to do. That's what Joe Biden doesn't want to acknowledge what his position is on but trust me, if he is forced and pushed by the left, there's no way he would stand up to that pressure and we are seeing that is what the left wants.

Quick question for you with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, who some say tipped his hand a bit in terms of the way he would view these cases with regard to a contested election. He said -- he says under the U.S. Constitution the state courts do not have a blank check to rewrite state election laws for federal elections.

      "utterance": "Well, here's the thing with me. I don't like Mr. Trump and I did not like Mr. Joe Biden, so my decision was really based upon Mr. Pence and Ms. Kamala Harris. Because what I wanted to know that if they ran into any type of situation, which particular V.P. would actually have the ear of the president. Now the last four years we saw Mr. Pence in action with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump is extremely immature, he is not presidential and some of his ideologies are mind-boggling, especially when it comes to women and women of color. And as I thought about his last behavior regarding calling Kamala Harris a monster, there was no way in the world as a colored woman I could actually support anything that Mr. Trump would do. Now looking at Mr. Biden, Mr. Biden, like I said, I'm not a fan of his and I had to go back to 1991 and look at the Anita Hill case when he was the chair of the judiciary committee and she had accused Justice Clarence Thomas when he was nominated by George Bush to be on the Supreme Court and how he shunned a lot of women who were going to support the stories of Anita Hill, so that didn't register with me. So what I looked at, I looked at the debate between Pence and Harris and I had to say to myself, who would be more coachable, who would have an open ear to actually deal with issues regarding (Inaudible) and who would deal with women issues and that would be Kamala Harris. Who would be the most approachable? Kamala Harris. Who would have the ear of the president? Kamala Harris. So, on that note as far as you know, rectifying some of this racial divide, I had to go with someone who would actually speak out on the benefit of every single American, especially now that we are dealing with COVID-19 and that would be the Biden and Harris team."

I've had similar thoughts. I, you know, healthcare is a big thing to me and I don't know that either Biden or Trump have impressed me with that. I like, you know, that Biden wants to cap families at 8.5 percent of their income for health insurance, but it's not sustainable with this public option, so that doesn't really win me over. I am also very concerned about there not being checks and balances as far as if the president and the Senate and the House are all Democrat, that's not the way our democracy was set up and so I am leaning towards voting for Trump and Pence. I am always disappointed and President Trump's behavior, but because we are small business owners and because of the Republican platform, that's the way I'm leaning at this time. But like I said, I go back and forth a lot. I'm not sure I'm going to know until I just actually do it."
