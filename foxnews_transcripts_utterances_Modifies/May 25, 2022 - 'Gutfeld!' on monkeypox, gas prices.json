We're going to keep it super light this evening because yesterday and today was pretty heavy and it was heavy for everyone. But my job is to offer some break or a place to come up for air and breathe especially in ugly times, so with that, onto tonight's monologue. So how about that monkeypox? There is a transition you don't see. We'd beat COVID and now we got monkeypox. From an update, let's go live to some monkeys.",

We're following CDC guidelines to keep at least six feet of distance from the closest chimp. But there are no concerns here. Well, except for this weird rash I just got on my back. In all seriousness, 200 people are being monitored for infection in Massachusetts after coming into contact with a confirmed case, and it's not Liz Warren, although she now claims she's 13 percent primate. But the virus may have been spreading for months. And experts claim that they've even been suspected cases in Salt Lake City. So who was just in Salt Lake City? Sunday, actually. I never should have gone to the zoo. I also shouldn't have hopped the fence to hang out in the enclosure. But I could have sworn that orangutans winked at me. Don't laugh, Tyrus.",

      "sentences": "Well, I bet Putin is relieved Joe isn't blaming him anymore. So only then did Biden pay lip service to millions of Americans as they experienced an incredible transition of money from their paychecks to the pumps. Calling this crisis a transition is like saying Caitlyn Jenner used to be kind of a tomboy. And we're supposed to chalk it up to progress. And now we're told there are going to be blackouts. I'm sure if you asked Joe about them, he'll say what's the big deal, man I blackouts all the time. So in case you're wondering if this administration feels your pain, they don't, but they sure are great at creating it. Even if they did feel your pain, they still think it's good for you. That reminds me of tonight's bondage night at Duties. We're all those always welcome as long as he doesn't remove the ball gag. But I posed this question before. What if -- what makes our lives worse is exactly what the Dems in the media wanted all along. It's not just a bunch of unexpected side effects like the time I took those pills, I found a Dana Perino's purse, I didn't care for the diarrhea, but at least I won't have heartworm. Sure, gas prices are high, but isn't that what the left wants the same way the anti-tobacco folks wanted a pack of cigs to cost 20 bucks so you'd quit? Sure, cheap, plentiful, clean gas heats your home, but it's morally reprehensible. It's far better to price you out of affordable heat, which surprises rich white lives can endure while the rest of you have to decide whether to fill your tank or serve your kids Alpo in the shape of meatloaf and hope they don't notice. This is the chemo to cure you have your fossil fuel addiction, and it's forced upon you by an old fossil in the White House himself. Maybe that's why Joe hates fossil fuels. For him, it's cannibalism. But this is part of the oppression theology because you live in the greatest country ever. You're guilty. Sure, the crime wave is bad, but Law and Order is inherently racist so deal with it. If you are cops, more criminals, that's the price you pay for the revolution. And for the left, anarchy creates chaos and chaos creates change. They want you angry, desperate, and confused, like a car crash victim or someone whose TV is stuck in the view. I wonder what Joe Biden thinks about all this.",

At least that's according to a new study from the University of Pennsylvania, the school for people who couldn't get into college.

Weird analogy, I agree. But the study's authors claim the media Stokes the supposed hatred between parties and it clouds people's better judgment to a fault. By pointing this out they hope to \"clear up some of the misperceptions people have about how much they are hated by their political opponents, and by extension, discourage people from feeding their own hostility.\" Well, what a bunch of -- I kid.

And we probably shouldn't have called her home phone -- because she doesn't have one, Banderas. It's the joke. She also says the minimum wage should be $30 an hour, I guess she thinks rising inflation means putting too much air in your home's tires. But she's full of practical ideas. We await her plan to generate electricity from stupidity. Meanwhile, Tennessee, that's a state. They're taking a different approach, making homeless camps on public land a felony. The law goes into effect on July 1st and criminalizes tent cities in parks and local public property punishable by up to six years in prison. Six years, seems harsh, but I get it, we let the crazies take over our streets. And now some states are taking the streets back. Now, if only they could take the streets, streets back from these people. You know, it'll also be the fourth time I say this today, Joe, but that's a lot of ducks. Fourth time. Fourth time.

But my job is to offer some break or a place to come up for air and breathe especially in ugly times, so with that, onto tonight's monologue. So how about that monkeypox? There is a transition you don't see. We'd beat COVID and now we got monkeypox. From an update, let's go live to some monkeys."

We're following CDC guidelines to keep at least six feet of distance from the closest chimp. But there are no concerns here. Well, except for this weird rash I just got on my back. In all seriousness, 200 people are being monitored for infection in Massachusetts after coming into contact with a confirmed case, and it's not Liz Warren, although she now claims she's 13 percent primate. But the virus may have been spreading for months. And experts claim that they've even been suspected cases in Salt Lake City. So who was just in Salt Lake City? Sunday, actually. I never should have gone to the zoo. I also shouldn't have hopped the fence to hang out in the enclosure. But I could have sworn that orangutans winked at me. Don't laugh, Tyrus."

      "utterance": "Well, I bet Putin is relieved Joe isn't blaming him anymore. So only then did Biden pay lip service to millions of Americans as they experienced an incredible transition of money from their paychecks to the pumps. Calling this crisis a transition is like saying Caitlyn Jenner used to be kind of a tomboy. And we're supposed to chalk it up to progress. And now we're told there are going to be blackouts. I'm sure if you asked Joe about them, he'll say what's the big deal, man I blackouts all the time. So in case you're wondering if this administration feels your pain, they don't, but they sure are great at creating it. Even if they did feel your pain, they still think it's good for you. That reminds me of tonight's bondage night at Duties. We're all those always welcome as long as he doesn't remove the ball gag. But I posed this question before. What if -- what makes our lives worse is exactly what the Dems in the media wanted all along. It's not just a bunch of unexpected side effects like the time I took those pills, I found a Dana Perino's purse, I didn't care for the diarrhea, but at least I won't have heartworm. Sure, gas prices are high, but isn't that what the left wants the same way the anti-tobacco folks wanted a pack of cigs to cost 20 bucks so you'd quit? Sure, cheap, plentiful, clean gas heats your home, but it's morally reprehensible. It's far better to price you out of affordable heat, which surprises rich white lives can endure while the rest of you have to decide whether to fill your tank or serve your kids Alpo in the shape of meatloaf and hope they don't notice. This is the chemo to cure you have your fossil fuel addiction, and it's forced upon you by an old fossil in the White House himself. Maybe that's why Joe hates fossil fuels. For him, it's cannibalism. But this is part of the oppression theology because you live in the greatest country ever. You're guilty. Sure, the crime wave is bad, but Law and Order is inherently racist so deal with it. If you are cops, more criminals, that's the price you pay for the revolution. And for the left, anarchy creates chaos and chaos creates change. They want you angry, desperate, and confused, like a car crash victim or someone whose TV is stuck in the view. I wonder what Joe Biden thinks about all this."

At least that's according to a new study from the University of Pennsylvania, the school for people who couldn't get into college. Their football team is named the Quakers, which means the players probably do go to class because they're not good. Anyway, research has found that the main reason Americans choose and stay loyal to a party has more to do with the love than hate, i.e. it's not that either side wants to trash the other's beliefs it's the -- it's that like a quality pair of boxer briefs, they just want to support their own. Weird analogy, I agree. But the study's authors claim the media Stokes the supposed hatred between parties and it clouds people's better judgment to a fault. By pointing this out they hope to \"clear up some of the misperceptions people have about how much they are hated by their political opponents, and by extension, discourage people from feeding their own hostility.\" Well, what a bunch of -- I kid.

And we probably shouldn't have called her home phone -- because she doesn't have one, Banderas. It's the joke. She also says the minimum wage should be $30 an hour, I guess she thinks rising inflation means putting too much air in your home's tires. But she's full of practical ideas. We await her plan to generate electricity from stupidity. Meanwhile, Tennessee, that's a state. They're taking a different approach, making homeless camps on public land a felony. The law goes into effect on July 1st and criminalizes tent cities in parks and local public property punishable by up to six years in prison. Six years, seems harsh, but I get it, we let the crazies take over our streets. And now some states are taking the streets back. Now, if only they could take the streets, streets back from these people. You know, it'll also be the fourth time I say this today, Joe, but that's a lot of ducks. Fourth time. Fourth time.
