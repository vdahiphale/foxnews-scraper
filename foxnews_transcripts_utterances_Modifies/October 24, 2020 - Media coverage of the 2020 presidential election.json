It's sad that he has no one in his life looking out for him. If he did, he'd never leave his house without his underwear on his head.   It's a lesson to us all. If you're in a-hole to everyone when you're rich and famous, no one will bother to help you when you're now just in a-hole alone and miserable. But Trump has a way of making his critics unravel and then unbuckle. That's CNN legal analyst. He files his briefs instead of wearing them. I throw the tape of the media reporting of this story, but they didn't. Searches for Toobin video are up this week, but all you get is this.",

      "sentences": "Memories. But I'm sure the excuse is the story is too gross. I wonder what their excuse is for Hunter. But I'm sure if a pro-Trump had pulled Toobin, CNN would have the screen grabs. The Gallup poll would be replaced with a different one. But here, it's just an honest mistake because Trump's President Toobin is so necessary. The daily news among others said we need Mr. Toobin back on the job more than ever. Yes, he needs even more exposure. It makes you wonder what kind of grip he has on Jeff Zucker. But at least, Toobin wasn't malicious. Unlike this hairball of hysteria.  This week, Robert Reich demanded a commission to deal with those who hadn't joined the heroic resistance. You know, once Biden wins. This commission would name everyone who supported Trump and mete out whatever punishments were deemed fit. It's ghoulish.   Under the guise of reconciliation, he calls for a witch hunt, where the winners punish the defeated or half the country. Funny how we'd never do that to them. Are we better people? But if that tells you what's acceptable behavior to them if they win, what the hell is acceptable if they lose? Think about that.  Joe Biden made the claim that only he could stop the mob violence plaguing our cities, and a vote for Trump would only lead to more as if Trump is in charge of Antifa going out at night in his slippers and house coat to deface a few statues, beat people bloody and destroy homes and businesses. Biden's premise was extortion, and it makes us wonder: Joe, you told us the violence would stop if you win. But what if you lose? What do you tell your supporters then and its deranged vindictive subset children of the elite who roam the streets harming the law-abiding, who burn the buildings? What will you do to stop that?  The question should also be posed to the media who ginned up audience rage in a four-year hysteria spell. They branded Trump a monster who must be stopped. But what if he doesn't leave? What if he wins?  What if you promise a pony to your kids for Christmas, and instead they get a lump of Trump? It's troubling. In NYC, as we edge toward the abyss, its Mayor who wanders the streets for hours, daily, instead of protecting his citizens, a patchwork of every bad left-wing idea that has oozed from the hate-filled classrooms of our failing academia. De Blasio lumbers the alley, he is like a mopey Frankenstein monster scaring children and people with sense.  You could compare him to Nero fiddling while Rome burned, but at least Nero could fiddle. But it's not just de Blasio, it's everything he came from, everything that protects him, everything that sees what is coming and still does nothing.   It's a distressing time in which our city leaders, our media, our entertainment and academic freeloaders refuse to share the risk and rise up to condemn the coming mobs. They won't even talk about it even when it presents itself. And so our industry obsesses over the days leading up to the election, but not a peep about what follows, which is not just foolish, it's dangerous. Sure, pay attention to the road ahead, but what about the cliff at the end of it? What if the election is close? What if there's mail fraud? What if there's no immediate outcome? Or what if the outcome outrages those who control the airwaves, who control the social media platforms and the algorithms that gin up so much discontent?  What about the leftists who tweet \"Burn it all down\"? It seems the only plan for now is to let it burn.",

But when they talk about Truth and Reconciliation Commissions and people, names will have to be named, we're going to have to make lists. I mean, I know it's hyperbolic to talk about Nazism and how it rose because everyone calls everyone a Nazi these days.  But this is actually it when you're making lists of the bad people. And we're going to re-educate people and gulags and the rest of it. And you're right, Greg, what you said in the monologue, it's like, we don't do this.

I think to Dave's point as well, like the never Trumpers and the sort of Vichy Republicans that have been hiding under their desk, hoping this kind of all blows over and it's not going to bother them. It isn't. The only way to defeat these people is to politically smash them. I mean, smash them, politically. And so -- because every time we try to reason with them, that's not going to happen. Anytime people say well, you know, we've got to give them a little bit. They're not -- they're voracious. They take whatever they want.   And I'm ready. I hope well -- I know the people that I am friends with, the people I served in the military with, we're pretty much ready for this, but I think a lot of people in the United States aren't.

It's sad that he has no one in his life looking out for him. If he did, he'd never leave his house without his underwear on his head. It's a lesson to us all. If you're in a-hole to everyone when you're rich and famous, no one will bother to help you when you're now just in a-hole alone and miserable. But Trump has a way of making his critics unravel and then unbuckle. That's CNN legal analyst. He files his briefs instead of wearing them. I throw the tape of the media reporting of this story, but they didn't. Searches for Toobin video are up this week, but all you get is this."

But I'm sure if a pro-Trump had pulled Toobin, CNN would have the screen grabs. The Gallup poll would be replaced with a different one. But here, it's just an honest mistake because Trump's President Toobin is so necessary. The daily news among others said we need Mr. Toobin back on the job more than ever. Yes, he needs even more exposure. It makes you wonder what kind of grip he has on Jeff Zucker. But at least, Toobin wasn't malicious. Unlike this hairball of hysteria. This week, Robert Reich demanded a commission to deal with those who hadn't joined the heroic resistance. You know, once Biden wins. This commission would name everyone who supported Trump and mete out whatever punishments were deemed fit. It's ghoulish. Under the guise of reconciliation, he calls for a witch hunt, where the winners punish the defeated or half the country. Funny how we'd never do that to them. Are we better people? But if that tells you what's acceptable behavior to them if they win, what the hell is acceptable if they lose? Think about that. Joe Biden made the claim that only he could stop the mob violence plaguing our cities, and a vote for Trump would only lead to more as if Trump is in charge of Antifa going out at night in his slippers and house coat to deface a few statues, beat people bloody and destroy homes and businesses."

What do you tell your supporters then and its deranged vindictive subset children of the elite who roam the streets harming the law-abiding, who burn the buildings? What will you do to stop that? The question should also be posed to the media who ginned up audience rage in a four-year hysteria spell. They branded Trump a monster who must be stopped. But what if he doesn't leave? What if he wins? What if you promise a pony to your kids for Christmas, and instead they get a lump of Trump? It's troubling. In NYC, as we edge toward the abyss, its Mayor who wanders the streets for hours, daily, instead of protecting his citizens, a patchwork of every bad left-wing idea that has oozed from the hate-filled classrooms of our failing academia. De Blasio lumbers the alley, he is like a mopey Frankenstein monster scaring children and people with sense. You could compare him to Nero fiddling while Rome burned, but at least Nero could fiddle. But it's not just de Blasio, it's everything he came from, everything that protects him, everything that sees what is coming and still does nothing. It's a distressing time in which our city leaders, our media, our entertainment and academic freeloaders refuse to share the risk and rise up to condemn the coming mobs. They won't even talk about it even when it presents itself. And so our industry obsesses over the days leading up to the election, but not a peep about what follows, which is not just foolish, it's dangerous. Sure, pay attention to the road ahead, but what about the cliff at the end of it? What if the election is close? What if there's mail fraud? What if there's no immediate outcome? Or what if the outcome outrages those who control the airwaves, who control the social media platforms and the algorithms that gin up so much discontent? What about the leftists who tweet \"Burn it all down\"? It seems the only plan for now is to let it burn."

And the only way that you can get people not to say, oh, you know, you've gotten everything wrong forever, is to be able to point and say, oh, orange man bad. But when they talk about Truth and Reconciliation Commissions and people, names will have to be named, we're going to have to make lists. I mean, I know it's hyperbolic to talk about Nazism and how it rose because everyone calls everyone a Nazi these days. But this is actually it when you're making lists of the bad people. And we're going to re-educate people and gulags and the rest of it. And you're right, Greg, what you said in the monologue, it's like, we don't do this.

And they're telling -- they've been telling you they're going to do it. I think to Dave's point as well, like the never Trumpers and the sort of Vichy Republicans that have been hiding under their desk, hoping this kind of all blows over and it's not going to bother them. It isn't. The only way to defeat these people is to politically smash them. I mean, smash them, politically. And so -- because every time we try to reason with them, that's not going to happen. Anytime people say well, you know, we've got to give them a little bit. They're not -- they're voracious. They take whatever they want. And I'm ready. I hope well -- I know the people that I am friends with, the people I served in the military with, we're pretty much ready for this, but I think a lot of people in the United States aren't.

We do this constantly. What should have been a walk in the park debate turned out to be where the bar is so low that Joe gets rave reviews because he crossed the finish line, and whose fault is that? It's our fault. And we didn't hear -- I think President Trump wasted way too much time attacking Joe. It doesn't work. I think it would have been -- I was waiting to hear about some infrastructure. I was waiting to hear about what his second term was going to look like. I think that's the only thing that I really felt like, he didn't even need to acknowledge Joe because Joe will - - Rambling Joe will be Rambling Joe. And I really thought that he missed an opportunity there since he wasn't ferocious and whoever he kept looking at to calm him down, because he kept looking off and I think maybe it was the wife going you've got this. You're good. Remember what we talked about. But, just again, it was one of those things where both sides represented. They pleased their base, and I don't see like anybody -- the needle didn't go either way. They got through a debate. They both gave off their ideas. They both had good moments. But you know, I wanted to flip over to the to the game, but it was the Eagles and the Giants, so I mean, I literally, really couldn't -- you know, I was losing that night because it just wasn't -- he was just not doing what I want him to do in terms of don't even acknowledge them, the other side. Focus on what we're going to do, what the plan is and let people get energized and excited about what's coming. And you know, Terry, you don't have to read the encyclopedias to sell them.

You know, I stopped trusting people in power over me when I was four and I found out my parents lied to me about Santa. And I get that that was a little young. So if it is not you, then congrats on the childhood magic, whatever.

So I'm very anti-bubble. I don't like the bubble. I don't want anything to do with the bubble."

He was ejected from the turret. He went in there six times, covered with fuel, on fire, saved his guys and he was awarded the Silver Star. We are pushing that to be a medal of honor. We have a lot of people on board. The Senate just needs to get off their ass and make this happen. This is the right thing, Sergeant Alwyn Cashe deserves the Medal of Honor."
