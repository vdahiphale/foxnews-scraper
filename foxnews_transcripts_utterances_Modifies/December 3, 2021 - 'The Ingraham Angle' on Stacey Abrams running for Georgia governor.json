      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Joe Biden has had a very strange 24-hour Odyssey from a bizarre Christmas tree lighting to a press conference today, where he could barely squeak out a word. Well, Raymond Arroyo breaks it all down in Friday Follies. But first, Stacey Abrams rides again, that's the focus of tonight's angle. All right, let's say you're lucky enough to be driving a newer model, let's say, a Porsche SUV with low mileage in pristine condition. And some schmuck approaches you in a parking lot, walks up to you and asked if you'd be willing to trade it for his 2002 Mitsubishi. It's dented on the driver's side and has a muffler hanging off the back. You'd burst out laughing, right? Well, that's what Georgia voters response should be upon hearing that Stacey Abrams is once again running for governor. Why on earth would voters there want to give up economic policies that deliver safety, prosperity and job growth for the misery of places like California, New York? Four years of Governor Abrams, oh, that would mean four years of poisonous racial recriminations. Four years of high taxes on businesses and families. Four years of mask and vaccine mandates. Four years of smash and grabs, increasing violent crime, and four years of anti-American propaganda in Georgia schools. In other words, four years of economic and cultural decline. Now, we've seen how this movie ends in blue states across America. What we told you at the start of the pandemic, when blue states refused to open was that the red states that reopened early would leave them all behind. And that's precisely what has happened. Check out today's headline in California Sacramento Bee. The economy is booming. So why is California's unemployment rate so high? I don't know. Maybe devastating stay at home orders. They got millions used to being at home and getting paid for it. Generous unemployment benefits and outrageous taxes have sent businesses like Tesla fleeing the state to friendlier places like Nevada and Texas. California's only clawed back about two-thirds of the 2.7 million jobs they lost since the pandemic began. In fact, they don't expect a full recovery until the end of 2023. And I think that's generous. But, of course, just as they protect Gavin Newsom from culpability, the press would protect Abrams if she ever won state office again. She'd never be held accountable, no matter how bad things got. Now compare California's train wreck to the economic miracle that's been unfolding in the Peach State under Republican Governor Brian Kemp. Georgia's unemployment rate dropped to 3.1 percent in October, the lowest rates since the Feds began keeping records back in 1976. Now remember, Kemp was smart enough to end the lock downs earliest, earliest of all states, even though he was criticized for it by everyone from President Trump, to Pelosi and even Abrams herself.",

That month over month, job growth was over 20,000. So Abrams can't span away hard facts. Its red states like Georgia that are driving almost all of the nation's job growth now, from the Wall Street Journal. The pandemic heightened the economic policy differences between the two political parties. The states have provided a market test and GOP policies won. The White House is taking credit for the pandemic policy results in Florida and Georgia, not in New York or California. Stacey Abrams cannot leave Georgia because she's incapable of telling the truth, even when she's been caught on tape. Now last night, she claimed that she never contested the election back in 2018.",

Atlanta is tied with Washington, D.C. and Forbes recent study of where African Americans are doing best economically. So what exactly is Stacey Abrams done to help Georgia since she lost in 2018? Well, she led the crusade to push the Major League Baseball All Star game out of Atlanta. What did that do? Will it cost the majority black city of Atlanta up to $70 million in lost business. Georgia, this isn't even a close call. Why on earth would you want to sink into the decline and decay that we're seeing in blue states across America? Georgians don't need Abrams to ride to the rescue. They need her to ride into the sunset and for good, and that's the angle. Joining me now, Candace Owens, host of the Candace Owens Show and founder of Blexit. Candace, Abrams strikes me as not only destructive as a politician but she she feels entitled to the governorship, your reaction? CANDACE OWENS, \"THE CANDACE OWENS SHOW\" HOST: Yes, she does feel entitled. I think that she's one of those people that you can say is true to her soul, a Black Lives Matter activist. And I don't mean that in a good way. I'm talking about, you know, illogically always throwing race into the narrative, thinks that she's -- she should be the first that people should listen to everything she says, simply because she's a black woman. And she really does have bad policies. And let's also -- let's not forget, he's also impossibly corrupt. You know, Stacey Abrams, it was her sister that was a federal judge, who dismissed when they wanted to clean up their voter rolls in Georgia. She wants to make sure people can get on the voter rolls that are not eligible to vote, to make sure that she can win elections. So she is somebody that you should watch out for. I can't imagine why any person, any sane individual would want her leading their state unless you are a glutton for crime, a glutton for punishment. You're a fan of maybe the Batman movies and you want to see what it looks like to live in Gotham City. But there's really no reason that any sane person would want to turn Georgia into a New York or an L.A. situation. But like I said, people should pay attention because she is very corrupt, and she is very connected. And she has shown in the past that she will do nothing to stop winning, to stop herself from winning.",

They think that's because somebody looks like them, that person is going to get into office is going to further the things that they need to get done. And that's just not true. The evidence, as you said, is shown by the city of Atlanta, and it's thrived under Republican leadership. And that's because it doesn't matter what your race is in this country. The policies that work are the policies and the ideas that this country was founded upon. Free market policies, opening the economy, you know, not forcing businesses shut down, because you have fears about a virus. Allow people to make their decisions by themselves as individuals. Allowing free market competition. And she stands for the exact opposite. She believes that people should be placed in society, the pecking order according to their race. You know, if you are black and you are a woman, you should be ahead of someone because you're white. It is not the right way to look at in economy.

That is going to be a problem throughout America, whether it's natural gas from heating oil or propane. These are the real sufferings that the American people are going through on Joe Biden's watch.

Joe Biden has had a very strange 24-hour Odyssey from a bizarre Christmas tree lighting to a press conference today, where he could barely squeak out a word. Well, Raymond Arroyo breaks it all down in Friday Follies. But first, Stacey Abrams rides again, that's the focus of tonight's angle. All right, let's say you're lucky enough to be driving a newer model, let's say, a Porsche SUV with low mileage in pristine condition. And some schmuck approaches you in a parking lot, walks up to you and asked if you'd be willing to trade it for his 2002 Mitsubishi. It's dented on the driver's side and has a muffler hanging off the back. You'd burst out laughing, right? Well, that's what Georgia voters response should be upon hearing that Stacey Abrams is once again running for governor. Why on earth would voters there want to give up economic policies that deliver safety, prosperity and job growth for the misery of places like California, New York? Four years of Governor Abrams, oh, that would mean four years of poisonous racial recriminations. Four years of high taxes on businesses and families. Four years of mask and vaccine mandates. Four years of smash and grabs, increasing violent crime, and four years of anti-American propaganda in Georgia schools. In other words, four years of economic and cultural decline. Now, we've seen how this movie ends in blue states across America. What we told you at the start of the pandemic, when blue states refused to open was that the red states that reopened early would leave them all behind. And that's precisely what has happened. Check out today's headline in California Sacramento Bee. The economy is booming. So why is California's unemployment rate so high? I don't know. Maybe devastating stay at home orders. They got millions used to being at home and getting paid for it. Generous unemployment benefits and outrageous taxes have sent businesses like Tesla fleeing the state to friendlier places like Nevada and Texas. California's only clawed back about two-thirds of the 2.7 million jobs they lost since the pandemic began. In fact, they don't expect a full recovery until the end of 2023. And I think that's generous. But, of course, just as they protect Gavin Newsom from culpability, the press would protect Abrams if she ever won state office again. She'd never be held accountable, no matter how bad things got. Now compare California's train wreck to the economic miracle that's been unfolding in the Peach State under Republican Governor Brian Kemp. Georgia's unemployment rate dropped to 3.1 percent in October, the lowest rates since the Feds began keeping records back in 1976. Now remember, Kemp was smart enough to end the lock downs earliest, earliest of all states, even though he was criticized for it by everyone from President Trump, to Pelosi and even Abrams herself."

Its red states like Georgia that are driving almost all of the nation's job growth now, from the Wall Street Journal. The pandemic heightened the economic policy differences between the two political parties. The states have provided a market test and GOP policies won. The White House is taking credit for the pandemic policy results in Florida and Georgia, not in New York or California. Stacey Abrams cannot leave Georgia because she's incapable of telling the truth, even when she's been caught on tape. Now last night, she claimed that she never contested the election back in 2018."

Atlanta is tied with Washington, D.C. and Forbes recent study of where African Americans are doing best economically. So what exactly is Stacey Abrams done to help Georgia since she lost in 2018? Well, she led the crusade to push the Major League Baseball All Star game out of Atlanta. What did that do? Will it cost the majority black city of Atlanta up to $70 million in lost business. Georgia, this isn't even a close call. Why on earth would you want to sink into the decline and decay that we're seeing in blue states across America? Georgians don't need Abrams to ride to the rescue. They need her to ride into the sunset and for good, and that's the angle. Joining me now, Candace Owens, host of the Candace Owens Show and founder of Blexit. Candace, Abrams strikes me as not only destructive as a politician but she she feels entitled to the governorship, your reaction? CANDACE OWENS, \"THE CANDACE OWENS SHOW\" HOST: Yes, she does feel entitled. I think that she's one of those people that you can say is true to her soul, a Black Lives Matter activist. And I don't mean that in a good way. I'm talking about, you know, illogically always throwing race into the narrative, thinks that she's -- she should be the first that people should listen to everything she says, simply because she's a black woman. And she really does have bad policies. And let's also -- let's not forget, he's also impossibly corrupt. You know, Stacey Abrams, it was her sister that was a federal judge, who dismissed when they wanted to clean up their voter rolls in Georgia. She wants to make sure people can get on the voter rolls that are not eligible to vote, to make sure that she can win elections. So she is somebody that you should watch out for. I can't imagine why any person, any sane individual would want her leading their state unless you are a glutton for crime, a glutton for punishment. You're a fan of maybe the Batman movies and you want to see what it looks like to live in Gotham City. But there's really no reason that any sane person would want to turn Georgia into a New York or an L.A. situation. But like I said, people should pay attention because she is very corrupt, and she is very connected. And she has shown in the past that she will do nothing to stop winning, to stop herself from winning."

And, unfortunately, in too many circumstances, it works amongst black Democratic voters. They think that's because somebody looks like them, that person is going to get into office is going to further the things that they need to get done. And that's just not true. The evidence, as you said, is shown by the city of Atlanta, and it's thrived under Republican leadership. And that's because it doesn't matter what your race is in this country. The policies that work are the policies and the ideas that this country was founded upon. Free market policies, opening the economy, you know, not forcing businesses shut down, because you have fears about a virus. Allow people to make their decisions by themselves as individuals. Allowing free market competition. And she stands for the exact opposite. She believes that people should be placed in society, the pecking order according to their race. You know, if you are black and you are a woman, you should be ahead of someone because you're white. It is not the right way to look at in economy. It's not the right way to look at Georgia as a state. And, unfortunately, people don't wake up to that and understand that.

The Washington Post Josh Rogin is reporting that, \"Administration sources confirmed that in an October call between Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Senator Jeff Merkley, co-sponsor of the Uyghur Force Labor Act, Sherman made it clear that the administration prefers a more targeted and deliberative approach to determining which goods are the products of forced labor.\" Stephen, translate that for us, would you?"

      "speaker": "MILLER",
      "utterance": "Well, the translation is that the Biden administration is soft on genocide. I mean, what you're seeing now is unthinkable. It is morally unthinkable, it is ethically unthinkable. And it's politically unthinkable. If this were to be understood and exposed to the whole American people, that in order, I suppose, to get China to agree to some empty climate statements, they're going to let him off the hook on genocide? And that's what I think's going on here, Laura, is that John Kerry wants him to sign some non-binding agreements. So we'll kind of -- we'll slow walk this whole genocide thing. I would urge the Republicans who are bravely pushing this to keep it up. Don't stop, don't let it go. Keep fighting on this until everyone in the country knows what this administration is doing."

So after what was -- and I think it was like a 15-minute standoff with the state police, the Republicans ended up streaming into the hall once they realize the troopers just weren't going to stop them. Now at that point, the Republicans remained in the chamber for over two hours as frantic Democrats tried desperately to seek ways to remove them. Here now are the two men behind this effort. Assemblymen Erik Peterson and Hal Wirths. Assemblyman Peterson, let me start with you. So what happened? Take us through it when you originally attempted to enter onto the floor."

When we first came to the statehouse, we were told the state police were going to stand down and weren't going to stop us. When I got there, there were hundreds and hundreds of state troopers outside, inside all over the place in the State House, as if there was some kind of riot going to happen. And I -- it was done to intimidate us. And I got to tell you, it had the opposite effect. It pissed me off. And we decided as a caucus that we were going to enter into our chambers that we have a legal right and a constitutional right to do. And when we got up to where we were going to enter in, I was the first person across the threshold into the chambers, and our state trooper standing there.

There's never been state police stationed at our entrance point or at our caucus. He is the one who tried blocking this. And as my colleague said, wouldn't let us into the chambers. And this isn't about vaccination pro or con, this is about giving up liberty and freedom. And let me tell you something. Liberty and freedom almost died yesterday. And it's very important that the rest of the folks know when you weaponize and politicize the New Jersey State Police, one of the finest police departments or police forces in the state, and use them to pit them against legislators, that's a very, very scary time. And to -- well, who's next? And what is next? And I think there should be a full investigation who ordered the state police when they knew that the rule was illegal. OLS, Office of Legislative Services made it very clear that they did not have the authority to enforce that law, or the state police could not arrest or come after any legislators and the Speaker still follow through with that. And we were vindicated. Last night, when a judge put a stay on saying that that is it -- and, you know, that they put a stay at allowing for another day. And a few minutes ago, the Democrats announced now that they don't like what we're doing and next week's meetings are going. And remote sort of theory here was created.

I mean, you guys picked up seven seats, did you not, in the State Assembly last election? That's a -- I think that's the best election turnout you've had in decades.

I think the people need to know that, Hal and I and the other legislators, Brian Bergen, who were all there and took the sworn (ph) yesterday, we're not going to back down.

From Afghanistan to COVID to inflation to the rise in crime to his failure to do anything of success on Capitol Hill other than to redistribute income, which is classic progressive dogma, what has Joe Biden done?

You make things go up an enormous amount, over a dollar, and then you have some celebration for when you may be see two cents come off. I don't know how you're going to spend all the money you're going to save at the pump, Laura. I'm sure you can afford some more ornaments for your tree, or maybe if you scrimp it together a little bit. But it's one of these things where you look at the performance you had today from Joe Biden, and he doesn't give anybody the kind of faith that this is a country that's moving in the right direction in any real sense. And when it comes to the economy, I think that what we've seen is this is a White House that is willing to stoop to any base when it comes to spin. In this case, that two-cent a gallon thing that was blasted out by the DCCC and other Democratic entities came as a joke from a lefty blogger, who said thanks to Joe Biden for the implementation of that two-cent drop.

I just played my recent bill, $3.29 per gallon, up almost 100 percent. It's going to be an expensive winter just to heat my home. That is going to be a problem throughout America, whether it's natural gas from heating oil or propane. These are the real sufferings that the American people are going through on Joe Biden's watch. And the reason, Laura, is his fundamental miscalculation of becoming a woke president. Instead of focusing on the basics and on the economy and on free markets, he went woke. He went for the massive progressive spending spree on Capitol Hill, and that's why he doesn't even have Democratic support to get that through. This is the fundamental problem of the Biden era."

You can see the poll numbers that show that nearly 80 percent of Americans are saying they're going to buy fewer Christmas gifts this year because of the challenges that they are facing when it comes to the prices of goods. And yet the White House's attitude toward this is as if it's some concocted media problem, as opposed to a real problem that is impacting American families, working families across the country. And I think that's why you see the poll numbers going in the direction that they are, not just for Joe Biden but for his entire administration, for Democrats on Capitol Hill. And the truth is, those Democrats are mostly checked out. They're already looking at the exits. You saw another retirement just this past week with Representative DeFazio.
