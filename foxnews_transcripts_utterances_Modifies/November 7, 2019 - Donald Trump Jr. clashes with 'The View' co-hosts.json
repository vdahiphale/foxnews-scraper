Mark Zaid a never Trump fanatic had long called for Trump's impeachment and now represents the whistleblower who like the dossier plotters and the collusionists had also been working with the Dems to concoct an impeachment scheme.  All you need is an ambitious lawyer and an embedded activist willing to blow a whistle only Democratic dogs can hear. In the media world of what ifs, here is a what is, actual tweets proving intent by insiders to overthrow a president. And once again, we see how the media and the Dem's desires coincide perfectly.  Because way back then, Zaid also coolly tweeted this. Quote, \"I predict CNN will play a key role in Donald Trump not finishing out his full term as president.\" Holy crap. Now maybe he was just applying for a job at CNN, or perhaps he was working with them already.   Because the fact is, CNN, the Dems, the Times, they are all working for each other trying to manipulate you with the same old story that gave us collusion and all the other non-bombshells. I mean, don't you find it really odd how the networks bend over backwards to protect this special whistleblower because well, they hate Trump. Yet, CBS fires the whistleblower for outing ABC for bearing coverage of a known molester. I guess politics takes priority over pedophiles. I doubt CNN will report that. Now when you've got all those Trump misspellings to uncover. So, here are some of the tweets that Zaid did back two years ago. Coup has started. As one fails two more will take their place. Rebellion, impeachment. A second tweet in the coup. Coup has started, first of many steps. Rebellion, impeachment will follow.   So, Jesse, you were not supposed to be saying the word, coup.

It's because they're working with him and they don't want to know who is running the coup, because they don't want the public to know who is running the coup, because the left is running the coup.  It's an inside job. Because if you look at Rudy, the lawyer for the president, they know everything about Rudy. They know what he eats for breakfast, when he butt-dial someone. He can't go anywhere without them noticing.  Mark Zaid is talking about launching a coup three years before this whole thing happen. And they tried to keep it in the dark for three years. Also, great point in the monologue about a whistleblower double standard. They want to go after the president, but they don't want to go after an international child sex trafficking ring, because it has a Bill Clinton connection. That's disgusting. Also, last point. Everyone knows who the whistleblower is. We all know who it is. Google the whistleblower. You can find it. It's out there. Fox probably has it 99 percent nailed down who it is. We don't want to be first. Every other network doesn't want to do it because they want to protect the whistleblower because it's a part of the scheme, but it is not illegal to out a whistleblower if you're the media.

Or once they saw something they thought rose to the occasion or if the whistleblower went to them first with secondhand knowledge of this phone call. And it wasn't just the tweets about the coup, by the way. This guy also has tweets about praising the attorneys for Brett Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. Saying it was amazing they were doing the work for her pro bono. He actually wanted to reach out and help Michael Avenatti. So, when you're talking about intent and credibility, these things matter. And one more thing, the other attorney for the same whistleblower here. His name is Andrew Bakaj. He also was talking two years ago about removing President Trump from office through the 25th Amendment.   And where have we seen that language?

The point is, you should not be able to sleep on a sidewalk. You should be able to pass out on a sidewalk. That is part of the American experience. You're not supposed to pitch a tent on a sidewalk, you're supposed to pitch a tent in the wilderness. And we have great national parks. And if you check out Fox Nation, you could see all of them. The other thing is, Vegas is a party city, and this is a party foul. You can't have people pitching tents on the street. It ruins the mojo of the gamblers. Vegas has to stay hot. If you see people living in homeless encampments on the street, you're going to think twice about going back to the table. Vegas doesn't want you to think twice. They just want you to play.",

All you need is an ambitious lawyer and an embedded activist willing to blow a whistle only Democratic dogs can hear. In the media world of what ifs, here is a what is, actual tweets proving intent by insiders to overthrow a president. And once again, we see how the media and the Dem's desires coincide perfectly. Because way back then, Zaid also coolly tweeted this. Quote, \"I predict CNN will play a key role in Donald Trump not finishing out his full term as president.\" Holy crap. Now maybe he was just applying for a job at CNN, or perhaps he was working with them already. Because the fact is, CNN, the Dems, the Times, they are all working for each other trying to manipulate you with the same old story that gave us collusion and all the other non-bombshells. I mean, don't you find it really odd how the networks bend over backwards to protect this special whistleblower because well, they hate Trump. Yet, CBS fires the whistleblower for outing ABC for bearing coverage of a known molester. I guess politics takes priority over pedophiles. I doubt CNN will report that. Now when you've got all those Trump misspellings to uncover. So, here are some of the tweets that Zaid did back two years ago. Coup has started. As one fails two more will take their place. Rebellion, impeachment. A second tweet in the coup. Coup has started, first of many steps. Rebellion, impeachment will follow. So, Jesse, you were not supposed to be saying the word, coup.

This is a month and a half after this whole thing started. Why haven't the networks found anything about Mark Zaid, the attorney for the whistleblower? It's because they're working with him and they don't want to know who is running the coup, because they don't want the public to know who is running the coup, because the left is running the coup. It's an inside job. Because if you look at Rudy, the lawyer for the president, they know everything about Rudy. They know what he eats for breakfast, when he butt-dial someone. He can't go anywhere without them noticing. Mark Zaid is talking about launching a coup three years before this whole thing happen. And they tried to keep it in the dark for three years. Also, great point in the monologue about a whistleblower double standard. They want to go after the president, but they don't want to go after an international child sex trafficking ring, because it has a Bill Clinton connection. That's disgusting. Also, last point. Everyone knows who the whistleblower is. We all know who it is. Google the whistleblower. You can find it. It's out there. Fox probably has it 99 percent nailed down who it is. We don't want to be first. Every other network doesn't want to do it because they want to protect the whistleblower because it's a part of the scheme, but it is not illegal to out a whistleblower if you're the media.

Now, there's a whole bunch of questions about whether the attorneys reached out to someone to become the whistleblower. Or once they saw something they thought rose to the occasion or if the whistleblower went to them first with secondhand knowledge of this phone call. And it wasn't just the tweets about the coup, by the way. This guy also has tweets about praising the attorneys for Brett Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. Saying it was amazing they were doing the work for her pro bono. He actually wanted to reach out and help Michael Avenatti. So, when you're talking about intent and credibility, these things matter. And one more thing, the other attorney for the same whistleblower here. His name is Andrew Bakaj. He also was talking two years ago about removing President Trump from office through the 25th Amendment. And where have we seen that language? In the anonymous op-ed that was published in the New York Times and in this new book that is reportedly coming out from this anonymous person accusing Mike Pence of wanting to do the same thing."

Eighty percent plus of all taxes are paid by the top 2 quintiles. More than 70 percent of the government transfer payments go to the bottom too. Which means all this money from top goes to bottom. All right? That transfer shrinks economic inequality so that the bottom quintile has about 50 grand. And the top quintile maybe has like, I don't know, 100 to 200. That is inequality.

There has been a lot of talk about whether the front runners can really make it, whether Joe Biden can get over the finish line, beat Trump. Elizabeth Warren with this massive $52 trillion Medicare for All plan and even Hillary Clinton has been asked in recent weeks, so she's willing to jump in. She says she's not taking up professional running at this time, so it is interesting. We'll see if he ends up filing for other states to kind of solidify him getting in.

This hurts Joe Biden more than anybody because Joe Biden has got that middle lane. This is Bloomberg's so-called middle lane. And Biden right now is a terrible mess. If you look at him on the debate stage. Bernie is a radical socialist. And Liz Warren is now so compromised herself with stealing away 180 million people's health care plans that I don't see any of them making it.

The point is, you should not be able to sleep on a sidewalk. You should be able to pass out on a sidewalk. That is part of the American experience. You're not supposed to pitch a tent on a sidewalk, you're supposed to pitch a tent in the wilderness. And we have great national parks. And if you check out Fox Nation, you could see all of them. The other thing is, Vegas is a party city, and this is a party foul. You can't have people pitching tents on the street. It ruins the mojo of the gamblers. Vegas has to stay hot. If you see people living in homeless encampments on the street, you're going to think twice about going back to the table. Vegas doesn't want you to think twice. They just want you to play."
