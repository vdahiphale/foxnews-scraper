Cohen's team using that point to argue that Avenatti should be allowed to - - should not be allowed to join the case involving the raid of Cohen's home and office. Alleging he leaked sensitive bank records that revealed Cohen's consulting contracts, and that his practically non-stop cable T.V. appearances have included all kinds of misrepresentations. Now, Judge Kimba Wood seem to give Cohen's team some credibility on that, but warning Avenatti to stop his \"publicity tour\" on T.V. So Avenatti, ended up withdrawing his motion to participate in this particular court battle over the raid of Cohen's hotel and office, though, Avenatti will still represent porn actress Stormy Daniels, true to form when he left the courtroom, we quickly did more cable T.V. interviews and held a news conference where he hiked the idea that audio tapes recorded by Cohen are going to be as explosive as the Nixon tapes during Watergate.

We are going to protect crucial, critical, strategic technologies for example. We are going to put imports on China's that might steal those technologies. I think that's very important.

But the woman claims she was drunk and unable to give consent. Mumphrey says she was not intoxicated and surveillance video shows at the time she was walking with a, quote, steady gate and had no trouble keeping her balance. Keith Mumphrey claims the woman opposed him using a condom and they did not have sex. The woman claims she was sexually assaulted and filed a claim with campus police the next day. Now, remember, Michigan State follows the so-called Dear Colleague guidelines issued during the Obama administration. So instead of using the legal guilt standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, the university threshold is more likely than not. And under the Dear Colleague policy, the accused is not allowed to question the accuser. And yet, despite that, after months of investigating the university found that Mumphrey did not violate the school sexual misconduct policy. Even the county prosecutor decided not to file charges citing a lack of evidence and a lack of cooperation by the accuser. But unlike a court of law where a not guilty verdict cannot be retried, Title IX investigations do allow double jeopardy. So the woman appeals Mumphrey's acquittal and Michigan State reopens the case. But Keith Mumphery is now playing for the Houston Texans and the notification by the school is sent to an old e-mail account so he doesn't know the case is back open and does not offer a defense. And In March of 2017, the university finds him responsible for sexual misconduct. He is then cut by the Texans, cannot get a tryout with any other team and because is he banned from Michigan State, he can't finish his graduate degree. Mumphery has now filed a lawsuit against Michigan State, alleging the university has left him with no viable job prospects, among other things. We reached out to MSU for a comment.

Do you believe that the White House, that the president when he talks about spygate, is talking about a different individual who was embedded into the campaign at the behest of the FBI, and who was an agent or is it your understanding that the White House is also talking about this professor who was questioning some sort of peripheral campaign members?"

And so, the question was, is this an individual who was on the periphery as you mentioned, this professor whom as I ran the campaign for 18 months had never met and don't believe I ever had any communication with. And he was trying to work his way through other individuals like Carter Page and George Papadopoulos who also had no decision rights in the campaign, whatsoever. Or did the FBI actually take somebody and put them on the inside of the campaign? And I don't think the president's ever alluded to the fact that the FBI has done this, but we know that Clapper has said that there were individuals. He isn't when I use the term spying, right?

We have seen lie, after lie, after lie, from either Jim Comey or his former deputy -- you know, Andrew McCabe, and Strzok, and Page and we all saw that the FBI had some real problems in this. And if they were using government surveillance through the FISA Court to spy on American citizens based on a dossier that was paid for by the Clinton campaign, and they didn't disclose that, that is spygate and is a violation of Fourth Amendment, and the American people should be very concerned."

But I also think of the relationship that Barack Obama and Eric Holder had. And Eric Holder was held in contempt of Congress, he was very public that he was then President Obama's wingman, he said it very publicly they had a very close relationship, an unapologetic relationship.

Sex lives and audiotapes, just some of the headlines out of the courtroom today as well as shredded documents that the FBI and their officials were told are now trying to piece back together in this case only giving more fodder to Michael Cohen's attorneys, who say that Michael Avenatti has created a circus atmosphere in this case that's why they do not want him involved. Cohen's team using that point to argue that Avenatti should be allowed to - - should not be allowed to join the case involving the raid of Cohen's home and office. Alleging he leaked sensitive bank records that revealed Cohen's consulting contracts, and that his practically non-stop cable T.V. appearances have included all kinds of misrepresentations. Now, Judge Kimba Wood seem to give Cohen's team some credibility on that, but warning Avenatti to stop his \"publicity tour\" on T.V. So Avenatti, ended up withdrawing his motion to participate in this particular court battle over the raid of Cohen's hotel and office, though, Avenatti will still represent porn actress Stormy Daniels, true to form when he left the courtroom, we quickly did more cable T.V. interviews and held a news conference where he hiked the idea that audio tapes recorded by Cohen are going to be as explosive as the Nixon tapes during Watergate. Now Cohen's attorneys acknowledged he kept hours of audio tapes of his conversations with various people, Avenatti declaring he knows for a fact the President Trump's voice is on some of these tapes, though, it is unclear exactly what was said, and whether any of it was inappropriate.

He had the opportunity to join this case, and the judge said, either you can join the case and be quiet, or you can continue to go on television and promote yourself and this isn't manually. I think was just settled a lawsuit for $10 million himself Avenatti did. So his goal is to go and get as much free publicity as he can by himself and not actually see any justice performed here."

      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",

Can you imagine for one second if the president, if it was President Obama and the Justice Department raided his own personal attorney, the media being uproar and there has been very limited uproar. There's a very serious concern here about attorney-client privilege and there is no question that at one period of time, Michael Cohen was the president's attorney and the conversations that he had are -- were with the President in are part of that attorney-client privilege which Michael cannot reveal.

Then shortly after that, you had a ZTE deal that was reached. Now you've got this second sort of slam in the opposite direction with saying that you're going to have 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion of Chinese goods.

There's a G7 meeting coming up, there are European discussions with us about trade, there are NAFTA discussions with us about trade, there are Chinese discussions. President Trump is a change agent. He's trying to change a number of things you know, including unfair and illegal trading practices. He wants the U.S. to be treated fairly, he wants reciprocity, he wants peace -- he wants peace and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. Now, these are breath-taking developments. I happen to think it's all to the good and I think that the president is conducting himself in a terrific manner. And by the way, he doesn't always play by the norms of Washington."

And you just said that you think he will be in Singapore on June 12th. Is that -- is the White House saying they believe this thing's back on?"

Korea doesn't depend on China trade. I acknowledge that they may be linked in a grand landscape if you will, but the China trade look, the United States needs China to get rid of these unfair and illegal trading practices. We can't let them steal our technology. We can't let them force us to give technology over. They have to drop tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers. Now, some progress is being made Wilbur Ross, Secretary Ross is going to be over there. I think he's actually there now. I'm crossing the dateline. Progress has been made. Steve Mnuchin made progress. But the president again is emphasizing to the Chinese as we've told them in you know person-to-person meetings we are going to protect our family jewels. We are going to protect crucial, critical, strategic technologies for example. We are going to put imports on China's that might steal those technologies. I think that's very important. We are going to demand that they changed a lot of their policies. And with respect to investment here in the United States, this is not new. The Chinese have heard this before. Their response by the way was quite mild because they have heard this before. But again, to get growth, to get more American exports, to get reciprocity with Europe, to get better trade deals with China, it will help American jobs, it will help America's employment and wages and it has to be done."

It is a sick attempt to gain attention and we just simply are not going to put it on the air.

The number one of the schools are going to have is law enforcement officers. Number two, more mental health counselors. Number three, we gave them more money. We are already giving them money every year for hardening, bullet proof glass, metal detectors, fewer entrances and exits.

But now ex- NFL and former Michigan State football star Keith Mumphery is in the fight of his life. This MeToo target says he is innocent. He has just filed a lawsuit against his college. The former Texan's wide receiver was cut from the team two days after the \"Detroit Free Press\" broke this story. He was never charged with any crime. He is here exclusively for the first time on television to tell his side of the story in moments. But, first, Trace Gallagher gives us the back story. Trace?"

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Martha, both sides agree that on March 17, 2015 the woman in this case invited Keith Mumphrey back to her Michigan State dorm room and there are text messages and a picture indicating that at the very least the atmosphere was flirtatious. But the woman claims she was drunk and unable to give consent. Mumphrey says she was not intoxicated and surveillance video shows at the time she was walking with a, quote, steady gate and had no trouble keeping her balance. Keith Mumphrey claims the woman opposed him using a condom and they did not have sex. The woman claims she was sexually assaulted and filed a claim with campus police the next day. Now, remember, Michigan State follows the so-called Dear Colleague guidelines issued during the Obama administration. So instead of using the legal guilt standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, the university threshold is more likely than not. And under the Dear Colleague policy, the accused is not allowed to question the accuser. And yet, despite that, after months of investigating the university found that Mumphrey did not violate the school sexual misconduct policy. Even the county prosecutor decided not to file charges citing a lack of evidence and a lack of cooperation by the accuser. But unlike a court of law where a not guilty verdict cannot be retried, Title IX investigations do allow double jeopardy. So the woman appeals Mumphrey's acquittal and Michigan State reopens the case. But Keith Mumphery is now playing for the Houston Texans and the notification by the school is sent to an old e-mail account so he doesn't know the case is back open and does not offer a defense. And In March of 2017, the university finds him responsible for sexual misconduct. He is then cut by the Texans, cannot get a tryout with any other team and because is he banned from Michigan State, he can't finish his graduate degree. Mumphery has now filed a lawsuit against Michigan State, alleging the university has left him with no viable job prospects, among other things. We reached out to MSU for a comment. So far, no response, Martha."

So she basically made it known, you know, what she wanted to do. So fast forward a little bit, we got to a situation and the situation was about the condom. I told her I did not have sex without a condom. So that's when she flipped and everything just went south. So I basically, you know, told her like hey, it's time for me to leave. I don't have time for this. I basically said I'm going to have to leave. I'm black and you're white. And I told her that and I left. And that was the end of that."

So the company that makes Ambien tweeted this, while all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication. You know, it would maybe have behooved her, governor, to use something that she doesn't use often which is to just be quiet for a little while. Be silent perhaps for a moment."

We need to be really changing the policies about how we deal with the criminal justice system. As my prison director in Arkansas used to say and it's a brilliant understanding, we are locking a lot of people up that we are mad at rather than the ones we are afraid of. And the result is we have as far incarcerated an extraordinary number of people who have no business being in prison. These are non-violent offenders. We are mad at them. They have done things that made us mad, but we're really not afraid of them. And the fact is, it's costing us more money to put a person in prison for one year than it would to put them in college for a year, pay full tuition, room and board, buy books and give them spending money. It's unsustainable. And Martha, when you put people in a lock-up situation and then you do something that is really stupid, which we did back in the `90s, called three strikes and you are out and you go through this no parole approach, what you've done then is you take the one thing that can change people's lives away from them. Hope. You take hope away, you've destroyed the future of that individual and the criminal justice system."
