      "sentences": "All right. And, Tucker, and thank you. Welcome to a busy news night tonight on HANNITY. There is breaking news all over the world. In a moment, we will check in on Canada where the country's wannabe socialist dictator Justin Trudeau just invoked the Emergency Powers Act. This is illegal, all in an effort to stomp out peaceful protests are taking place in Ottawa. So is the wimpy, cowardly, gutless Justin planning what are you planning Justin on sending in the police or the military to hurt the heroes of the pandemic? Is that -- is that your plan? Apparently, he now wants to treat freedom-loving truckers like terrorists freeze their bank accounts seize their property put them in jail take their rigs and with Justin Trudeau, I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? Also tonight, Anthony Weiner out of jail. He will join us straight ahead. First, it appears to be the biggest election and presidential spying scandal in the history of this great country. I'm going to go through this slowly because without a doubt, unequivocally, the Trump campaign -- their campaign, their transition team, even the Trump White House -- meaning the president -- was spied on by the Clinton campaign. It is far worse than what we have known until now and we've reported on this now for three years. Now, thanks to a brand new filing from the special counsel John Durham, we now know that the Clinton campaign paid a tech firm to infiltrate the servers at Trump Tower and then later infiltrate the servers at the Trump White House. In other words, illegally spying on a presidential candidate and later a president of the United States. Their end goal, fabricate evidence that President Trump was a Russian asset or Russian stooge of some kind. But make no mistake, this is far worse than Watergate. So let's go through this step by step. Let me refresh many people's memories maybe you don't have a reference point of Watergate. The Watergate scandal involved associates that will link to the 1972 Nixon reelection campaign. These associates, they broke into DNC headquarters at Washington, D.C.'s Watergate office building. They stole campaign documents. They attempted to bug phones. In the end, 69 people were indicted, 48 people were convicted, and Richard Nixon ended up resigning in disgrace for his part in the cover-up of this. Now, of course, business is conducted a little differently in 1972 versus, you know, 2016 when this all went down. In the age of the Internet, you don't need to break into a building to steal your opponent's information. You just need access to their server, and that is exactly what the Clinton campaign did. But here's where this is even worse than Watergate. Not only do they hack into the opposing campaign and steal material like in the case of Watergate, but then they hacked into the office of the president of this great country, according to Durham's blockbuster filing late Friday. This is something maybe we would expect from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, not an American political campaign. And clearly, the Clinton machine was willing to do anything and everything, legal and illegal, to win an election and when that didn't work, to then smear and destroy the guy that legitimately won that election. If this filing is accurate, it is all illegal, everyone involved should go to jail, just like Watergate, except this is far worse. Don't take my word for it. Take a look at what Nancy Pelosi once had to say after the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was hacked in a similar fashion by a foreign government, not by Republicans, in 2016. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Oh, Nancy is right, that Hillary Clinton's campaign was involved in a like electronic Watergate. But now, surprise, surprise, Nancy is totally, completely, utterly silent about Durham's revelation, so is the Biden administration. Now, the executive office of the president was surveilled, but the White House can't be bothered to answer one single question about it? Maybe that's because Biden's national security adviser, that guy right there, Jake Sullivan, he is at the center of this entire scandal and here's where the story takes yet another turn. Stay with us. After infiltrating the servers at the Trump Tower and the executive office of the president and spying on her opponent and then the president, the Clinton campaign found no evidence in any form or fashion that Trump was a Russian asset so they just fabricated all of this out of thin air. Jake Sullivan was a senior policy advisor for Hillary Clinton in propagated a bogus story about Trump's secret line to Russia. Naturally, Sullivan's wife just to make it even more interesting works for the attorney general of the United States Merrick Garland who oversees the Durham probe. She would need to recuse herself he would need to recuse her immediately she should have done this on day one. Republicans need to demand that the AG in this case takes her off anything involving the Durham investigation immediately. Jake Sullivan, he needs to now answer questions about his role in the Clinton campaign's illicit activities as of now. In other words, what did he know, what did Hillary know, when did they know it? Mitch McConnell, by the way, where are you in all this? Is spying on a president and presidential candidates, is it okay with everybody in Washington? Think about what we knew before this filing of John Durham and what we've known for a long time and what we spent nearly three years investigating right here on this show. We knew about Christopher Steele's debunked dirty Russian misinformation dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and, of course, the money was funneled through a law firm Perkins Coie, and Fusion GPS, and they hire Christopher Steele. We told you that story a million times. The FBI then used that material as the basis for the Russia witch hunt. And, by the way, to do that the top of a FISA warrant says verified, we now know it's totally debunked. None of it was true, it was all unverifiable when they found out it was unverified. They still continue to use Hillary's dirty Russian dossier. The FISA warrants against the Trump campaign associate Carter Page, guess what, they did it all. This is even worse than all of that. According to Andrew McCabe, if there's no dossier, there would be no FISA warrant granted. Now we know that Hillary Clinton and her campaign was spying on Donald Trump's Internet activity. As a matter of fact, the entire Trump Tower, the entire White House as a candidate and by the way now as president. That too was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton's attorneys, and when they came up empty, Jake Sullivan was more than happy to disseminate unverified rumors and conspiracy theories as fact. In other words, President Trump, he was right the whole time. This might remind you.",

And by the way, the same goes for fake news CNN. They spent three years lying to the American people. MSDNC, by the way, probably a very convenient time for the conspiracy theorist of all time, Rachel Maddow to be on, quote, leave. You know what? They gave more time to this than any other story, three years of the Trump presidency. And you think they would spend a minute and inform their viewers that they were wrong the entire time and update them on this new development? Where's Bob Woodward? Where's Bernstein, Carl Bernstein? Anyway, remember they once cared about, quote, journalism through their top secret source deep throat they broke the Watergate story wide open. Now, they are nowhere to be found and apparently, you know, for them, politics is much more important than, quote, journalism. Now, the reason the media will ignore this story that is bigger than Watergate is because they are accomplices the entire time. They have lied the entire time. They advance their propaganda almost hours a day seven days a week and they did it for over three years. They knew and they know the dossier was a lie but their hatred of Donald Trump was more important than the truth they have never set the record straight they never made a correction they never admitted that they were wrong. \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", oh, they got Pulitzers for false stories. Maggie, it's time to return it. And, by the way, what about the congenital liar Adam Schiff? He sits on the January 6 committee, and they said campaign rhetoric and talk about elections has brought us to this point. Okay, Adam Schiff or, you know, whatever we want to call you, the congenital liar, if you really care about election interference, is it okay when Hillary Clinton does it? Because Adam Schiff on that January committee is the biggest purveyor of election fraud lies ever. He's going to be critical of Donald Trump? We need an investigation into him. And thankfully Durham doesn't take orders from Schiff or fake news CNN, or anyone else in the media mob. John Durham, he's been taking forever but he's supposedly looking for the truth and he's given us a window into what he's finding. And to that end, according to foxnews.com, his probe is accelerating, more people are cooperating and testifying before a grand jury. I can't predict what Durham will ultimately find, nobody's been held accountable for the lies they made to the FISA court that we know they made lies, they knew they were lying, but I do know that as of now, all roads lead back to one person and one campaign. That's Hillary Clinton and her campaign. And I hope one day very soon, her campaign will be held accountable for the worst political spying scandal in the history of this country. That's how important it is. Here with more from the Trump Organization is Eric Trump. I just want to just go through this here. So what we have, lawyers for the Clinton campaign paid a technology firm to infiltrate servers in where you work in Trump when you worked in Trump Tower when your dad was running, and then later in the White House when your dad was the president and they did it to establish an inference and a false narrative to bring government agencies to link Donald Trump to Russia. That to me would be the biggest scandal in the history of modern politics if not the presidency, but yet, there's crickets in the media. Why?",

She pitted America against Russia, two of the biggest nuclear superpowers in the world, she pitted them against each other to hopefully get a couple extra greedy votes for herself. And now, it's all backfiring. And, Sean, I remember the day -- I remember like it was yesterday when we got that call from, first, \"The New York Times\", and second of all, \"The Wall Street Journal\", and they asked well we have information saying that the Trump Organization has hidden servers that link directly with the Kremlin bank, and I'm sitting there saying, what are you people talking about? We don't have -- we have nothing to do with Russia. We have no servers. And it wasn't until years later, it wasn't until the indictment, you know, a month or two ago that we figured out who this guy Michael Sussman was and what exactly was happening. But, Sean, this is awful, awful stuff. I mean, literally, two of the biggest countries in the world get pitted against each other, you know, for the benefit of one candidate's greed, right? I mean, how many millions of hours of testimony on Capitol Hill, how many tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars were wasted? Three years of my father's invest -- administration was spent dealing with this hoax, all for that woman on the screen right there? What she did to this country was atrocious and somebody has to pay for it. You know, Sean, every single day, they come after us.

They learned in December of 2016 that they shouldn't have used it, and then the sub-source of Christopher Steele said it's nothing but bogus. It was bar talk, none of it's true. But yet they continued to go before the FISA court and purposely put forward false information that they know was unverified and unverifiable.

And there's Comey, in the middle of a 10-year FBI term, and he wants to stay on as director, but he didn't make his way to Trump Tower until January 6, two full months after the election. But it was the day before, Sean, that I was at the White House, the Obama White House for a transition lunch, and while I was down the navy mess upstairs, they were cooking this up. Comey, Brennan, Susan Rice, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, they were all being -- Clapper, of course -- they were all being briefed about what was going to happen at Trump Tower the next day. That's number one. Number two, guess what I learned today yet again? The Clinton people have no faith in her. There's no confidence in her competence. They have to cut corners. They have to cheat. They have to lie. They have to perfume the pig. They have to make the candidate something she's not. We had tremendous faith in our candidate to get the job done, to go out there and connect with people. You know, \"The Washington Post\"/ABC News poll during the end of the 2016 campaign said that 62 percent of Americans said Hillary was neither honest nor trustworthy. Her campaign knew that that was the case, so they had to -- they had to hurry up and do other things to try to get her over the finish line. And then when she failed to win in 2016, they were still trying to get her in there. Very quickly, Clinesmith, Sussman, you got to look at these names everybody, Danchenko, these are folks who either in the case of Clinesmith pled guilty. He was charged with altering an email that led to the Lisa Page, you know, FISA warrant mess. And, then, of course, Sussman and the other guy, Danchenko, they've been charged with lies. They're lying to the FBI and what Sussman lied about was that he went to FBI counsel James Baker and lied and said he wasn't there on behalf of any candidate, act like he was a do-gooder, just a public servant, when, of course, the Clinton people had paid for him.. So all those who investigated the screaming chyrons, the hours and hours of coverage, let's at least have our due, dig a little bit deeper and let's see where this takes us.",

Now, let me be clear, what Trudeau is signaling is an all-out authoritarian, dictatorial crackdown against an overwhelmingly peaceful protest, rather than meet with the heroes of the pandemic that kept Canada alive in their worst moments, rather than negotiate a settlement, rather than listening to their legitimate concerns, he is acting like an authoritarian thug cracking down with the full force of government on the heroes of the pandemic. Now, taking orders from what Joe Biden, a U.S. president who's done nothing to secure his own borders to the south, the truckers are allowing commerce. They have been peaceful. So what is Justin going to do? You're going to send in the military, you're going to send in police, crack a few heads, arrest people, imprison people, confiscate their livelihood, their rigs, put them in jail, fine them a hundred grand, as they're talking about?

Not much has changed here in the past few weeks, every single weekend, it really does pick up, but even here on a Monday night, you can see the crowds are still pretty thick right here in the middle right in front of parliament.

That means trucks will be towed away and the prime minister has even threatened to freeze the bank accounts of the truckers if they don't go home. The announcement coming as the freedom convoy has taken over Canada's capital, semi trucks still lined up in front of parliament tonight even as the Canadian government threatens the group with fines and jail time.

CURTIS SLIWA, CO-HOST OF \"THE LEFT VS THE RIGHT\" ON 77 WABC RADIO: Well, I actually did two weeks of programming with Anthony before his life just imploded. He's a good talk show host. He reveals much of his feelings. I feel he's on solid ground. Our owner operator, John Catsimatidis, who as you know saved WABC from the scrap heap, there would never again a WABC if he hadn't rescued it -- believes in giving people a second chance. Bill O'Reilly -- I can run through a whole list of people who are my colleagues at WABC who he's given a second chance. He believes in that. And let's face it: we need to give people a second chance. We saw that in the Trump administration when he cut the jail time of so many people that we didn't realize were being incarcerated 20, 30, 40 years. So, I think all of us, Democrats and Republicans, we have come to a conclusion that if you've done your time, if you pay the price for what you did, it's time to come back into the fold. And I must tell you, if Anthony Weiner had not had his personal problems, we wouldn't have had Bill de Blasio for eight years who single-handedly destroyed our city.",

      "utterance": "All right. And, Tucker, and thank you. Welcome to a busy news night tonight on HANNITY. There is breaking news all over the world. In a moment, we will check in on Canada where the country's wannabe socialist dictator Justin Trudeau just invoked the Emergency Powers Act. This is illegal, all in an effort to stomp out peaceful protests are taking place in Ottawa. So is the wimpy, cowardly, gutless Justin planning what are you planning Justin on sending in the police or the military to hurt the heroes of the pandemic? Is that -- is that your plan? Apparently, he now wants to treat freedom-loving truckers like terrorists freeze their bank accounts seize their property put them in jail take their rigs and with Justin Trudeau, I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it? Also tonight, Anthony Weiner out of jail. He will join us straight ahead. First, it appears to be the biggest election and presidential spying scandal in the history of this great country. I'm going to go through this slowly because without a doubt, unequivocally, the Trump campaign -- their campaign, their transition team, even the Trump White House -- meaning the president -- was spied on by the Clinton campaign. It is far worse than what we have known until now and we've reported on this now for three years. Now, thanks to a brand new filing from the special counsel John Durham, we now know that the Clinton campaign paid a tech firm to infiltrate the servers at Trump Tower and then later infiltrate the servers at the Trump White House. In other words, illegally spying on a presidential candidate and later a president of the United States. Their end goal, fabricate evidence that President Trump was a Russian asset or Russian stooge of some kind. But make no mistake, this is far worse than Watergate. So let's go through this step by step. Let me refresh many people's memories maybe you don't have a reference point of Watergate. The Watergate scandal involved associates that will link to the 1972 Nixon reelection campaign. These associates, they broke into DNC headquarters at Washington, D.C.'s Watergate office building. They stole campaign documents. They attempted to bug phones. In the end, 69 people were indicted, 48 people were convicted, and Richard Nixon ended up resigning in disgrace for his part in the cover-up of this. Now, of course, business is conducted a little differently in 1972 versus, you know, 2016 when this all went down. In the age of the Internet, you don't need to break into a building to steal your opponent's information. You just need access to their server, and that is exactly what the Clinton campaign did. But here's where this is even worse than Watergate. Not only do they hack into the opposing campaign and steal material like in the case of Watergate, but then they hacked into the office of the president of this great country, according to Durham's blockbuster filing late Friday. This is something maybe we would expect from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, not an American political campaign. And clearly, the Clinton machine was willing to do anything and everything, legal and illegal, to win an election and when that didn't work, to then smear and destroy the guy that legitimately won that election. If this filing is accurate, it is all illegal, everyone involved should go to jail, just like Watergate, except this is far worse. Don't take my word for it. Take a look at what Nancy Pelosi once had to say after the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee was hacked in a similar fashion by a foreign government, not by Republicans, in 2016. Take a look."

And I think that we have to recognize what is happening here. Now who the Russians broke in, who did they give the information to, I don't know. Who dumped it, I don't know. But I do know that this is a Watergate-like electronic break-in."

      "utterance": "Oh, Nancy is right, that Hillary Clinton's campaign was involved in a like electronic Watergate. But now, surprise, surprise, Nancy is totally, completely, utterly silent about Durham's revelation, so is the Biden administration. Now, the executive office of the president was surveilled, but the White House can't be bothered to answer one single question about it? Maybe that's because Biden's national security adviser, that guy right there, Jake Sullivan, he is at the center of this entire scandal and here's where the story takes yet another turn. Stay with us. After infiltrating the servers at the Trump Tower and the executive office of the president and spying on her opponent and then the president, the Clinton campaign found no evidence in any form or fashion that Trump was a Russian asset so they just fabricated all of this out of thin air. Jake Sullivan was a senior policy advisor for Hillary Clinton in propagated a bogus story about Trump's secret line to Russia. Naturally, Sullivan's wife just to make it even more interesting works for the attorney general of the United States Merrick Garland who oversees the Durham probe. She would need to recuse herself he would need to recuse her immediately she should have done this on day one. Republicans need to demand that the AG in this case takes her off anything involving the Durham investigation immediately. Jake Sullivan, he needs to now answer questions about his role in the Clinton campaign's illicit activities as of now. In other words, what did he know, what did Hillary know, when did they know it? Mitch McConnell, by the way, where are you in all this? Is spying on a president and presidential candidates, is it okay with everybody in Washington? Think about what we knew before this filing of John Durham and what we've known for a long time and what we spent nearly three years investigating right here on this show. We knew about Christopher Steele's debunked dirty Russian misinformation dossier bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and, of course, the money was funneled through a law firm Perkins Coie, and Fusion GPS, and they hire Christopher Steele. We told you that story a million times. The FBI then used that material as the basis for the Russia witch hunt. And, by the way, to do that the top of a FISA warrant says verified, we now know it's totally debunked. None of it was true, it was all unverifiable when they found out it was unverified. They still continue to use Hillary's dirty Russian dossier. The FISA warrants against the Trump campaign associate Carter Page, guess what, they did it all. This is even worse than all of that. According to Andrew McCabe, if there's no dossier, there would be no FISA warrant granted. Now we know that Hillary Clinton and her campaign was spying on Donald Trump's Internet activity. As a matter of fact, the entire Trump Tower, the entire White House as a candidate and by the way now as president. That too was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton's attorneys, and when they came up empty, Jake Sullivan was more than happy to disseminate unverified rumors and conspiracy theories as fact. In other words, President Trump, he was right the whole time. This might remind you."

And by the way, the same goes for fake news CNN. They spent three years lying to the American people. MSDNC, by the way, probably a very convenient time for the conspiracy theorist of all time, Rachel Maddow to be on, quote, leave. You know what? They gave more time to this than any other story, three years of the Trump presidency. And you think they would spend a minute and inform their viewers that they were wrong the entire time and update them on this new development? Where's Bob Woodward? Where's Bernstein, Carl Bernstein? Anyway, remember they once cared about, quote, journalism through their top secret source deep throat they broke the Watergate story wide open. Now, they are nowhere to be found and apparently, you know, for them, politics is much more important than, quote, journalism. Now, the reason the media will ignore this story that is bigger than Watergate is because they are accomplices the entire time. They have lied the entire time. They advance their propaganda almost hours a day seven days a week and they did it for over three years. They knew and they know the dossier was a lie but their hatred of Donald Trump was more important than the truth they have never set the record straight they never made a correction they never admitted that they were wrong. \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", oh, they got Pulitzers for false stories. Maggie, it's time to return it. And, by the way, what about the congenital liar Adam Schiff? He sits on the January 6 committee, and they said campaign rhetoric and talk about elections has brought us to this point. Okay, Adam Schiff or, you know, whatever we want to call you, the congenital liar, if you really care about election interference, is it okay when Hillary Clinton does it? Because Adam Schiff on that January committee is the biggest purveyor of election fraud lies ever. He's going to be critical of Donald Trump? We need an investigation into him. And thankfully Durham doesn't take orders from Schiff or fake news CNN, or anyone else in the media mob. John Durham, he's been taking forever but he's supposedly looking for the truth and he's given us a window into what he's finding. And to that end, according to foxnews.com, his probe is accelerating, more people are cooperating and testifying before a grand jury. I can't predict what Durham will ultimately find, nobody's been held accountable for the lies they made to the FISA court that we know they made lies, they knew they were lying, but I do know that as of now, all roads lead back to one person and one campaign. That's Hillary Clinton and her campaign. And I hope one day very soon, her campaign will be held accountable for the worst political spying scandal in the history of this country. That's how important it is. Here with more from the Trump Organization is Eric Trump. I just want to just go through this here. So what we have, lawyers for the Clinton campaign paid a technology firm to infiltrate servers in where you work in Trump when you worked in Trump Tower when your dad was running, and then later in the White House when your dad was the president and they did it to establish an inference and a false narrative to bring government agencies to link Donald Trump to Russia. That to me would be the biggest scandal in the history of modern politics if not the presidency, but yet, there's crickets in the media. Why?"

It really is the biggest scandal and by the way, Lesley Stahl owes my father an apology. \"The New York Times\" owes my father an apology. \"The Washington Post\" owes my father an apology. What they did is absolutely atrocious and by the way, Hillary almost by default created another Cold War. She pitted America against Russia, two of the biggest nuclear superpowers in the world, she pitted them against each other to hopefully get a couple extra greedy votes for herself. And now, it's all backfiring. And, Sean, I remember the day -- I remember like it was yesterday when we got that call from, first, \"The New York Times\", and second of all, \"The Wall Street Journal\", and they asked well we have information saying that the Trump Organization has hidden servers that link directly with the Kremlin bank, and I'm sitting there saying, what are you people talking about? We don't have -- we have nothing to do with Russia. We have no servers. And it wasn't until years later, it wasn't until the indictment, you know, a month or two ago that we figured out who this guy Michael Sussman was and what exactly was happening. But, Sean, this is awful, awful stuff. I mean, literally, two of the biggest countries in the world get pitted against each other, you know, for the benefit of one candidate's greed, right? I mean, how many millions of hours of testimony on Capitol Hill, how many tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars were wasted? Three years of my father's invest -- administration was spent dealing with this hoax, all for that woman on the screen right there? What she did to this country was atrocious and somebody has to pay for it. You know, Sean, every single day, they come after us.

And this is separate and apart, this is on top of Hillary Clinton paying for the dirty Russian misinformation dossier that we know in fact was full of lies, but yet was presented to a FISA court on four separate occasions. They were warned by Bruce Ohr in August of 2016 not to use that document, that it's unverifiable. They learned in December of 2016 that they shouldn't have used it, and then the sub-source of Christopher Steele said it's nothing but bogus. It was bar talk, none of it's true. But yet they continued to go before the FISA court and purposely put forward false information that they know was unverified and unverifiable. Now, those people have yet to be held accountable, Eric, and we've now known this for years.

And guess where Trump Tower is located? It's located on Fifth Avenue in New York. Where are these prosecutors? Where is the D.A.? Isn't that a federal -- isn't that a -- you know, isn't that fraud? Isn't that all sorts of offenses? Where's Letitia James in this whole thing? Is she just going to ignore this because Hillary happens to be in her political party?"

But I don't have a lot of confidence because we already knew about the dirty Russian dossier that Hillary paid for that was unverifiable.

But nobody has had really much of an insight if any insight into the investigation that he's been conducting. I can remember I had asked Jim Baker. You know, I'm trying to figure out -- you know, Jim, if you're a good guy or a bad guy, and he said, well, I'm a good guy. Well, we're starting to see the allegations that it was literally everybody, Clinton operatives, putting it together. There is one other thing that will come out is that dossier that you're talking about it's not just the fact that Hillary Clinton's campaign had paid for it. It was that there are other Clinton operatives that were shopping around parts of the dossier John Durham kudos to him for bringing it all together but shame on the media for not covering it.

And my new book that you just talked about, \"Here is the Deal\", has brand new details about January 5th and January 6, 2017. Remember, January 6 is the day that the intelligence officers, Clapper, Brennan, Comey go to Trump Tower. And there's Comey, in the middle of a 10-year FBI term, and he wants to stay on as director, but he didn't make his way to Trump Tower until January 6, two full months after the election. But it was the day before, Sean, that I was at the White House, the Obama White House for a transition lunch, and while I was down the navy mess upstairs, they were cooking this up. Comey, Brennan, Susan Rice, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, they were all being -- Clapper, of course -- they were all being briefed about what was going to happen at Trump Tower the next day. That's number one. Number two, guess what I learned today yet again? The Clinton people have no faith in her. There's no confidence in her competence. They have to cut corners. They have to cheat. They have to lie. They have to perfume the pig. They have to make the candidate something she's not. We had tremendous faith in our candidate to get the job done, to go out there and connect with people. You know, \"The Washington Post\"/ABC News poll during the end of the 2016 campaign said that 62 percent of Americans said Hillary was neither honest nor trustworthy. Her campaign knew that that was the case, so they had to -- they had to hurry up and do other things to try to get her over the finish line. And then when she failed to win in 2016, they were still trying to get her in there. Very quickly, Clinesmith, Sussman, you got to look at these names everybody, Danchenko, these are folks who either in the case of Clinesmith pled guilty. He was charged with altering an email that led to the Lisa Page, you know, FISA warrant mess. And, then, of course, Sussman and the other guy, Danchenko, they've been charged with lies. They're lying to the FBI and what Sussman lied about was that he went to FBI counsel James Baker and lied and said he wasn't there on behalf of any candidate, act like he was a do-gooder, just a public servant, when, of course, the Clinton people had paid for him..

And by the way, the truckers -- they say they are not going anywhere. But you got a spineless, coward, gutless Biden of the north, Justin Trudeau, and now he says he's invoking the so-called Emergencies Act, invoking powers that Canada has never invoked before in the country's history and is trying to attack what has been a peaceful gathering of truckers and others and attacked their civil liberties. Now, let me be clear, what Trudeau is signaling is an all-out authoritarian, dictatorial crackdown against an overwhelmingly peaceful protest, rather than meet with the heroes of the pandemic that kept Canada alive in their worst moments, rather than negotiate a settlement, rather than listening to their legitimate concerns, he is acting like an authoritarian thug cracking down with the full force of government on the heroes of the pandemic. Now, taking orders from what Joe Biden, a U.S. president who's done nothing to secure his own borders to the south, the truckers are allowing commerce. They have been peaceful. So what is Justin going to do? You're going to send in the military, you're going to send in police, crack a few heads, arrest people, imprison people, confiscate their livelihood, their rigs, put them in jail, fine them a hundred grand, as they're talking about? And it gets worse because as part of the crackdown, the deputy prime minister is saying they are broadening the country's terrorist financing rules to prevent the truckers from accessing the donations, the Crowdfunding platforms and from even using cryptocurrency.

But check it out behind me, Sean. Not much has changed here in the past few weeks, every single weekend, it really does pick up, but even here on a Monday night, you can see the crowds are still pretty thick right here in the middle right in front of parliament. Protesters in Ottawa tell me they are just getting started. This is the first time in Canadian history that they've used the emergencies act here in Canada and it's now in effect for 30 days. That means trucks will be towed away and the prime minister has even threatened to freeze the bank accounts of the truckers if they don't go home. The announcement coming as the freedom convoy has taken over Canada's capital, semi trucks still lined up in front of parliament tonight even as the Canadian government threatens the group with fines and jail time. Ontario is now in the process of rolling back COVID restrictions, including vaccine passports but the truckers I've talked to on the ground, Sean, say that's not enough. Listen."

And then also something to point out that we've been talking to some of the protesters about is just how quickly and how much they've packed into this area in front of parliament. They've actually moved more trucks in there just today and they're trying to put it into an area, Sean, that even if they do try to come in and tow them, they won't be able to really get in and move those tow trucks around. So there's still a lot more that needs to be done, but another thing that I thought you'd think was interesting is we talked to some of the convoy earlier, Sean, and they told us that they had a police escort by the Ottawa PD to move out of the neighborhoods today and in front of parliament so no matter what the prime minister is saying there's still more truckers with this convoy and they're not going anywhere."

You heard the deputy prime minister who by the way happens to be a governor of the World Economic Forum.

You see for yourself, it's a festival environment. There's no violence. It's happy moms and dads and kids. Trudeau is claiming they're dangerous, claiming their terrorists so he can seize bank accounts. The most scary thing announced today by the finance minister who's on the World Economic Forum board is that banks will be directed to seize your accounts without due process, and you can't even sue them, they're indemnified.

I -- I would just recommend in the sense that if it was something this serious, that there's got to be, let me fall on the sword, admit and tell people what's different about me at this point. You know, I would think going to jail is different. And this is what I learned. This is the help that I got. This is how --"

You know, I've always in my political life and more concerned about things on Brighton Beach Avenue than Brighton, England. This -- we're going to talk about New York City issues. But, you know, I'm of the belief that the way you demonstrate that you've changed is for other people to perceive it. It's for other people to see that you -- that you're dealing with --"
