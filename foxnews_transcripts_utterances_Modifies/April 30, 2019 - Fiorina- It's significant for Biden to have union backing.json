      "sentences": "Beautiful baby, a beautiful night at the White House. Thank you, Brett. All right, everybody. Breaking right now, we have two fast-moving stories that were following live for you this evening. Here is one. Joe Biden, the front-runner rising in the polls about to take the stage in Iowa. A state that sent him home back in 1988 when he got less than one percent of the vote -- 2008 rather. But tonight, he is in a very different spot after eight years as vice president.  And now, a live look at the very volatile situation that is unfolding tonight in Venezuela. Where Nicolas Maduro is in hiding after deciding not to get on a plane this morning to Cuba and the White House is urging him to turn around that decision and get on that plane and go. They say all options are on the table to preserve democracy there.  Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” Joe Biden continues to filled questions on the decades-old Anita Hill hearings. He'd answer them again this morning.  But now, some are saying that all this apologizing is rewriting the past. And that it's somewhat unfair to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who after the long and dramatic hearings, had the belief of 58 percent of Americans, 24 percent believed to the story of Professor Anita Hill. Betsy McCaughey and a piece about to publish in the New York Post, writes of Biden, saying that he wished the committee had been more fair to Hill. \"Sorry, Joe. That's rewriting history. The hearing was fair, Hill's testimony was full of holes and devoid of evidence to back up her claim.\"  There are also questions tonight about how Biden is now saying that he believed Anita Hill from the very beginning. When in Justice Clarence Thomas's 2007 book, he writes that as the story came out, Biden told him \"I will be your biggest defender.\" There's a lot to unravel here tonight. Marc Thiessen and Chris Hann, standing by. Also with me here in New York, Carly Fiorina, with her unique take on all of this.  But let's go first to Mike Tobin, who is live in Iowa as we await the former Vice President Joe Biden. Good evening, Mike.",

I think that we've moved to a different place in our society than we were in 1991 when these hearings were going on. I think more people believe Anita Hill today than believed for then, who remember those hearings. Just like more people believe Monica Lewinsky today than believed her in the 90s. So, things have changed, our nation has evolved. I think Joe Biden is a good man, and I think that if he -- if he has invaded people's space or made them feel uncomfortable, I don't think he was intending to do that in a -- in a negative way.

And of course, China with its financial cloud, you have Iran, you have Turkey, they're profiting from a blood gold and all they want to do is just expand their geopolitical stronghold in the region, and to challenge the U.S. values and interest in the hemisphere. And then, of course, you got the regional situation where Maduro is actually pushing people out. We got 3.7 million people pushed into challenging the sovereignty of Brazil and of Colombia, and then you have the domestic problem. We have at least 22,000 Cubans infiltrated and armed forces with 40 percent of our territory ELN, FARC, I mean you name it is there and it's moving forward.

And what you see Booker is saying there is a bigger issue here that Bernie may be touching on, and as may be intentional, which is, mass incarceration, and especially the idea that you have so many African- Americans and Hispanics, disproportionately in the prison population.

      "utterance": "Beautiful baby, a beautiful night at the White House. Thank you, Brett. All right, everybody. Breaking right now, we have two fast-moving stories that were following live for you this evening. Here is one. Joe Biden, the front-runner rising in the polls about to take the stage in Iowa. A state that sent him home back in 1988 when he got less than one percent of the vote -- 2008 rather. But tonight, he is in a very different spot after eight years as vice president. And now, a live look at the very volatile situation that is unfolding tonight in Venezuela. Where Nicolas Maduro is in hiding after deciding not to get on a plane this morning to Cuba and the White House is urging him to turn around that decision and get on that plane and go. They say all options are on the table to preserve democracy there. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” Joe Biden continues to filled questions on the decades-old Anita Hill hearings. He'd answer them again this morning. But now, some are saying that all this apologizing is rewriting the past. And that it's somewhat unfair to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who after the long and dramatic hearings, had the belief of 58 percent of Americans, 24 percent believed to the story of Professor Anita Hill. Betsy McCaughey and a piece about to publish in the New York Post, writes of Biden, saying that he wished the committee had been more fair to Hill. \"Sorry, Joe. That's rewriting history. The hearing was fair, Hill's testimony was full of holes and devoid of evidence to back up her claim.\" There are also questions tonight about how Biden is now saying that he believed Anita Hill from the very beginning. When in Justice Clarence Thomas's 2007 book, he writes that as the story came out, Biden told him \"I will be your biggest defender.\" There's a lot to unravel here tonight. Marc Thiessen and Chris Hann, standing by. Also with me here in New York, Carly Fiorina, with her unique take on all of this. But let's go first to Mike Tobin, who is live in Iowa as we await the former Vice President Joe Biden. Good evening, Mike."

There was an unofficial stop at between Cedar Rapids and Dubuque at an ice cream store in Monticello. But when he made his first official stop, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Biden wasted little time getting into the general election business and gunning for President Trump."

And 2008, he took fifth place in Iowa with less than one percent of the vote, dropped out shortly after that. Now, he shows up in Iowa with this dominant lead. According to the latest CNN poll, he's 24 points ahead of Bernie Sanders, and the rest of the Democrats are polling in the single digits. Some pick campaign veterans say, being out front this early makes Biden vulnerable."

He's 76, he'll be -- if he wins here the presidency, he'll be 77 years old on the day of his inauguration. That's the same age Ronald Reagan was when he left office. And one of the problems with being old as a candidate is you bring up -- you have old baggage. And so, you've got the Anita Hill hearings. This happened in 1991. So, there's a poll out there that shows 30 percent of Democrats don't approve of his handling of the Anita Hill hearings. 44 percent don't know, because they weren't born. You know, so, and. You know, as his lead expands --"

So, I think it's time to move on from Lucy Flores. I also think that what Vice President Biden said about Anita Hill, I think that was good enough. I think that we've moved to a different place in our society than we were in 1991 when these hearings were going on. I think more people believe Anita Hill today than believed for then, who remember those hearings. Just like more people believe Monica Lewinsky today than believed her in the 90s. So, things have changed, our nation has evolved. I think Joe Biden is a good man, and I think that if he -- if he has invaded people's space or made them feel uncomfortable, I don't think he was intending to do that in a -- in a negative way. In the same way that we think that there are -- you know, there are some people who have done this, and they -- and women should be believed."

So, but that's why everybody's going to come after him. And you know, this whole thing about the smelling of the hair, and the rubbing shoulders isn't going to go away, and he says this is from a different era. It was never OK to come up to a woman you don't know in a work environment and smell her hair and give her a massage. I mean, if someone did that to my daughter tomorrow, it would be pretty ticked off about it, and so, with most Americans.

I think it is a demonstration once again that Russia is not our friend, that Cuba is not our friend. However, I also think now we're at a very delicate point. Because you will recall how long the Obama administration and the rest of the world called for Bashar al Assad to go. He must go, he must go, he must go, and he didn't go.

This is the point of no return and it's about time because there was a response from the military. And to begin with, we have to look at this from the global perspective that there are many pillars of support for Maduro. Internationally as you've seen, well he's got $12 billion arsenals from Russia and military support. And of course, China with its financial cloud, you have Iran, you have Turkey, they're profiting from a blood gold and all they want to do is just expand their geopolitical stronghold in the region, and to challenge the U.S. values and interest in the hemisphere. And then, of course, you got the regional situation where Maduro is actually pushing people out. We got 3.7 million people pushed into challenging the sovereignty of Brazil and of Colombia, and then you have the domestic problem. We have at least 22,000 Cubans infiltrated and armed forces with 40 percent of our territory ELN, FARC, I mean you name it is there and it's moving forward. So I think it was the right moment to do it and now we have to see what is the problem. China and Russia are managing as well as satellites intelligence surveillance and most probably this what is happening right now with Internet. They closed a radio station this morning. They have put some people in jail, journalists for the last few weeks. Now, this is going to get harder and stronger."

I think it's got the wrong country. He's talking about probably Russia and their 100 military technicians that are putting S-300 missile components in our borders. They have already 5,000 man pants that are shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missiles. I mean more dangerous than what we have right now. It would only be to let them keep the stronghold in our territory because this is the gateway to America. And what they're trying to do with their convergence with terrorism and that's why Iran is present there, FARC and ELN are present there is because they're believing the country dry and there will most probably head into the hemisphere."

And what you see Booker is saying there is a bigger issue here that Bernie may be touching on, and as may be intentional, which is, mass incarceration, and especially the idea that you have so many African- Americans and Hispanics, disproportionately in the prison population. Right now, I think for black men, it's six times more likely they are going to be put in jail than white men, about two times for Latino men.

Netflix told Fox News, quoting, \"We've just have seen the study and are looking into the research, which conflicts with last week's study from the University of Pennsylvania.\" In that study, it found that students who watched the entire season, the second season of \"13 Reasons Why,\" were less likely to purposely injure themselves or seriously considered suicide. But both studies emphasize the influence the media has on young people and the responsibility that outlets should bear.

You have a television show, \"13 Reasons Why,\" that is targeted at teenagers, yet romanticize his teen suicide, and what are we to expect that what we are starting to see? One thing to point out, though, is the University of Pennsylvania report, research report that just came out focused on adults ages 18 to 29.

And so, an informed parent is the best line of defense, but at some point in time, we have a corporation that is profiting, this is literally blood money now. And at some point in time, this corporation had to step up and take accountability for its contribution to this very terrible equation."

      "utterance": "So, this new development breaking right now, the Washington Post is reporting that Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote a letter to Attorney General William Barr complaining about the summary of the special counsel's investigation. According to this report that just came out from the Post, the letter said in part, quote, \"The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24th did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office's work on conclusion. There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the special counsel, to ensure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigation.\" So, it will play front and center tomorrow when the attorney general appears in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee."

That is not going to happen. What do you think about the request?"

      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "It all sounds bizarre to me, Martha, and frankly, it sounds like more grandstanding. Look, the Democrats can't come to grips with the fact that the Mueller report found that there was no collusion, there was no conspiracy, there was no obstruction. What we should be focused on here is what's been going on in our government, what's been going on at the highest levels of the FBI. That is where the focus needs to be and that's what I look forward to asking the attorney general about tomorrow."

      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "What I want to know is, what led to the president of the United States, the duly elected leader of the country, having a counterintelligence investigation opened against him by the FBI? Treated like a spy by the FBI. I mean, based on what we have heard from news reports, this is because FBI leadership didn't like his policy positions on Russia, didn't like his campaign. I mean, this is extraordinary. Here's my concern, Martha, we had a time in this country when the FBI tried to run the country, tried to tell elected leaders what to do. I don't want to go back to that time in our history. We need to make sure that we never do."

      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "It did. What surprised me even more, Martha, as he went on to say that we may be talking about not just the FBI but about other agencies and the government as well. I mean, this is extraordinary. I have never heard of an example in American history when a presidential campaign has been spied on by agencies from our own government. When a presidential candidate and then elected president has been treated like a spy by agencies of our own government. We need answers on what exactly is going on at the FBI and may be in other agencies and that's what I hope to get tomorrow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "I want to know what he is learned so far about how this counterspy, counterintelligence investigation of President Trump got launched. Who was responsible for it, why did the FBI leadership tried to take steps to insulate that investigation from discovery and political oversight? Who's responsible for it? So, I want answers to these things and I also want to ask him if we need a special counsel. I think that we do. The FBI -- Martha, I've been pressing the FBI for answers on this for months now. They have been stonewalling me. If they are going to stonewall and obstruct a special counsel should look into this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, I mean, that's a tough question for the attorney general. Obviously, that, you know, it falls under his domain. You know, I guess the question is, you will be pressing him, I would imagine, on how, you know, objective that whole process can be when it's part of the Department of Justice, the FBI."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "You know, I'm encouraged that he had set up a task force. He said that he would, that he is going to press forward on this. I think he is asking the right questions. Tomorrow is a chance to see if he's gotten any answers. And it may be, Martha, that he needs help in getting answers. It may be that the FBI needs the consequence of a special counsel to really come to terms with their own behavior and so the American public can get answers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, we're going to be watching closely. I got one more question for you, because I know that you are very interested in the issues of privacy and social media. Mark Zuckerberg made some big statements today. The one that really caught my eye was that he said the future is private. The future on social media, where Facebook is concerned, is going to be private, which is the absolute antithesis of what we have all heard for the past decade about social media, that privacy is gone, that it's over."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAWLEY",
      "utterance": "My question is, where has Mark Zuckerberg been for the last few years? I mean, the American people have wanted privacy, have been expecting privacy for years. Facebook has basically admitting that they have done anything but. Look, they've been scooping up our private personal information, they've been monetizing that, making big profits on it. So, in terms of their privacy push, I'll believe it when they see it, when I see it. But what we need to do now is get answers from Facebook. We need to know what information are you collecting on consumers, what are you doing with it, and why are you discriminating against conservatives on your platform?"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
