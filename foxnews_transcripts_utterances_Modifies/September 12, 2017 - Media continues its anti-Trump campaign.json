There was nine percent positive? I didn't see it. I've seen more favorable coverage of scurvy.  According to the Media Research Center, Trump has got more air time in his first 24 days in office than Obama did in his last two years on the job. Which makes sense. Trump is a one man band generating money and outrage or, rather, money for the outraged. Like MSNBC's Joy Reid. In an interview, she stated, \"I've said to people that this is probably the greatest time to be a journalist. And the worst time to be a human.\" Oh, dear. Let's think about that. Reid, a journalist, said that this is probably the worst time to be a human? Where did she go to school? I kind of remember reading about the Dark Ages, the Black Death, the Mongols, Nazi concentration camps, the atrocities of the Aztecs, famine in Ukraine, the Khmer Rouge, the Western Front during World War I, Japanese prison camps in World War II, the Soviet Union -- remember Siberia? You get the picture. Does Joy? As she forgets and insults hundreds of millions who died in the worst times ever. But hey, hysteria pays the bills.  But I can say safely that the best time to be human is right now. The statistics show it: far less poverty, decline in worldwide violence, vast improvements in hygiene, medicine and technology. But I guess you can't say that when you live in a left-wing bubble where 91 percent is every single person you know and everyone else you believe is Hitler. I don't know, Kimberly, 91 percent negative, that seems a little low to me. I think it's about 98 percent!",

So, for whatever reason you want to blame his side or blame the media side, it's a relationship that is in dire need of repair.   So, when you see something like this, they say, ok, well, this is to be expected. Look at this.

Three, they don't have the prestige of access to the White House that they would have had under Hillary.  Four, they're now the tip of the spear because the Democrats in Washington have no power so they have to be the attack dogs. And then finally, they can't afford to have President Trump be successful. If he is successful and redraws the map, electorally, the Democrats are shut out of power for a very long time.

They got the one bank of China who says all bank activities related to North Korea are suspended now. So that is a huge deal.

Housing takes up half of the people's income and has the largest poverty rate in the United States according to the census bureau supplemental poverty measure. Largest poverty rate in the nation. Only the rich, the really rich can live there. Not the middle class. And it's the rich who are making these rules. And they can afford to make rules based on social justice. They can afford to make rules on making their egos feel better. I know you hate the word virtue signaling but this is a country of rich people doing one -- a state doing one giant virtue signal that they can afford. Remember the Oroville dam, everybody to evacuate? Where's the money for water infrastructure? They don't need it. The house is on fire and the rich is watering their plants. This is a horrible, horrible thing. This is a once great state. Like I said, my dad and my mom could not live there. A lot of people are moving out because of this.

Three, they don't have the prestige of access to the White House that they would have had under Hillary. Four, they're now the tip of the spear because the Democrats in Washington have no power so they have to be the attack dogs. And then finally, they can't afford to have President Trump be successful. If he is successful and redraws the map, electorally, the Democrats are shut out of power for a very long time. And I think it's very disrespectful for the mainstream media to treat 40 percent of the country who still has a lot of love and respect for this president like they don't even matter.

So, she has lots of praise for her single mom that taken her all over the country to see this great American country that she loves. Then, what I also admires that she was a journalist, straight up journalist. In 2004, she was so against the Iraq war. She wrote an op-ed. She got blow back from her employers about it. She worked for a TV station. I think it was down in Florida. And she decided to quit. And she started over her career and went into opinion journalism which is where she sits now at MSNBC. And so, there are lots of people that can have opinions. I think that one line she probably wanted to take out of it.

This is a huge diplomatic victory, I think, for the Trump administration for all the fire and fury that he got from the mainstream media. You have Nikki Haley, you have my man Rex and you had the treasury department really put together a double quarter pounder with cheese round of sanctions against this regime right here unanimously. You have to tip your hat to them for that. Also, this dough boy dictator will have a lot less dough to buy all the cheese he likes, because this sanctions have teeth now. They got the one bank of China who says all bank activities related to North Korea are suspended now. So that is a huge deal. So they're slapping sanctions on the crude oil, textiles and then visas are also being banned. So I think the goal is to disable the regime to the extent that he can't afford his lavish lifestyle so he can't buy all the wine and video games, he also can't grease the generals and pay off these chemical weapons experts and the nuclear physicists. If you do that to the extent that he is no longer able to maintain that grip on power, then that is how you squeeze him and how you bring him back from the edge."

This is sort of the dark internet currency that is being used, and apparently, Kim Jong-un has a ton of it.

I don't think he leaves North Korea. But that is their demand. United States, we want you to put something in the table. We don't want to seem like we're giving into you. They gave into Donald Trump. They did. And so to me, I hope that this signals there's some progress. In my heart of hearts, I don't see it. When Trump says at that meeting, this is a little bit of something but it ain't much, I suspect he is right. And then, of course, then that raises all the flags in your head is he talking about fire and fury and nuclear weapons and destruction?

I will tweet and tell the dreamers that you don't have to worry. It's not going to be a problem. I feel like the state of California is jumping the gun and trying to make it political rather than actually looking at what is happening on the ground. But I also feel like the administration should ask for an expedited Supreme Court review of this, because sanctuary cities and states, whatever, this is an issue, you have nine members of the Supreme Court. Go ahead and ask them for what it is. Today, the Supreme Court actually overturned something that was passed by the court in the ninth circuit, if I'm right, Kimberly, about the travel ban. And reversed it and said no, the administration is well within its rights to continue on and talk about the merits later. There are actually -- our system is smart. It's really good. You can actually ask the Supreme Court to review this and everybody can have an answer before having to talk about making this all political."

Only the rich, the really rich can live there. Not the middle class. And it's the rich who are making these rules. And they can afford to make rules based on social justice. They can afford to make rules on making their egos feel better. I know you hate the word virtue signaling but this is a country of rich people doing one -- a state doing one giant virtue signal that they can afford. Remember the Oroville dam, everybody to evacuate? Where's the money for water infrastructure? They don't need it. The house is on fire and the rich is watering their plants. This is a horrible, horrible thing. This is a once great state. Like I said, my dad and my mom could not live there. A lot of people are moving out because of this.

A bigger issue for me is, you know, companies have a problem with employees who are forever tempted to make pronouncements on twitter. We know this.

It's also a horrible business decision, because guess who watches ESPN. Men. Guess who else watches them. White men. I think Trump won 63 percent of the white male vote.
