Qassem Soleimani has been in a terrorist mastermind for Iran for more than 20 years. And has the blood of thousands of Americans on his hands. The president drew a very clear red line, if any American harmed by an Iranian attack, by their proxies, or by Iran itself, he would retaliate. That's what happened when you strike one of their militia's bases on December 29th. You know, and when they attacked our embassy and we had a target of opportunity with Qassem Soleimani, we took it.

The statement also says they intend to balance their time between the U.K. and North America. The couple married in 2018. They have a baby son, Archie. Up next, the panel on the conflict with Iran. First, beyond our borders tonight. A car bomb exploded at a checkpoint in Somalia's capital this morning, killing three people and wounding six others. The Al Qaeda linked al-Shabaab extremist group quickly claimed responsibility. A government spokesman there says the blast occurred as soldiers conducted searches at a checkpoint. The presidents of Turkey and Russia inaugurated the dual natural gas line connecting their countries today. The meeting in Istanbul between Turkish President Erdogan and Russia's Putin celebrated the opening of a new export path for Russian gas into Turkey and Europe, and a promise of greater cooperation in trade and diplomacy. Auto executive turned fugitive Carlos Ghosn says his arrest in Japan was a plot against him, and described his detention conditions as a travesty against human rights. He says financial misconduct charges are false. The former Nissan chairman escaped from Japanese custody last month. Just some of the other story beyond our borders tonight. We'll be right back. AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, IRANIAN SUPREME LEADER (through translator): Well, last night, we slapped them. These military actions are not enough.

JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": The sense I have from talking to people in the White House is that they are not naive that this is the dawn of some new diplomatic renaissance with Iran, but they are happy -- I should maybe use a different word -- at least hopeful that this is -- if this is the conclusion of this little skirmish, it's probably a good outcome. I do not think for a second that Iran is going to stop its malign the behavior across the region, that its proxies may take other actions. There are several questions they are really examining at the moment. One is the idea of Iran using deniability, its proxies to hit maybe an ally, and what does the United States do then? And of course, the question of its nuclear program, which we saw the president talk about then. They can get that up and going pretty quickly. And then we're now talking about back to the last decade, early last decade when you are thinking about the Israelis or the U.S. getting involved preemptively.",

We do not seek escalation or war but will defend ourselves against any aggression.\" After what we saw against Iran and its response, kind of what that signaled, does it diminish this argument about whether the Soleimani attack was justified or not, taking out this terrorist? SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I think the last sentence that you read from that tweet is the most important here, which is that they are not seeking to escalate this. And they issued that tweet right after they fired those missiles. So on Capitol Hill, people are describing it, Republicans, as the strike is a form of de-escalation because there weren't any casualties. So it provided Iran with a way to answer back from the Soleimani drone attack that killed Soleimani and those other officials without killing any Americans or causing enough damage that the U.S. uses its full force against Iran, which Iran doesn't want because they can't survive that.",

Here's two things we know. One is we now know that there is no distinction between the Iranian proxy militias and the Iranian government. That was made clear by the missile attacks that came from Iran. More importantly, we now know Donald Trump's red line. In truth, when knew it implicitly back last summer when he failed to retaliate militarily over the downing of our drone. Then it was implicit, since then it's been explicit. If Iran or its proxies kill Americans, America will retaliate in a showstopping way, and I think that's one reason why the Iranians want to back out of this conflict.",

The president began his address to the nation today, by saying once again, he will never permit Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. But he emphasized the U.S. is ready to embrace peace.

Fox Five in Atlanta where researchers report the largest ever one year decline in the U.S. cancer death rate.

Fox 40 in Sacramento as California's governor says he is seeking $750 million in part to help pay rent for people facing homelessness. Democrat Gavin Newsom plans to sign an executive order creating the fund two days before he presents his second annual budget proposal to the California State Legislature. And this is a live look at Detroit from our affiliate Fox Two. One of the big stories there tonight Takata recalls 10 million more front airbag inflators sold to 14 different automakers because they can explode with too much force and hurl shrapnel. The recall is the last one the bankrupt company agreed to win a 2015 settlement with U.S. safety regulators.

They reviewed with us the various options from which the president shows on the list of options they presented. And the president chose correctly, in my opinion. Qassem Soleimani has been in a terrorist mastermind for Iran for more than 20 years. And has the blood of thousands of Americans on his hands. The president drew a very clear red line, if any American harmed by an Iranian attack, by their proxies, or by Iran itself, he would retaliate. That's what happened when you strike one of their militia's bases on December 29th. You know, and when they attacked our embassy and we had a target of opportunity with Qassem Soleimani, we took it. The world is a better place and America is a safer place."

But they did so because in the parlance of experts, we've restored deterrence or as we say, in Arkansas, the Ayatollahs are scared of the United States once again. It was very important that the president stressed at his speech today that his red line remains in place.

Every president of both parties has believed that since it was passed in 1973. The second, Congress can act to cut off funding for military operations anytime it wishes. In fact, some left-wing congressmen and senators tried to do that just last year to stop the president from taking any military action, even justified self-defense as we did against Iran, and over the last two weeks, and those measures failed in the Congress.

Democrats are saying they weren't impressed with the briefing about the imminence of the attack.  Yet, you and other Republicans say it was everything you thought it should be. Are we looking now at intelligence and the issue of possibly getting into action against Iran through a partisan lens? And is that a bad thing?"

    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Well, Bret, I think it's unfortunate that so many Democrats are making the question of the imminence of this attack a partisan measure.  General Milley was very clear. The intelligence you saw suggested a major attack against our troops in Iraq and the Middle East, within weeks, if not days. Intelligence rarely gets better than that. It rarely tells you the exact moment and the exact day the exact place. But finally, I just have to say on questions of eminence, it probably looks a lot different if you're a soldier sitting in Iraq than if you're a comfortable senator sitting behind secure doors with armed guards in Washington, D.C."

And President Trump in a series of back and forth escalations in the last 18 months have brought us to that place. Now, some of my colleagues may earnestly believe that it would be a good idea for us to be at war with Iran. Many of us don't think it's a good idea. But we should all be able to agree that we shouldn't be at war unless Congress has a debate and vote. That's what the Constitution requires. And frankly, that's what our troops deserve. They deserve to know that there's a political consensus by the legislative body, that this is a mission in the national interest. And there's no shortcuts. And I think that's why Republicans came out of the briefing today so angry because the White House prefers were very dismissive of the notion that Congress should have anything to say about this."

I actually believed that the rationale was that yes, he was an enemy combatant. He was part of the terrorist groups that were authorized under the 2001 authorization. And when he put himself in the position of enemy combatant, then he was subject to that authorization. What we don't have in Iran is we don't have an authorization. Today in the briefing, the administration is not claiming that the 2001 authorization cover the attack on Soleimani. They're just claiming Article Two power."

You know, we were within minutes of a missile strike against Iran last summer, and then it got called off at the last minute.  And then there was a de-escalation, and then we've escalated again.

First, beyond our borders tonight. A car bomb exploded at a checkpoint in Somalia's capital this morning, killing three people and wounding six others. The Al Qaeda linked al-Shabaab extremist group quickly claimed responsibility. A government spokesman there says the blast occurred as soldiers conducted searches at a checkpoint. The presidents of Turkey and Russia inaugurated the dual natural gas line connecting their countries today. The meeting in Istanbul between Turkish President Erdogan and Russia's Putin celebrated the opening of a new export path for Russian gas into Turkey and Europe, and a promise of greater cooperation in trade and diplomacy. Auto executive turned fugitive Carlos Ghosn says his arrest in Japan was a plot against him, and described his detention conditions as a travesty against human rights.

Let's bring in our panel, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for \"Axios.\" Jonathan, at the White House, are they hopeful that this is kind of the beginning of turning a corner when it comes to dealing with Iran? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": The sense I have from talking to people in the White House is that they are not naive that this is the dawn of some new diplomatic renaissance with Iran, but they are happy -- I should maybe use a different word -- at least hopeful that this is -- if this is the conclusion of this little skirmish, it's probably a good outcome. I do not think for a second that Iran is going to stop its malign the behavior across the region, that its proxies may take other actions. There are several questions they are really examining at the moment. One is the idea of Iran using deniability, its proxies to hit maybe an ally, and what does the United States do then? And of course, the question of its nuclear program, which we saw the president talk about then. They can get that up and going pretty quickly. And then we're now talking about back to the last decade, early last decade when you are thinking about the Israelis or the U.S. getting involved preemptively."

Charter, targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens and senior officials was launched. We do not seek escalation or war but will defend ourselves against any aggression.\" After what we saw against Iran and its response, kind of what that signaled, does it diminish this argument about whether the Soleimani attack was justified or not, taking out this terrorist? SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": I think the last sentence that you read from that tweet is the most important here, which is that they are not seeking to escalate this. And they issued that tweet right after they fired those missiles. So on Capitol Hill, people are describing it, Republicans, as the strike is a form of de-escalation because there weren't any casualties. So it provided Iran with a way to answer back from the Soleimani drone attack that killed Soleimani and those other officials without killing any Americans or causing enough damage that the U.S. uses its full force against Iran, which Iran doesn't want because they can't survive that."

MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": Any missile can kill people, and you saw some of the damage to those structures, and even the best awareness might lead to accidental casualties. Here's two things we know. One is we now know that there is no distinction between the Iranian proxy militias and the Iranian government. That was made clear by the missile attacks that came from Iran. More importantly, we now know Donald Trump's red line. In truth, when knew it implicitly back last summer when he failed to retaliate militarily over the downing of our drone. Then it was implicit, since then it's been explicit. If Iran or its proxies kill Americans, America will retaliate in a showstopping way, and I think that's one reason why the Iranians want to back out of this conflict."

It's really important to understand, and I've spent a lot of time now talking to people in the intelligence community, the Pentagon, and other part of the government to try and understand how they perceive that Iran is operating. First, Zarif is a minor -- he's not around the table with the ayatollah. He's a very slick operator, but he's not a decision-maker.
