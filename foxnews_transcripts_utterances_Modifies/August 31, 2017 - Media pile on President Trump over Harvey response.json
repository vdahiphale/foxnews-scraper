Some areas in Texas received over 50 inches of rain creating what one scientist is calling a once in every thousand years flooding events. Vice President Mike Pence visited with storm survivors in Texas today and President Trump is donating $1 million of his own money to storm victims.  The latest on Harvey and its aftermath, let's go to Steve Harrigan in Silsbee, Texas. Steve?",

So, when the press then says, but you didn't do it and guess what, we have a FOX News poll out today that says only 26 percent of Americans think of him as a compassionate person. I think it plays into a negative image about his weaknesses. And so, the press then says, well, I mean, this guy doesn't seem very compassionate and you guys say, oh, that's the mainstream press. Or on the immigrants' issue, who has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign?  Maybe that's the reason he got elected, because he was hard on illegal immigrants, immigrants in general. And now when people say, well, what about, you know, are they stopping immigrants at the checkpoints? Are they going to do some kind of sweep at the shelters to find illegal immigrants?

Meanwhile, people are being airlifted from certain death. It's such a powerful contrast at least to me. Now, these conflicts over statues and historical figures, they exist in good times because we have the time to discuss it. But a disaster rescues us from such a reoccurring division. Now I know, we're supposed to hate each other says the media. And it must be hard for identity activists to see folks in trucker hats or hoodies, rescuing people of all stripes. They can't wait to get back to the rage when the waters recede. But for now, tribulation silences all tribes. It's the calm that came with a terrible storm.

I worry that we can cut and cut and cuts, this all started with President Obama expelling 35 Russians at the end of 2016 right before he left office in retaliation for election meddling. Then they cut to 750 Americans, now we cut, we can cut until there's no one left on diplomatic channels on either side, on either country. Then everybody loses because we have no way to communicate with the Russians anymore. Whether we like them or not, whether we want to talk to them or not, we have to communicate to them about some very important issues. The Syrian civil war. Like Afghanistan. Like a rock, like all kinds of different things. I do commend the Trump administration in this instance, they did say they are closing consulates in a few small offices. Those people, the Russians who work there can be reassigned. We're not expelling them from the country which is smart. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX \"The Five\" SHOW HOST: But I mean on the other hand, is it comparable? The way you guys talk about it, President Trump is punishing the Russians, but in fact the Russians kicked out 60 percent of our diplomats at our key embassy in Moscow. That damages our ability to do what you are talking about which is communicate and talk. We didn't kick out any of their people now, we kicked out 35 earlier. That is a minuscule by comparison, 60 percent of all diplomats. What compounded this from a position of the state department is when the Russians, we're talking about the evil Vladimir Putin kicked out the Americans, President Trump's reaction was thanks for helping us cut the size of government.

Which makes me think they really don't care that this is a political point that they are trying to make. I would never say the media is trying to do this. By the way, it was, you know, both sides do this. The side out of power always goes after the site in power during Hurricane Sandy, there was a lot of criticism about Obama hugging Chris Christie, do you remember that? But the interesting thing, I think this is a different time. I don't think President Trump is as big a factor in this because it seems like Texas represents such a positive unifying force that people can't really turn this into a bad thing.

This to me is a really shining example of the best of American cooperative efforts, trying to help one another of our unity, about what unites us rather than what divides us. So, I think it has been in a way a time of healing through tremendous tragedy, or people have said, you know what? We really actually have so much more in common than what the mainstream media or press would tell us that divides us, and that I think is really important."

If he had gone down to Texas, if he had actually gone to the front lines. People say, well, you know what, he's going through the motions to try to create an image that will appeal to Americans, well, he didn't do it. So, when the press then says, but you didn't do it and guess what, we have a FOX News poll out today that says only 26 percent of Americans think of him as a compassionate person. I think it plays into a negative image about his weaknesses. And so, the press then says, well, I mean, this guy doesn't seem very compassionate and you guys say, oh, that's the mainstream press. Or on the immigrants' issue, who has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign? Maybe that's the reason he got elected, because he was hard on illegal immigrants, immigrants in general. And now when people say, well, what about, you know, are they stopping immigrants at the checkpoints? Are they going to do some kind of sweep at the shelters to find illegal immigrants? Are illegal immigrants eligible for benefits? All these questions bubble up because he has demonstrated such an antipathy towards immigrants."

It's fair to say, okay, President Trump is not taking on this sort of consoler in chief attitude. He has not maybe been so overly emotive, he is not been hugging people.

I believe that The Washington Post was sexist in choosing a woman to do the story. Kayla Epstein because that provided them with a camouflage to trash the First Lady. It's about trashing the First Lady. If you look at the Twitter feeds of Kayla Epstein, not a Trump fan by any means but they used her, they used her sex to cover this.

But you're also seeing another kind of rescue, one from all of those conflicts that occurred before the flood. Stuff about statues and privilege and gender identity and trigger warnings. These stories still exist. But in times of crisis, they seem to fade. But some still pop up as a reminder of how things used to be. Right now there are cities planning to replace Columbus Day with \"Indigenous Day.\" I don't know what to think except that it's got to be cool to have all that time on your hands to debate that stuff in dry comfortable weather. Meanwhile, people are being airlifted from certain death. It's such a powerful contrast at least to me. Now, these conflicts over statues and historical figures, they exist in good times because we have the time to discuss it. But a disaster rescues us from such a reoccurring division. Now I know, we're supposed to hate each other says the media. And it must be hard for identity activists to see folks in trucker hats or hoodies, rescuing people of all stripes. They can't wait to get back to the rage when the waters recede. But for now, tribulation silences all tribes. It's the calm that came with a terrible storm. Kimberly, I'm trying to contrast between reality and made-for-TV outrage. You can talk -- we can have discussions about indigenous day and all that stuff if were not living a horrible life.

What in fact is going on on a daily basis, you can't even imagine it if you're put in this position with our family and friends and wondering if our loved ones were they are, they haven't begun even recovery efforts in terms of the waters because they're too high. So, the contrast is very difficult.

So, James Baker used to be secretary of state and Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta, UN Ambassador, I believe. And it basically said, you know, we have to start talking to each other. We have to get back to the idea of solving problems.

I would rather be offended instead of all of that stuff. But people are so coddled in this country, they can't experience discomfort. They can't experience offense.

Then they cut to 750 Americans, now we cut, we can cut until there's no one left on diplomatic channels on either side, on either country. Then everybody loses because we have no way to communicate with the Russians anymore. Whether we like them or not, whether we want to talk to them or not, we have to communicate to them about some very important issues. The Syrian civil war. Like Afghanistan. Like a rock, like all kinds of different things. I do commend the Trump administration in this instance, they did say they are closing consulates in a few small offices. Those people, the Russians who work there can be reassigned. We're not expelling them from the country which is smart. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX \"The Five\" SHOW HOST: But I mean on the other hand, is it comparable? The way you guys talk about it, President Trump is punishing the Russians, but in fact the Russians kicked out 60 percent of our diplomats at our key embassy in Moscow. That damages our ability to do what you are talking about which is communicate and talk. We didn't kick out any of their people now, we kicked out 35 earlier. That is a minuscule by comparison, 60 percent of all diplomats. What compounded this from a position of the state department is when the Russians, we're talking about the evil Vladimir Putin kicked out the Americans, President Trump's reaction was thanks for helping us cut the size of government.

That is what it is, she gets out in front of as many people as she can, rehabilitate her image so she is still got some zhing and her step, she is in good health, she knows how to make a buck and she gets to tell her side of it.
