      "sentences": "All right, you have been listening to the president of the United States. Thirty-three days into a government shutdown, the State of the Union speech is down. It's not going to happen, at least in the House of Representatives.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is “Your World.”  We have never seen something like this in American history. We have seen a State of the Union speech that was delayed because of the Challenger disaster when Ronald Reagan was president in 1986, but no one was denying him the opportunity eventually to talk to the American people. So there is no precedent for what is unfolding here before us.  A president denied by the speaker the House to speak in the House of Representatives, in the well of the House, as other presidents have. She arguing, of course, the government is shut down. Until it's open, then there will be no address. The president complying with that, but hinting, hinting of an alternative that could be in the works. We just don't know.  This much, we do. We are in uncharted territory, my friends. And doesn't John Roberts know it at the White House?  Hey, John.",

      "sentences": "This has been two years of a presidency of precedents. And today was no different. The president describing this in pretty stark terms, saying it was a horrible precedent, a sad thing for the country, then at the very end there calling it a disgrace, saying that he will have a response in due course. Nancy Pelosi has said they won't have this concurrent resolution for the president to use the House of Representatives to give the State of the Union until government is open.   But I would think, Neil, that even if the government were to be open in the next few days, they couldn't find a -- quote -- \"mutually agreeable date\" that would put it back on track for Tuesday. So it really does sound like a State of the Union Tuesday is off, which means now that the White House is likely going to go to plan B, because they have said that the president is going to give an address, whether it be in Congress or whether it be somewhere else, to the American people on the 29th. I have heard that they have discussed several locations outside of Washington, D.C. So it looks like, at this moment, they will probably start the train rolling on the plan B. But I have got to tell you, when we saw this letter from the president to Nancy Pelosi earlier today, I thought to myself, here comes the strategy to call her out, put the ball deep into her court, then see how she responds.  The president in his letter to Nancy Pelosi saying, look, your original concerns about security are not a concern, so I will see you on Tuesday night, to which she only had two options. One was to say, OK, we will see you on Tuesday night, we will have the State of the Union, or, B, find some sort of parliamentary way of saying, we're not going to invite you.   So now the president has the political victory of saying the speaker of the House has for the very first time in this nation's history canceled the State of the Union address. And I think he believes he can get a lot of political mileage out of this -- Neil.",

He's talking about in his latest proposal 234 miles of barriers, including fencing for people, including some barriers for vehicles and, yes, including some steel barriers he's talked about that are pretty substantial.   But it's in the areas of the border where everybody agrees it's needed. It's based on a plan that experts put together, saying, what are the top 10 priorities for the border, starting with Texas, where you have only got 100 miles of fence, despite the fact that it's 1,200 miles of the 2,000-mile border?",

So, we do have an issue on the border that has to be addressed. He's right. The drug issue is very real. It's crystal meth, it's heroin. It is coming across the Mexican border.  And we also have issues in human trafficking, women and children being traffic increasingly. So there is -- there is a crisis on the border. I don't think you can avoid saying that. And we have now a proposal that is a reasonable proposal. Do Democrats have some changes they would like to make? Yes. Let's make those changes. I think the president would be OK with that. But in the meantime, let's do open government. And this is where -- you and I have talked about this before -- I never believed that shutting down government provided leverage. One, I think it's a bad idea to shut down government. The taxpayer ends up losing. Families of workers end up losing. The economy ends up getting hit, so it really doesn't make sense.

      "sentences": "Hi, Neil. First, let's start with the good news. It's business as usual this evening at Newark Liberty International Airport, this after two pilots coming in for a landing spotted a drone. One of the pilots said the drone was about 30 feet from his aircraft. Take a look today inside Terminal B. And you can see for yourself that the departures and arrivals appear to be taking place uneventfully. But it was a very different situation last night. All incoming flights for about 30 minutes were prevented from landing and had to circle. A number of them were diverted to other airports. And flights still on the ground at other airports or heading to Newark were temporarily halted, resulting in delays rippling through the system. Some flights, though, from Newark, the flights that were taking off, were not affected. That's because they used a different flight path. Now, a statement from the FAA reads in part: \"At approximately 5:00 p.m., we received two reports from incoming flights into Newark that a drone was sighted at about 3,500 feet above Teterboro, New Jersey. At that point, flights arriving into Newark were held for a short duration.\" And, as you mentioned, this is a story that is all too familiar. During 2017 -- that is the year for which we have the most recent statistics -- there were more than 2,000 such sightings in the United States alone. Not only are these occurrences dangerous, but they can be very costly. You might recall that just before Christmas, more than 1,000 flights to Gatwick Airport just outside of London were canceled because of multiple drone sightings. That incident cost the airlines an estimated $60 million- plus. Now, these events, these incidents can also be very costly for the perpetrators themselves. Here in the United States, they could face fines up to $15,000, that in addition to criminal penalties. I should say, Neil, that the Trump administration says it is keenly aware of the issue of drone safety and the air traffic system, and that the Department of Transportation is working on a number of proposals to do -- to address what is now a growing problem -- Neil.",

As you or I or anyone who's traveled to any Third World country can tell you, there's a nice lifestyle available to the wealthy, but they're living behind armed guards. So it's not -- nobody thinks that having poor people or people who need to resort to violence to make a living is a good idea. But that's a very different thing from squelching the exact kind of economic initiative, the exact kind of innovation, the exact kind of investment that you need at a technological turning point moment like this.

It can't be based on a missed call or a wrong call on the field. And it can't be at the behest of a club that was impacted by that.

      "utterance": "All right, you have been listening to the president of the United States. Thirty-three days into a government shutdown, the State of the Union speech is down. It's not going to happen, at least in the House of Representatives. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is “Your World.” We have never seen something like this in American history. We have seen a State of the Union speech that was delayed because of the Challenger disaster when Ronald Reagan was president in 1986, but no one was denying him the opportunity eventually to talk to the American people. So there is no precedent for what is unfolding here before us. A president denied by the speaker the House to speak in the House of Representatives, in the well of the House, as other presidents have. She arguing, of course, the government is shut down. Until it's open, then there will be no address. The president complying with that, but hinting, hinting of an alternative that could be in the works. We just don't know. This much, we do. We are in uncharted territory, my friends. And doesn't John Roberts know it at the White House? Hey, John."
    },

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "This has been two years of a presidency of precedents. And today was no different. The president describing this in pretty stark terms, saying it was a horrible precedent, a sad thing for the country, then at the very end there calling it a disgrace, saying that he will have a response in due course. Nancy Pelosi has said they won't have this concurrent resolution for the president to use the House of Representatives to give the State of the Union until government is open. But I would think, Neil, that even if the government were to be open in the next few days, they couldn't find a -- quote -- \"mutually agreeable date\" that would put it back on track for Tuesday. So it really does sound like a State of the Union Tuesday is off, which means now that the White House is likely going to go to plan B, because they have said that the president is going to give an address, whether it be in Congress or whether it be somewhere else, to the American people on the 29th. I have heard that they have discussed several locations outside of Washington, D.C. So it looks like, at this moment, they will probably start the train rolling on the plan B. But I have got to tell you, when we saw this letter from the president to Nancy Pelosi earlier today, I thought to myself, here comes the strategy to call her out, put the ball deep into her court, then see how she responds. The president in his letter to Nancy Pelosi saying, look, your original concerns about security are not a concern, so I will see you on Tuesday night, to which she only had two options. One was to say, OK, we will see you on Tuesday night, we will have the State of the Union, or, B, find some sort of parliamentary way of saying, we're not going to invite you. So now the president has the political victory of saying the speaker of the House has for the very first time in this nation's history canceled the State of the Union address. And I think he believes he can get a lot of political mileage out of this -- Neil."

And it has this expansion of the DACA and the TPS group that the Democrats have been calling for."

But my hope is that there will be some amendments offered that will be bipartisan. I'm working on that, as you indicated earlier. I'm meeting this afternoon with a bunch of Democrats and Republicans, a bunch of us who realize this is not good for anybody. It's not good for the economy. It's certainly not good for the taxpayers. And it's not good for the families who are affected, the federal workers and their families."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PORTMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it's -- it's a lot of members who have been public. So I can say some of their names. Tim Kaine, for instance, from Virginia has been a leader on dealing with this DACA issue and the TPS issue, the sort of people that have a protected status right now."
    },

      "speaker": "PORTMAN",

So it's been just a group of members that have said, it's time for us to actually figure out how to find a way forward to get out of this mess. Shutdowns don't make sense. But the president's proposal on the border is very reasonable. What he's talking about is not 2,000 miles of a cement wall. In fact, he was never talking about that. He's talking about in his latest proposal 234 miles of barriers, including fencing for people, including some barriers for vehicles and, yes, including some steel barriers he's talked about that are pretty substantial. But it's in the areas of the border where everybody agrees it's needed. It's based on a plan that experts put together, saying, what are the top 10 priorities for the border, starting with Texas, where you have only got 100 miles of fence, despite the fact that it's 1,200 miles of the 2,000-mile border?"

And he's doing it consistent with a plan that the Customs and Border Protection people have put forward that has been involved in both of the last appropriations bills, last year's bill and this bill, on a bipartisan basis, who said this plan makes sense. So, that's where we are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, no, you're right. But let's be clear then, Senator. He calls it a barrier. You have called it a barrier. Others have called it security at the border. If he avoids the term wall, apparently, which sticks in the craw of a lot of Democrats, and, to your point, the same Democrats who voted for this earlier and under Barack Obama at least twice, but, having said that, do you think that would get the monkey off everyone's back, something as simple as semantics?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PORTMAN",
      "utterance": "It would help. It would help, because, right now, we're talking past each other. I mean, when you hear what the Democrats are saying, how they're characterizing the president's proposal, it's not accurate. But, also, let's be honest. The way the president is characterizing it sometimes makes it sound like it's a wall all the way across the border. And it's not ."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But do you regret that the president -- it's easy to play Monday- morning quarterback, sir, and I understand that -- but that attaching funding for the government, in other words, attaching this to a potential shutdown if he didn't get his way, was the right way to go, that this has now set the stage that simply won't end?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PORTMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, let me say something first about your previous comment. The president has used the word barrier repeatedly, and he has said repeatedly it's not a cement wall anymore. Now, at other times, he has used the word wall. So he has sort of said both. And people have chosen..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, he might have changed it from cement to steel, but he was often using wall. And through the campaign, we ran just a few bites where wall came up."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PORTMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes.  Well, I think you have an honest conversation where the facts are presented, which is that we do have an increase in people crossing the border. In the last two months of last year, we had more people crossing, actually twice as many people as the year before. We had a 50 percent increase in kids and family. So, we do have an issue on the border that has to be addressed. He's right. The drug issue is very real. It's crystal meth, it's heroin. It is coming across the Mexican border. And we also have issues in human trafficking, women and children being traffic increasingly. So there is -- there is a crisis on the border. I don't think you can avoid saying that. And we have now a proposal that is a reasonable proposal. Do Democrats have some changes they would like to make? Yes. Let's make those changes. I think the president would be OK with that. But in the meantime, let's do open government. And this is where -- you and I have talked about this before -- I never believed that shutting down government provided leverage. One, I think it's a bad idea to shut down government. The taxpayer ends up losing. Families of workers end up losing. The economy ends up getting hit, so it really doesn't make sense. I don't think it provides leverage. But what I do think is, the president has got a proposal that needs to be taken seriously."

President Nicolas Maduro has broken off relations with the United States, will not recognize the U.S. government. We have urged our personnel there to get out of there. All this as Juan Guaido, the challenger, is being recognized by us and now the Canadians, we're told the Brits, as the legitimate leader of Venezuela. They want interim elections, but it is mass confusion in a country that is seeing inflation run amok. And it's getting worse. What do you think we should do?"

You have millions of Venezuelans who are now fleeing the country, including going into some of our allied countries like Colombia and creating enormous challenges there, somewhat comparable to what you see in the Middle East with regard to Syrian refugees going into Europe and other places.

I mean, they have no allies left to speak of. And, increasingly, countries are saying, why don't we come together as a group of Latin American and North American countries to address this issue? And that's the right way to do it. So I think we need to be careful not to do it unilaterally. But I think, in conjunction with the other countries, the so-called OAS countries, we should definitely be taking more actions."

It's business as usual this evening at Newark Liberty International Airport, this after two pilots coming in for a landing spotted a drone. One of the pilots said the drone was about 30 feet from his aircraft. Take a look today inside Terminal B. And you can see for yourself that the departures and arrivals appear to be taking place uneventfully. But it was a very different situation last night. All incoming flights for about 30 minutes were prevented from landing and had to circle. A number of them were diverted to other airports. And flights still on the ground at other airports or heading to Newark were temporarily halted, resulting in delays rippling through the system. Some flights, though, from Newark, the flights that were taking off, were not affected. That's because they used a different flight path."

At that point, flights arriving into Newark were held for a short duration.\" And, as you mentioned, this is a story that is all too familiar. During 2017 -- that is the year for which we have the most recent statistics -- there were more than 2,000 such sightings in the United States alone. Not only are these occurrences dangerous, but they can be very costly. You might recall that just before Christmas, more than 1,000 flights to Gatwick Airport just outside of London were canceled because of multiple drone sightings. That incident cost the airlines an estimated $60 million- plus. Now, these events, these incidents can also be very costly for the perpetrators themselves. Here in the United States, they could face fines up to $15,000, that in addition to criminal penalties. I should say, Neil, that the Trump administration says it is keenly aware of the issue of drone safety and the air traffic system, and that the Department of Transportation is working on a number of proposals to do -- to address what is now a growing problem -- Neil."

You know, all this talk about a top rate of 70 percent have a lot of people saying it's never going to happen, never going to happen. We used to have it happen a lot. In fact, it used to be a lot higher than that. Says who? The media called to see it that way -- after this."

It's a host of other Democratic announced and not-yet-announced Democrats who are seeking the White House and others who are saying, you know what? We have to rejigger this tax code. We have to hike taxes on the rich, not necessarily to 70 percent at the top end, but hike them just the same. Just the new guy coming in to take over the House Budget Committee has talked about raising the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, experimenting with the possibility of raising taxes on the upper income as well. You add it all up, there's a lot of focus on making sure those taxes move up. To Deke Digital CEO Dave Maney on this. Dave, how seriously do you take this? It was serious enough, I noticed, in Davos with a lot of these big money managers, saying, unlikely though it is to happen with just a Democratic House and the other two branches of government under firm Republican control, it is setting the table for 2020. What do you think?"

I think that the -- I think that there are all sorts of motivations for a Democratic Party to try to push that tax slider up just as high as it will go. And it's a core and fundamental philosophical way of looking at the world. Their view is that all roads should lead through the government and that tribute should be paid to those in the control of that government. And when you take 70 percent of the marginal dollar that's made in America, then guess what? You have to go do business with the government. You have to ask favor from the government. You have to ask for ways to avoid paying that tax. And all that leads to, in my opinion, Democratic campaign coffers."

Obviously, with the Democratic base, it's one thing, but it is interesting to note that -- and to be fair to the congresswoman, she talks about the 70 percent rate kicking in over $10 million. But the trend is the trend. And one of the things that has come up is this idea that it would forcibly lower the gap between the rich and the poor. In fact, there was a very otherwise well-written column in Bloomberg today talking about the wisdom of that and that was the intention of our founders. And I'm thinking, I don't know if that was the intention of our founders, but very smart media folks who are saying, not a bad idea."

So there's no anchor there. Is it a bad idea to have giant income inequality? I don't know about income. I know that giant wealth disparity causes problems. As you or I or anyone who's traveled to any Third World country can tell you, there's a nice lifestyle available to the wealthy, but they're living behind armed guards. So it's not -- nobody thinks that having poor people or people who need to resort to violence to make a living is a good idea. But that's a very different thing from squelching the exact kind of economic initiative, the exact kind of innovation, the exact kind of investment that you need at a technological turning point moment like this. It's economic idiocy. And you have -- and so you have got to look behind. If it doesn't make any economic sense, and they know it doesn't make any economic sense, then you have got to sort of say, so why are you guys really doing this?"

They are blowing these calls, whether it was the Eagles a couple weeks ago, or the Saints and the Steelers, last week. This is a joke, but the bottom line is, Roger Goodell, the commissioner, doesn't care. The rating was 44.1 million people watched this game. People, unless you're from New Orleans, are not going to not watch the Super Bowl. Goodell doesn't care because it's all about the money. But the referees are a joke this year."

And why are these rules in the NFL rule book if they're not going to be applicable at any point in time? And the fact that the league admitted guilt by calling coach Payton and saying that that was a blown call, it was clearly pass interference, it was a missed call, I'm pretty sure that these fans do have a leg to stand on here and call on the NFL to do something. Now, with all of the crises that the NFL has faced, you would think that they would just maybe not want to mess with New Orleans on this one. And I, as a Patriots fan, can admit, I do not want to play the Saints in the Super Bowl. I don't want to, but they should be the team there."

And, unfortunately, in the court of law, the precedent has been established that failure to meet a fan's expectation is not an actionable offense. So where I would disagree -- or, rather, clarify what Ashley said..."

And that's an action by club on the field, non-participant fan interference -- a crazy streaker jumps on the field, something like that -- or a calamity, a ceiling tile dislodges. The problem comes in the next portion. And that's Article 2, which is the limitations placed on the commissioner's ability to intervene and effectively overturn an outcome. It can't be based on a missed call or a wrong call on the field. And it can't be at the behest of a club that was impacted by that. So, commissioner Goodell would have to, in his own independent judgment, determine that either we needed to replay the last minute and 49, or avoid it, and start from the beginning. But the reality is, we're now 10 days out from the Super Bowl. In a $14 billion industry -- and, as Gunzelman mentioned a moment ago, it's the single most viewed Nielsen event on the calendar every single year."

Because I think we have focused on the federal workers who are drawing down -- paying tax penalties, drawing down their IRA, or going against their credit card accounts, but the small contractors will never get repaid, all the private businesses who support around national parks and others never going to get any payback.
