Now, she stood up a bit for some of those principles that she ran on as she stood here, expressing thanks and gratitude to her team, to her supporters. She also promised to stay in the fight, touting some of those key issues, her wealth tax, the student loan forgiveness, affordable child care.   She was asked about the two white men that are now leading the field. Warren said she thought about all the -- quote -- \"little girls who were going to have to wait four more years.\" What Warren didn't say is who she would endorse.",

So the fact that he thinks that the corrupt establishment is the reason he keeps losing, and not the fact that he has failed to make connections with regular Democratic base voters, he's trying to start a revolution.

So he's done his part. It's up to the campaign now to go and package those messages and deliver them to those states. And it will change the map a little bit. Florida is in play if Biden is the nominee. If Bernie is, not so much. We would focus on some of the other Rust Belt states a little bit more. But it doesn't change the president's odds when we look at some of these polls where the president is down in some of these key swing states.

Remember, Elizabeth Warren, she went to war with Bernie Sanders. She said that he told her she couldn't win the presidency because she was a woman. That's a very significant attack that a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters are going to remember and that Elizabeth Warren supporters are going to remember. But I think that something to focus on here is that Elizabeth Warren has been progressive, but she's also been very friendly with the DNC in a way that Bernie Sanders has not.

And also to address Bernie Sanders' comments that he made, saying that Joe Biden is simply being supported by Wall Street and corrupt billionaires, Bernie Sanders knew he had an issue with African-American voters, yet skipped the Selma march, did not go to Edmund Pettus Bridge, has not spoken out on Nathaniel Woods, who is set to be executed in Alabama in just a couple hours. So the fact that he thinks that the corrupt establishment is the reason he keeps losing, and not the fact that he has failed to make connections with regular Democratic base voters, he's trying to start a revolution.

He's delivered on his promises that he made during the campaign. Voters across all of the swing states have seen lowest unemployment, highest wages, lowest taxes, lower regulation. So he's done his part. It's up to the campaign now to go and package those messages and deliver them to those states. And it will change the map a little bit. Florida is in play if Biden is the nominee. If Bernie is, not so much. We would focus on some of the other Rust Belt states a little bit more. But it doesn't change the president's odds when we look at some of these polls where the president is down in some of these key swing states. It's no different than, in 2016, when he was down against Hillary Clinton, and he still won. So the campaign is confident. We're just going to see which states we need to focus on."

It's certainly something that, for any presidency, if this sort of thing isn't handled correctly, could be a problem long term for the president. And I think that is why you have seen stepped-up efforts within the White House to put in new staff, to put Mike Pence in charge of this, to do daily briefings at the White House, most of which have been on camera, to really get out the information to the public to try and stall some of this, again, as you said, with the markets."

This is where people simply say, we cannot politicize something that we do not understand. It's not as if this is a partisan issue, how to deal with coronavirus. And I think one of the first political missteps that the president has made with his judgment was when he put the word hoax and coronavirus in the same speech, and then to the very next day have people start dying in Washington state and in Seattle. It does make it look like there's somebody asleep at the switch when it comes to dealing with this national -- this emergency.

And I think that's why the chief justice did what he did, pointed out that -- where Schumer was absolutely wrong. And I think, if I were one of those justices, I would be concerned. Look, that's the kind of thing that happened to ball players from the Republican Party before a congressional ball game, where, at their practice field, they were attacked. And it became a shooting field, with someone trying to kill them. You have to be very concerned with your words.

When the ship returned to San Francisco on February 21, 62 people never got off. They continued on the subsequent cruise to Hawaii. Since they have possibly been exposed, they are now under quarantine in their cabins. So, for now, no word on when this ship will be allowed to return or where it will dock. Neil, it was scheduled to come back here to San Francisco to this pier on Saturday. That is probably optimistic, and much will depend, as we heard, on the test results.

Remember, Elizabeth Warren, she went to war with Bernie Sanders. She said that he told her she couldn't win the presidency because she was a woman. That's a very significant attack that a lot of Bernie Sanders supporters are going to remember and that Elizabeth Warren supporters are going to remember. But I think that something to focus on here is that Elizabeth Warren has been progressive, but she's also been very friendly with the DNC in a way that Bernie Sanders has not.

I need a little less sanctimony, a little more honor and humility in the business. He has to remember that, when Merrick Garland wanted a hearing, he denied a hearing. He then went on to say last year that if -- if there were opening on a Supreme Court, and President Trump would forward the nominee, he would give that nominee hearing even in an election year, which was his reason for not doing it for Merrick Garland."

Remember, the chief justice, in his report, his annual report just a few months ago said that our democracy is a fragile thing, and we have to work to hold onto it. I thought he was sending a message to both Democrats and Republicans. But the other day, he had to send wonder directly to Senator Schumer. I was pleased to see him go to the floor today.

Think about it. Conventions, meetings, conferences, you name it, companies are nixing all of it. How do businesses deal with this, when billions of dollars are on the line? Let's ask for McDonald's USA President and CEO Ed Rensi. Ed, I'm thinking of your old haunts, and I'm thinking about all the companies now, as we get into annual shareholder meeting time, that are looking and reexamining even having them. What do you think of that?"

We need to educate ourselves on what's going on from the public health service. We need to make sure that our employees practice hygiene, washing their hands, using sanitizing, restrict as much as possible international travel, until we know more about what the landscape look like. It's going to be expensive, come to grips with it. I think stakeholders and shareholders will come to understand that we need to have precaution. Public health is more important at any moment than shareholder wealth, in my opinion."

In other words, people then start thinking, all right, I'm not going to go to movie theaters, because a lot of people congregate there. I'm not going to basketball venues, a lot of people congregate there. And they extend it to restaurants. I'm not going to go a restaurant. I might even think twice about a drive-through. Where does this end?"

What a lot of U.S. companies do know is, it's way too much of their business that's depending on China, not just as a place to sell their stuff, but as a place to make their stuff. Now tech giants like Apple and Microsoft are trying to spread the wealth. But if my next guest is right, it won't be easy, and it won't be cheap, and it might not come soon. To the man who literally wrote the book about \"The Coming Collapse of China,\" Gordon Chang. So, Gordon, a lot of them want to sort of hedge their bets, spread their wealth. Easier said than done, right? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Well, it is. But, for some companies, it's pretty easy. So, if you have, let's say, low- tech manufacturing, you can move out six months, nine months. That occurred during the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, when companies left and then came back. But if you're Apple, and you are fixed in China with Foxconn, the contract manufacturer, it's going to take some time. But, Neil, they're going to have to do it, because manufacturing in China is becoming unsustainable."

    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "No, Neil, because the Communist Party is imposing extraordinary controls on information. Xi Jinping is doing this because he wants workers to return to their job sites. So their infection numbers and their death numbers, I think, are being managed to do that. And the other thing, Neil, is that what you're seeing is, as people go back to work, because they're forced by the government to do that, they are prolonging the epidemic, because new workers are infecting each other at this very moment."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "utterance": "All right, so we say, usually, warmer weather negates the effect. This seems to be one -- or at least a strand of it that seems to thrive in that. We just don't know. What we do know is, it's drawing economic activity, certainly, in China, to a halt. They might be in a recessionary quarter. And that will eventually spill over here. Play it out. What do you think happens?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "Well, clearly, China right now is in contraction. It is also exposing a lot of financially weak companies to the possibility of default. Beijing is now imposing, I think, essentially emergency measures to keep the economy going. They can do that for a little while, Neil. But if this virus continues longer than people expect, then it's going to really stress the financial system there. And it's going to spread panic throughout the global financial system. We have seen that now for the last three or four days, with our Dow up and down and up and down."

For those of who just tuned in, a peek at the Dow today, down about 969 points, so essentially giving back kind of what we gained yesterday. But I always like to leave you with some good news. If you are looking to refinance a mortgage or get a new one, we are at all-time lows in interest rates. That could translate to a good backstop to have. That, along with declining gas prices, mean more money in your pocket, more cash, if you're not afraid of touching it.
