The bad news, her replacement is a full-blown tin foil hat conspiracy theorist who thinks that many of our political opponents are racist and we've got a full HANNITY investigation into Karine Jean-Pierre coming up. But we begin tonight with this, the big guy Joe Biden, his genius new plan to battle inflation. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "I'm screaming at the TV, how have they helped Joe? Now since Joe has clearly lost any ability to communicate because of his cognitive decline, allow me to try to translate for him. There's no plan to curb inflation. By the way, it's not transitory either. There's no plan to lower gas prices. There's no plan to spur on economic growth or as Bloomberg reported, quote, inside the administration, there is a sense of frustration doom and some say magical thinking about inflation. Magical thinking? We're now on the verge of what is a devastating recession, coupled with record-setting inflation and of course on top of that a supply chain crisis and gas prices, yep, they just hit a brand new record high along with diesel prices. Now, the stock market is plunging right before our eyes. Fortunes, I mean fortunes are being lost by the middle class in this country and people on fixed incomes in this country. That means their pensions, retirement funds, 401ks, they're getting wrecked in the market. There's a nationwide shortage of baby formula and the White House is thinking about the economy in a magical way. Well, it's time for heads to roll. Joe's economic and energy policies, they're nothing but a complete and utter disaster. Biden's inflation is now costing you, the average American, the average American household over $5,200 annually and new numbers out today show the average American is paying $2,000 more per year just for gasoline. But nothing is going to change because the Democratic Party is ruled by socialists that are all part of this religious climate alarmist cult and they will never retreat from their radical agenda. I don't see that ever happening. They don't seem to care if you, the American people suffer. They don't care if the country implodes, so long as the system is fundamentally transformed the way they want and capitalism becomes a thing of the past and according to them, we all must pay for our sins against Mother Earth and beg Iran and Venezuela and OPEC to produce the oil we could be producing ourselves. So, no matter how high gas prices go, Biden's not going to open up drilling and fracking. He's not going to green light the Keystone XL pipeline. The Alberta premiere said we'd be getting 9,000 barrels of Canadian oil a day had he let that continue to be finished by now. And no matter how bad inflation gets, Joe's not going to stop spending either, as the economy gets worse and worse, the administration -- they keep peddling more dumb excuses one after another, you know, the usual Biden excuse. For example, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, she was supposed to be a brilliant economic mind. As it turns out, Janet has lost all touch with reality. She now wants you to believe that a future Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade is the cause of Joe Biden's economic and energy policies and all the problems we had. I thought this was all caused by Putin and Donald Trump. I guess I was wrong.",

Those are 63 million of God's created babies who would never see the light of day, who never would grow up, who never would become productive people in our economy and our society. We lost 63 million. That is a great damaging blow to the economy.

I want to ask you this economic question, we now had a report today two- thirds of Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck. I mentioned in my opening monologue that the average American household is paying, according to Bloomberg, about $5,200 extra in Biden inflation. Now if you put those two facts together and then you artificially reduce the supply of the lifeblood of the world's economy and that is oil gas and coal like Joe Biden did when he became president and now you beg Iran and Venezuela and OPEC to produce the oil that we could be producing ourselves, when you do that, Larry, isn't that a guarantee that everything you buy in every store you go to is going to cost more because supply and demand crisscross and dictate the price and you reduce the supply, demand remains constant that means we're paying more for everything and he caused it.

Now, on this program, we have consistently condemned all acts of violence and intimidation. We condemn the riots of the summer of 2020, 574 of them. We had dozens of dead Americans, billions of property damage, thousands of injured cops and the Biden administration -- well, they were either quiet or they kind of supported it. They weren't going to take on the base of their party that was responsible for it. On this program, on my radio show in real time, I condemned the violence on January 6th. I condemned it that night on this program. We also now condemn the doxxing of Supreme Court justices demonstrators stalking. Now, justice Alito and his family and Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Roberts, and in some cases forcing them to flee their own homes, can't, Jen, you know be bothered a little bit, not see the danger in this philosophy of a president of the United States putting his tacit seal of approval on this type of behavior, even though it's against the law, but I guess they aid in a bit law breaking all the time down at the border, right? Now a pro-abortion group is now planning to hold more protests at justice's private homes. And by the way, this is not only wrong. It is unlawful as I've been saying. Look at the law, section 1507, title 18 of U.S. Code, it is illegal to protest near a residence occupied or used by a judge, juror, witness or court officer with the intent of influencing the discharge of his duty. And get this, one of the reasons it's illegal to protest outside the private homes of public officials is because of a case that actually protected the privacy of an abortion doctor. So, now, is the White House going to apply the law equally or are they just going to wait around see if something really bad happens first? Now, this week, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, she got multiple death threats because of her support for constitutionalist judges. I can only imagine the kind of threats that the justices themselves are receiving and, by the way, not a word from FBI Director Wray, not a word from the DHS secretary, who just last week, Mayorkas was saying domestic extremism is the single biggest threat to America. Not a word from the Attorney General Merrick Garland, not one word at all. They're the ones that were scared of parents protesting at school board meetings and wanting to investigate whether they were domestic terrorists. And, of course, none of that matters to the genius over at \"The View\", Joyless Behar. Now she thinks this kind of intimidation is just wonderful. Take a look.",

Now since Joe has clearly lost any ability to communicate because of his cognitive decline, allow me to try to translate for him. There's no plan to curb inflation. By the way, it's not transitory either. There's no plan to lower gas prices. There's no plan to spur on economic growth or as Bloomberg reported, quote, inside the administration, there is a sense of frustration doom and some say magical thinking about inflation. Magical thinking? We're now on the verge of what is a devastating recession, coupled with record-setting inflation and of course on top of that a supply chain crisis and gas prices, yep, they just hit a brand new record high along with diesel prices. Now, the stock market is plunging right before our eyes. Fortunes, I mean fortunes are being lost by the middle class in this country and people on fixed incomes in this country. That means their pensions, retirement funds, 401ks, they're getting wrecked in the market. There's a nationwide shortage of baby formula and the White House is thinking about the economy in a magical way. Well, it's time for heads to roll. Joe's economic and energy policies, they're nothing but a complete and utter disaster. Biden's inflation is now costing you, the average American, the average American household over $5,200 annually and new numbers out today show the average American is paying $2,000 more per year just for gasoline. But nothing is going to change because the Democratic Party is ruled by socialists that are all part of this religious climate alarmist cult and they will never retreat from their radical agenda. I don't see that ever happening. They don't seem to care if you, the American people suffer. They don't care if the country implodes, so long as the system is fundamentally transformed the way they want and capitalism becomes a thing of the past and according to them, we all must pay for our sins against Mother Earth and beg Iran and Venezuela and OPEC to produce the oil we could be producing ourselves. So, no matter how high gas prices go, Biden's not going to open up drilling and fracking. He's not going to green light the Keystone XL pipeline. The Alberta premiere said we'd be getting 9,000 barrels of Canadian oil a day had he let that continue to be finished by now. And no matter how bad inflation gets, Joe's not going to stop spending either, as the economy gets worse and worse, the administration -- they keep peddling more dumb excuses one after another, you know, the usual Biden excuse. For example, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, she was supposed to be a brilliant economic mind. As it turns out, Janet has lost all touch with reality. She now wants you to believe that a future Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade is the cause of Joe Biden's economic and energy policies and all the problems we had. I thought this was all caused by Putin and Donald Trump. I guess I was wrong."

And what Janet Yellen said today in that Senate hearing was bizarre, deplorable, it's one of the worst things I've ever seen. Since Roe v. Wade, Sean, I'm sure you know these numbers, since Roe v. Wade, over 63 million abortions have been performed. Those are 63 million of God's created babies who would never see the light of day, who never would grow up, who never would become productive people in our economy and our society. We lost 63 million. That is a great damaging blow to the economy. Apart from the moral problem involved in that, what Yellen said today was grotesque and deplorable and she ought to take it back because there's no - - and nobody could respect somebody who comes out and makes a statement like that that actually more abortions would be -- would be uh good for the economy.

I want to ask you this economic question, we now had a report today two- thirds of Americans are now living paycheck to paycheck. I mentioned in my opening monologue that the average American household is paying, according to Bloomberg, about $5,200 extra in Biden inflation. Now if you put those two facts together and then you artificially reduce the supply of the lifeblood of the world's economy and that is oil gas and coal like Joe Biden did when he became president and now you beg Iran and Venezuela and OPEC to produce the oil that we could be producing ourselves, when you do that, Larry, isn't that a guarantee that everything you buy in every store you go to is going to cost more because supply and demand crisscross and dictate the price and you reduce the supply, demand remains constant that means we're paying more for everything and he caused it.

But here's the strangeness of this whole progressive agenda which has failed so badly. Here's Biden up there blaming everybody else, but -- but, but, but he wants to keep spending which means more inflation. In other words, spend and borrow. He wants the Federal Reserve to purchase the bonds and inject more money, but he also is blaming fossil fuel producers. If -- you know, his issue on gasoline, he has no sense of how important it is to produce more oil and gas, including LNG. He has no sense of that. So his White House people have the most restrictive environmental permitting in our history, which will knock out oil and gas pipelines, LNG. But here's the bizarre part, it'll also knock out the infrastructure, bridges, roads and highways, will not pass their environmental tests.

Wade as we just showed you. Now, if the Supreme Court does in fact overturn Roe and Casey, abortion will still be legal in the United States. But according to the left, we are now living in a real life version of handmaid's tale and the only way to stop it is to take to the streets. Forget about boating or contacting your state representative, the people that will actually decide, Democrats, they prefer mob rule, political intimidation and harassment. And today, once again, Jen Psaki speaking on behalf of her fearless leader Joe Biden encouraged far left lunatics from Arlington, Virginia and suburban Maryland to stalk their local Supreme Court justice and show up at their homes.

      "utterance": "Yeah. Let's send a mob right outside the House of elected officials, Supreme Court justices, anybody we disagree with. This is not going to end well. Now, on this program, we have consistently condemned all acts of violence and intimidation. We condemn the riots of the summer of 2020, 574 of them. We had dozens of dead Americans, billions of property damage, thousands of injured cops and the Biden administration -- well, they were either quiet or they kind of supported it. They weren't going to take on the base of their party that was responsible for it. On this program, on my radio show in real time, I condemned the violence on January 6th. I condemned it that night on this program. We also now condemn the doxxing of Supreme Court justices demonstrators stalking. Now, justice Alito and his family and Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Roberts, and in some cases forcing them to flee their own homes, can't, Jen, you know be bothered a little bit, not see the danger in this philosophy of a president of the United States putting his tacit seal of approval on this type of behavior, even though it's against the law, but I guess they aid in a bit law breaking all the time down at the border, right? Now a pro-abortion group is now planning to hold more protests at justice's private homes. And by the way, this is not only wrong. It is unlawful as I've been saying. Look at the law, section 1507, title 18 of U.S. Code, it is illegal to protest near a residence occupied or used by a judge, juror, witness or court officer with the intent of influencing the discharge of his duty. And get this, one of the reasons it's illegal to protest outside the private homes of public officials is because of a case that actually protected the privacy of an abortion doctor. So, now, is the White House going to apply the law equally or are they just going to wait around see if something really bad happens first? Now, this week, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, she got multiple death threats because of her support for constitutionalist judges. I can only imagine the kind of threats that the justices themselves are receiving and, by the way, not a word from FBI Director Wray, not a word from the DHS secretary, who just last week, Mayorkas was saying domestic extremism is the single biggest threat to America. Not a word from the Attorney General Merrick Garland, not one word at all. They're the ones that were scared of parents protesting at school board meetings and wanting to investigate whether they were domestic terrorists.

If I can't call him on the phone and say that, how can you assemble a mob with pitchforks and torches and go outside their private home and people say peacefully assembled? That's not true. The message behind showing up at someone's house is we know where you live. We're going to make you uncomfortable. We're going to make your family uncomfortable. And by the way, there's a hundred of us here, 99 of us are going to go home and you never know if one whack job either here or somewhere else is going to show up in the middle of the night and try to harm you. That's the message behind showing up at people's home. It is an open effort to intimidate Supreme Court justices on their decision. It's illegal. It's improper.

They're saying -- well, you know, these are people that are outraged and they're cheered on. You know, why these groups do it, because they know people like those whoever those ladies were there talking, you know, people like that are going to be out there cheering them on and they know political leaders in the Senate. We have Senate leaders that are saying I don't see a problem with people showing up outside their homes they know they're going to be cheered on and it's across the board. This is a radical left-wing party, radical left-wing party who believes and supports an abortion paid for by taxpayers on demand up to the date of birth. That's their position. That's the vote they want here tomorrow. That's why they're running somebody against me in Florida. They want to take me out and replace me with someone named Val Demings, a do-nothing Pelosi puppet congresswoman who supports taxpayer-funded abortion on demand up to the moment of birth. By the way, I've asked everybody out there. If you don't want Florida to go crazy or in a crazy direction, you know, go on my website. Learn more about this crazy congresswoman, MarcoRubio.com, and help me. Because otherwise, we got to beat these people at the ballot box in November, but this needs to be stopped.

It's the Russians, inflation, it's transitory, no, no, it's actually a good thing. It's everyone but what it actually is, which is the asinine policies that Democrats promised you. They are delivering what they said they were going to deliver. Americans are feeling it. You can't find baby formula in America, but they're going to make sure that you can get abortions at 42 weeks, maybe a little bit post-term. I mean, what difference does it make right, Sean? This is the insanity of the radical left agenda, but it's been very domineering but what's great about Donald Trump, Sean, is he brought out the fight in conservatives. He made them learn to be able to stand up for themselves to speak out, to not just be put in a corner and to be afraid of cancellation. It's creating entire economies. Whether that be again, you know, Truth Social and the boom that's going on on there, whether it's MXM news, whether it's what's happening to Disney in the reverse effect. When you see corporate woke America taking asinine positions where you know they want to really get into the explicit details of sexual innuendo with young children, and if you can't, it's over.

Not gay marriage. Not any other social issue, just that. So she is lying there. To your question about conservatives -- look, I guess called for violent incitement, I guess that's now cool, with the left right? Look, President Trump on January 6 talked about a call for a peaceful protest at that capital. Okay? So if people like Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger on the January 6 commission, if they had any political integrity whatsoever, they would then propose an investigation into this because this language for Mayor Lightfoot looks like an actual call for violence, it looks like an actual incitement to violence with a call to arms. And Whoopi Goldberg can make all of the excuses in the world about the phraseology of Mayor Lightfoot and whatever. But we know exactly what they may because that left has been engaging in the threats of violence and actual violence, since the 1960s and even before that, Sean, to achieve their communist gains."

      "utterance": "I will tell you, Sean, it is funny, when she talks about call to arms, and for us to take up arm, she wants to turn America into Chicago. Call to arm, that goes on 24/7, seven days a week in Chicago. You have a disgraced mayor trying to look for an issue in order to salvage her reelection chances and it won't work. There is no nexus between Roe v. Wade and LGBT community or, you know, the challenge to interracial marriages. I'm so sick of Whoopi Goldberg and those who keep talking about the `60s. A third of this country was not even born. And so after 1960, so they keep going back to this Jim Crow civil rights movement in order to get people upset, to basically tear down this country's value system. This is nothing more than an attempt to change what is great about this country, the heritage, the Supreme Court. They wanted to tear it down because they are interested in his power and control. They don't care about rules. They don't care about anything like that. All they want is power and control."

      "utterance": "Why did they not arrest people in the summer of 2020 rioting? Why did -- why do all those people go free? How come they are silent and even the tacit approval of Joe Biden as it relates to doxxing? We got 20 seconds, Monica?"

      "speaker": "CROWLEY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, you are hitting on the really critical the point here, Sean, which is the double standard, the two tier justice system, the uneven application of the law and the republic just cannot go on like this. It needs to be fixed or we're not going to survive as a country."

      "utterance": "All right. Occasionally, we have actually great news and I got some big news and a big congratulations to friends of mine, Whitney and Drew. Now, they already have three beautiful girls, 12, 10 and 6, and they just had their son, there he is, Pierce James, born yesterday. And Whitney and Drew, I know God has a great plan for his life just like your incredible daughters and both of you. By the way, he is going to grow up like I did, three older sisters. It wasn't that easy. But anyway, I want to say congratulations. God bless all of you. Looking forward to meeting him hopefully soon, and welcome to the world, Pierce. Go out and make a difference. We're glad you're born, and may God bless you every day of your life. The life that he had and the plan map out for you. I'm so happy for you. All right. That is all the time we have. Never miss an episode. Thank you for making the show possible. In the meantime, let not your heart be troubled. Laura is next. We'll see you back here tomorrow night.
