      "utterance": "I’m Laura Ingraham and this is the Ingraham Angle from another insane Washington tonight. The Democrats’ weak impeachment case was exposed today as the congressional rules committee sent it to the full House. Congressman and Judiciary members Jim Jordan, Ken Buck, and Tom McClintock are all here to respond. Also, senators are now saying, this is my favorite moment of the day, that Mitch McConnell should recuse himself ahead of the Senate trial. Oh, anything else? Alan Dershowitz has something to say about that. Plus, the impeachment push is now losing the support of, wait for it, Democrats. The Ingraham pollsters Rasmussen and McLaughlin tell us why. And also, tonight, and this was stunning, the court that signed off on all those bogus FISA warrants just dropped a rare rebuke of the FBI and Jim Comey. Sara Carter, Matt Schlapp and Dinesh D’Souza are all here to respond. But first, Pelosi’s three-ringed flop. That’s the focus of tonight’s mini-angle. All right. This impeachment shuffle, I was thinking about it literally on the drive to the studio tonight. It has all the feel of, like, a second-rate traveling circus that camps out in the old fairgrounds of your town but then it never leaves. You have the jugglers, the kind of half-baked jugglers, and kind of un-easy tightrope walkers."

Joining me now are three congressmen on the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, Tom McClintock, and Ken Buck. Congressman Jordan, let’s start with you. The articles are expected to hit the floor tomorrow."

They’ve always been on the president’s side and that’s why the Democrats had to resort to this unfair partisan process they conducted in the House. No subpoenas for a Republican, none of our witnesses could be invited to the hearings. In the depositions, Adam Schiff prevented some witnesses from answering Republican questions. All the Democrat questions got answered. And of course, Adam Schiff told us that the whistleblower was going to testify until we all discovered, “Oh, wait a minute, the whistleblower had met with Adam Schiff’s staff.” So, then he wasn’t going to testify. So, this idea that they’re now talking about process concerns in the Senate after what the House Democrats did through this entire three months is just kind of laughable. And I think your angle was right on."

But it reminds me a lot of what the Air Force describes as target fixation, when a pilot gets so fixated on a target that he forgets to fly his plane and ends up crashing into a mountain. I think that’s where the Democrats are. And they’re crashing the country into a mountain. I mean, these articles of impeachment are an absolutely travesty. And by the way, I think you owe an apology to America’s circuses comparing them to what’s going on in that building right now."

And he did so today with a scathing letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, writing, “History will judge you harshly. As you proceed with this impeachment charade, your legacy will be that of turning the House of Representatives from a revered legislative body into a star chamber of partisan persecution.” Well, here’s now Nancy reacted."

      "utterance": "Well, what the president did was lay out the procedural flaws in the House process. And I think that if the bar stays this low for future impeachments, we’re going to have a problem as a country. Because anytime we have a Republican House or a Republican House and Senate and a Democrat president, the Republicans are going to go after the Democrat president if this is where the bar is. It shouldn’t be here."

      "utterance": "Well, a little interesting, slightly, that that congressman back in 1988, Mr. Hastings, was himself impeached when he was a federal judge for bribery and perjury. But like the circus, it keeps coming back up into town. I mean, the same people. He’s only one of eight people ever to be removed from office by a Senate impeachment trial. So, Congressman Jordan, you literally can’t make this up. I saw that and I said, “That can’t -- that actually isn’t --“"

      "speaker": "Jim Jordan",

She promised that in the end, it’d be bipartisan. In the end, they would move the American people. When they actually had the hearings, it would move Americans towards their position. And in fact, just the opposite has happened. So much so that when they took the vote on the official enquiry, two Democrats voted with us. And now, one of those Democrats is going to switch and become a Republican. So, they have not made their case because they don’t have the facts on their side."

We respect you so much, but I have a slight disagreement, a quibble with you.” Like, he’s not going to do that. He’s going to take -- you come at him with a club and he’s going to come at you with something bigger and harder. And Congressman McClintock, they were hammering this letter. I mean, they seized this letter and they must have been like Evelyn Wood speed-readers, because they read this letter and they immediately pounced. Watch."

      "utterance": "[laughs] I mean, the letter is hard-hitting, but the letter is pretty darn, you know, on point on almost every point. They were trying to distract from the economy, they’re obsessed with getting him, they hate him, they hate the Americans who voted for him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tom McClintock",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that’s a big reason he was elected, not because he talks in smarmy platitudes like politicians, but precisely because he doesn’t. What you get with Donald Trump is the blunt, clear talk of a Manhattan businessman. He says what he means, he means what he says, and I think that a lot of people found that appealing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "Congressman Buck, he says in this letter that the Democrats are the ones who are interfering with the next election. Everything they accuse of him of, they’re, in fact, doing. They’re intolerant; they’re filled with hate; they want to dilute the votes of Americans who will turn out to vote for Trump. They want to remove that choice from the ballot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Ken Buck",
      "utterance": "And this is the opening statement that you’re going to see in the Senate, and the president is laying out for the American people what the American people can expect. And if Mitch McConnell shortens the Senate trial, it’s unfortunate because I think the American people are waiting to see the Republican narrative. We haven’t had that opportunity in the House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "I ran into Louie Gohmert in the green room, Congressman Jordan. Louie is up for a fight. I mean, he’s like, “Why are we shutting” -- I get the moderates want to shut this thing down, and my concern as a lawyer to do this stuff is that you never know what you’re going to get.” Like, you know, you think it’s -- it’s like, don’t dig a hole when you’re on top of terra firma here. That’s the only concern, but I kind of want to take it to the wall, too, with these people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jim Jordan",
      "utterance": "Well, we’d all like to hear from the whistleblower, but I trust Mitch McConnel and what the senators are going to do. The facts are -- you know, the facts are on the president’s side. We’ve said this for months now. Four facts have never changed. We have the transcript; there was no linkage, no quid pro quo. We have the two guys on the call, Zelensky and President Trump, saying no pressure, no linkage, no pushing whatsoever. We have the fact Ukraine didn’t know the call -- aid was held up at the time of the call. Most importantly, the Ukrainians did nothing to get the aid released. So, those facts have never changed, will never change. We can focus on that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Tom McClintock",
      "utterance": "Well, let’s talk about the substance for a second. I mean, if you brought a case to a court that charged no actual crimes, but rather pretend crimes, crimes that you made up, those are the two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Those are not crimes. Obstruction of Congress means he went to the courts to defend his constitutional prerogatives. Abuse of power means he lawfully exercised his constitutional powers, just in a manner that the Congress --"

    {
      "speaker": "Laura Ingraham",
      "utterance": "And I want to now introduce you to Larry Tribe, Harvard law professor, anti-Trump zealot, and the legal expert that House Democrats consulted with behind closed doors to draft the articles of impeachment. He’s now telling Democrats, quote, “Now that failing to formally impeach Trump would invite foreign intervention in the 2020 election and set a dangerous precedent, another option seems vital to consider: voting for articles of impeachment, but holding off for the time being on actually transmitting them to the Senate.” This is a cute trick. They’re always changing it, right? Joining me now, Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor emeritus, pal of Tribe -- you know him well -- author of the book Guilt by Accusation. Alan, Democrats keep kind of -- they’re playing, like, a new trick. A little -- something else is coming out of the hat this time. It’s not a censure; it’s bribery. Then it’s extortion. Then it’s in the court document, but it’s not in the articles, and now it’s, “Well, we’ll have it in our back pocket, and we won’t put our cards on the table.” What about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Alan Dershowitz",
      "utterance": "I can’t think anything more unconstitutional or any greater deprivation of civil liberties than for Congress to impeach a president, to accuse him, and then not bring him to trial, not give him to the opportunity to be vindicated. I could write another book about that called Guilt by Impeachment. Guilt by Accusation -- it’s the same thing. You accuse him. You know what it would be like? It would be as if a prosecutor indicted somebody and said, “But I’m not bringing you to trial. You’re now indicted. You stand indicted, but you have no opportunity to prove your innocence.” You want to hear something interesting? Back in the 1970s, they did that to Richard Nixon. They named him as an unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal case. I was then on the national board of the ACLU. I objected to it, and I asked the ACLU to get involved on Nixon’s behalf to make sure his rights weren’t violated. Look, this impeachment is tearing the country apart, and my friend and colleague Larry Tribe’s idea would tear the country apart even more because it would accuse somebody formally without giving him an opportunity to be vindicated and acquitted. Hamilton and Madison would be turning over in their graves at Larry Tribe’s suggestion."

The leaders of the Senate -- the Democratic leaders of the Senate worked very closely with the White House, I know. I saw it; I was there. And so, you know, if you would invent a new way of having impeachment, it would be great as if it was nonpartisan, if all the people in the House were to just listen to the evidence objectively, and all the people in the Senate were to listen. But for the Democrats, after conducting an extraordinarily partisan impeachment, to now say suddenly, “We’re virtuous, and the trial itself has to be without any involvement” -- if McConnell has to recuse himself, so would Adam Schiff have to recuse himself, and Jerry Nadler and all of those, all of the people. Maxine Waters, who called for impeachment on day one --"

So, at this point in time, and this is according to my sources, sources that are former FBI, sources that are with the FBI right now, that the players that are being called out in the IG report are trying to control the narrative. Those that haven’t come out publicly that he’s talked about in that report that basically altered documents or misled the FISA court are scrambling now. They’re getting attorneys.

After Bob Mueller did everything -- hired every Democrat he could to try to find the evidence, found no evidence. Second of all, on the text messages the reason why it’s important for the American people and the taxpayers to see it, it wasn’t about their sexual relationship. It was about two high-powered FBI officials talking such never-Trump trash on the elected president of the United States. That’s the part everyone needs to see.

I was wondering when this was going to happen. Orders the FBI to fix national security wiretaps after that damning IG report. The FISA court judge writing, Dinesh, \"The frequency with which representations made by FBI personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case calls into question whether information contained in other FBI applications is reliable.\" Dinesh, how big a deal is this and what does it mean for Lisa Page and all of her protestations tonight? Dinesh D’Souza, filmmaker: Well, first of all, it’s very clear that these FISA courts rely completely on the files that are put on their desk. I believe that out of hundreds and hundreds of FISA requests the courts have denied almost none of them, maybe one, maybe two. And so clearly the FISA court isn’t really a court in the sense that it’s conducting investigations, hearings, cross examination, none of that. They basically look at the file and they go sure. And now they’ve realized that they have been lied to. Now, while the FISA court doesn’t focus on the issue of bias, and of course the IG himself, Horowitz, said there’s no bias here, I find that an amazing conclusion when you have errors, a lot of them, and they all fall on the same side. When the tennis ball falls once or twice on this side and once or twice on that side, it’s random. It can be incompetence. It could be an accident. But if the tennis ball falls 17 times on the same side of the net, that is prima facie evidence of bias. So, it’s kind of weird to say there have been all these mistakes, they all fall in the same direction, and yet no bias here, guys."

Here to tell us why that is is Scott Rasmussen, pollster and editor-at-large for Ballotpedia and John McLaughlin, Trump 2020 campaign pollster. All right. Scott, let’s start with you.

Now the numbers are shifting back the other way. And democrats and everybody else is aware the president is not going to be removed by the Senate.

Well, we were 33 percent on Election Day in 2016. So, they can’t believe that the polls that they rigged are actually going against them. Because after two weeks of hearings, they bored the country to death. They came up with no evidence, no proof, and all they proved was that Donald Trump is innocent of everything they’re saying. And this is a railroad. It’s all politics and the country’s tired of it. They want to move on to other things. We produced the campaign, the Trump campaign -- through Tony Fabrizio produced the poll in the 30 districts that Democrats now hold because one switched.

But I think a lot of this goes down to what they’re seeing now as far as the results of this months and months of discussion of Ukraine, Trump’s beating, and these are national polls. They’re not ever battleground state. But there is a national poll, interesting snapshot, beating every major presidential candidate. We’ll put up the graphic. Here it goes, and this is USA Today’s Suffolk poll. Biden, he’s beating; Bernie Sanders, Warren, Bloomberg, Buttigieg. Some months back, that was not the case.

Partly, it’s because of what we’ve seen in the Democratic presidential debates, partly it’s the economy, partly it’s the impeachment. But you can’t get overconfident if you’re the president’s team if you want the president to win. Polls about a general election in December of the preceding year aren’t all that predictive, and what they’re telling us is it’s likely to be a close election. If nothing changes, we’re likely to be talking later on election night about places like Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and so I don’t think either side should feel great about this.

And I’ll tell you what, the only one who thinks she may be a winner on this -- Nancy Pelosi is pushing this.

When they go to the DMV, they’re going to show a Mexican matricula ID, which the FBI has done numerous reports saying they’re the most vulnerable to fraud. So, these people are going to be presenting fraudulent foreign identification, and we don’t even know if it’s them. And this law in New York -- it goes beyond just not -- it doesn’t allow them to share their information with ICE, only ICE. They specifically call immigration. And not only that, if ICE actually gets a court order to get the information, within three days they’re supposed to notify the subject of the inquiry so they can let them know ICE is looking for them."

Tessa Majors, a Barnard College freshman, brutally murdered, stabbed to death allegedly by three young teens in New York City. A 13-year-old suspect was in court today charged with second degree murder. Now there’s a frantic manhunt on for another suspect, a 14-year-old who allegedly bolted from a car yesterday on his way to meet with police. On top of the gruesome details there now controversy over information released by the NYPD union chief about what Majors was up to the night she was murdered. Joining me now former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik. Bernie, I read this story the night it happened. It just -- your heart breaks. It is horrific at every level but Ed Mullins, the president of the NYPD sergeant’s benevolent association is being accused of victim blaming. Reports are that the victim was perhaps at some point out there looking to buy marijuana but what do you think about all this?"

      "speaker": "Bernard Kerik, former NYPD commissioner",
      "utterance": "Listen. I know what Mullins, you know, and I take him at his word that that’s not what he was doing. He was trying to explain or talk about the mayor’s policies on not locking people up for marijuana. I know the mayor blasted him but I also think that’s because Ed Mullins and the other unions have exposed the mayor for an anti-cop mayor for somebody that has promoted anti-cop rhetoric, for somebody that has emboldened the thugs, for somebody that has supported groups that have bashed the police. So, you know, I don’t want to get into what Mullins said. I think this is a tragedy. I think it’s horrible. It’s reminiscent of what was going on in the city back in the ‘70s, ‘80s, early ‘90s before Rudy Giuliani created the renaissance of New York and Bloomberg followed all the crime reduction strategies. This is something that we have to look at extremely carefully right now because I think the city’s changing. All you have to do is take a walk around the city right now. Rampant homelessness, panhandlers."

There were a number of these that happened prior to Ms. Majors that some were reported, some weren’t reported. They came out after the fact. This is an area that obviously there needs to be a bigger police presence. There needs to be more security. And this isn’t the only place in the city this is happening. There are spikes in the violent crime indicators right now. This is something that the police commissioner is looking at, I’m sure, but look, I’m scared to death that the city’s reverting back to where it was prior to 1994."

A friend of mine actually alerted me to this in a video and it was posted on Facebook and he was like flying around Park Avenue today just slashing at people. We’re out of time, Bernie, but that’s just one example of what you’re talking about. And thank you for sounding the alarm tonight on this anti-cop rhetoric. Bernie, thanks so much."

B.S. Let me go through the right process. I also used to think I was a Democrat. Not no more. Trump 2020.\" That sounds like a country music song. All right. That’s all the time we have tonight.
