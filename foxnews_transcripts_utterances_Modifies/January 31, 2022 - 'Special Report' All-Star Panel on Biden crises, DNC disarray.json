Republicans have added two-and-a- half seats despite just the most amazing, almost Salvador Dali maps that came out of New York and Illinois that are the height of partisan gerrymandering. And I salute them, I salute partisan gerrymandering. But Republicans are going to take back the House. So if Joe Biden is going to get out of that hole, he needs it a reset.

So that is a legitimate change they need. But, if I'm the Biden administration, I would not change their people involved in COVID for the simple reason that it will just make conservatives say see, we were right all along, and it will upset liberals who love Fauci. There is no political upside for them doing that. They are stuck with the people they have. They are stuck with that team.

Personnel changes, I don't really see how personnel changes really help you. He said that he is happy with his team. I don't see any top White House officials being ditched. These are people who Biden has worked with for many, many years. But he has got to get a hold of the two things that the public cares about the most -- COVID and inflation. After that, yes, crime and immigration are important, too. And that's going to be hard to do.

And the problem that the Democrats have now is they are on identical trajectory, and I don't see anything stopping it. The only move that I would make if I were Joe Biden is on crime, I would start going after those liberal D.A.'s who are changing the laws, not prosecuting people for what used to be felonies, reduced it to misdemeanors, which invited more crime. Joe Biden should go after the Manhattan D.A. He should go after the Portland D.A., the Seattle D.A., the San Francisco and Los Angeles D.A. That would be a smart move that would at least sandy signal to centrist that maybe Joe Biden has some sensibility left. But he's too far in with the left, and that's what explains, Shannon, so much of that Gallup poll that you cited. And the polling numbers in November when you really vote, look like they are going to be blow out because things are so bad in America, and Joe Biden is getting the blame for much of what he has created.",

But the average loss of a president in their first midterm, I think, is 27 seats. So this is something that happens every two years. Donald Trump lost the House in 2018. And the only question I think among political operatives now is how big are the Democratic losses going to be? And, yes, every single day they wake up to some new depressing metric about party I.D. or congressional -- generic congressional ballot. So everything becomes another reason for Republicans to start measuring the drapes. But we have got almost a year to go. A lot of things can happen.

      "utterance": "Well, they don't have to hint it. They can observe it. He was missing. He has been missing since the day he got appointed. It's just baffling to me that a politician, a congressman, who understands the power of communication when the biggest issue in the country is under your auspices as secretary of HHS, Health and Health Services, and he doesn't speak to the public. So that is a legitimate change they need. But, if I'm the Biden administration, I would not change their people involved in COVID for the simple reason that it will just make conservatives say see, we were right all along, and it will upset liberals who love Fauci. There is no political upside for them doing that. They are stuck with the people they have. They are stuck with that team. And anything they do to change it would be a sign of such weakness they won't mollify anybody. They will antagonize everybody."

    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Messaging, yes. The president himself has talked about that. He wants to get out of the -- in the country more. He said he is going to invite people into the White House who have different perspectives. There's always criticism that the White House is too insular. Personnel changes, I don't really see how personnel changes really help you. He said that he is happy with his team. I don't see any top White House officials being ditched. These are people who Biden has worked with for many, many years. But he has got to get a hold of the two things that the public cares about the most -- COVID and inflation. After that, yes, crime and immigration are important, too. And that's going to be hard to do. I think that only maybe one or two presidents have ever improved their approval rating after February of an election year. Ari might remember that statistic better. But it's really hard to do. He's pushing against a lot of historical forces."

NBC News reports this, that \"DNC Chair Jaime Harrison has considered early exit amid White House tensions,\" go on to say that he \"is frustrated, isolated, trapped in a job he long thought he wanted -- a dynamic driven by escalating tensions with the White House over his role. Harrison has been frustrated enough to consider an escape route to depart before the midterms.\" Hugh, what do you think is going on at the DNC?"

Shannon, in a nutshell, it's desperate on the Democratic side. And that does not upset me at all. They don't have an answer to the crime issue and the COVID breakdown. They don't have initiative that they are going to get through. They don't even have an idea how to make the Supreme Court nomination that is pending into a story. They are desperate for a story. They would love there to be controversy over whether it's Judge Brown Jackson or Justice Kruger in California or Judge Childs. There isn't going to be any controversy. I think the over/under is 65 votes. They don't have an answer. They don't have an initiative. They don't have an exit strategy to stop red wave that is building, and I don't know how they can come up with one."

A piece in the \"New York Times\" this weekend says \"The poll shows just how much trouble Democrats are in. When Joe Biden took over from Donald Trump a year ago, Democrats held a 49 to 40 advantage in that Gallup poll party identification. From nine points up to five points down in less than a year, it is one of the most dramatic reversal of party fortune that Gallup has ever recorded.\" Ari?"

      "utterance": "Yes, and earlier Hugh talked about the two midterm elections that were massive sweeps, 1994, Bill Clinton's first midterm election, in 2010, Barack Obama's midterm election, which the Democrats suffered massive losses. And the problem that the Democrats have now is they are on identical trajectory, and I don't see anything stopping it. The only move that I would make if I were Joe Biden is on crime, I would start going after those liberal D.A.'s who are changing the laws, not prosecuting people for what used to be felonies, reduced it to misdemeanors, which invited more crime. Joe Biden should go after the Manhattan D.A. He should go after the Portland D.A., the Seattle D.A., the San Francisco and Los Angeles D.A. That would be a smart move that would at least sandy signal to centrist that maybe Joe Biden has some sensibility left. But he's too far in with the left, and that's what explains, Shannon, so much of that Gallup poll that you cited. And the polling numbers in November when you really vote, look like they are going to be blow out because things are so bad in America, and Joe Biden is getting the blame for much of what he has created."

What do you think is driving that, Mara? Is it the idea that there may be, as President Obama once called it, a shellacking? What's dividing them, or some of these folks have been there a long time for not coming back?"

    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Some people are old. They're committee chairman. They don't want to go into the minority. There's no doubt that a lot of House Democrats, the majority of them probably, are expecting to lose the House in the fall. But the average loss of a president in their first midterm, I think, is 27 seats. So this is something that happens every two years. Donald Trump lost the House in 2018. And the only question I think among political operatives now is how big are the Democratic losses going to be? And, yes, every single day they wake up to some new depressing metric about party I.D. or congressional -- generic congressional ballot. So everything becomes another reason for Republicans to start measuring the drapes. But we have got almost a year to go. A lot of things can happen. And especially, I would watch COVID and inflation, see if those two things improve. That's what the president and his party really need."

But meantime, to circle back around to where we started with the DNC, by the way, the chairman, Jaime Harrison, tweets this out, says \"To unnamed sources, if you expect me to go away or roll into a ball and whimper, you picked the wrong one. The focus is upending the party of fraud, fear, and fascism. You have the mission. Now get with the program.\" Hugh?"

I'm sure he checked that with Ari's successor at the White House, calling everyone fascist who disagree with him. That is, in fact, a reflection of how far gone the Democratic Party is on messaging. They have lost the ability to communicate. But hey, nobody knows who Mr. Harrison is, period, beyond the beltway. And, b, when they do hear about him, they are going to find he's calling them a fascist. It's not a winning recipe."
