We spent about an hour with him. The better part of an hour, he was very upbeat. He seemed very comfortable, very at ease in his own skin.  I have to say, because this was the first formal interview in these two years since he has been president, very at ease being the commander-in- chief. He has his command in his brief.

      "utterance": "Exactly. You know, I really enjoyed and was anxious to have that part of the interview because I have not done a formal interview with him since December of 2016, since the tweet about fake news is the enemy of the people. I've thought about it a lot, I've talked about it a lot, I've won press awards and given speeches about it, and I wanted to confront him with my thoughts which are basically, look, you can criticize the media, you can criticize coverage, I think some of the coverage of you has been biased."

And then when he tried to sort of separate it and say, well, I'm talking about CNN, I'm not talking about you, it's like I wanted to make the point, we are all in solidarity on this. You know, you want to call specific stories, specific reporters out, go ahead, but don't say we are the enemy of the people because we are not."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The president says he is only talking about fake news but he has also said that fake news is 80 percent of the media by his calculation. Do you think -- did you have the sense that he is deeply offended by the coverage of him or is it also -- or separately the fact that he uses the press as such an effective foil?"

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I think that he really feels that he has been the victim of bad reporting and he says some -- all of our successes get downplayed. And again, I think there is some truth in that, as I have said in some speeches. Even hypochondriacs sometimes really get sick. On the other hand, I think that he -- while he does feel in some cases legitimately agreed, I think he also thinks that it's a talking point. When he was defending it, he talked in terms of my supporters and they get it. The fact that there's a lot of good news in the country that doesn't get reported, I think he sees it absolutely as a kind of wedge issue that helps him at the expense of the media and media criticism and also the expense of his political opposition."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You asked him about a spate of stories portraying him as being very angry and lashing out since the midterms. The Washington Post called it \"days of fury.\" The L.A. Times said he has retreated into a cocoon of bitterness and resentment. Let's take a look."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "It's very light. It's fake news. It's disgusting fake news. I wrote a front page on The Washington Post. They never even call me. Nobody ever calls me. You know, they -- they hear -- I don't even think they have sources. I think they just make it up like it's fiction."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "These are two of his favorite lines. Many of the sources are made up and that nobody ever calls me, as if a reporter can just call up and get the president on the line very quickly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And The Washington Post did quote a senior White House official on his behalf in that particular piece."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Right. I -- first of all, it was the first question I asked because one, I was legitimately interested. I also thought, you know, there is a lot of tough stuff I wanted to ask him about. I wanted to ask about the Mueller investigation, about staff changes, about Khashoggi, and I thought let's just talk about you. We know this president has no problem. The weight of question began, let's talk about the state of Donald Trump. And it was interesting to me, and I will say not just in the interview, but just the entire time. We spent about an hour with him. The better part of an hour, he was very upbeat. He seemed very comfortable, very at ease in his own skin. I have to say, because this was the first formal interview in these two years since he has been president, very at ease being the commander-in- chief. He has his command in his brief. He is comfortable in the Oval Office. He's the president and he knows it, and he's very much at east with it. Maybe he's mad to staff, but I would say that he was very good spirited despite some tough challenging questions in our interview."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, in addition to pushing back, he is angry and lashing out. Maybe some of those stories are overstated although clearly he has gone (ph) on the attack a lot. He said the White House is running like a well- oiled machine. That seemed to be pushing a little bit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I would say, you know, it's the line -- I wouldn't be lending any money at this point to either John Kelly or to Kirstjen Nielsen. You gave them far less than full-throated endorsement. Can you imagine a president saying about a chief of staff ever, what are some things about him I like and some things about him I don't like? I mean, I remember when Ronald Reagan made a very, very mild statement about Don Regan when I was covering him in '87. We all knew right away he was dead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It certainly didn't give the notion that he is definitely staying as chief of staff through 2020. But let me ask you also, it just broken when you sat down with the president, the judge's ruling for CNN, restoring Jim Acosta's credentials in that lawsuit against the White House, and he kind of said was no big deal. We're going to play that later in the program, Chris. But right after that press conference, let me take you back, you went on the air and talked about how you as a former White House correspondent felt about Acosta's behavior. Let's take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I've never seen anything like it. I covered the White House with Ronald Reagan for six years. Most of the people there were serious reporters asking serious questions. But Jim Acosta, I thought, embarrassed himself today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And after that, a CNN executive did something extraordinary, put out a statement attacking you and saying, Chris, Acosta doesn't work for state T.V. How do you -- it must be hard to sleep at night. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I slept fine that night. Well, they were pushing back and then I doubled down on it a few days later because people were asking. It was obviously a hot story. I notice that whoever the person was at CNN who I never heard of didn't fire back. There are two -- you know, two things, like a lot of things in life, there can be two things that are both true. One, I thought that Jim Acosta embarrassed himself. I thought he misbehaved. I have never seen anything like it. I covered the White House with Sam Donaldson. We were pretty aggressive with Ronald Reagan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "But the idea that you stand up, first just to say begin your question by saying, I want to challenge you, Mr. President, and then continue to ask questions, and then when you're told to sit down, to keep standing up and even kind of fight off an intern, I was astonished. Having said that --  KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But then the White House pulls his credentials."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Pulling his pass was clearly a bridge too far and it was a mistake. The president in his answer to my question about it and subsequently -- no big deal. I think they were stunned by the fact that they lost and that they were to a certain degree trying to downplay a defeat. I would say I talked to a couple of White House aides beforehand and before the ruling came down. They said, we think we are hearing at 60-40, we're going to lose. So, they weren't shocked by it, the ruling by the judge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, but it did put most of the meeting including Fox News in the position of siding with CNN, but that's not the same as condoning Jim Acosta's behavior. But as a distinction that you just made, it sometimes gets lost on people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I had this experience a half dozen times during the campaign, what would you say is the most challenging thing about interviewing Donald Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "He -- you asked him a question and he will give you an answer. But sometimes, there's a lot of other stuff around it. For instance, my first question was, how dark is your mood, and he proceeds to go into he's fine, which kind of what would have been the answer. But then he talks about the White House, then he went into the cemetery and on and on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "And so you went up having to edit him, not in any way to censor him, but because you are trying to get the answer out of a camouflage, out of the underbrush."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You said to him quite bluntly, what you call fake news is sometimes news that you don't like. The president pushed back very hard on that. But his supporters not only I think revel in the attacks on the press, but at the same time, they, you know, it is true as you noted that a lot of the coverage of this president, warranted or not warranted, is negative. So it's not like he doesn't have something of a case in lashing out at the media coverage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, this gets us back to the Acosta confrontation and the question I asked him which was, why did you call on him in the first place? And to a certain degree, this seemed to be, you know, a perfect symbiosis (ph) here. The president knows if I call Acosta, he'll do something obnoxious and that will fire up my base. I don't think he thought Acosta was going to go as far as he did, and Acosta gets the spotlight to do something and get a lot of attention. It went further I suspect than either of them wanted. But I think they knew at the moment that the president called on Acosta, this was going to be a pothole and they would both be able to play it to their benefit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Chris Wallace, thanks very much for saying that with us."
    },

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Ahead, more on CNN beating the president in court over the banning of Jim Acosta though it's only the first round. But up next, President Trump absolutely unloads on Robert Mueller, calling him an Obama guy. We'll take a hard look at the coverage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "President Trump told Chris Wallace he's finished writing answers to Robert Mueller's questions, denounced the Russia investigation in the harshest terms yet, tweeting that it is a total mess and has gone absolutely nuts. \"They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our nation and don't care how many lives they ruin. These are angry people including the highly Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for eight years. They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A total witch hunt like no other in American history.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Joining us now to analyze the coverage",
      "utterance": "Emily Jashinsky, culture editor at The Federalist; Sara Fischer, media reporter for Axios; Mo Elleithee, former DNC official and Fox News contributor who runs Georgetown University's Institute of Politics. So, the press, Emily, is covering this as a really overheated escalation on the president's part. Disgrace, absolutely nuts, even by the standards of all the previous Trump attacks on this so-called witch hunt."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY JASHINSKY, CULTURE EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Right. When the president is tweeting in all capital letters, very angry things, it is understandable that the press would focus on that a little bit, maybe more a little bit in fact. KURTZ: Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "But at the same time, the president has some frustrations about the scope of this investigation into what's supposed to be collusion that I think are rarely acknowledged to the extent that they should in the press. So, again, it's sort of like when you are talking about your interview with Chris Wallace, two things can be true. I think that's the case here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Sara, as a factual matter saying that Robert Mueller worked for Obama for eight years is hardly the full story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA FISCHER, MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "I mean, he not only didn't just worked for Obama for those years, he was hired in the Bush administration and he is a registered Republican. So this is not somebody who is just some Democrat out to get him. He's a Republican who is trying to do his job. And even though the media is conflating some of his roles, where he supports, where he doesn't, none of us really know what's going on in Robert Mueller's head. He has never given an interview."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That's right. He doesn't try to compete in that space, Mo. President also telling Chris Wallace he will probably not be sitting down for an interview with Mueller. He didn't make it 100 percent, he said probably. Insiders tell me that Trump is just sick in this investigation, wants to bring it to a head. Could this escalation be a product of Trump having been immersed with his lawyers in preparing these answers to the Mueller questions and that kind of setting him up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE OF POLITICS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, look, I don't know what triggers Donald Trump. He has been frustrated with this investigation since day one, right? I mean, he has been frustrated, he finally got rid of Jeff Sessions who he has been wanting to get rid of because of this investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And because the attorney general recused himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "That's right. That's right, because the attorney general took himself out of position where he could have stopped this investigation. So, the president's frustration, I guess I get it. His reactions, I don't. I think it just doesn't serve him well politically frankly. I think if he were to sit back and say, fine, there is nothing there, but I will fully cooperate and show you that there is nothing there, I think it will away this -- that is not how he is wired."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

The president said that if Whitaker took any steps to curtail or reign in the investigation, the president said he leave it up to Whitaker, that he would not going to intervene. And then there was this question."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The president is a little skeptical on that point, that he finally gets to the point his own acting attorney general who has a well-documented record, and he had no idea that he was a Mueller critic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "I find that hard to believe as well. I'm not sure how big of a deal that is, but at the same time, the president in his interview with The Daily Caller this week when he was asked about Whitaker, he did immediately transition into talking about the investigation. So I find it hard to believe. It is not something I'm going to freak out over."
    },
    {

Zuckerberg and Sandberg insist they didn't know about the work of the firm which the company has now fired. And they say they have done nothing wrong.

While we don't condone the growing antagonistic tone by both the president and the press secretary recent media mails, we do support a free press, access and open exchanges for the American people.

But I worry about a president or a White House press secretary saying I don't like your coverage. And therefore, I'm going to call you rude or pick a fight with you, so that I have then grounds to throw you out. That is not beyond the realms of possibility with this White House where the president calls people whose coverage he doesn't like the enemy of the American people.

So whether or not this raises issues -- constitutional issues of free speech, because eventually, if the case proceeds, the judge will get to that.

The government lawyer went before the judge and said, you know what, CNN has all these other reporters who come to the White House, and they're pretty credential people. So you know somebody else could cover the president and Acosta could come to the White House by watching on TV. That seems to me to not get in the way in which why this isn't important principle to news organization."

Also, you know, some at the White House say, well, by doing this, they took Acosta's oxygen away for a week. But they also gave a lot of oxygen obviously to others. And finally, this is why I said it was a strategic misstep. And that is for all the controversy surrounding Jim Acosta, even among his colleagues, the White House kind of turned him into a journalistic martyr, because other organizations felt they had to stand with CNN even with reservations about Acosta, who is now -- at least for now, back on the job. All right. Next on Media Buzz, huge media hype about another White House shake-up or is it just some routine personnel moves after the elections. And later, Monica Lewinsky shedding new light on her ordeal in a documentary and why she still thinks Bill Clinton should apologize."

And this is said to be fueling his push for another White House shake-up aimed at such targets as Homeland Security Chief Kirstjen Nielsen and how many times have we been through this one, Chief-Of-Staff John Kelly. Oh, I thought we were going to a sound bite. All right. So, Emily, the president does seem resentful about the coverage of Paris. He brought up the coverage of him not visiting the cemetery in France, this potential shake-up. But then he tells Chris Wallace well, that Washington Post story about fury is based on fictional sources. Your take on that and these similar pieces?"

I also think there is another thing to say about the president not actually hiding a lot of his frustrations. As we mentioned earlier, he's tweeting out in all caps. I mean, it's not as though he's necessarily trying to say that he's not frustrated with these things. It's more about the chaos in the White House. That's what frustrates him. And when you have these narratives constructed on the accounts of anonymous sources, I understand why he would take issue with this."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Unless the anonymous sources are senior White House officials and top advisors as they sometimes are, the media had this chaos narrative. And it would be a big deal if Trump dumped John Kelly, who he did not give a resounding vote of confidence in the Wallace interview after he would stay in 2020. But you know, Ryan Zinke, Kirstjen Nielsen, in any other administration, I think the press will treat this as a normal turnover after the midterm elections, in which the party lost one chamber."

They like to leak for different reasons. That makes them feel more self-important, right. So that's number one is you have a White House staff that likes to talk. And two, you have a White House staff that doesn't necessarily know what's in the president's head. And so, they may be hearing something or interpreting something or putting something out there about a staff shake- up. But I will say this, we have gone through this cycle umpteen times now with this president where there is a leak and a denial. And then, the thing actually happens, not long afterwards."

And it died down for a while under John Kelly. And now, it really seems to be back. And some of these leaks may be coming from places like the State Department and Homeland Security and the NSC where certain officials have been targeted, which leaves me to my question for Sara. The First Lady of the United States Melania Trump publicly issued a statement, none of us have ever seen anything like this, calling for the firing of John Bolton's deputy at the National Security Council, Mira Ricardel, who has since been transferred. The president was asked about that again by Chris Wallace. And he said well, she is not exactly for the United Nations. I mean, she's not diplomatic, but he liked her anyway. Other first ladies have obviously - Nancy Reagan was one who yielded power behind the scenes. But this -- did this deserve all the coverage it got because of its unique nature?"

    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "It is unique. And it's unique for Melania. She tends to be somebody who stays in the background, who doesn't speak out a lot. In fact, the only other time she was really speaking out that causes media ripple was when she made comments about I can watch whatever I want with CNN. So it's newsworthy that we are getting inside Melania's head."

It dawned on me anew how incredible this escapade in American history had been, understanding exactly how many people would have been aware internally that something was up, trying to understand how an intern, sort of low on the totem poll you can be at the White House, gain access to the president in the first instance, and managed to have time alone with him. All of these things were not things I thought about as a teenager when the story was breaking."

      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "But occurred to me anew with a lot of impact when I was in my early mid-20s."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Monica Lewinsky says she thinks Bill Clinton still owes her and the country an apology. Well, he apologized to the country. And also, just to see it there as a real thing, it certainly is striking. Now, she writes a piece in Vanity Fair saying she would like to be freed from her victimhood. But she says that's not up to me, it's up to the social mob, and the media, which sounds about right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And that's one of the notable things that came at the end of that piece, where she said the reason she was doing this docuseries in the first place and talking about this ancient history now is because she can, which was a reference to when President Clinton was interviewed by Dan Rather. He was asked why he was having a relationship with a young woman that wasn't his wife, Bill Clinton said because I could."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. She doesn't want to be defined by this scandal for the rest of her life, although so far, that's what happened."

    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's her opportunity from her perspective."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "It's her opportunity to tell the story as her own, to reclaim the narrative from the media, from President Clinton."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All the people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Exactly, to make it her own. That is sort of not to get too pop culture, psychoanalytical on you, but that's a very common way to treat and help victims recover at this point, to reclaim narratives and make them their own. So it's a little bit of that probably."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I wonder if today's climate would all the way help liberate Monica Lewinsky and she wouldn't be stuck at the age of 22 and what happened to her and the FBI and all of that. Gillian Turner, great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us. Still to come, why I feel a personal connection to Spiderman and the late Stan Lee. And I have something I have never shown before on national television."

      "speaker": "TOBEY MAGUIRE, ACTOR WHO PLAYED SPIDERMAN",
      "utterance": "Not everyone was meant to make a difference. But for me, the choice to live an ordinary life is no longer an option."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Stan Lee, the Marvel legend who died at 95, was a superhero to me, as a kid who actually had a letter published in Spiderman 22. This is the guy who revolutionized the comics, moving away from those cardboard super duper characters to create such wise-cracking figures as the nerdy teenage Spidey, Ironman, the Hulk, the X-Men, Fantastic Four, people who had problems when they weren't fighting bad guys, as Stan Lee told the New York Times."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STAN LEE, MARVEL LEGEND",
      "utterance": "What I tried to do was take these characters, who are obviously bigger than life and fictitious, and make them seem real. They have got these powers. They do wonderful things. But what are the things that worry them, what are the things that frustrate them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I learned to write by reading the Marvel comics and began to draw my own called the Defenders. I never showed this before. It's all in these notebooks. I also liked that Stan Lee credited the writers and artists in each issue. Well, the Marvel stars are now huge and lucrative, movie franchises, that has its roots in the 1960s with Stan Lee's angst written heroes, plots which included social issues, all for 10 cents an issue. Well, we're doomed, at least those of us in the television news. China has created an anchor powered by artificial intelligence. And how can we compete with those? They don't require sleep or long lunches or big salaries and they don't make mistakes."

      "speaker": "CHINA'S A.I. ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "This is my very first day in Xinhua News Agency. My voice and appearance are modeled on Zhang Zhao, a real news anchor with Xinhua. The development of the media industry calls for continuous innovation."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That's not how it's done, buddy. You got to have some sparks, some sizzle. Put some into it. Well, that's a relief. That anchor is never going to get any ratings. I hope.
