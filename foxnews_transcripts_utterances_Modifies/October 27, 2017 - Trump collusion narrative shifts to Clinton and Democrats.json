I think that's why you saw Sessions trying to sidestep that question there. Broadly if you look at this week, this is a week where the Trump White House feels like they finally are able to go on the offense on the Russia investigation. They feel like this revelation that Democrats, the Clinton campaign and the DNC, were involved in funding a section of this dossier after a Republican had started this off, puts them on stronger footing.  I do think it's really important, though, for people to remember that the reason the Russian investigations exists in the first place isn't because there was a dossier that was funded by opponents of Donald Trump. It exists because there was Russian interference in the election. And the special counsel investigation is there in part because of what we saw transpire around the Comey firing and the fact that you had to have Jeff Sessions recuse himself.   So the dossier is important in the sense that it got a lot of attention and it's something that the FBI felt strongly enough about to bring to Donald Trump and to Barack Obama, but it's not the reason that the Russia investigation exist.",

Try to imagine that first meeting between Donald Trump and his -- an incoming president and his FBI director where his FBI director pushes across the table this dossier and says, listen, we have this, we know this about you. We have this information on good authority. And the president of the United States is sitting there, looking at the guy going, oh my goodness, this is my FBI director? And that's where their relationship began. And so when you go back to the fact that Comey is ultimately fired, it's amazing that he lasted as long as he did last. How he wasn't fired upon taking office is puzzling to me. So I think that this dossier and all of the new information that's coming out about it really does -- has flipped all of the scripts in Washington. Everything that the Democrats are saying now, the Republicans were saying last week, and vice versa. But clearly there is a lot more that needs to be found out.

But one of the other issues that's become at least a political story, maybe something that's investigated, are the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. had with the Russian lawyer, efforts from Republicans who are close, who were in the sort of Trump orbit to find Hillary Clinton's deleted emails. Well, listen, it's a very simple question.
