      "sentences": "All right, you had a lot of news in that nearly hour-long press conference that first featured the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, then Larry Kudlow, the economic adviser, at first talking about what we're going to do about Venezuela, $7 billion in assets that have now frozen to that country, affecting directly its state-run oil concern, Petroleos de Venezuela, all in an effort to get the president there, Nicolas Maduro, to just step down and allow Juan Guaido to take charge. Now, that could prove easier said than done, because, obviously, Maduro has said that he wants to stay. He's got the military behind him. There are increasing signs that he might not.  But, of course, the news of the moment seems to be on the fears of yet another government shutdown if, in the next 18 days, the president, the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill can't come to some agreement to avoid that, making it very, very clear that, unless whatever they cobble together includes funding for a wall -- it wasn't ironclad at $5.6 billion, $5.7 billion for a wall -- then we could be right back to where we started with a shutdown.  That one ran into 35 days and sliced a lot of growth off the economy. The CBO estimates that about $11 billion was lost as a result, $3 billion that will never come back. Of course, as Larry Kudlow pointed out, the CBO has been wrong on lots of things.  But what's the mood on Capitol Hill about avoiding just that? Let's go to Peter Doocy right now, right there.  Peter, what are you hearing?",

Many thanks to our House Democratic Caucus for remaining strong and unified. As I have said, our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power.\"   There is a lot of mystery about these negotiations, because Democrats wouldn't talk about how much of the $5.7 billion in border wall money they could stomach the entire time the government was closed.",

Now, that could prove easier said than done, because, obviously, Maduro has said that he wants to stay. He's got the military behind him. There are increasing signs that he might not. But, of course, the news of the moment seems to be on the fears of yet another government shutdown if, in the next 18 days, the president, the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill can't come to some agreement to avoid that, making it very, very clear that, unless whatever they cobble together includes funding for a wall -- it wasn't ironclad at $5.6 billion, $5.7 billion for a wall -- then we could be right back to where we started with a shutdown. That one ran into 35 days and sliced a lot of growth off the economy. The CBO estimates that about $11 billion was lost as a result, $3 billion that will never come back. Of course, as Larry Kudlow pointed out, the CBO has been wrong on lots of things. But what's the mood on Capitol Hill about avoiding just that? Let's go to Peter Doocy right now, right there. Peter, what are you hearing?"

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals jurisdiction would likely enjoin the president, if history is any guide. And then he probably would have played his last card. But then we have the alternative to that is for the president to shut down the government again. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that $3 billion was permanently lost as a result of the 35-day shutdown. Larry Kudlow was asked about that today, disputed the CBO figures. But I asked him. I said, well, if you had this government shutdown, then you open it again, and then you shut it again, could that compound the economic impact? Here's what he said."

Yesterday, I was filling in for Chris Wallace on \"FOX News Sunday.\" One of our guests was West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin on the Democratic side.  He was the only Democrat to vote for the president's proposal last week in the Senate for $5.7 billion for a wall. He told me yesterday that if the president were to go further on protections for DACA recipients -- and that would be a path to status or maybe even citizenship -- he might get more Democrats to sign on to his need for a border barrier. I asked Sarah Sanders about it. Listen to this back and forth."

We'd like to see that happen. And the president would love to deal with the overall problem of illegal immigration, fixing a number of the loopholes that would prevent some of those things from happening, so that we can move forward with a system that actually works."

While there might be a lot of Democrats in the House and in the Senate who say, you know, I could see the need for a border barrier, as Joe Manchin has said and said again yesterday, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly no money for a wall.

We need to secure the border, and we need to start fixing our broken immigration system. The president, I believe, has been willing to compromise. He came forward with a proposal which did just that. We have 30 members of the House who are Democrats who wrote a letter to the speaker that said, we want to vote on border security. I believe we're going to get that. And we're going to get a solution in the next three weeks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, again, if they don't budge on that border or the amount of money to commit to it, and don't even offer the president a dime on that, I would imagine he will -- he will either declare an emergency or he will shut the government down, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRASSO",
      "utterance": "Well, it would be a complete failure on the part of Nancy Pelosi's leadership, a failure to lead her conference and what the government -- what the public wants. They want a solution. They want both sides to be contributing to this, both sides cooperating in a way that we find a solution to fund the government and secure the border. We cannot fail to secure the border of this country. I know what she has said in terms of only $1 and being immoral. What is immoral, that we don't have a secure border at our southern border. And the president is committed to doing that. It's part of national security, Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. You might be right on that, and you might be right to point out, I think, as you did, Senator, that, even among Democrats -- Steny Hoyer was one of them who doesn't seem to think that a wall is immoral, seems to think that it works on the Tijuana-San Diego border quite well, and is open even to the president as of last week giving a speech any day he wanted to on the House floor. Do you think that there is enough division among Democrats that they would effectively have to sort of overrule Nancy Pelosi?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRASSO",
      "utterance": "Well, that may come to that. And I believe that there is that sort of division. You have a number of new -- newly elected Democrats from some basically swing districts. And Nancy Pelosi will be the minority leader again if she continues to be obstructing the idea of national security. And that's -- what the president is asking for is not all 2,000 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. We have 700 miles of barrier right now. He's asking for 234 additional miles. And, Neil, this is in an area where Border Patrol said, these are the 10 key spots where we need it most. That's all that he's asking for, which to me is very reasonable."

      "utterance": "All right. But, again, to be clear, if the president forced the issue and said, darn it, I'm going to do it again, I'm going to shut this government down if I don't get that wall, you say that would be a mistake?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRASSO",

We don't -- I mean, I'm a good -- I know how to turn flips. I played football. I can come up with some little chants and cute little things.  And Republicans need to stop saying, Nancy -- as the senator did, Nancy Pelosi, it's on her and so forth. What we need to do is just stop it. I mean, I don't think we need to say - - start calling the president a cave man and all this stuff, because what that does -- I mean, everybody involved here are human beings.

One of the things that I think Jim Clyburn has continued to tell us to use -- and I think he's absolutely correct -- that we need to start talking about walls and virtual walls, where we can use all kinds of technology. I mean, what's the point in becoming the most technologically advanced nation on the planet if we can't use it?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLEAVER",
      "utterance": "Well, I will be there. I think I have a responsibility to be there. I'm hoping that it -- that someone won't tell the president that we use this to launch attacks, because it will just keep this thing going. I think he ought to come in and deliver a speech on the state of the United States, and then -- and then be aspirational in a speech and talk about what we stand for and where we're going to go. I'm going to sit there, as I have every single time we have had a State of the Union since I have been in Congress. And I know there are people who are going to boycott. I won't be one of them. I do think that the president and the Democrats should have something that people in the country are proud of."

More than half the country by the end of the week will be experiencing below-zero temperatures, where you will have, for example, a common theme of minus-15 degrees. That's without the windchill factor. Add the windchill factor in places like Chicago, on Wednesday, you're looking at minus-50 degrees. Yikes. Oil watcher Phil Flynn following all of that and the crosscurrents in a market. When you hear cold weather reports like that, obviously, it costs more to heat your home, and it costs more to keep a level heating when you have to up it when it's that cold outside. But what are we looking at here?"

      "speaker": "PHIL FLYNN, PRICE FUTURES GROUP",
      "utterance": "I think we're seeing a situation where we're going to see our bills this year a lot higher than they were a year ago, because a lot of what we pay for our heating bills throughout the season is how cold it is. The last couple winters, come on, we have had a pretty easy. We have had a cold spell here, a snowstorm there, but we haven't had this type of sustained cold, Neil, like we're potentially going to have over the next couple of weeks. So what does that mean? In your home, you're going to be turning up that thermostat. It's going to be working harder, because it's going to be harder to keep that house cold -- from getting too cold. So you're going to see a lot of that going on. And so, over the period of a year, what that means is more dollars coming out of your wallet. Now, this year, of course, it could be even worse.  And the reason why that is, is because we have more geopolitical risk on the horizon, new sanctions just announced today on Venezuelan oil. That too could push up the price of oil. And then, at the end of the day, that could cost you more in the long run as well."
    },

      "speaker": "FLYNN",
      "utterance": "You know, I think we're going to see prices over the season about 6 percent higher, more out of your pocket than we paid a year ago. But, interestingly enough, we saw a weather forecast on Sunday night, some of the weather models that were predicting that we're going to see more of this beautiful cold weather through -- throughout the first week of February, backed off of those. And we could actually see a warm-up in February. So, looking at the natural gas market today, Neil, it gave hope to people that are going to have to go through some of the most brutal temperatures they have ever experienced in their life."

By the way, we are just learning right now that the U.S. has formally filed fraud charges against the Chinese tech giant Huawei and a top executive, accusing the company, among other things, of stealing trade secrets. Now, this is in the middle of top Chinese delegation officials arriving in the United States to continue trade talks. They had been separately urging the administration and the U.S. to go slowly here, that this could complicate matters. If you don't think that these issues will directly relate and fight against one another, and maybe the prospect for a trade accord, Chinese authorities say you are naive. But now the implications are that the slap on Huawei is on, and, right now, the response from China, well, we're waiting. More after this."

They had what we call assault rifles, heavy- duty military-grade machine guns. And there were two boats behind Stone's house, which abuts on a -- on a canal in Fort Lauderdale. And there was a helicopter hovering overhead.  So that's..."

And we were afraid at 6:00 in the morning, with everybody asleep, once he saw us, he would start destroying evidence.

That's one way they hope, the administration, that they can get him to step down and Juan Guaido to take over as the opposition leader, with full backing of the United States and, they hope, eventually the military. That last part might be easier said than done. To retired Lieutenant General Jerry Boykin, who joins us now. General, what do you think of this move?"

      "speaker": "LT. GEN. JERRY BOYKIN (RET.), U.S. ARMY",

The endgame of that is that Maduro and his cronies can't put that in their personal accounts, which I'm sure are growing at the moment. But I think that's OK. But I think the next step has to be that we rally more of our allies. We have already got 21 different countries that have come to our side of this..."

      "utterance": "General, it seems that whoever has the military with them has the presidency. And so far, Nicolas Maduro has that, at least among the top generals, the rank and file, not so much. But one very popular figure, even though he's retired and out of the country, I understand, Colonel Jose Luis Silva, is the first high-ranking official to say, yes, it is time for Maduro to go and we have to rally around Guaido. That's the kind of stuff you have to see to get this crisis settled, right?"

So what you have is you have a -- I think, a huge divide between the lower ranks, the mid-level officers and the upper ranks, and read that as the generals. And I think that what you're going to see is, you're going to see a split. And you are already seeing signs of unrest. You're already seeing members of the military in the lower ranks and the mid-grade officers actually expressing very openly their displeasure with and their disgust with Maduro and what he's done to the country. And I think that's going to get worse. And that's going to create a divide. And then it won't be long before either the higher ranks are going to flee the country, or they're going to jump ship and switch sides."

And -- but I think that what is -- what is also going to happen here, though, is, I think that this violence is going to -- is actually going to turn on the average Venezuelan citizens. They are -- there are reports of them actually killing each other for a kilo of rice."
