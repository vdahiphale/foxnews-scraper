And who is Caitlyn Jenner? Then I would tell my 10-year-old self who Caitlyn Jenner is. And I'd be like, holy (BLEEP) what the hell is going on with this world? Then I would ask, is Mr. T still Mr. T? But then I would calm down and I'd be totally site. So when you have a sports legend on your show, who's also trans you're going to have to tackle the elephant in the room. You have to paraphrase Roy Scheider in Jaws, we're going to do a bigger Wheaties box. Yes. The Olympics welcomes its first trans athlete. And thankfully, we have a few athletes on this panel tonight to talk about this. Not Kat of course. The last time she ran anywhere was from the police. But as a -- as a former Olympic athlete, I do have some thoughts. Yes, I bet you didn't know I was in the Olympics. I sure was until they banned the dwarf toss. But I -- even me, I even made it on the Wheaties box. Here you go. Take that Count Chocula. Still, I don't know how much I should care about women's weightlifting. My idea of women's weightlifting is watching Kat try to pick up my wallet. Can you find a smaller subgroup of society than women's weightlifting in New Zealand? Well, maybe, Seth Meyers fans.

      "sentences": "And who knew New Zealand had an Olympic team? I mean, I know they have a government. They're quite a sturdy bunch. So add to seven billion people, the Trans athlete issue is commanding quite a space. But should everyone have an opinion? I live by a very simple rule. Don't get angry about anything if the people closer to the issue aren't angry first. I came up with that rule a week after I was married. Meaning if the people directly impacted by this stuff aren't willing to speak up, then why should I? Now maybe they're pissed off but they can't say so because they're scared for the very same reasons, everyone is scared today. They don't want to be ostracized for their beliefs. In the modern era of wokeism, even people possessing real experience that enables them to speak out, they get swarmed by the mob too. Just happen to Rita Moreno. She had to apologize for defending a non-white director for not being woke enough. But then again, we are talking female weightlifters. Why should they be scared of anyone? They can crush you with their thighs. And they charge a lot for that on Craigslist. I really should get a new safe word. It's harder. My point is -- my point is the people -- the people who should be getting upset about competing against trans athletes should be the athletes, their parents, their significant others, their co-workers at the Postal Service. But if they can't voice their opinions, because they fear attacks by hardcore activists, how can the rest of us help? Maybe that's the point. People critical of trans athletes competing against biological women bring up the hard work biological women put into their training. All to see them losing their spot to an athlete who looks like me in a onesie. There's a reason why people take male hormones to enhance performance. Now you could have separate teams for male, female and trans but God forbid we violate the woke sacred rule of inclusion. You could do away with all criteria altogether, and like humans play together like co-ed soccer back in school. But except a real sport. But even in those games, you can't escape the innate sex differences. Rules usually require an equal number of sexes per team. Because men and women are different. Something I have to remind myself when I accidentally walk into the wrong sauna at Planet Fitness. It's not common in head to head sports to have men compete against women due to physiology, but an open class sports you can mix up the sexes, you know, like a party of Kat's apartment. In equestrian sports, females compete with male jockeys and dog sled racing, male and female mushers directly compete. In the NCAA, men and women compete against one another in rifle shooting which is great prep work if you're planning to move to Chicago.",

Which is a huge advantage with lifting. So, I kind of feel that there should be a third division for fairness. But in this situation, this individual isn't even in the top five. So it's still -- as far as World Class goes, there is an unfair advantage, if you are genetically male in competition just because that's just how it -- how it is.",

But for an answer on why guns are suddenly being used more often, we'll have to wait for Biden's next press conference sometime in 2030. Just don't ask liberal media outlets like CNN. Consider this headline: seven killed more than 40 injured in 10 mass shootings across the U.S. over the weekend. But a closer look reveals many of these crimes were spontaneous and possibly gang-related not preordained mass shootings. Lumping those together shifts the blame from defunding police to gun control.

So add to seven billion people, the Trans athlete issue is commanding quite a space. But should everyone have an opinion? I live by a very simple rule. Don't get angry about anything if the people closer to the issue aren't angry first. I came up with that rule a week after I was married. Meaning if the people directly impacted by this stuff aren't willing to speak up, then why should I? Now maybe they're pissed off but they can't say so because they're scared for the very same reasons, everyone is scared today. They don't want to be ostracized for their beliefs. In the modern era of wokeism, even people possessing real experience that enables them to speak out, they get swarmed by the mob too. Just happen to Rita Moreno. She had to apologize for defending a non-white director for not being woke enough. But then again, we are talking female weightlifters. Why should they be scared of anyone? They can crush you with their thighs. And they charge a lot for that on Craigslist. I really should get a new safe word. It's harder. My point is -- my point is the people -- the people who should be getting upset about competing against trans athletes should be the athletes, their parents, their significant others, their co-workers at the Postal Service. But if they can't voice their opinions, because they fear attacks by hardcore activists, how can the rest of us help? Maybe that's the point. People critical of trans athletes competing against biological women bring up the hard work biological women put into their training. All to see them losing their spot to an athlete who looks like me in a onesie. There's a reason why people take male hormones to enhance performance. Now you could have separate teams for male, female and trans but God forbid we violate the woke sacred rule of inclusion. You could do away with all criteria altogether, and like humans play together like co-ed soccer back in school. But except a real sport. But even in those games, you can't escape the innate sex differences. Rules usually require an equal number of sexes per team. Because men and women are different. Something I have to remind myself when I accidentally walk into the wrong sauna at Planet Fitness. It's not common in head to head sports to have men compete against women due to physiology, but an open class sports you can mix up the sexes, you know, like a party of Kat's apartment. In equestrian sports, females compete with male jockeys and dog sled racing, male and female mushers directly compete. In the NCAA, men and women compete against one another in rifle shooting which is great prep work if you're planning to move to Chicago."

I woke up one morning, Steve Prefontaine had just commit from a run and said, hey, you can't believe what's going on outside. Somebody's got shot or something. So I went downstairs to the commons. And I realized that what had happened and that terrorists had come in and they had taken over the Israeli athletes and hurt one of them with shot, this and then. And I was so upset. And anyway, we went around to where the Puerto Rican team was. Went out on the porch and I actually saw the guy standing, you know, that famous picture of the guy with the hat on in the doorway out on the balcony.

I will never wait in line again with white people. Excuse me, why am I behind you? What were you drinking? Excuse me start my Starbucks line days are over. Privilege? Damn. Like, this is ridiculous. And I would just like to once again go back to the human being thing. The white people are like, I'm so sorry. I'm like, how many slaves did you own exactly? When did you let them go? Did you give them the 40 acres? What? Well, no, I didn't actually do that; my father was a mechanic, my mother was a teacher. So, you didn't actually participate in the slavery? No. How many lynchings have you attended? Um, none. Huh? You should be ashamed yourself. What the hell is wrong with people?

But in terms of conversations and I do have decades of experience with conversations. I'll say that starting it off with, hey, you're a piece of (BLEEP), and so coming out, and we'll make you feel really, really bad because a piece of (BLEEP) like you deserves it.

But how do you split an adorable Corgi without first laying down a tarp? Alaska, California and Illinois have laws giving judge's discretion to consider what would be in the best interest of the animals. It was worse before I edited it. And a similar bill is pending in New York but everywhere else fights over Fido are handled the same way as the ones over used (INAUDIBLE). Which makes sense because sometimes you have to walk it. In recent years, people have made use of mediators who specialize in pets and so called pet naps to keep the matter out of court.

He's my best friend. He sleeps under my chin every single night the dog. I feel like, him, like he loves the dogs so much to the point that it's weird like more than me. I'll overhear him talking to the dog about vacations they are going to take together just the two of them. Like including specific plans like walks along the beach and like sharing a steak.
