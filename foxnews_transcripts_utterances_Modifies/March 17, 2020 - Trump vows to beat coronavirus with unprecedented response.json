America is at war against an invisible enemy, and we will win. That's the urgent message coming from President Trump amid the rapidly developing Coronavirus pandemic. There are a lot of new developments, almost 6,000 Americans testing positive, and over 90 people here have died. Cases are now being reported in every state except West Virginia and millions more across the country being impacted by businesses and schools shutting down. President Trump meeting with business leaders today as Washington prepares for a historic response to blunt the economic impact the virus is causing.  The White House pushing Congress to pass an $850 billion stimulus package, including putting money in American's hands.",

We could keep going back every day or every week. We are going big. The best thing we can do is get rid of the virus. Once that's gone, it's going to pop back like nobody's ever seen. One day, we will be standing possibly up here. We'll say, well, we won and we're going to say that.  As sure is you're sitting there, we're going to say that. And we are going to win.

And I think that everybody -- that team seems to me to be working very well together. And then you add that -- so many things happening at once. You have the healthcare issues, so that's where you have Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and their teams working on that piece. Then you have the economic piece, which -- I am pretty calm in a crisis usually. This one, I feel myself sometimes like not breathing, and not because I'm necessarily worried about the healthcare issues because there's nothing I can do about that. But I am worried for the workers across America who are really going to be hit hard. And I absolutely agree with the administration to go with a super big package.  Do it once. Have a Congress do it together. And we will have to figure out on the other end how we deal with that. I remember in 2008 during the financial crisis, it was very unpopular to spend all that money especially to bail out Wall Street. This is very different. The banks were able to pay that money back. We have a situation right now where it's so important for us to figure out a way to help keep employees as connected to their employers as possible. So instead of those businesses going out of business, they are able to stay together, figure out how to keep it going, so that these workers can be taken care of. And that's -- I am hoping that the Congress can do that as quickly as possible.",

But so far, Mitchell McConnell says good things but nothing has happened. And the House is away this week, so it's been a little bit -- to me, I'm in -- you know, I think Dana's corner here on let's get something done and let's do it now. Because you hear big companies, Marriott, you know, some of the coffee people laying off large numbers of people as they shut down hotels, the coffee shops, obviously restaurants, casinos, airlines are in big -- we're -- as a country, we need the airlines to function. So I don't think there's any doubt that it's in our interest to do some kind of major bailout.  Now, let me just say in terms of the president, though, Jessie. I think I'm on another page, because I salute the fact that he pivoted yesterday. He said -- he now says this is a bad one. But it's taken him a very long time to get here. And then we see the consequences of that delay and lack of seriousness he brought to this subject in terms of the most recent poll.   A Marist Poll out today, 60 percent of Americans don't trust what our president has to say on this issue. That's pretty shocking. And it's 66 percent of independent voters. And in terms of disapproving, 49 percent of Americans disapprove of how he's handled this. So you can see that what we're getting from the president is a problem for lots of Americans. Instead, they put their trust, high numbers, 70, 80 percent in the experts like Dr. Fauci.",

It's because it's very difficult for any president, especially a president with a successful business background to in a time of crisis tell the country, don't go to work. Don't shop. Don't spend. Don't come together.  Essentially telling the U.S. economy you have to shut down in order to start back up and get better. That's a very difficult thing for anybody to do.",

He was -- at the beginning of this crisis, was trying to address and quell a panic when he saw it happening in the stock market. That was when he saw his role. He got out of the way of the experts. He has Anthony Fauci handling that. And we are getting every single thing that we need. We are attacking this thing 100 percent. So I think that, like, you know, worrying about polls, you can have that. Have fun, whatever. There's good news. There's good news to talk about. I think that the preparedness and what we've been doing is working.   It doesn't look right now that the virus is spreading exponentially, which is good but we don't know. And I think actually, on a fun level, I mean, it's having an effect on people personally. Like, you know, I'm spending a lot of time with my wife.",

Meanwhile, I'm doubling up on my exercise and trying to focus on, like, endurance and explosive strength. So you will never find another time in your life to focus this much on self-improvement. You can do so many things. And some of these behaviors could become permanent, like shopping off hours. I don't really do that, drinking at home, that's a good thing. Turning hand sanitizer into moonshine, prisoners are doing that. I might do that. But it might be a time to apply self measures now that can be permanent.

I think it's important to remember that -- this needs to be differentiated from the financial crisis in 2009. That was a bailout. What we are dealing with right now is a rescue mission of our small businesses, our travel industry, all of which we -- not only depend on for personal reasons, but professional reasons. And the reason that things are amping up right now is because the Imperial College report just came out showing the data from all the epidemiological modeling, which shows the impact that this pandemic can actually have on the United States. And it talks about the importance of suppressing and mitigating the viral infection. And that is exactly why they're doing it. And they're saying we have to do these certain steps. We have to do it now. And it has to be an entire country's effort in order to mitigate the spread and not overwhelm our healthcare system.

Well, it's really interesting, because they are still taking it to the streets. The bottom line is we heard Dr. Fauci.

But they absolutely are mitigating -- they're not helping in mitigating of the spread of the disease. Because you can be an asymptomatic carrier or they made themselves even just be a mild carrier, having those large groups together, they are continuing to spread this illness and putting they're our more vulnerable populations at risk.

Now, you want them to see how their behavior affects others, like gramps and granny. And if they can't understand that, then they're not worth talking to. But that's the problem because now it's no longer about them. We almost need to lie to them. You have to tell them that it's a sexually-transmitted disease, because then they won't go to spring break. If you said this is, like, really -- this is worse than herpes, then they might go home. But I do think that there needs to be consequences in order for them to understand the importance of this.

We'll move on now. So we have a Coronavirus outbreak. It's ongoing. And Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are facing off tonight in three big primaries, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. So the decision to send voters to the polls is causing some controversy. Ohio delayed its primary, which was supposed to happen today, at the very last minute over public health concerns. Joe Biden is anticipating another big night, but it looks like Sanders isn't going anywhere. Aides for the senator saying he's not planning on dropping out of the race even if he has a poor showing. And this is interesting. Allies for Joe Biden reportedly think Elizabeth Warren could be a potential running mate. And it's a good thing I'm sitting down, Juan. Or I don't know if I would have been able to handle that latest bit of news. Let me get your take on today. Obviously, there is going to be a lower turnout than what you saw on previous dates, because we are all trying to follow the orders of Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx -- what we're supposed to do it responsibly.

And what you can anticipate with, first, people canceling or delaying elections, is it going to take away some of that momentum potentially. But then it also breeds conspiracy theories and when do you reschedule and who is going to turn out when you reschedule. But the bigger point is that when I was coming to which is if you see lower turnout.  There's not much you can extrapolate from who is actually interested in this election, who's going to vote, who you can go to later on and say I like you to help us organize.

And I think that everybody -- that team seems to me to be working very well together. And then you add that -- so many things happening at once. You have the healthcare issues, so that's where you have Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and their teams working on that piece. Then you have the economic piece, which -- I am pretty calm in a crisis usually. This one, I feel myself sometimes like not breathing, and not because I'm necessarily worried about the healthcare issues because there's nothing I can do about that. But I am worried for the workers across America who are really going to be hit hard. And I absolutely agree with the administration to go with a super big package. Do it once. Have a Congress do it together. And we will have to figure out on the other end how we deal with that. I remember in 2008 during the financial crisis, it was very unpopular to spend all that money especially to bail out Wall Street. This is very different. The banks were able to pay that money back. We have a situation right now where it's so important for us to figure out a way to help keep employees as connected to their employers as possible. So instead of those businesses going out of business, they are able to stay together, figure out how to keep it going, so that these workers can be taken care of. And that's -- I am hoping that the Congress can do that as quickly as possible."

      "utterance": "Well, I'm sort of disappointed that the Senate hasn't acted. You know, the House passed the bill. The president backed the bill. But so far, Mitchell McConnell says good things but nothing has happened. And the House is away this week, so it's been a little bit -- to me, I'm in -- you know, I think Dana's corner here on let's get something done and let's do it now. Because you hear big companies, Marriott, you know, some of the coffee people laying off large numbers of people as they shut down hotels, the coffee shops, obviously restaurants, casinos, airlines are in big -- we're -- as a country, we need the airlines to function. So I don't think there's any doubt that it's in our interest to do some kind of major bailout. Now, let me just say in terms of the president, though, Jessie. I think I'm on another page, because I salute the fact that he pivoted yesterday. He said -- he now says this is a bad one. But it's taken him a very long time to get here. And then we see the consequences of that delay and lack of seriousness he brought to this subject in terms of the most recent poll. A Marist Poll out today, 60 percent of Americans don't trust what our president has to say on this issue. That's pretty shocking. And it's 66 percent of independent voters. And in terms of disapproving, 49 percent of Americans disapprove of how he's handled this. So you can see that what we're getting from the president is a problem for lots of Americans. Instead, they put their trust, high numbers, 70, 80 percent in the experts like Dr. Fauci."

It's because it's very difficult for any president, especially a president with a successful business background to in a time of crisis tell the country, don't go to work. Don't shop. Don't spend. Don't come together. Essentially telling the U.S. economy you have to shut down in order to start back up and get better. That's a very difficult thing for anybody to do."

He was -- at the beginning of this crisis, was trying to address and quell a panic when he saw it happening in the stock market. That was when he saw his role. He got out of the way of the experts. He has Anthony Fauci handling that. And we are getting every single thing that we need. We are attacking this thing 100 percent. So I think that, like, you know, worrying about polls, you can have that. Have fun, whatever. There's good news. There's good news to talk about. I think that the preparedness and what we've been doing is working. It doesn't look right now that the virus is spreading exponentially, which is good but we don't know. And I think actually, on a fun level, I mean, it's having an effect on people personally. Like, you know, I'm spending a lot of time with my wife."

Meanwhile, I'm doubling up on my exercise and trying to focus on, like, endurance and explosive strength. So you will never find another time in your life to focus this much on self-improvement. You can do so many things. And some of these behaviors could become permanent, like shopping off hours. I don't really do that, drinking at home, that's a good thing. Turning hand sanitizer into moonshine, prisoners are doing that. I might do that. But it might be a time to apply self measures now that can be permanent.

I think it's important to remember that -- this needs to be differentiated from the financial crisis in 2009. That was a bailout. What we are dealing with right now is a rescue mission of our small businesses, our travel industry, all of which we -- not only depend on for personal reasons, but professional reasons. And the reason that things are amping up right now is because the Imperial College report just came out showing the data from all the epidemiological modeling, which shows the impact that this pandemic can actually have on the United States. And it talks about the importance of suppressing and mitigating the viral infection. And that is exactly why they're doing it. And they're saying we have to do these certain steps. We have to do it now. And it has to be an entire country's effort in order to mitigate the spread and not overwhelm our healthcare system. And to be honest, I think the administration is tackling it from both standpoints, the economic, as well as the public health perspective."

And they're a lot of informed than the rest of Americans, and that they're not going to trust the government to take over. Well, it's really interesting, because they are still taking it to the streets. The bottom line is we heard Dr. Fauci. We heard Dr. Birx earlier to say, yes, we understand that it is not the young people necessarily having severe symptoms when it comes to this illness. But they absolutely are mitigating -- they're not helping in mitigating of the spread of the disease. Because you can be an asymptomatic carrier or they made themselves even just be a mild carrier, having those large groups together, they are continuing to spread this illness and putting they're our more vulnerable populations at risk. They need to take responsibility. This will not just take an individual municipality or state. It will take our entire nation to work together to get us past this."

At that age, young people already don't understand the effects of dumb behavior on their mortality. They have the highest death rates in car accidents, and they do really stupid things. Now, you want them to see how their behavior affects others, like gramps and granny. And if they can't understand that, then they're not worth talking to. But that's the problem because now it's no longer about them. We almost need to lie to them. You have to tell them that it's a sexually-transmitted disease, because then they won't go to spring break. If you said this is, like, really -- this is worse than herpes, then they might go home. But I do think that there needs to be consequences in order for them to understand the importance of this. Because obviously, to the doctor's point, congregating, asymptomatic spread, you combine those two things together, it ain't going to stop spreading. So these kids should stay home and drink at home like I do the responsible way. I drink at home under a sun lamp."

So as someone that went to spring break and then reported on spring break, I am a spring break veteran. So I will say, out of respect, young college students, for your parents and your grandparents who are paying your college tuition to go to spring break and cut loose, don't do it.

We'll move on now. So we have a Coronavirus outbreak. It's ongoing. And Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are facing off tonight in three big primaries, Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. So the decision to send voters to the polls is causing some controversy. Ohio delayed its primary, which was supposed to happen today, at the very last minute over public health concerns. Joe Biden is anticipating another big night, but it looks like Sanders isn't going anywhere. Aides for the senator saying he's not planning on dropping out of the race even if he has a poor showing. And this is interesting. Allies for Joe Biden reportedly think Elizabeth Warren could be a potential running mate. And it's a good thing I'm sitting down, Juan. Or I don't know if I would have been able to handle that latest bit of news. Let me get your take on today. Obviously, there is going to be a lower turnout than what you saw on previous dates, because we are all trying to follow the orders of Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx -- what we're supposed to do it responsibly. But there is an election that's ongoing. What are you hearing from any of the Democrats today?"

Obviously, Joe Biden has some momentum going into this. But part of his success has been seen in higher rates of turnout especially in the suburbs near big cities. And what you can anticipate with, first, people canceling or delaying elections, is it going to take away some of that momentum potentially. But then it also breeds conspiracy theories and when do you reschedule and who is going to turn out when you reschedule. But the bigger point is that when I was coming to which is if you see lower turnout. There's not much you can extrapolate from who is actually interested in this election, who's going to vote, who you can go to later on and say I like you to help us organize. I'd like you to become a surrogate in this campaign. And that's very valuable to candidates running in the primary."

Are they putting politics before the voters' health? A lot of old people get out there and vote. And I think it will depress the numbers. And I think it puts people at risk.

And it prevents him from having to go out and give televised speeches to people and stick his foot in his mouth. I also understand in the general election, the conventional wisdom says that this is going to help Biden because the economy is going to go down for a little bit. But it also -- it keeps him out of the news because he can't get any airtime. His donors, they're broke now. I mean, look at the stock market. The money is drying up. Fortunes are leaving pretty quickly. And I just don't see Joe rise to the occasion. The President, on the other hand, is exercising an enormous amount of power over the country. He's engineering an economic recovery. He's rallying the country around a threat, and he's trying to protect people's health and their pocketbook.

I had so many people reach out both in the neighborhood to volunteer, but then also all over the world sending me pictures of their signs that they're making, which I think is so huge."

Not the kind of phony virtue on social media where a pop star tweets an inspirational phrase that she Googled a minute ago. That's zero cost with zero benefit. By the way, it's odd how our most famous celebrity crusaders have gone silent. My guess, they're in their guarded seclusion, and I'm sure the gun control zealots among them are armed to the hilt. As for you do good things that make you feel good. Granted, it's hard in isolation, but small things matter. Oddly, even washing your hands should make you feel heroic because you're killing germs and sharing, yes, even sharing your toilet paper. One guy actually started a toilet paper exchange on a California street corner. His homemade sign read share your toilet paper, and it's working. Why? Because good deeds make you feel less crappy. It's not virtue signaling, but virtue doing. We saw idiots hoarding toilet paper and true to their mimetic nature, people copied it. So why not initiate good behavior and hope people copy that too. This is also a good time to eat better, exercise more, practice that guitar gathering dust on the wall. Now's the time to be your better self. It's the opposite of every panic imagined by our entertainment industry. Prove them wrong by doing things right once again."

And he created a Web site, and like one day, they came to him, it's called OneWestport.com. And I think that's going to happen all over the country. Basically, it's a site where local businesses can sign up and then you can go and buy gift cards for each of those businesses, but it's like a one- stop shopping place, so you can be supportive of your local community. And I think that's also very important, which is figuring out what is needed right here. There's a guy named Greg Danson, who -- down in Dallas said, let me try to do something like that young girl from Fox and Friends. How can I help in my community?

In all seriousness though, Ivanka Trump has a hashtag now, it's called #TogetherApart, which she's doing a lot of the things you're talking about.

After 9/11, we needed government to step up and do1 its thing. And we need government right now to step up and take constructive action to help us all. So you know, we can talk about individuals, but I don't think we should somehow, you know, the libertarian bent and you may say, you know what, government always bet.

Because although it may be hard, it really does give them this positive feedback, and they realize they're doing more. So I think it's great we're covering these stories. And, you know, it takes -- it's a little bit of different approach. Because people love to look at a bad car crash, but it's even -- you know, we're all addicted to that for some reason.

I mean, I've been following it a little bit on social media and it seems to be, you know, it's quite the situation. So, Jesse, I have a question.

He's a system quarterback that Craft and Belichick have to be thinking. We cut this guy lose, and we just load up in the offseason, stack the deck on offense and defense and make another run for a ring. It will be weird to see him in another jersey. Remember when Jordan went to the Washington Wizards and was wearing blue, it's going to be hard to wrap your head around that. I think you'll probably wind up with the Rams in Southern California. You know, it's great weather, Hollywood, they got a good running back out there, some wide receivers. He's a California kid, like Greg Gutfeld. I think that's where he lands."

I have THE FIVE. I have the GG Show. I had Red Eye. I edited Maxim, I edited Stuff Magazine, I edited Men's Health. So in this universe of Serra High School graduates, he has one singular talent.
