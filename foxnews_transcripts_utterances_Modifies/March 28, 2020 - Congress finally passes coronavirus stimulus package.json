Yes, CNN covered that as they whined about having to cover an emergency briefing.   But so many things don't fit inside the media's narrative. For example, they see no importance in finding out the specific names of those special creeps who slipped elitist crap into the relief package. Why?  They haven't yet bothered to investigate how the Chinese covered up their outbreak causing a delay in information that caused this. The press lauded the Chinese for their quick government response. The media happily confused a potentially life-saving drug with a toxic chemical used in fish tanks. They all tweeted about it giddy at the thought that Trump touting a drug actually used by doctors might have killed some guy who swallowed poison because he was careless.  But that story was false. The guy didn't take the drug Trump touted. He took fish tank cleaner.  So why all these mistakes? Because they're too distracted, trying to gin up a rift between Fauci and Trump.",

The public understands that you weigh costs and benefits with every decision and that sooner or later, we will go back to work even when some risk is present, because you can't eliminate it entirely. But there will be groups of people in some places who can go back to work while others won't. The economy will reboot in phases. Trump gets that and so do you.

Because the price of unemployment isn't just financial, it leads to psychological, emotional and physical consequences. That's why it's an adult problem. You need to fight a pandemic without creating permanent damage. Of course, the media will report on these job numbers as if it was Trump's fault. And it's as if they knew it was coming, and were warning about it, forgetting that it was Trump who was on it before they were.

Yes, while the disease was bubbling up, they were frothing over impeachment hearings. But what if they hadn't? What if they had they been looking out for you? Would they have seen this crisis coming? Look, I've got no doubt we will exit this dark period stronger and better than before. Jobs will return. The economy will roar back.

This as cases in the U.S. surged to nearly 123,000 with more than 2,000 deaths. But states are concerned about the influx of New Yorkers. In Rhode Island today, the National Guard went door to door warning people from the state that they must self-quarantine for 14 days. And an infant from Illinois has died from COVID-19. This is the first known infant deaths from the virus here in the U.S. It's unclear if the baby had other health issues.

Yes, CNN covered that as they whined about having to cover an emergency briefing. But so many things don't fit inside the media's narrative. For example, they see no importance in finding out the specific names of those special creeps who slipped elitist crap into the relief package. Why? They haven't yet bothered to investigate how the Chinese covered up their outbreak causing a delay in information that caused this. The press lauded the Chinese for their quick government response. The media happily confused a potentially life-saving drug with a toxic chemical used in fish tanks. They all tweeted about it giddy at the thought that Trump touting a drug actually used by doctors might have killed some guy who swallowed poison because he was careless. But that story was false.

The public understands that you weigh costs and benefits with every decision and that sooner or later, we will go back to work even when some risk is present, because you can't eliminate it entirely.

Because the price of unemployment isn't just financial, it leads to psychological, emotional and physical consequences. That's why it's an adult problem. You need to fight a pandemic without creating permanent damage. Of course, the media will report on these job numbers as if it was Trump's fault.

Just like how they forget who was first concerned about China way back when? Oh yes, that was Trump, too, and again what occupied the media's time as this pandemic first spread? Yes, while the disease was bubbling up, they were frothing over impeachment hearings. But what if they hadn't? What if they had they been looking out for you? Would they have seen this crisis coming?

What people don't understand is there's already coronavirus in a cornfield in Iowa. It's just that when people don't live on top of each other, they don't naturally spread it by living their lives. And so that's what Trump is trying to say. He is trying to say the spread is because of the density of population, which is so funny because Andrew Cuomo is getting accolades by the millions every day by going on and doing story time and saying exactly that. And so if an Obama-style politician said it, yes, they would applaud because they do every day for two hours when Andrew Cuomo takes the mic."

It's actually going to make them stronger. And all the coronavirus in the world doesn't, you know, deter the American spirit of, hey, if we invest and gamble in this economy, it will pay us back, which is what Trump came into office and showed us.

This as cases in the U.S. surged to nearly 123,000 with more than 2,000 deaths. But states are concerned about the influx of New Yorkers. In Rhode Island today, the National Guard went door to door warning people from the state that they must self-quarantine for 14 days. And an infant from Illinois has died from COVID-19. This is the first known infant deaths from the virus here in the U.S. It's unclear if the baby had other health issues.

But you know, the one thing I will say is that I hope this instills some self-reliance in people and be like, you know, I can -- I can hang my own light fixture or maybe you know clean my house or do things that I don't normally do or pay someone else to do. I will tell you though, I need a barber and I'm so ready to sit down and have someone bring me a plate of food without having to lift a finger, so those two things I'm ready for."

Speaking of getting sick of things, Kat, how are you dealing with your -- you're living with your boyfriend, who you just kind of like moved in with, so you're learning all this weird stuff.

I'm like, you might as well just yell at me and tell me -- you're just telling me you're better than I am to my face. So other than that, things are going surprisingly well.

We've seen medical staffs telling the world they need supplies, and that spurs government into action. You know, you raise a stink on Twitter and people move faster than a burrito through my intestines. It helps us check in on our loved ones we can't visit right now or don't want to. And let's not forget those videos of Italians singing from their balconies. We wouldn't have that without social media. I hope that becomes a reality show. Italy has got balcony talent. And then there are the things out there that nobody asked for. And nobody needs to see, like my dog after he broke up with his girlfriend."

And then we go on Instagram, it's a bunch of 30-something year old parents learning to do a push up for the first time and making sure you know about it. I Instagram Lived me painting trim for one of my walls I rebuilt and people watched me watch paint dry, so that tells you how bored people are.
