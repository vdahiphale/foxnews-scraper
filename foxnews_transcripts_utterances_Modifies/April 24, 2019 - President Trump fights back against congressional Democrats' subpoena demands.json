The suggestion that you are not a patriot if you somehow disagree with this idea, if you don't join in the resistance, we talked about this before, the expanding target of denigration, you are not a patriot.  Let's go back to 2015, 2016. Having concerns about Trump made total sense, right? I had so many concerns. He wasn't a politician. His personality, he was a bull in a China shop. He never knew what he was going to do. He had an interesting, colorful past. And plus, you had all these other options. You have good options in the Republican Party. You had safer options. It didn't turn out that way but concerns made common sense. Now, people are having the same concerns three years later. None of their fears have materialized. The world -- he has not started any new wars. In fact, he has tried to shrink our military footprint. He has not destroyed the economy. We have a booming economy. We have the lowest unemployment in modern history. He's help minorities and women in that world.  So when you see this kind of panic going on, all you can think about is it's OK if you're a Democrat. I get it. It's team sports. That's what you do. But if you actually believe this stuff, I would say like a never- Trump Republican, it's emotional and it's irrational. It's stupid.

And tough -- and very tough prosecutor, in fact, in terms of the lot of youth crimes.

In this specific debate it looks like she's backtracking though, doesn't it? And so, that's why I think getting all this attention. To be fair, Bernie Sanders put this out there and it has, I think, stirred a lot of conversation because, you know, I think it was Earl Warren, the chief justice, who said, you know, its citizenship is not a right to be revoked due to bad behavior. It's your rights. And I think Republicans in Florida and elsewhere, President Trump with his crime reform bill, everybody is saying we've got to do more in terms of rehabilitating people who've been in prison in order to cut down on recidivism.  We don't want people just churning and ending up being criminals again and back in jail and living off all of us, as we pay for the criminal justice system. So the question is how do we do it?

Now, when they get out of jail, that's another story. Yes, but that's not what this is about. This is about what Bernie said, the Boston bomber should vote and could vote. I don't even know what you could add to that to make it worse. Oh, the Boston bomber should vote after he eats babies, maybe that would make it worse. But -- I'm kidding.

And so far from what I've seen, I don't think he is skilled enough as a politician to be able to pull that off. So far he seems clumsy. The rollout is seemed awkward. The touchy-feelyness thing was weird. And he went on an apology tour.

An existential threat, asteroids, cataclysmic climate change, Islamic terror, any time you're stuck in an elevator and Maroon 5 is playing, existential threat, but this is not. The suggestion that you are not a patriot if you somehow disagree with this idea, if you don't join in the resistance, we talked about this before, the expanding target of denigration, you are not a patriot. Let's go back to 2015, 2016. Having concerns about Trump made total sense, right? I had so many concerns. He wasn't a politician. His personality, he was a bull in a China shop. He never knew what he was going to do. He had an interesting, colorful past. And plus, you had all these other options. You have good options in the Republican Party. You had safer options. It didn't turn out that way but concerns made common sense. Now, people are having the same concerns three years later. None of their fears have materialized. The world -- he has not started any new wars. In fact, he has tried to shrink our military footprint. He has not destroyed the economy. We have a booming economy. We have the lowest unemployment in modern history. He's help minorities and women in that world. So when you see this kind of panic going on, all you can think about is it's OK if you're a Democrat. I get it. It's team sports. That's what you do. But if you actually believe this stuff, I would say like a never- Trump Republican, it's emotional and it's irrational. It's stupid. And that's all I've got to say."

What I mean by that is that subpoenas and orders of contempt are being held in contempt expires with that congressional duration, exactly. So all the president has to do is get to January of 2021. And also it is the courts, unlike the Supreme Court's ruling impeachment, which is zero, obviously, for claims of privilege or for subpoenas or contempt, they do play a part. So he can absolutely string it out and I think that's a really powerful tool because at the end of it, it will be him and McGahn that shines rather than Congress with nothing to show for it."

I think there're a lot of people on the far left who say she went too far in terms of prosecuting people, for example breaking marijuana laws in the like in California. And tough -- and very tough prosecutor, in fact, in terms of the lot of youth crimes. But -- so I think that helps her in terms of her position as a Democratic moderate and someone who can be tough on crime, and it would be harder to position her as left-wing. In this specific debate it looks like she's backtracking though, doesn't it? And so, that's why I think getting all this attention. To be fair, Bernie Sanders put this out there and it has, I think, stirred a lot of conversation because, you know, I think it was Earl Warren, the chief justice, who said, you know, its citizenship is not a right to be revoked due to bad behavior. It's your rights. And I think Republicans in Florida and elsewhere, President Trump with his crime reform bill, everybody is saying we've got to do more in terms of rehabilitating people who've been in prison in order to cut down on recidivism. We don't want people just churning and ending up being criminals again and back in jail and living off all of us, as we pay for the criminal justice system. So the question is how do we do it? I think this is an important conversation. I'm glad it started because I think that it's unfair to people who have been in jail and who've paid their dues to society to be denied their right to vote --"

Now, when they get out of jail, that's another story. Yes, but that's not what this is about. This is about what Bernie said, the Boston bomber should vote and could vote. I don't even know what you could add to that to make it worse. Oh, the Boston bomber should vote after he eats babies, maybe that would make it worse. But -- I'm kidding. She almost started crying there for a minute. So what I'm saying is Republicans don't need to exaggerate any of the planks of the Democrats. The Democrats are doing it for themselves, Juan.

And when his campaign reports numbers, when the quarter two report comes out in July, we will find out whether those big- time donors that have thus far stayed out of it, whether they do, in fact, support him.

And Biden has to be strong enough and crafty enough and articulate enough to say I'm Joe Biden, I'm electable, we had this great record under Barack Obama, and I know what I'm doing in Washington. But at the same time make the crazy people out there on the far left feel that he's one of them. And so far from what I've seen, I don't think he is skilled enough as a politician to be able to pull that off. So far he seems clumsy. The rollout is seemed awkward. The touchy-feelyness thing was weird. And he went on an apology tour. So from what I've seen so far, I just don't think he has the skills and the stomach actually because Limbaugh actually hit a good point. Does he really want it the way someone really wants it?

I can do this. And Democrats are actually quite rational. We talk about his touchiness. We talked about how he's out of touch.

Is it me or does that entire field minus Biden feel very small like physically like you get this sense - love Trump or hate Trump or a difference to Trump? He's larger than life. He's a walking phenomenon. So, when you look at these other people and these little town halls and they're also adorable and cute trying to play politician. And I did this, and I did that.

There it is, it's officially opened for business earlier this week. It's a six-ton spud located on 400 acres of farmland, it's about 25 miles southeast of Boise. Beautiful country. And although, the hotel may not seem like much on the outside, when you get in, it's more than it appears to be. Of course, it's pretty sweet. I love that it's pink."

He wasn't going to take that ball from an Orioles fan, against his principles, but in the end, it was just too tempting folks. He grudgingly accepts the gift. As a baseball fan, it's always expected that adults get foul balls to kids, so hats off to the Orioles fan. As for that young man, he's definitely one passionate fan. Way to go young fellow."

And he teaches specifically social studies and history and he focuses on helping them become socially conscious citizens. And overall, he's really an amazing guy. Hats off."
