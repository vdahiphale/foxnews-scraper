And the good news is, well, it's Friday. But the bad news is, it caps and not-so-great week for stocks. In fact, this just could end up being the worst week for stocks this year, and all because this China mess with China, that whole mess that we're having back and forth, well, it's getting worse by the day.  Beijing promising that it will retaliate for those added tariffs the president announced just yesterday. But we still have no idea just what the response will be or how soon it will come.  What we do know is, this latest round of tariffs is coming September 1, just in time for the back-to-school shopping season and, for retailers, the game get-ready-for-Christmas-stockpiling season. Now, that doesn't mean there still won't be a deal, but increasing signs it might not be happening any time soon. Let's just say that things are getting nasty.  So time for us to get going. We will have FOX Business Grady Trimble outside the New York Stock Exchange, where they're feeling the heat. And we will also have other experts on both the political and ramifications from that heat.  But, as I said, first to Grady -- hey, Grady.",

The markets, Neil, as you know, like predictability. Well, we did get that in today's jobs report, U.S. companies adding 164,000 jobs in July. Job growth seems to be slightly slowing, and hourly wages only increased by a little bit, but unemployment still near a 50-year low at 3.7 percent. But none of that mattered here inside those walls, where traders only had the tariffs on their mind. It will be interesting to see what happens when the markets open on Monday -- Neil.",

You're going to get into the fall, where these latest waves of tariffs are going to affect mostly consumer items. There won't be any of the industrial pass-through you had with the other tariffs that took a little bit longer to sort of gel.

And while we have gotten about $20 billion this year in tariffs, we have bailed out our farmers to the tune of $28 billion. And contracts we're losing to Brazil, we're losing for the foreseeable future. We're not going to get those back anytime soon. Farmers in the Midwest, which elected President Trump, are going to start to have a slow -- their patiences are going to start to ebb on this.

Lobster sales to China are going to be down 70 percent because of this trade issue; 70 percent of footwear that we wear back-to-school season is coming from China.  This is going to affect families, it's going to affect the economy, it's going to affect the consumer, which is what's driving the U.S. economy. So I'm not buying it. I think this is a real issue.

The spokesperson went on to say that, if the tariffs do go through -- quote -- \"China will have to take necessary countermeasures to resolutely defend its core interests.\" Now, the White House doesn't appear to be afraid of any possible retaliation.

The E.U. has huge trade barriers, he says, and that auto tariffs for E.U. auto manufacturers are never off the table.

The president and the congressman announced that he was withdrawing his name from consideration to be the director of national intelligence.

He said that he could have gotten Republicans on board, especially those in the Senate who would have been voting on his confirmation, because Congressman Ratcliffe is out on the House side.

And the history was quite interesting. And it leads us to where we are today. The Soviets introduced one of these missiles, the SS-20, in 1977. In '79, we introduced the Pershing II. By '83, the president, President Reagan, was able to introduce a suggestion of a zero-zero trade-off. Reykjavik happened in '86. In '87, we got the agreement. And in '88, we signed it. It was very significant, in that it eliminated -- I'm trying to remember -- it eliminated about 2,692 weapons, 846 on the U.S. side, 1,846 on the Soviet side. So it was significant in its time. But then, in 2001, we stopped inspections. In 2008, the Soviets -- really now the Russians -- broke out. And we're in a position now where both are modernizing. The real question today is, does this open the door to some sort of a new race? Or is it really about a new agreement? And the answer is, it's really about a new agreement, and China has to be in that agreement.

And the good news is, well, it's Friday. But the bad news is, it caps and not-so-great week for stocks. In fact, this just could end up being the worst week for stocks this year, and all because this China mess with China, that whole mess that we're having back and forth, well, it's getting worse by the day. Beijing promising that it will retaliate for those added tariffs the president announced just yesterday. But we still have no idea just what the response will be or how soon it will come. What we do know is, this latest round of tariffs is coming September 1, just in time for the back-to-school shopping season and, for retailers, the game get-ready-for-Christmas-stockpiling season. Now, that doesn't mean there still won't be a deal, but increasing signs it might not be happening any time soon. Let's just say that things are getting nasty. So time for us to get going. We will have FOX Business Grady Trimble outside the New York Stock Exchange, where they're feeling the heat. And we will also have other experts on both the political and ramifications from that heat. But, as I said, first to Grady -- hey, Grady."

The market dipped after the Fed announcer rate cut earlier this week. It dropped even more when President Trump tweeted about new tariffs on China yesterday. And then that continued with today's sell-off. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow explaining this morning the president's decision to impose those tariffs, right after the U.S. team met with Chinese trade officials."

They're things we buy all the time this time around, like iPhones, laptops, game counsels, and TVs, and then things you get at the grocery store, like alcohol, condiments, coffee and spices. The markets, Neil, as you know, like predictability. Well, we did get that in today's jobs report, U.S. companies adding 164,000 jobs in July. Job growth seems to be slightly slowing, and hourly wages only increased by a little bit, but unemployment still near a 50-year low at 3.7 percent. But none of that mattered here inside those walls, where traders only had the tariffs on their mind. It will be interesting to see what happens when the markets open on Monday -- Neil."

As Grady was just reporting, it is slowing from June's blistering pace, but the economy still churned out that 164,000 jobs he mentioned, and the unemployment rate itself, well, that's at 3.7 percent.

But unemployment holds steady at 3.7 percent, the lowest in 50 years right now. And what's more important is that wages for blue-collar workers are rising. Lower-income Americans are rising. That's what matters the most and the fact that the participation rate is going up. That means that more people are confident that they can get a job. They're coming off the sidelines, and they're finding a job that they're happy with."

And I don't think we're any closer than we were a year ago. I think the Chinese are preparing for a very long, long fight with this. Our economy is good. Heather is right. Our economy is good.

But, John, one of the things that has come up here is, be careful what you wish for, because the president plays tough -- and he's been playing tough on this. You're going to get into the fall, where these latest waves of tariffs are going to affect mostly consumer items. There won't be any of the industrial pass-through you had with the other tariffs that took a little bit longer to sort of gel. Then you're doing it at a tough time a year, the start of the fall, fall buying season, getting ready the holidays. What do you think?"

And his tough talk, I think, has backed President Xi into a corner which he cannot come out of. I don't think there's an easy off-ramp for President Xi. And while we have gotten about $20 billion this year in tariffs, we have bailed out our farmers to the tune of $28 billion. And contracts we're losing to Brazil, we're losing for the foreseeable future. We're not going to get those back anytime soon. Farmers in the Midwest, which elected President Trump, are going to start to have a slow -- their patiences are going to start to ebb on this. And that's when the political problem is going to manifest itself to the president. And I think that's what China is hoping will happen and why they're killing the clock."

But with the latest round of tariffs, we enter a whole new category of risk, not just for the market, but also for the economy as a whole. Neil, before, it was, hey, it's not in my backyard. If I'm not a soybean exporter to China, I don't care about the trade war. If I'm not an aircraft exporter, I don't care about the trade war. Neil, now it is in my backyard. I'm here in New England. And I got to tell you, it's on Main Street. Look, from footwear to lobsters, it is everywhere right now. It is showing up. Lobster sales to China are going to be down 70 percent because of this trade issue; 70 percent of footwear that we wear back-to-school season is coming from China. This is going to affect families, it's going to affect the economy, it's going to affect the consumer, which is what's driving the U.S. economy. So I'm not buying it. I think this is a real issue.

The president was making this announcement within the last couple of hours. He was there with his trade adviser, as well as North Dakota Senator John Hoeven, at his side. The president says the deal will -- with the E.U. will grant American farmers and ranchers access to more markets.

Today, China threatened to retaliate if the tariffs do go into effect. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that China doesn't want to fight, but isn't afraid to either. The spokesperson went on to say that, if the tariffs do go through -- quote -- \"China will have to take necessary countermeasures to resolutely defend its core interests.\" Now, the White House doesn't appear to be afraid of any possible retaliation. We heard from the president's economic adviser earlier today speaking with reporters, saying the U.S. economy remains strong, and that he believes that U.S. consumers will only see a minuscule impact if these tariffs continue to go back and forth between the U.S. and China -- Neil."

We've been there for 19 years. We're really serving as policemen. We could win Afghanistan in two days or three days or four days, if we wanted. But I'm not looking to kill 10 million people."

Earlier today, the president announced that E.U. beef deals for American farmers to sell more beef to the European Union. But the president says that's just the first barrier. The E.U. has huge trade barriers, he says, and that auto tariffs for E.U. auto manufacturers are never off the table. Much of the conversation the president just had on the South Lawn of the White House there focused on John Ratcliffe, the congressman who is now going to be staying in Congress. The president and the congressman announced that he was withdrawing his name from consideration to be the director of national intelligence. The president says that Ratcliffe received unfair treatment from critics and he said it was a good idea just to avoid the entire process altogether. He said that he could have gotten Republicans on board, especially those in the Senate who would have been voting on his confirmation, because Congressman Ratcliffe is out on the House side. He says he's got to have a decision possibly by Monday. The list is down to three people for director of national intelligence -- Neil."

Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump. Joe Biden can beat Donald Trump, Elizabeth Warren. Some polls suggest that they all would be competitive, if not ahead of him. So we really want to focus on winnowing the field down and getting past this huge primary. So this is what happens when you have so many candidates. They're all taking shots at the ones who are leading, and it does sort of drag down their popularity.

The INF Treaty eliminated nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range from about 300 miles to 3,400 miles. So it was really about protecting Europe. And the history was quite interesting. And it leads us to where we are today. The Soviets introduced one of these missiles, the SS-20, in 1977. In '79, we introduced the Pershing II. By '83, the president, President Reagan, was able to introduce a suggestion of a zero-zero trade-off. Reykjavik happened in '86. In '87, we got the agreement. And in '88, we signed it. It was very significant, in that it eliminated -- I'm trying to remember -- it eliminated about 2,692 weapons, 846 on the U.S. side, 1,846 on the Soviet side. So it was significant in its time. But then, in 2001, we stopped inspections. In 2008, the Soviets -- really now the Russians -- broke out. And we're in a position now where both are modernizing. The real question today is, does this open the door to some sort of a new race? Or is it really about a new agreement? And the answer is, it's really about a new agreement, and China has to be in that agreement. So what I see happening is, in the next maybe five years, you see an agreement of the same kind evolving, with both Russia and China signing with the United States, and that would be a good thing."

So we're not talking about a near-term record. But this is the natural trajectory. Unless you want nuclear war, ultimately, intermediate-range missiles have to be eventually limited again. And, really, the United States and Russia can get there, I think. They are modernizing. China's trying to catch up on a rapid beeline.

Because the president now is aiming for some of those blue cities, either to make a statement or, I don't know, finish a vendetta. The New York Post's Brooke Rogers joins me now to discuss. Brooke, we were talking briefly in the break. What is he doing? What's the strategy?"

      "utterance": "I don't know there is a strategy. I think that, in his mind, someone took a punch at him. And now his first instinct is to punch back. I think that if you look at his M.O. over the last couple of years, he -- when a politician comes after him, he goes for the throat. And that's what this is about. I don't think that he's necessarily trying to appeal to voters in those cities, as much as he's just trying to get back at Representative Cummings."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I think this is much more about changing the rhetoric around this issue. And it's a classic political tactic to say, when you're being attacked, look at your own -- look at your own district, look at your own neighborhood. What are you doing?"

      "speaker": "ROGERS",
      "utterance": "And when you're -- you're forcing, you're pushing the ball back to them. So then they have to come and say -- and defend their own record and defend themselves. And if you look at the rhetoric since then, people have been coming to Baltimore's defense. And it's changed from Representative Cummings' criticism of the border -- the border situation, to now he's on defense. And I think that was the whole -- the whole point of Trump's comments."

      "speaker": "ROGERS",
