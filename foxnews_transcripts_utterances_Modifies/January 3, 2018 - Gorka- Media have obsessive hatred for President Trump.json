      "sentences": "All right thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Breaking news tonight, the media is going nuclear; they're melting down on the way we've never seen before. Why? Because your president dared to stand up to the North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un who was threatening us, and we will explain how hating Trump is the media's drug, they are drug addicts, complete addicts. And we will show you the most insane, unhinged examples the latest liberal media freak out. Plus, media giddy tonight over the back and forth between President Trump and Steve Bannon, and of course, that's who they are. They love them fighting. My exclusive take tonight, all that and more in our breaking news opening monologue.  We'll start tonight -- an important monologue on the mainstream media. Here is what I want to explain to you. Hating President Trump is their drug in the media. And by the way, to them it's more addictive than heroin and crack cocaine. Let me explain.  Because in the liberal media bubble, a Trump tweet literally sends them into orbit, Alka-Seltzer in water, they bubble and fizz every day. It's like a dopamine rush to their brains, the drug is that powerful, they can't duplicate it any other way. Let me tell you how it works. President Trump, he usually tweets to get around the media and their twisted, distorted fake news coverage. And rightly so goes directly to you, the American people, and a lot of times with humor, they can't recognize. The media then promptly proceeds, they rush to the airwaves and they try and outdo each other feigning more outrage than the other one. Here's the latest example. Watch; just watch how the media reacted to President Trump's recent tweets. You can't make this up.",

      "sentences": "Really? President Trump is demented. Let's see, because he was responding to a nuclear threat from North Korea? Not only are they all a bunch of sheep, you notice they all say pretty much the same thing. But they are drug addicts in this sense; they crave their next Trump tweet. They need their fix and if, for some reason, there is not a tweet within 24 hours, there's not a comment, there's no fake outrage, well then they have to latch on to something that will satisfy their craving. They just race back to their gateway drug -- oh Trump, Russia, Trump, Russia. But with the Trump-Russia collusion story now falling flat, that's kind of like the equivalent of methadone, it's only a maintenance drug that barely separates them from like a padded room and some asylum somewhere. And for over a year you have been subjected to Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, collusion, collusion. The only thing missing are facts, facts, facts. And the media desperately repeating those words daily, hoping that somehow, if they say it enough it's going to come true.  Here's the problem, it's not true. There is to date zero evidence President Trump colluded with Russia, none -- whatsoever. It doesn't exist. So the media now, they need a new conspiracy theory that they can pass off as news to get themselves, well, back on their drug, get hooked again. And it's actually in one sense it's sad, because these people really need help. They have no -- let's say, they don't want to adhere to truth anymore. That's a sad thing. If you think about it for a second. Does the media ever -- when you watch the news, do they ever talk about anything Donald Trump that he did is good, any good news, any good news with the economy?   Or they're just obsessed with tearing this president down because they never thought he'd win. Do they ever talk about the American people, solutions for healthcare, getting people out of poverty, off of food stamps, back to work? I never hear it. If the media really cared about anything of real importance, then guess what, they would have to alter their constructive worship sites of Obama during his failed presidency. And by the way, in those years they would have seen the millions or more Americans in poverty and on food stamps, they would have stood up for you, but liking Obama was more important.  President Trump's tweets about North Korea, let's get into this. They are perfect examples. What did the president say that is so dangerous that you see them unleashed like they did in the last 24 hours? Let's see, he stood up to a two bit murdering dictator and he called the little rocket man and he said that the United States is not going to be intimidated by his little red button on his desk. And for the media, that kind of leadership, they don't like it. It's not good enough since what they are used to and what they personally support are the policies of appeasement. So we have to ask, is there anything that President Trump could do to make the media ever happy in the situation with Kim Jong Un? By the way, a situation Bill Clinton put us in. Now the press probably wants President Trump -- maybe they would be happy if he got down on his knees and kissed Kim Jong Un's ring on his little hand. Then they would be calling for him to get the Nobel Prize. Or maybe the media would be happy if Trump gave billions of dollars in fuel subsidies to North Korea like Bill Clinton did. Or maybe Trump should suck up and grovel to Kim Jong Un just like Bill Clinton sucked up and groveled to Kim Jong-il, his father. Then Donald Trump could go on TV like Bill Clinton did and tell you the American people a massive lie like this.",

And they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons. The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so, will North Korea fully join the community of nations.",

      "sentences": "Could Bill Clinton have been more wrong? Or how about this one, maybe they would be ecstatic, really, really happy if President Trump sucked up to the Iranian Mullahs. Maybe if President Trump sent them another $150 billion like Obama did and begged on his hands and knees, \"Pretty, pretty, pretty please, here's billions of dollars, just please stop saying you are going to wipe us off the face of the earth. Please stop saying you will destroy Israel. Please stop burning our flags. That's what they want in the press, that's pathetic. It's week and they are not doing a service to you, the American people.   I've said this many times. They are lazy and they are overpaid and they are a bunch of sycophants that all re-tweet each other in their little media bubble. The sky is literally falling down for these people all because Donald Trump cared to stand up and challenge a murdering dictator. The media lives in this bubble. These people are stepping all over themselves. They want to all outdo each other. It's like a competition. Let's see who can be the most anti-Trump and if one liberal media personalities that President Trump is demented, and then another has to step in and say no, he's really, really demented, and he's really, really a big, big, big, big liar and it goes on from there. See what I mean by drug addiction? It's like in part -- it's like initiation into their hate Trump club and to be a member you just have to hate everything. It's happening every single hour of every single day on every single news channel and in the mainstream media nonstop. That's all they do. That's their go to. And that is what now the media in this country has become and that's why I've been telling you since 2007 and 2008, journalism in America is dead, it's done. These so-called journalists, they don't care about truth anymore. Facts be damned, evidence be damned, because if they did care about truth, then they would actually start doing their job. If they would be investigating massive scandals that are staring them right in the face, they could win the Pulitzer Prizes they are dreaming about.  None of what we are about to tell you is important to the media, but it all should be. They are not doing their job. It's about the system of justice in America. It's now hanging in the balance, equal application under the law. The media ignores this, why? Because they need their Trump hate addiction fixed. An explosive report, The Hill's John Solomon revealing that written FBI documents show, agents working on the Clinton email investigation all believe laws were broken.  In addition, 17 witnesses interviewed after James Comey already drafted the exoneration statement of Hillary. The fix was in, it was rigged. It was exoneration before investigation. We have even more proof. Does the media even care about it, or are they spreading their Trump-Russia conspiracy theories? Is that more important after a year of no facts and a year of anonymous sources? How about Trump-hating and Clinton-loving FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend Lisa Page, completely trashing President Trump on text messages. They called him a lonesome human being, an idiot and Strzok and Paige also talked about an insurance policy in Andy's office, which we believe is the Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe incase Donald Trump won the election, and remember it was Strzok and Comey, they are the ones that chased the verbiage in the exoneration letter before the investigation was done. None of this is important to the media? It should be.   Special council of Robert Mueller, his merry team of Democratic generous donors, they don't donate to Republicans, 50 grand to Democrats, including Hillary and Barack Obama. And of course none of them gave to President Trump's campaign. One of Mueller's lead investigator's Jeannie Rhee actually represented Clinton and the Clinton Foundation in 2015. You can't get a bigger conflict of interest, nothing from the media. We have Mueller's top prosecutor, the expert Andrew Wiseman, the professional he is. He led the extremely controversial obstruction of justice case against Arthur Andersen Accounting as part of the Enron scandal. He destroyed that company, cost tens of thousands of people their jobs and was overturned in the U.S. Supreme Court in 0590. That's a great guy to put on your team. He also sent four Merrill Lynch executives to jail. Their convictions were also overturned, that case by the fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.  Does the media not care about any of this? If it was a bunch of Republican donors giving donations to Trump, investigating Hillary Clinton, don't you think it would be the biggest story ever? Really?  Next, of course, you have the demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr, his wife Nellie. Bruce Ohr meets with members of Fusion GPS before and after the 2016 election and Nellie his wife, Nellie Ohr worked for the firm that Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid to produce the fake, phony propaganda Russian anti-Trump dossier. And then finally, the FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and his wife Jill get 700 grand from a long-time Clinton ally. Former Virginia Governor Terry McCullough, democrats, all that money given for a failed Virginia state senate run; that is an astronomical sum in a senate race in Virginia. These are all individually massive stories. Not even mentioning Uranium One about let's see, bribery, extortion, money laundering, kickbacks and they knew it before CFIUS, before nine separate agencies approved of giving 20 percent of our Uranium, knowing that Vladimir Putin's thugs were in America trying to get a foothold into the uranium industry in our country? We don't have enough, we need more. It's insane. Then you look at the money behind that. You have mountains of evidence here of wrongdoing. They media is not touching any of it. Why? Because the media is infatuated, they cannot control themselves anymore, and it's all about hating President Trump. It's kind of like a sickness, it doesn't have a cure, apparently never will. They can't see anything else. That is their singular focus. Even, by the way, they would prefer kissing the rings and backsides of dictators. The media is betraying you, the American people.   You would think the press -- you would think they would have some sort of ethical compass, something that would move them towards truth, but they are now so corrupted, morally bankrupt, they hate any and everybody that doesn't do it their way. The media tonight, they are hyperventilating again, foaming at the mouth -- the back and forth between President Trump, former White House adviser Steve Bannon -- President Trump responding to comments, Bannon apparently made it is soon to be released book by Michael Wolff.  Here's the thing, the media loves, loves Steve Bannon for the moment. They love when Republicans or conservatives are fighting and create a circular firing squad. In real life, they hate Bannon and they hate Trump, but right now they will be supportive of Steve Bannon if they think he's advancing their cause. They love these intramural fights. They love palace intrigue. They love to analyze who's up, who's down. It's another example; the media's priorities are so screwed up. When do they ever talk about you? When do they ever about making your life better, your kids' lives better? Here's another thing that I've said before -- anyone who works in the White House, they are there to serve the country and the president. That's it -- and the American people. That should be the main goal; people asking me all day today, what do you think about this? I think this. I think the agenda of the American people is point one, two, three, four and a thousand and that should be the focus of everybody.  This isn't going to be a story in 48 hours. Instead of blowing this out of proportion like the media always does, maybe they should be focused on this. Look at this painting by John McNaughton, a guy that's out in Utah, great guy, great painter. I bought that original painting. See that guy sitting on the bench? He represents -- that's called, \"The Forgotten Man\" painting. It represents the forgotten men and women in this country, all those people in poverty, all those people and food stamps. All those people that don't have jobs, we should be focused on creating jobs, energy independence, securing our borders, fighting back against radical Islamists, rebuilding the military. That's where my focus is.  Joining us now, with Reaction, former Deputy Assistant to the President, Fox News contributor, and Sebastian Gorka; former Arkansas Governor, Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. He will be the headline Dr. Gorka, Hannity says media is like drug addicts. And you know what? I do. Because they wake up every day and they've got to hate this President and they have ignored so much, what do you think is going on?",

And a lot of them actually go into rehab and they get better. The press never gets better, they keep getting worse. They've become more obsessed with the destruction of Donald Trump than they are with the building up of America. This is a President who has had a remarkable year. Oh yes, he says some things and tweets that drives everybody off the ranch, but the truth is our economy is better, our security is better, we are trusted by nations that hated us before and didn't trust us. The Middle East is rapidly changing in a positive way. He's had the guts to stand up for the Iranian people against their autocratic totalitarian brutal terroristic government and they can't see any of that. Drug addicts sometimes have good days.

She said, \"The fight is everything.\" It's not about the truth, it's not about America and if you love America like this President does, like his family does, then you are the problem. Remember, leadership has been reasserted whether it's with little Kim and North Korea, whether it's in NATO, whether it's in the Middle East, or whether it's in Jerusalem.

      "utterance": "All right thanks, Tucker. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Breaking news tonight, the media is going nuclear; they're melting down on the way we've never seen before. Why? Because your president dared to stand up to the North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un who was threatening us, and we will explain how hating Trump is the media's drug, they are drug addicts, complete addicts. And we will show you the most insane, unhinged examples the latest liberal media freak out. Plus, media giddy tonight over the back and forth between President Trump and Steve Bannon, and of course, that's who they are. They love them fighting. My exclusive take tonight, all that and more in our breaking news opening monologue. We'll start tonight -- an important monologue on the mainstream media. Here is what I want to explain to you. Hating President Trump is their drug in the media. And by the way, to them it's more addictive than heroin and crack cocaine. Let me explain. Because in the liberal media bubble, a Trump tweet literally sends them into orbit, Alka-Seltzer in water, they bubble and fizz every day. It's like a dopamine rush to their brains, the drug is that powerful, they can't duplicate it any other way. Let me tell you how it works. President Trump, he usually tweets to get around the media and their twisted, distorted fake news coverage. And rightly so goes directly to you, the American people, and a lot of times with humor, they can't recognize. The media then promptly proceeds, they rush to the airwaves and they try and outdo each other feigning more outrage than the other one. Here's the latest example. Watch; just watch how the media reacted to President Trump's recent tweets. You can't make this up."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Really? President Trump is demented. Let's see, because he was responding to a nuclear threat from North Korea? Not only are they all a bunch of sheep, you notice they all say pretty much the same thing. But they are drug addicts in this sense; they crave their next Trump tweet. They need their fix and if, for some reason, there is not a tweet within 24 hours, there's not a comment, there's no fake outrage, well then they have to latch on to something that will satisfy their craving. They just race back to their gateway drug -- oh Trump, Russia, Trump, Russia. But with the Trump-Russia collusion story now falling flat, that's kind of like the equivalent of methadone, it's only a maintenance drug that barely separates them from like a padded room and some asylum somewhere. And for over a year you have been subjected to Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, collusion, collusion. The only thing missing are facts, facts, facts. And the media desperately repeating those words daily, hoping that somehow, if they say it enough it's going to come true. Here's the problem, it's not true. There is to date zero evidence President Trump colluded with Russia, none -- whatsoever. It doesn't exist. So the media now, they need a new conspiracy theory that they can pass off as news to get themselves, well, back on their drug, get hooked again. And it's actually in one sense it's sad, because these people really need help. They have no -- let's say, they don't want to adhere to truth anymore. That's a sad thing. If you think about it for a second. Does the media ever -- when you watch the news, do they ever talk about anything Donald Trump that he did is good, any good news, any good news with the economy? Or they're just obsessed with tearing this president down because they never thought he'd win. Do they ever talk about the American people, solutions for healthcare, getting people out of poverty, off of food stamps, back to work? I never hear it. If the media really cared about anything of real importance, then guess what, they would have to alter their constructive worship sites of Obama during his failed presidency. And by the way, in those years they would have seen the millions or more Americans in poverty and on food stamps, they would have stood up for you, but liking Obama was more important. President Trump's tweets about North Korea, let's get into this. They are perfect examples. What did the president say that is so dangerous that you see them unleashed like they did in the last 24 hours? Let's see, he stood up to a two bit murdering dictator and he called the little rocket man and he said that the United States is not going to be intimidated by his little red button on his desk. And for the media, that kind of leadership, they don't like it. It's not good enough since what they are used to and what they personally support are the policies of appeasement. So we have to ask, is there anything that President Trump could do to make the media ever happy in the situation with Kim Jong Un? By the way, a situation Bill Clinton put us in. Now the press probably wants President Trump -- maybe they would be happy if he got down on his knees and kissed Kim Jong Un's ring on his little hand. Then they would be calling for him to get the Nobel Prize. Or maybe the media would be happy if Trump gave billions of dollars in fuel subsidies to North Korea like Bill Clinton did. Or maybe Trump should suck up and grovel to Kim Jong Un just like Bill Clinton sucked up and groveled to Kim Jong-il, his father. Then Donald Trump could go on TV like Bill Clinton did and tell you the American people a massive lie like this."

The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. South Korea with support from Japan and other nations will bear most of the cost with providing North Korea with fuel to make up for the nuclear energy it is losing. And they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons. The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so, will North Korea fully join the community of nations."

I've said this many times. They are lazy and they are overpaid and they are a bunch of sycophants that all re-tweet each other in their little media bubble. The sky is literally falling down for these people all because Donald Trump cared to stand up and challenge a murdering dictator. The media lives in this bubble. These people are stepping all over themselves. They want to all outdo each other. It's like a competition. Let's see who can be the most anti-Trump and if one liberal media personalities that President Trump is demented, and then another has to step in and say no, he's really, really demented, and he's really, really a big, big, big, big liar and it goes on from there. See what I mean by drug addiction? It's like in part -- it's like initiation into their hate Trump club and to be a member you just have to hate everything. It's happening every single hour of every single day on every single news channel and in the mainstream media nonstop. That's all they do. That's their go to. And that is what now the media in this country has become and that's why I've been telling you since 2007 and 2008, journalism in America is dead, it's done. These so-called journalists, they don't care about truth anymore. Facts be damned, evidence be damned, because if they did care about truth, then they would actually start doing their job. If they would be investigating massive scandals that are staring them right in the face, they could win the Pulitzer Prizes they are dreaming about. None of what we are about to tell you is important to the media, but it all should be. They are not doing their job. It's about the system of justice in America. It's now hanging in the balance, equal application under the law. The media ignores this, why? Because they need their Trump hate addiction fixed. An explosive report, The Hill's John Solomon revealing that written FBI documents show, agents working on the Clinton email investigation all believe laws were broken. In addition, 17 witnesses interviewed after James Comey already drafted the exoneration statement of Hillary. The fix was in, it was rigged. It was exoneration before investigation. We have even more proof. Does the media even care about it, or are they spreading their Trump-Russia conspiracy theories? Is that more important after a year of no facts and a year of anonymous sources? How about Trump-hating and Clinton-loving FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend Lisa Page, completely trashing President Trump on text messages. They called him a lonesome human being, an idiot and Strzok and Paige also talked about an insurance policy in Andy's office, which we believe is the Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe incase Donald Trump won the election, and remember it was Strzok and Comey, they are the ones that chased the verbiage in the exoneration letter before the investigation was done. None of this is important to the media? It should be. Special council of Robert Mueller, his merry team of Democratic generous donors, they don't donate to Republicans, 50 grand to Democrats, including Hillary and Barack Obama. And of course none of them gave to President Trump's campaign. One of Mueller's lead investigator's Jeannie Rhee actually represented Clinton and the Clinton Foundation in 2015. You can't get a bigger conflict of interest, nothing from the media. We have Mueller's top prosecutor, the expert Andrew Wiseman, the professional he is. He led the extremely controversial obstruction of justice case against Arthur Andersen Accounting as part of the Enron scandal. He destroyed that company, cost tens of thousands of people their jobs and was overturned in the U.S. Supreme Court in 0590. That's a great guy to put on your team. He also sent four Merrill Lynch executives to jail. Their convictions were also overturned, that case by the fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Does the media not care about any of this? If it was a bunch of Republican donors giving donations to Trump, investigating Hillary Clinton, don't you think it would be the biggest story ever? Really? Next, of course, you have the demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr, his wife Nellie. Bruce Ohr meets with members of Fusion GPS before and after the 2016 election and Nellie his wife, Nellie Ohr worked for the firm that Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid to produce the fake, phony propaganda Russian anti-Trump dossier. And then finally, the FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and his wife Jill get 700 grand from a long-time Clinton ally. Former Virginia Governor Terry McCullough, democrats, all that money given for a failed Virginia state senate run; that is an astronomical sum in a senate race in Virginia. These are all individually massive stories. Not even mentioning Uranium One about let's see, bribery, extortion, money laundering, kickbacks and they knew it before CFIUS, before nine separate agencies approved of giving 20 percent of our Uranium, knowing that Vladimir Putin's thugs were in America trying to get a foothold into the uranium industry in our country? We don't have enough, we need more. It's insane. Then you look at the money behind that. You have mountains of evidence here of wrongdoing. They media is not touching any of it. Why? Because the media is infatuated, they cannot control themselves anymore, and it's all about hating President Trump. It's kind of like a sickness, it doesn't have a cure, apparently never will. They can't see anything else. That is their singular focus. Even, by the way, they would prefer kissing the rings and backsides of dictators. The media is betraying you, the American people. You would think the press -- you would think they would have some sort of ethical compass, something that would move them towards truth, but they are now so corrupted, morally bankrupt, they hate any and everybody that doesn't do it their way. The media tonight, they are hyperventilating again, foaming at the mouth -- the back and forth between President Trump, former White House adviser Steve Bannon -- President Trump responding to comments, Bannon apparently made it is soon to be released book by Michael Wolff. Here's the thing, the media loves, loves Steve Bannon for the moment. They love when Republicans or conservatives are fighting and create a circular firing squad. In real life, they hate Bannon and they hate Trump, but right now they will be supportive of Steve Bannon if they think he's advancing their cause. They love these intramural fights. They love palace intrigue. They love to analyze who's up, who's down. It's another example; the media's priorities are so screwed up. When do they ever talk about you? When do they ever about making your life better, your kids' lives better? Here's another thing that I've said before -- anyone who works in the White House, they are there to serve the country and the president. That's it -- and the American people. That should be the main goal; people asking me all day today, what do you think about this? I think this. I think the agenda of the American people is point one, two, three, four and a thousand and that should be the focus of everybody. This isn't going to be a story in 48 hours. Instead of blowing this out of proportion like the media always does, maybe they should be focused on this. Look at this painting by John McNaughton, a guy that's out in Utah, great guy, great painter. I bought that original painting. See that guy sitting on the bench? He represents -- that's called, \"The Forgotten Man\" painting. It represents the forgotten men and women in this country, all those people in poverty, all those people and food stamps. All those people that don't have jobs, we should be focused on creating jobs, energy independence, securing our borders, fighting back against radical Islamists, rebuilding the military. That's where my focus is. Joining us now, with Reaction, former Deputy Assistant to the President, Fox News contributor, and Sebastian Gorka; former Arkansas Governor, Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee. He will be the headline Dr. Gorka, Hannity says media is like drug addicts. And you know what? I do. Because they wake up every day and they've got to hate this President and they have ignored so much, what do you think is going on?"

In the commercial breaks between the CNN segments, I think they are handing around a crack pipe of Trump hatred. The analogy is perfect. They need that dopamine dump because none of it is logical, as you've said for the last 11 months they haven't been able to say one positive thing about this President's work whether it's the stock market, the jobs, the securing the border, the defeating ISIS. None of it matters to them. It's all obsessive psychologically obsessive hatred of a man who they don't understand, and all the people who voted for him. They don't understand what happened on November the eighth, and they still don't get it today.

      "utterance": "Yes, you don't want this pie. But I have to disagree with both you and Dr. Gorka. Here's the reason. You said that the media are like drug addicts, and I think that's being very unkind to the drug addicts because I've known a lot of drug addicts, Sean. And a lot of them actually go into rehab and they get better. The press never gets better, they keep getting worse. They've become more obsessed with the destruction of Donald Trump than they are with the building up of America. This is a President who has had a remarkable year. Oh yes, he says some things and tweets that drives everybody off the ranch, but the truth is our economy is better, our security is better, we are trusted by nations that hated us before and didn't trust us. The Middle East is rapidly changing in a positive way. He's had the guts to stand up for the Iranian people against their autocratic totalitarian brutal terroristic government and they can't see any of that. Drug addicts sometimes have good days. I just don't know that the media is capable of having a good day, Sean, they're just not able."

It's no longer about really performing a public service. Journalism used to be about informing the American people so they can make the right judgments, especially when it comes to an election. The media has become like the Obama White House. Narrative is everything -- remember that dedication to Hillary's Master's Thesis. She said, \"The fight is everything.\" It's not about the truth, it's not about America and if you love America like this President does, like his family does, then you are the problem. Remember, leadership has been reasserted whether it's with little Kim and North Korea, whether it's in NATO, whether it's in the Middle East, or whether it's in Jerusalem. American leadership has been reasserted by Donald J. Trump and they can't stand it because for them we are the problem, America is the problem."

    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's disappointing in part because just a few days ago Steve Bannon was considered by the press to be unhinged. He's crazy, he's a wild man. Suddenly this guy Michael Wolff quotes him in a book saying terrible things about President Trump and now he's a hero. But I mean the only gig he's got of his future is perhaps being an occasional commentator at MSNBC, joining the other thumb suckers over there who just can't get enough of themselves. But Sean, the bottom line is this -- there are two things you give to someone when you were hired in a political context. You give them loyalty and you give them confidentiality. Those are the two virtues that are more important than anything else you can bring. And if you see how many people have maybe been at the administration, they've come out; they've had integrity whether it's Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, Sebastian Gorka -- there have been a number of people who came out -- and they didn't go out and trash the President or the other people they worked with at the White House. Steve Bannon said all along that the entire Russia investigation was a farce. Those are his words, \"A complete farce and there was no collusion.\""

Our friend Dan Bongino he didn't like it very much, he tweeted back, and independence isn't what you want, what you are asking for his omnipotence. Your hubris was her downfall, and continues to blind you. Dan Bongino joins us now, former secret service agent along with our other good friend, former economic advisor.
