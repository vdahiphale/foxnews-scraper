      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" I am not overstating this. This is literally now a tipping point in American history. Democrats and the media, they have no shame. Zero restraint, zero concern for truth, zero concern for innocent lives, and they are all too willing to destroy, all for political power. That's more important than what is truth and justice.  Now, we have one party in this country, it's about smears, slander, besmirchment, bludgeoning, and the media in this country, they are the willing accomplices and we've got the evidence tonight. They're using every dirty trick in the book to run out the clock on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.  Last week, they got their wish. The FBI performing a background check into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, his seventh background check. But already, they have moved to the goalpost, almost instantaneously. They want more investigations. Longer investigations and guess what? There are no testing out a brand-new accusations in the mainstream media.  What they are forgetting here is that this is a real man's life. A real family, real kids, for them, it's just a political game, a quest for power and attempt to wait it out for 36 days until the all-important midterm elections. We're going to break all of this down with all the information you need including a report from the independent prosecutor who questioned both Kavanaugh and Professor Ford. She is calling the allegations weak, uncorroborated. We also have a message tonight for Dianne Feinstein, whose dirty tricks are now being investigated. And as per usual, disgraced former FBI director, James Comey, he is trying to weigh in from the sidelines and once again siding with all of his friends in the Democratic Party and a brand-new NBC interview, an unmitigated disaster on so many levels. So, said tight, buckle up, it's time for our D.C. opening monologue.",

If you are the average American that works hard, plays by the rules, pays their taxes, raises their kids and serves the country every day, providing goods and services, good Americans need to step back tonight. This isn't about Republican, Democrat, or liberal at all.  With no due process, zero corroborating evidence, the left in America is now smearing an individual and they been doing it now for 15 consecutive days -- calling him evil, accusing him of being a serial rapist, a sexual predator, a violent drunk, a liar, a perjurer, and much more -- classic character assassination of a man who has served his country and has been in the spotlight for 40 years without a single whiff of misconduct until 15 days ago.   As we Americans now, we better get this as a country right because the collective rush to judgment, getting rid of all the presumption of innocence and due process, it is a clear and present danger to all of you, to every American. And tonight, at a huge rally in Johnson City, Tennessee, President Trump stood up for his Supreme Court nominee, and the pillar of what is America's justice system, the presumption of innocence. Let's watch the president.",

      "sentences": "I just lie like I always did. Now, tonight, the FBI's background check unto Professor Ford, these are all important facts we've got to remember. It is well underway.   But Rachel Mitchell, remember the independent prosecutor hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee to question both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, well, she's already released her report to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In these findings, they are devastating, this is what she says.  A he said, she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that.  Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations are failed to cooperate them. Now, for the reasons discussed below, I do not think any reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee. And the prosecutor went on to list multiple issues where Professor Ford's accusations, including no consistent account of when the alleged assault actually happened, a failure to previously identified Judge Kavanaugh as the assailant, inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault, a failure to remember key details including who invited Ford to the party, how she got to the party, where the party even took place, and how she got home from the party.  She does however remember unrelated details like the consumption of exactly one beer and that she took no medication that day.  Another issue listed by prosecutors surrounds the fact that Ford's allegations have been corroborated by nobody, including a lifelong friend.  And Dr. Ford also struggled to recall recent events related to her accusation, including the date of a polygraph test. Now, there are also inconsistencies with Ford's psychological trauma claims, including her alleged fear of flying. That despite the fact that she flies frequently and many of her hobbies involve flying all over the world.  And Rachel Mitchell also reported, the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr. Ford's attorneys likely affected Dr. Ford's account. It is important to remember that Senator Feinstein -- this is where we get into facts matter. Corroboration matters. She mentioned these four people, none of them corroborated her story, including an alleged eyewitness to the incident.   And Dianne Feinstein played politics with Professor Ford's very serious claims from the very beginning. She knew about this in July. And last week, Senate Democrats demanding an FBI investigation, but Feinstein and her colleagues have known about this, as I said, since July, where is their calls for an investigation into Keith Ellison? Or for that matter, Juanita Broaddrick and Bill Clinton? Why didn't Senator Feinstein ask Kavanaugh about these allegations when they met personally, while -- at the very same time she's advising Professor Ford on what attorney to hire?  Instead of contacting her with a qualified, experienced, nonpartisan lawyer, well, Feinstein suggested what turns out to be a partisan left- winger, big time Democratic donor named Debra Katz, once proclaimed on national TV she would resist President Trump. She dismissed Paula Jones -- oh, it was only 10 to 12 minutes. Excuse me. He exposed himself, Bill Clinton, at the time. That was the allegation. And then she defended creepy Senator Al Franken. And according to a report from The Washington Free Bacon tonight, one of Katz's close friends is now searching for anyone willing to come forward against Kavanaugh, they are sending out emails to people, literally soliciting people as late as last week.   Now, if Feinstein cared about getting to the truth, why suggest a Democratic hack that's inconsistent on one is a serious issue today? And meanwhile, even though Professor Ford requested her name remain private, it was leaked, because congressional Democrats were the only officials with access to her story and Senate Republicans are a now vowing, rightly so, to investigate Dianne Feinstein and the Democrats' handling of this case. Of course, Senator Feinstein is denying any responsibility for the leak but earlier today, president Trump called out the senator for her shameless political tactics and they were shameless.

And Democrats are continuing their political stall tactic. Last week, it was a narrow investigation, limited to only a week. Now, despite President Trump ordering the FBI to investigate any and all legitimate claims, it's still not enough for the left.  They want FBI investigations into every single claim made against Kavanaugh no matter how unsubstantiated and some are even calling for investigations into whether or not Kavanaugh lied about how much you drink in high school.  He said sometimes he drank a lot, like a lot of kids in high school and college.  Now, that's called moving the goalpost, that's called changing the game in the middle of it. And as we've been saying for months, they want to stall the nomination, they want the midterm elections. These facts all matter because 36 days, you, we, the people, if you want to put these people in power, they want to impeach the president, endless investigation, they want their crumbs back, they want open borders, they want to keep Obamacare.  And, of course, if the FBI does extend the investigation of the second and third accuser, well, we already know about the second accuser and we find again unsubstantiated claims from a woman who is claiming that Kavanaugh may have exposed himself to her at her drunken college party when he was a college freshman. She doesn't really remember. In fact, she said she wasn't totally sure if Kavanaugh was the perpetrator. She called around, according to The New York Times, to see if they remember the incident, whether it was him, they did not. She even acknowledges that she has significant memory gaps from that evening. \"The New York Times\" refused to report the story because of the lack of evidence.  And, of course, there is the third accuser, here name is Julie Swetnick.  In this case, the FBI is likely to find a lot of inconsistencies from her wild allegations. Remember, she is claiming Kavanaugh was involved in the serial drugging and gang rape scheme and the '80s that happen almost every weekend. And she went to attend these parties. And today, Swetnick represented by the all famous seeking attorney, Michael Avenatti, the new face of the Democratic Party, sat down with NBC news in what turned out for NBC by the end of the day to be a disaster.

The same NBC News that sat on that interview with Juanita Broaddrick when she was making rape allegations about Bill Clinton, they refused to air it for over a month all because they said it couldn't be corroborated. They needed time to vet at. NBC should -- this is a disgrace. This is not news. This is them letting an individual make uncorroborated claims and then just airing it. Here they are running totally unverified, uncorroborated claims against Judge Kavanaugh and multiple inconsistencies yet again. Are there any new standards over there? Should we at all be surprised?  This is now an unmitigated disaster for NBC News.  By the way, Tom Brokaw, if you are watching, if somebody calls you in three minutes, would you air this? You need to speak out publicly. You spend your whole life trying to build that brand. All three of these stories do have one thing in common: zero corroborating evidence, outright denials of so-called witnesses and many inconsistencies.  After all, this is how your mainstream media is now treating the ongoing Supreme Court battle. This weekend, a cartoonist drew this vile depiction of Judge Kavanaugh's young daughter praying for her, quote, angry, lying, alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr. Ford. Never made it into a newspaper. The cartoonist published it online on his own. Did not return our request for comment, shocking.  And then there's the media darling James Comey. He, of course is calling for an unlimited time frame for FBI investigations and bashing anybody did -- get this -- you won't sit down with FBI investigators. Writing, quote, most people will speak to the FBI, refusal to do so is it some kind of statement. And I'm thinking, really? Asked General Flynn and George Papadopoulos about speaking to the FBI, that literally worked out perfect for them. In the case of even General Flynn, they didn't think he lied. He was charged with lying. Now, when you see all of these antique Kavanaugh offense and people like Jim Comey asking for more information, when you see people rushing to judgment, when you see Democrats demanding more and more investigations, you've got to remember this one clear point and this is what matters tonight, this is all about politics. It's now about power. It's not about the truth. Democrats have been against Kavanaugh publicly from the day he was announced. No matter what this investigation finds, they're never going to vote for him anyway, they never were. It's likely every single important event in modern history. This is a matter that we better get right. If you don't have evidence, and you are going to rush to judgment, and you're going to have zero presumption of innocence, by the way, this is not the first time. Ferguson, Missouri, Richard Jewell, Baltimore, Maryland, Cambridge police, Duke lacrosse, UVA rape allegations, now Judge Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas? We have a party of smear, slander, lies, and no due process, none. This shouldn't be political. And all their left-wing friends in the mainstream media, the deep state, are backing them up, all along the way.  There is no life they are not willing to destroy for power, no reputation they won't defile, no process they want corrupt at this point, no issue they won't politicize. And that means there is no shame. Their actions are literally, as we speak, reprehensible, and we've got a lot to get to tonight.

I am a baby compared to him in terms of the knowledge. \"Jesus is Risen: Paul and the Early Church.\" It's out tomorrow. My friend David Limbaugh, yes, he has done legal work for me like everybody else because I'm in a lot of legal trouble all the time apparently. Let me start, David, with you, and I break down in every single case here, there is no corroboration. We watched Julie Swetnick tonight literally reverse herself on key details that she made in a statement that her lawyer released last week. The same thing with Ms. Ramirez, we have problems with her story. We read all of the inconsistencies of Professor Ford's story, and again, no corroboration there. Are we getting rid of due process and presumption of innocence now? DAVID LIMBAUGH, \"JESUS IS RISEN\" AUTHOR: Well, obviously, this isn't a criminal proceeding, where those guarantees are attached. But as Jonathan Turley said, they still apply by analogy. It's a tradition in this country that people who are accused of these kinds of activities should get a presumption of innocence and the accuser should have to produce evidence or credible evidence. Nobody is denying -- well, some people are denying -- I don't deny the sincerity of Dr. Ford but it seems like she is troubled. And there are some inconsistencies in her testimony. I'm not even -- my quarrel isn't with Dr. Ford, who I believe is in good faith. My quarrel is with the Democrats who are lying in wait to ambush any nominee who is a constitutionalist because they want judges on the Supreme Court, justices, who will legislate their political liberal agenda.  And it's horrendous. They have no moral or ethical standing. And so my real thrust here is for feckless conservatives, feckless Republicans to, naive Republicans, accommodating Republicans to realize why President Trump is so popular and it is because a feckless conservatism isn't impotent conservatism. We are in existential war our struggle or whatever you want to call it, for the future of this country and the Democrats are relentlessly pursuing their agenda. They will do anything they can to thwart President Trump's appointments. This idea that they are doing this to find the facts is just ridiculous.",

The idea that there are various reports over the weekend that he is restricting the FBI probe of Judge Kavanaugh. He said absolutely not. That the FBI is moving quickly and intensively and he is staying out of the way. In fact, they started their work Friday after the Senate compromised and the president says they work through the weekend. In fact, we learned a short time ago that Kavanaugh friends Mark Judge has already talk to the FBI, though his lawyer says they have not completed that. He is going to talk some more. Remember, he has already said he doesn't remember anything about Dr. Ford's allegations. The Senate deal by Republican Jeff Flake and Democrat Chris Coons led to a one-week pause so they could focus on what is called current and credible allegations like the charge from Dr. Ford. Not nuance with a deadline for the FBI this upcoming Friday. But Coons cracked the door open to expanding this, saying he cannot control new allegations. Sure enough other unverified charges have been popping up. Tonight a Washington Post story quoting a former Yale classmate saying that Kavanaugh was a violent drunk. The White House tonight releasing a long statement from two of his classmates, saying that it is grossly untrue. Republican Mitch McConnell charge the Democrats are trying to move the goalpost beyond Friday so that they can keep investigating Kavanaugh. Sure enough, Democrat Richard Blumenthal suggests they should go on longer. He falsely charged that the White House is micromanaging the FBI probe. So the president at the Rose Garden news conference fired back. He said that's not true. He said, he'll do what the Senate wants in terms of this playing out. And he ripped into Blumenthal by nothing he lied about his service in Vietnam. Sean?",

Zero restraint, zero concern for truth, zero concern for innocent lives, and they are all too willing to destroy, all for political power. That's more important than what is truth and justice. Now, we have one party in this country, it's about smears, slander, besmirchment, bludgeoning, and the media in this country, they are the willing accomplices and we've got the evidence tonight. They're using every dirty trick in the book to run out the clock on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. Last week, they got their wish. The FBI performing a background check into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, his seventh background check. But already, they have moved to the goalpost, almost instantaneously. They want more investigations. Longer investigations and guess what? There are no testing out a brand-new accusations in the mainstream media. What they are forgetting here is that this is a real man's life. A real family, real kids, for them, it's just a political game, a quest for power and attempt to wait it out for 36 days until the all-important midterm elections. We're going to break all of this down with all the information you need including a report from the independent prosecutor who questioned both Kavanaugh and Professor Ford. She is calling the allegations weak, uncorroborated. We also have a message tonight for Dianne Feinstein, whose dirty tricks are now being investigated. And as per usual, disgraced former FBI director, James Comey, he is trying to weigh in from the sidelines and once again siding with all of his friends in the Democratic Party and a brand-new NBC interview, an unmitigated disaster on so many levels. So, said tight, buckle up, it's time for our D.C. opening monologue."

This isn't about Republican, Democrat, or liberal at all. With no due process, zero corroborating evidence, the left in America is now smearing an individual and they been doing it now for 15 consecutive days -- calling him evil, accusing him of being a serial rapist, a sexual predator, a violent drunk, a liar, a perjurer, and much more -- classic character assassination of a man who has served his country and has been in the spotlight for 40 years without a single whiff of misconduct until 15 days ago. As we Americans now, we better get this as a country right because the collective rush to judgment, getting rid of all the presumption of innocence and due process, it is a clear and present danger to all of you, to every American. And tonight, at a huge rally in Johnson City, Tennessee, President Trump stood up for his Supreme Court nominee, and the pillar of what is America's justice system, the presumption of innocence.

      "utterance": "I just lie like I always did. Now, tonight, the FBI's background check unto Professor Ford, these are all important facts we've got to remember. It is well underway. But Rachel Mitchell, remember the independent prosecutor hired by the Senate Judiciary Committee to question both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, well, she's already released her report to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In these findings, they are devastating, this is what she says.  A he said, she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that. Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refuted her allegations are failed to cooperate them. Now, for the reasons discussed below, I do not think any reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee. And the prosecutor went on to list multiple issues where Professor Ford's accusations, including no consistent account of when the alleged assault actually happened, a failure to previously identified Judge Kavanaugh as the assailant, inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault, a failure to remember key details including who invited Ford to the party, how she got to the party, where the party even took place, and how she got home from the party. She does however remember unrelated details like the consumption of exactly one beer and that she took no medication that day. Another issue listed by prosecutors surrounds the fact that Ford's allegations have been corroborated by nobody, including a lifelong friend.  And Dr. Ford also struggled to recall recent events related to her accusation, including the date of a polygraph test. Now, there are also inconsistencies with Ford's psychological trauma claims, including her alleged fear of flying. That despite the fact that she flies frequently and many of her hobbies involve flying all over the world. And Rachel Mitchell also reported, the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr. Ford's attorneys likely affected Dr. Ford's account. It is important to remember that Senator Feinstein -- this is where we get into facts matter. Corroboration matters. She mentioned these four people, none of them corroborated her story, including an alleged eyewitness to the incident. And Dianne Feinstein played politics with Professor Ford's very serious claims from the very beginning. She knew about this in July. And last week, Senate Democrats demanding an FBI investigation, but Feinstein and her colleagues have known about this, as I said, since July, where is their calls for an investigation into Keith Ellison? Or for that matter, Juanita Broaddrick and Bill Clinton? Why didn't Senator Feinstein ask Kavanaugh about these allegations when they met personally, while -- at the very same time she's advising Professor Ford on what attorney to hire? Instead of contacting her with a qualified, experienced, nonpartisan lawyer, well, Feinstein suggested what turns out to be a partisan left- winger, big time Democratic donor named Debra Katz, once proclaimed on national TV she would resist President Trump. She dismissed Paula Jones -- oh, it was only 10 to 12 minutes. Excuse me. He exposed himself, Bill Clinton, at the time. That was the allegation. And then she defended creepy Senator Al Franken. And according to a report from The Washington Free Bacon tonight, one of Katz's close friends is now searching for anyone willing to come forward against Kavanaugh, they are sending out emails to people, literally soliciting people as late as last week. Now, if Feinstein cared about getting to the truth, why suggest a Democratic hack that's inconsistent on one is a serious issue today? And meanwhile, even though Professor Ford requested her name remain private, it was leaked, because congressional Democrats were the only officials with access to her story and Senate Republicans are a now vowing, rightly so, to investigate Dianne Feinstein and the Democrats' handling of this case. Of course, Senator Feinstein is denying any responsibility for the leak but earlier today, president Trump called out the senator for her shameless political tactics and they were shameless. Take a look."

If she wanted a really thorough investigation, we had all the time in the world.  She didn't have to wait until after the hearing was closed, essentially.  She should have said, listen, I have a problem. I have this report. I'd like the FBI to look at it while we are doing the hearings. We have two months. For the Democrats to be talking about, we want more time for the FBI, if you wanted more time for the FBI, why didn't Dianne Feinstein bring this up?"

      "utterance": "Why didn't she? America deserves an answer to that question.  And why didn't she tell her Republican colleagues, say, oh, we need time, we can rush this? We have plenty of time. And Democrats are continuing their political stall tactic. Last week, it was a narrow investigation, limited to only a week. Now, despite President Trump ordering the FBI to investigate any and all legitimate claims, it's still not enough for the left. They want FBI investigations into every single claim made against Kavanaugh no matter how unsubstantiated and some are even calling for investigations into whether or not Kavanaugh lied about how much you drink in high school.  He said sometimes he drank a lot, like a lot of kids in high school and college. Now, that's called moving the goalpost, that's called changing the game in the middle of it. And as we've been saying for months, they want to stall the nomination, they want the midterm elections. These facts all matter because 36 days, you, we, the people, if you want to put these people in power, they want to impeach the president, endless investigation, they want their crumbs back, they want open borders, they want to keep Obamacare. And, of course, if the FBI does extend the investigation of the second and third accuser, well, we already know about the second accuser and we find again unsubstantiated claims from a woman who is claiming that Kavanaugh may have exposed himself to her at her drunken college party when he was a college freshman. She doesn't really remember. In fact, she said she wasn't totally sure if Kavanaugh was the perpetrator. She called around, according to The New York Times, to see if they remember the incident, whether it was him, they did not. She even acknowledges that she has significant memory gaps from that evening. \"The New York Times\" refused to report the story because of the lack of evidence. And, of course, there is the third accuser, here name is Julie Swetnick.  In this case, the FBI is likely to find a lot of inconsistencies from her wild allegations. Remember, she is claiming Kavanaugh was involved in the serial drugging and gang rape scheme and the '80s that happen almost every weekend. And she went to attend these parties. And today, Swetnick represented by the all famous seeking attorney, Michael Avenatti, the new face of the Democratic Party, sat down with NBC news in what turned out for NBC by the end of the day to be a disaster.

This weekend, a cartoonist drew this vile depiction of Judge Kavanaugh's young daughter praying for her, quote, angry, lying, alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr. Ford. Never made it into a newspaper. The cartoonist published it online on his own. Did not return our request for comment, shocking. And then there's the media darling James Comey. He, of course is calling for an unlimited time frame for FBI investigations and bashing anybody did -- get this -- you won't sit down with FBI investigators. Writing, quote, most people will speak to the FBI, refusal to do so is it some kind of statement. And I'm thinking, really? Asked General Flynn and George Papadopoulos about speaking to the FBI, that literally worked out perfect for them. In the case of even General Flynn, they didn't think he lied. He was charged with lying. Now, when you see all of these antique Kavanaugh offense and people like Jim Comey asking for more information, when you see people rushing to judgment, when you see Democrats demanding more and more investigations, you've got to remember this one clear point and this is what matters tonight, this is all about politics. It's now about power. It's not about the truth. Democrats have been against Kavanaugh publicly from the day he was announced. No matter what this investigation finds, they're never going to vote for him anyway, they never were. It's likely every single important event in modern history. This is a matter that we better get right. If you don't have evidence, and you are going to rush to judgment, and you're going to have zero presumption of innocence, by the way, this is not the first time. Ferguson, Missouri, Richard Jewell, Baltimore, Maryland, Cambridge police, Duke lacrosse, UVA rape allegations, now Judge Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas? We have a party of smear, slander, lies, and no due process, none. This shouldn't be political. And all their left-wing friends in the mainstream media, the deep state, are backing them up, all along the way.  There is no life they are not willing to destroy for power, no reputation they won't defile, no process they want corrupt at this point, no issue they won't politicize. And that means there is no shame. Their actions are literally, as we speak, reprehensible, and we've got a lot to get to tonight.

The author -- by the way, a brand-new book, and I'm going to be releasing on foxnews.com my review of this book, because David Limbaugh has so inspired me and my life. I am a baby compared to him in terms of the knowledge. \"Jesus is Risen: Paul and the Early Church.\" It's out tomorrow. My friend David Limbaugh, yes, he has done legal work for me like everybody else because I'm in a lot of legal trouble all the time apparently. Let me start, David, with you, and I break down in every single case here, there is no corroboration. We watched Julie Swetnick tonight literally reverse herself on key details that she made in a statement that her lawyer released last week. The same thing with Ms. Ramirez, we have problems with her story. We read all of the inconsistencies of Professor Ford's story, and again, no corroboration there. Are we getting rid of due process and presumption of innocence now? DAVID LIMBAUGH, \"JESUS IS RISEN\" AUTHOR: Well, obviously, this isn't a criminal proceeding, where those guarantees are attached. But as Jonathan Turley said, they still apply by analogy. It's a tradition in this country that people who are accused of these kinds of activities should get a presumption of innocence and the accuser should have to produce evidence or credible evidence. Nobody is denying -- well, some people are denying -- I don't deny the sincerity of Dr. Ford but it seems like she is troubled. And there are some inconsistencies in her testimony. I'm not even -- my quarrel isn't with Dr. Ford, who I believe is in good faith. My quarrel is with the Democrats who are lying in wait to ambush any nominee who is a constitutionalist because they want judges on the Supreme Court, justices, who will legislate their political liberal agenda.  And it's horrendous. They have no moral or ethical standing. And so my real thrust here is for feckless conservatives, feckless Republicans to, naive Republicans, accommodating Republicans to realize why President Trump is so popular and it is because a feckless conservatism isn't impotent conservatism. We are in existential war our struggle or whatever you want to call it, for the future of this country and the Democrats are relentlessly pursuing their agenda. They will do anything they can to thwart President Trump's appointments. This idea that they are doing this to find the facts is just ridiculous."

But this, if she identifies an eye witness and the eyewitness contradicts what she says, that is just problematic. Without saying anything about her personally at all we cannot assume that people are guilty knowing that this is a tactic that is used in Supreme Court nominations and in political campaigns, often by people that don't care about the truth."

      "utterance": "Yes. We are separate, Hannity. Here's the bottom line. President Trump is pushing back today on what he essentially calling fake news. The idea that there are various reports over the weekend that he is restricting the FBI probe of Judge Kavanaugh. He said absolutely not. That the FBI is moving quickly and intensively and he is staying out of the way. In fact, they started their work Friday after the Senate compromised and the president says they work through the weekend. In fact, we learned a short time ago that Kavanaugh friends Mark Judge has already talk to the FBI, though his lawyer says they have not completed that. He is going to talk some more. Remember, he has already said he doesn't remember anything about Dr. Ford's allegations. The Senate deal by Republican Jeff Flake and Democrat Chris Coons led to a one-week pause so they could focus on what is called current and credible allegations like the charge from Dr. Ford. Not nuance with a deadline for the FBI this upcoming Friday. But Coons cracked the door open to expanding this, saying he cannot control new allegations. Sure enough other unverified charges have been popping up. Tonight a Washington Post story quoting a former Yale classmate saying that Kavanaugh was a violent drunk. The White House tonight releasing a long statement from two of his classmates, saying that it is grossly untrue. Republican Mitch McConnell charge the Democrats are trying to move the goalpost beyond Friday so that they can keep investigating Kavanaugh. Sure enough, Democrat Richard Blumenthal suggests they should go on longer. He falsely charged that the White House is micromanaging the FBI probe. So the president at the Rose Garden news conference fired back. He said that's not true. He said, he'll do what the Senate wants in terms of this playing out. And he ripped into Blumenthal by nothing he lied about his service in Vietnam. Sean?"
