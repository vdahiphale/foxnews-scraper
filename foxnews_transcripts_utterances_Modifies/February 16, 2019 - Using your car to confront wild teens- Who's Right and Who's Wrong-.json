Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign senior adviser, Katrina Pierson and RNC spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany. All right, ladies, so I had a problem with this POLITICO report because they said, you know, the Republicans, they are moving away from Nancy Pelosi as just demonizing her because they did that in the midterms. There are other women that are now coming up and they are making so much controversy with these radical proposals and things they are saying that are anti-Semitic and whatnot that Republicans are targeting them, but Republicans better be careful according to the media, Kayleigh because you don't want to ever criticize someone who is a female or a minority that might make you look mean."

KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: Oh, Jesse, there is no question about that and if Democrats don't want these individuals to be in the spotlight, they shouldn't be given prominent positions on committees and Kayleigh is right, there are serious issues with these individuals and it seems like, the Democrats thought they could package the anti-Semitism with a brown woman and expect there not to be criticism, but what Republicans know is that in the future elections, these races are going to be won at home on the ground. The people who are not watching cable news, they don't know the things that Kayleigh just said. We have to get those message to the people because most people don't know that Ilhan Omar, just three years ago went to a judge for leniency for individuals who either pled guilty or were tried and found guilty of supporting ISIS and she sits on the foreign intelligence committee."

But whatever the two told investigators appears to have been enough to change minds. The two men are apparently brothers. They are originally from Nigeria, and police say at least one of them worked with Smollett on the set of the Fox TV show \"Empire.\" And now, Jussie Smollett has reportedly hired a high-priced defense lawyer amid reports Chicago Police are looking into the theory that the entire attack may have been staged -- Jesse."
