In fact, in the book, we have a picture of a blood trail that somebody took that shows you how far I crawled before ultimately, my arms gave out and then at that moment, I just started to pray. The first thing that came to mind, I said, \"I'm just going to pray and put it in God's hands.\" And believe me God performed miracles that day, but uh he gave me an unbelievable sense of calm.

And my trauma surgeon told me later I wouldn't have made it to the hospital if not for that, for what Brad did, and then there was a few minutes of everybody -- colleagues of mine kind of coming around attending to me and then an ambulance finally got there and they transferred me initially to an ambulance.  That's kind of when I started to go out to kind of fade out and then, at some point, the ambulance is leaving, sees a helicopter coming and it's 7:30 in the morning in Northern Virginia as you know, I would have never made it to George Washington Hospital, which is where they're going to take me. I would have bled out.  So then they go to where the helicopter is landing on the ball field and sure enough, the helicopter had come to transport me away and they put me on that helicopter and four minutes later, I'm in the emergency room over at MedStar Hospital.

I actually showed up at the hospital with a zero blood pressure, which rarely does anybody make it out from that and then they had to put about 20 pints of blood in me. The human body takes about nine pints of blood, so I lost a lot of blood and then even as they were putting more in, I was - so many arteries that were shredded, so they finally sewed up each one individually and got me to a point where they could close me up again.

No country is close to us.   And by the way, those other countries have their own border protection. So good luck trying to walk into their country illegally.

There are some parts of that legal system that are very broken, but at the same time, we do know that there are bad people who are trying to come here and it's well documented.

A lot of people talk tough, but when it comes time to actually vote to secure the border, they're not there and even Americans who aren't maybe where you and I are on immigration law would still say, at a minimum secure the border. You know, what you do with different aspects of immigration policy is one thing, but securing America's border is critical to our national security. Not one Democrat was willing to vote yes.  LEVIN; But here's the problem. You've got Republicans out there. You've got the conservative base out there. You've got other people at this. Okay, we gave the Republicans the House. We know what the Democrats are. We know they don't support securing the border even though they did ten years ago. Now, they've decided it's not in their best interest. The Republicans can't cobble together the numbers that they need to send the bill to the Senate. True?",

We also by the way got regulations under control. The Obama era regulations were crushing not just the middle class they were killing manufacturing in America. We've completely reversed that working with this President and getting bills to his desk that he signed. The tax cut bill, not one Democrat voted with us, but yet we got a bill not since Ronald Reagan in 1986 have we had a tax reform bill get all the way to the President's desk and this one was incredibly historic. Cut taxes at every single level, made our country competitive again and we're reaping the rewards, and by the way the Federal government this year took in more money to the Treasury with those tax cuts for those people that would say tax cuts equal deficits, we took in more money this year than we ever have before. Obviously, we've got to get control over the mandatory side of spending, but we've gotten our economy back on track. We're finally seeing economic growth and we've rebuilt our military while getting regulations under control. Those are important things. There are definitely things that we haven't done and it's fair criticism to say, \"Okay, you didn't do this on immigration, on Obamacare you didn't repeal and replace it.\" We in the House passed the bill with one vote to spare to do it, it failed by one vote in the Senate. Fair criticism to say those things didn't get done, so there's more work left to do. But clearly, when you look at what we've done in the house working with this President incredibly historic things for our economy and our military. There's still more work to be done, but watch what Pelosi does when she's speaker and I think then people will recognize what the difference is.",

And you've highlighted this so many times so well over the years on what the Constitution is really all about. If you look at what's driving our debt, we spend probably 90% of our time talking about the discretionary side of budget, which includes defense. If you eliminated the whole Department of Defense, you'd still have a deficit, so don't act like that's the problem in Washington. Two thirds of our spending in Washington is what's called mandatory spending, things that we don't even vote on. It's Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Obamacare. And think about this, in one bill, in one bill that we passed to the Senate last year, with only a 51-vote requirement to repeal and replace Obamacare, we repealed Obamacare, got rid of that, actually put in place reforms to lower premiums, put you in charge your healthcare, protected people with pre-existing conditions. We did all of that and we turned Medicaid, which is one of the most broken forms of healthcare. We turned Medicaid over to the states to run and we put Medicaid on a budget. We didn't cut Medicaid spending like Democrats would say, we just slowed the growth. So only in Washington, you know, if you were going to get an 8% increase and you get a 3% increase, you've still got an increase and they call it a cut. Just that alone would have saved over $800 billion and improved healthcare outcomes for families all across the country. Oh and by the way, Medicare, if we do nothing, if we don't touch it, it's set to go bankrupt in eight years. I think that would be irresponsible to let it go bust. We have a plan by the way to save Medicare from bankruptcy. Democrats don't even want to talk about that, but if you just look at the healthcare bill alone, two of the big four mandatory spending programs in one fell swoop, we could have dramatically reformed and helped us get to a balanced Federal budget.",

I mean, there were probably 15,000 people in the arena and another 15,000 outside knowing they couldn't get in, but just wanted to be there, which tells you the enthusiasm for this President has never been higher. I do think when it comes to 2020 and it's President Trump on the ballot against whatever far-left radical they nominate out of their 20 to 30- person primary, President Trump is going to do incredibly well because we've got a great economy. I think it's going to keep getting better and then ultimately, you're going to have a contrast that couldn't be clearer just like President Trump against Hillary Clinton, I think it's going to be a very similar situation in two years.",

I'm just kind of in a numbness trying to get away. So I crawled probably about 20 feet and then my arms gave out. In fact, in the book, we have a picture of a blood trail that somebody took that shows you how far I crawled before ultimately, my arms gave out and then at that moment, I just started to pray. The first thing that came to mind, I said, \"I'm just going to pray and put it in God's hands.\" And believe me God performed miracles that day, but uh he gave me an unbelievable sense of calm. Once I started praying it was almost like everything around me just kind of went into a background noise and I'm just in a one-on-one conversation with God at that point."

He's a doctor, but he's also - he was a combat surgeon in Iraq and he was watching me the whole time and he immediately came over and looked at where the damage was, put a tourniquet on it to stop the bleeding. And my trauma surgeon told me later I wouldn't have made it to the hospital if not for that, for what Brad did, and then there was a few minutes of everybody -- colleagues of mine kind of coming around attending to me and then an ambulance finally got there and they transferred me initially to an ambulance. That's kind of when I started to go out to kind of fade out and then, at some point, the ambulance is leaving, sees a helicopter coming and it's 7:30 in the morning in Northern Virginia as you know, I would have never made it to George Washington Hospital, which is where they're going to take me. I would have bled out. So then they go to where the helicopter is landing on the ball field and sure enough, the helicopter had come to transport me away and they put me on that helicopter and four minutes later, I'm in the emergency room over at MedStar Hospital. And again, I kind of was out and unconscious by the time I got on the helicopter, but I was starting to fade prior to that wondering am I even going to make it."

I actually showed up at the hospital with a zero blood pressure, which rarely does anybody make it out from that and then they had to put about 20 pints of blood in me. The human body takes about nine pints of blood, so I lost a lot of blood and then even as they were putting more in, I was - so many arteries that were shredded, so they finally sewed up each one individually and got me to a point where they could close me up again.

And so I'm trying to make some verbal signals to her and luckily, she knew what I was motioning and initially what I wanted to find out was Dave and Crystal, my two capital police security detail officers that were there with me that morning. I knew both of them were shot in the shootout. And you talk about real heroes and look, Mark, I identify in the book a lot of miracles that happened, but also the heroes that played a role in saving me and no bigger heroes than David Bailey and Crystal Griner who both risked their life, were shot at during the shootout and kept going after the shooter until they took him down.

So I know I'm lucky to be alive. If anything, it puts a real renewed focus on what's important in life. You know, all of us have things that we do every day and you know, you're following somebody else's schedule on certain things and then there's the things you really want to do and I've tried to remove some of the clutter in my life and focus on the things that really matter to me, which is you know, my faith and my family and the things I love doing.

I mean, that is as pure of evil as you can get and nobody should be compared to him, but at the same time, you see that they almost seem to try to desensitize it as if you disagree, it's okay to call somebody something that evil these days and we ought to be standing up against that and saying, \"Hold on a second.\" Look, if we disagree let's it at least be honest about why we disagree and try to win the argument. Margaret Thatcher said you know, first win the debate then when the vote, which means if you're losing the debate, you don't go and threaten the other person physically or try to call them a racist or a Nazi, you try to maybe make a better argument and these days, it almost seems like the cop- out is, just go say something so vitriolic that you try to shut down the debate. And you see this on a lot of college campuses, too, where they literally don't want conservative viewpoints if you're - you know, try going to Berkeley as a conservative. I mean, is that really what you're supposed to be about? Shouldn't you try to say, \"Look, go educate yourself.\" Let's hear all viewpoints and have enough confidence in your argument that you're going to win the day, but if you're so afraid of the other side's argument that you want to call them names to the point where you shut them down.

It's a big priority of mine. I'd like to see us get this done and we're in a fight with the other side, but at the same time when you look at this caravan coming across, you have in this caravan of people who have said we're going to ignore your laws and just storm across the border. There are over six hundred already known criminal convicts in the caravan when you look at some of the things they do to try to use women as human shields; again, it shows you what kind of people are really responsible for the caravan, but it's incredibly important that we secure our border and I applaud President Trump for being willing to do it because look, every single day this doesn't get mainstream media coverage and it should. Every single day in this country, at least ten known terrorists are captured trying to cross into America through our border. Why are we trying to secure the border? To keep America safe and it's not that everybody that comes here wants to seek the American dream. There's a legal way to do that and President Trump has said, even if you want to seek asylum, seek it the legal way. But if you're trying to break our laws and come over here when the President's saying we're going to secure the border, there's a reason he's fighting to keep this country safe because there really are bad people that try to come here."

When we come back. Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget most weeknights, you can watch me on Levin TV, Levin TV. Go to crtv.com/mark to sign up crtv.com/mark or give us a call at 844-LEVIN-TV, 844-LEVIN-TV. We'll be right back. Congressman Steve Scalise, so you've mentioned that 10 captures a day of potential terrorists on the southern border. Well, why wouldn't that compel the Democratic Party to be a little bit more supportive of building physical barriers on that southern border where we think we can build them?"

      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "And it's a good question, but it shows you there is a different mindset on the left. I mean, they truly believe in open borders. You know, this whole idea that just people want to come in, let them come on in and again, you can look at real numbers to know, there is a legal way to come here. By the way, Mark, we are the most generous nation in the world. Anybody that thinks we don't let people into our country, we let a million people into our country legally every single year, by far the most generous in the world. We have nothing to be ashamed of. No country is close to us. And by the way, those other countries have their own border protection. So good luck trying to walk into their country illegally. So what we say is, there's a way to come here legally. We ought to reform by the way. There are some parts of that legal system that are very broken, but at the same time, we do know that there are bad people who are trying to come here and it's well documented. And so if you want to come here legally, there's a legal way to come here and there are people by the way that have been waiting years. Ten, fifteen years in some cases to come to America, so what does it say if you're okay with letting somebody jump ahead of them in line, what are you telling those people that have done it the right way? That have played by the rules?"

You have red states going purple, purple states going blue because the Democrats would not be supporting open borders that they thought Republicans were pouring over the border. So that's a difficult mentality to deal with. But isn't there a problem even within your Republican caucus? I mean, don't you have a dozen, two dozen, three dozen Republicans who really are not necessarily that supportive of securing the border or at least securing in a way that matters?"

Most of our members have voted in one way or another to secure the border which includes building the wall. The difference is that you just have no support, not one Democrat. We brought two different bills on the House floor in the last few months to secure the border. We had over 220 Republicans who voted yes, not one Democrat voted yes and so clearly, the mentality on the other side is not to support securing the border. A lot of people talk tough, but when it comes time to actually vote to secure the border, they're not there and even Americans who aren't maybe where you and I are on immigration law would still say, at a minimum secure the border. You know, what you do with different aspects of immigration policy is one thing, but securing America's border is critical to our national security. Not one Democrat was willing to vote yes. LEVIN; But here's the problem. You've got Republicans out there. You've got the conservative base out there. You've got other people at this. Okay, we gave the Republicans the House. We know what the Democrats are. We know they don't support securing the border even though they did ten years ago. Now, they've decided it's not in their best interest. The Republicans can't cobble together the numbers that they need to send the bill to the Senate. True?"

We haven't coalesced around that and frankly, we've been working with the President on the best way to do it that he would support because you know the President has looked at it a number of different ways on this. The President wants to see the border properly secured and they get the $25 billion, it's not just $5 billion this year we're fighting for, you know and President Trump's made it clear at least give me the $5 billion this year to start building the wall out further. It's a long term project and it costs more money over the next four or five years, but at least let's start with you know, with this. And by the way, when Pelosi had a super majority in the House and Senate when they passed Obamacare, they could have done anything they wanted and they did. They didn't try to go and fix immigration policy. So when they right now try to use the left and use immigration and say, \"Oh look, you know, the Republicans don't care about you.\" They didn't care when they had everything. We've actually tried to solve this problem and not one Democrat stepped up to vote with us. When Pelosi controlled everything last time, she didn't bring a bill to the floor, not good or bad. We've at least brought bills to the floor."

We also by the way got regulations under control. The Obama era regulations were crushing not just the middle class they were killing manufacturing in America. We've completely reversed that working with this President and getting bills to his desk that he signed. The tax cut bill, not one Democrat voted with us, but yet we got a bill not since Ronald Reagan in 1986 have we had a tax reform bill get all the way to the President's desk and this one was incredibly historic. Cut taxes at every single level, made our country competitive again and we're reaping the rewards, and by the way the Federal government this year took in more money to the Treasury with those tax cuts for those people that would say tax cuts equal deficits, we took in more money this year than we ever have before. Obviously, we've got to get control over the mandatory side of spending, but we've gotten our economy back on track. We're finally seeing economic growth and we've rebuilt our military while getting regulations under control. Those are important things. There are definitely things that we haven't done and it's fair criticism to say, \"Okay, you didn't do this on immigration, on Obamacare you didn't repeal and replace it.\" We in the House passed the bill with one vote to spare to do it, it failed by one vote in the Senate. Fair criticism to say those things didn't get done, so there's more work left to do. But clearly, when you look at what we've done in the house working with this President incredibly historic things for our economy and our military. There's still more work to be done, but watch what Pelosi does when she's speaker and I think then people will recognize what the difference is."

It's getting bigger and bigger and in that context, I want to ask you if the House has a good relationship - working relationship with the Senate Republicans and Mitch McConnell. He's announced over and over again that they will not shut down the government. Now, I was around during the Reagan administration. He shut it down six times. Several years ago, on my radio show, Paul Ryan said they really - when we talk about a government shutdown, we're talking about 17% of the government, the vast majority of the government doesn't shut down. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Border Patrol, military, Federal Police, untouched and on and on and on. Is this a PR problem? Because it would seem every time the government is quote-unquote, shut down Republicans do okay and we just had a midterm election, so there's no election tomorrow and is the border wall a big enough issue to fight over this. We'll be right back."

Look, we just saw with this caravan, they were trying to attack and in some cases attacking our Border Patrol agents, throwing rocks, throwing other things at our Border Patrol agents and at law enforcement. And so the threat is real and the need to secure our nation - our nation's borders is real. If Chuck Schumer wants to shut down the government because he doesn't want to secure America's border, that's a fight that he's going to lose and he's lost one of these shutdowns before, so you know, at the end of the day, we need to secure our border and the American people again regardless of where you stand on immigration policy, most Americans believe we ought to secure the border."

And when not one of those bills can get it through the Senate because of that rule, it really makes it hard for us to follow through on the things we want to see done, but at the end of the day, those are the rules we've got to work with and so we still can work together to get big things done and a classic example of that is the tax cut bill."

It's barely been talked about,\" even Republicans on Capitol Hill. We hear the Senate say, \"We have a great bill. We're going to get it passed on the President's desk.\" Now last year when that happened, it was a massive spending bill but he wanted to protect the Defense Department, which has been as you said, was eviscerated under Obama. The president shouldn't really be given that choice, should he? Either fund defense or massive new debt? Where is this coming from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Yes, Mark, no President and no Congress should be in a position of saying, \"Do you properly fund defense or do you balance the Federal budget?\" It's a false choice and in fact, one of the very few constitutional responsibilities we have as members of Congress is to fund our national defense. And you've highlighted this so many times so well over the years on what the Constitution is really all about. If you look at what's driving our debt, we spend probably 90% of our time talking about the discretionary side of budget, which includes defense. If you eliminated the whole Department of Defense, you'd still have a deficit, so don't act like that's the problem in Washington. Two thirds of our spending in Washington is what's called mandatory spending, things that we don't even vote on. It's Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Obamacare. And think about this, in one bill, in one bill that we passed to the Senate last year, with only a 51-vote requirement to repeal and replace Obamacare, we repealed Obamacare, got rid of that, actually put in place reforms to lower premiums, put you in charge your healthcare, protected people with pre-existing conditions. We did all of that and we turned Medicaid, which is one of the most broken forms of healthcare. We turned Medicaid over to the states to run and we put Medicaid on a budget. We didn't cut Medicaid spending like Democrats would say, we just slowed the growth. So only in Washington, you know, if you were going to get an 8% increase and you get a 3% increase, you've still got an increase and they call it a cut. Just that alone would have saved over $800 billion and improved healthcare outcomes for families all across the country. Oh and by the way, Medicare, if we do nothing, if we don't touch it, it's set to go bankrupt in eight years. I think that would be irresponsible to let it go bust. We have a plan by the way to save Medicare from bankruptcy. Democrats don't even want to talk about that, but if you just look at the healthcare bill alone, two of the big four mandatory spending programs in one fell swoop, we could have dramatically reformed and helped us get to a balanced Federal budget."

I mean when I go home, I talk to senior groups in New Orleans and the first thing I say is, \"How many of you know Medicare goes bankrupt in eight years?\" Mark, half the people in the room are scared to even talk about it because they think that they know it's bad. They know it is going bust. They just think the solution would negatively impact them and when I say, \"First of all, our plan doesn't even make any changes to Medicare for you, except that it won't go bust on your watch.\" Well, immediately they're okay to having this conversation. Young people by the way don't believe it's going to be there for them. So if they're going to have to make some changes to how a 30-year-old will have to, you know, make plans so that they can still have some kind of healthcare plan for them when they retire, they're open to that discussion, too. We need to first -- we can't just assume everybody knows what the problem is. We have to have this discussion and then go talk about what our solution is because the Democrats don't want to make any changes. They want to let it go bust and scare and frighten seniors. That's all they want - and seniors are tired of being scared on this issue."

It's also the reason that they hate what he's doing because he's going after the, you know the leftist mentality that they put in place under Barack Obama and so when you look at what their agenda is, they weren't real clear in a lot of those swing districts, Mark. There's only three districts that they flipped that Hillary Clinton won, so the bulk of the Republicans that gave Pelosi the majority were places where Donald Trump actually won when he was on the ballot. And so it's going to be a real delicate balance for them. Their very first vote as a member of Congress is going to be for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker and many of them promised that they wouldn't do it. So eyes are going to be real clearly focused on that very first vote. Did you break your bond to your constituents on day one, but even on day two and three and four, when she's bringing radical bill after radical bill to abolish ICE. They want to get rid of our Interior Border Patrol agents. This open border mentality, Medicare-for-all where they eliminate private health insurance and help bankrupt Medicare. And then let alone all this personal stuff where they want to keep going after the President and ultimately go to impeachment. As they go down that kind of leftist agenda, that's not where Middle America is. That's not where a lot of those seats that they flip from Republican to Democrat are."

They were going to jack up the cost of healthcare. We laid it all out. It wasn't a mystery. And we did that in committee where the work is actually going to be done, on the House floor, where you've got to do battle to the point where when the bill passed, it was unpopular with the American people and it's remained unpopular because it's bad law.

They tried to put people on defense and they had a lot of money behind that, too. They heavily outraised us. Their base was very motivated. I'll say this, when the President got engaged, we actually did really well in terms of bringing our base to a higher level of turnout, too, and typically on an off-year election, doesn't do so well on turnout, we saw very high - high percentage turnout this time around, but ultimately, I do think that our message wasn't sharp enough, it wasn't just enough to be for the economy.

I mean, there were probably 15,000 people in the arena and another 15,000 outside knowing they couldn't get in, but just wanted to be there, which tells you the enthusiasm for this President has never been higher. I do think when it comes to 2020 and it's President Trump on the ballot against whatever far-left radical they nominate out of their 20 to 30- person primary, President Trump is going to do incredibly well because we've got a great economy.
