      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" At the core of any political campaign is the message, what it's about. What exactly are next Tuesday's midterm elections about? Well, on the one side, it's pretty clear, Donald Trump who is the leader of the Republican Party and in effect, it's only spokesman, says that a vote for Republican candidates is a vote for secure borders and against crime and chaos. You don't have to believe the President when he says this but it's definitely what Republicans are running on. What are Democrats running on? That's less clear against Trump certainly. Democrats talk about the President even more than he talks about himself which is a lot. They don't like him at all. Fine. But despising someone isn't really a platform or path forward, at best it's a reaction. What are the ideas that unite the Democratic Party, right now? For the answer to that we go to the other cable stations which over the past couple of years have come to function much as the DNC used to function. It's the Democratic Party’s brain trust and mouthpiece. If you want to know what Democrats are thinking watch CNN and MSNBC. Last night was especially instructive. Here are two contributors to MSNBC. One writes for \"The New York Times.\" The other at Princeton which is an Ivy League college in New Jersey. Both have impressive credentials, both are considered deep thinkers by most of the other people in this country who think of themselves as intellectuals. Watch as they explained what they have learned since the 2016 election.",

He's bound to say something indefensible once in a while, they all do, we can actually vouch for that having done it ourselves unfortunately. But here are the rules. When you say something awful that you can't defend, don't try to defend it. Apologize, explain what you meant and move on. Vow to do better. That's a rule for life, not just television news.

You'll notice the lack of contrition when Don Lemon said, we have to start doing something about Americans of a certain skin color, it turns out it wasn't a mistake, he meant that. He didn't apologize because nobody in his world asked him to. They are all saying pretty much the same thing. This is now a common view in the Democratic Party, it's one of the things they're running on. Now lots of Americans don't like that message obviously but Democrats are not concerned about that. They no longer care what those Americans think. They've given up on trying to represent them and that's why they fight harder to provide birth-right citizenship for foreigners than they ever thought to protect American citizens from heroin or plunging middle-class wages or privacy destroying tech monopolies. They know who their constituency is, that also explains their sudden sympathy for law breakers over everyone else. You already know about the Democrats' demand that America ignore its own immigration laws, but it's gone far beyond that. Elizabeth Warren who is the Senator for Massachusetts and is running for President in 2020 has condemned our entire criminal justice system as irredeemably racist. Meanwhile, the Hollywood Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke agrees with that. He's called our justice system `the new Jim Crow'. He accused cops of shooting people based on their skin color. Now, he offered no evidence that cops do shoot people just based on their skin color, he didn't need to because he just knows it's true. Meanwhile, Democratic sleeves around the country have decided that laws against crimes like shoplifting and public urination and others can no longer be enforced because that would be racist. Now the result of all of this is inevitable. It's always the same, everywhere, more crime, and you're already seeing that in many places. Turns out the victims are not cloistered rich people like Beto O'Rourke, they are normal people of all races. Crime hurts everyone but it tends to hurt the poor the most. If that's occurred to Democrats, they haven't mentioned it. They're feeling good about themselves right now. They know they're likely to win back the House on Tuesday and they're feeling vindicated, more self-righteous than ever. We searched long and hard today for a piece of tape that could sum up the Democratic worldview, right now and we found this. It was shot by a network camera man covering the President's trip to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, this week. The protester screaming at the president happens to be a Presbyterian minister. Watch.",

They couldn't understand why a barely detectable demographics, like fine with gays, fine with transgenders, then we get to intersexual. Most people have never even met an intersexual. Questioning, they don't know what it is. They don't understand why these people matter and tens of millions of ordinary Americans don't matter. They don't understand why foreigners who simply want to walk into your country have more rights than people who were born here and have been citizens of the United States all their lives. That's how Trump came along, and Don Lemon and people don't realize that they're partly responsible for Trump. And so, any stuff talking about white men being terrorist, the distinguishing feature of a terrorist is not that he's a white man, that's actually demonizing as you say half the country.

I don't understand that. The argument itself is a racist one. The argument is that somehow because of your skin color, you are less likely to have in your wallet a photo ID or you are less likely to be able to go to a government office and get a free photo ID. It's a ridiculous argument, it's been disproven empirically in state after state but the hard Left and now increasingly the entire Left keeps making the argument. And you know, Tucker, I went into that debate, that program thinking we were going to have a cordial debate about birth-right citizenship but as soon as Jeffrey Toobin started losing the argument, he just out of the blue says, you've devoted your career to stopping people of color from voting.

Democrats, on the other hand are talking about health care and it could help them win back the House because the Republicans ran on it in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, they want it all and they didn't deliver on what they said they would do. I think the Republicans have missed an opportunity to talk more about health care because believe me, the Democrats are not just going to talk about it in 2018, this is going to be a major topic in 2020. Their policy, Medicare for all, not that popular. In a popular vote however, if U.S. people, they want single-payer health care. Obamacare more popular today than it was at any other time previously.

Many school districts across the country went along sending billions of dollars on computers. Did any of this improve the lives of children, help them to learn more? Of course not. It is become obvious that Tech is addictive, both physically and mentally harmful. Kids need less screen time, not more. It does not help them learn. Top Tech leaders know that and that's why \"The New York Times\" just reported Silicone valley elite send their own kids to screen-free private schools. And yet these programs are still happening just like big tobacco, the tech monopolies have no problem addicting children to a product they know is so harmful, they don't want their own families around it.

What exactly are next Tuesday's midterm elections about? Well, on the one side, it's pretty clear, Donald Trump who is the leader of the Republican Party and in effect, it's only spokesman, says that a vote for Republican candidates is a vote for secure borders and against crime and chaos. You don't have to believe the President when he says this but it's definitely what Republicans are running on. What are Democrats running on? That's less clear against Trump certainly. Democrats talk about the President even more than he talks about himself which is a lot. They don't like him at all. Fine. But despising someone isn't really a platform or path forward, at best it's a reaction. What are the ideas that unite the Democratic Party, right now? For the answer to that we go to the other cable stations which over the past couple of years have come to function much as the DNC used to function. It's the Democratic Party’s brain trust and mouthpiece. If you want to know what Democrats are thinking watch CNN and MSNBC. Last night was especially instructive. Here are two contributors to MSNBC. One writes for \"The New York Times.\" The other at Princeton which is an Ivy League college in New Jersey. Both have impressive credentials, both are considered deep thinkers by most of the other people in this country who think of themselves as intellectuals. Watch as they explained what they have learned since the 2016 election."

To paraphrase a long-time liberal hero whose ideas are now ignored, what matters is the content of a person's character. But not anymore. Now the opposite is true, identity is everything.

He's bound to say something indefensible once in a while, they all do, we can actually vouch for that having done it ourselves unfortunately. But here are the rules. When you say something awful that you can't defend, don't try to defend it. Apologize, explain what you meant and move on. Vow to do better. That's a rule for life, not just television news. We all learnt it as kids. On the left though, it no longer applies. Here's what Don Lemon said last night about his remarks on Monday."

    {
      "speaker": "LEMON",
      "utterance": "I said that the biggest terror threat in this country comes from radicals on the far right, primarily white men. That angered some people. Their analysis shows that for every eight deadly attacks by Right Wing extremists, there were one by Left-Wing extremists. Those are the facts. So, people who were angered about what I said are missing the entire point. We don't need to worry about people that are thousands of miles away. The biggest threats are homegrown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "If you didn't like what I said, that's your problem. You'll notice the lack of contrition when Don Lemon said, we have to start doing something about Americans of a certain skin color, it turns out it wasn't a mistake, he meant that. He didn't apologize because nobody in his world asked him to. They are all saying pretty much the same thing. This is now a common view in the Democratic Party, it's one of the things they're running on. Now lots of Americans don't like that message obviously but Democrats are not concerned about that. They no longer care what those Americans think. They've given up on trying to represent them and that's why they fight harder to provide birth-right citizenship for foreigners than they ever thought to protect American citizens from heroin or plunging middle-class wages or privacy destroying tech monopolies. They know who their constituency is, that also explains their sudden sympathy for law breakers over everyone else. You already know about the Democrats' demand that America ignore its own immigration laws, but it's gone far beyond that. Elizabeth Warren who is the Senator for Massachusetts and is running for President in 2020 has condemned our entire criminal justice system as irredeemably racist. Meanwhile, the Hollywood Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke agrees with that. He's called our justice system `the new Jim Crow'. He accused cops of shooting people based on their skin color. Now, he offered no evidence that cops do shoot people just based on their skin color, he didn't need to because he just knows it's true. Meanwhile, Democratic sleeves around the country have decided that laws against crimes like shoplifting and public urination and others can no longer be enforced because that would be racist. Now the result of all of this is inevitable. It's always the same, everywhere, more crime, and you're already seeing that in many places. Turns out the victims are not cloistered rich people like Beto O'Rourke, they are normal people of all races. Crime hurts everyone but it tends to hurt the poor the most. If that's occurred to Democrats, they haven't mentioned it. They're feeling good about themselves right now. They know they're likely to win back the House on Tuesday and they're feeling vindicated, more self-righteous than ever. We searched long and hard today for a piece of tape that could sum up the Democratic worldview, right now and we found this. It was shot by a network camera man covering the President's trip to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, this week. The protester screaming at the president happens to be a Presbyterian minister. Watch."

They couldn't understand why a barely detectable demographics, like fine with gays, fine with transgenders, then we get to intersexual. Most people have never even met an intersexual. Questioning, they don't know what it is. They don't understand why these people matter and tens of millions of ordinary Americans don't matter. They don't understand why foreigners who simply want to walk into your country have more rights than people who were born here and have been citizens of the United States all their lives. That's how Trump came along, and Don Lemon and people don't realize that they're partly responsible for Trump. And so, any stuff talking about white men being terrorist, the distinguishing feature of a terrorist is not that he's a white man, that's actually demonizing as you say half the country. But Don Lemon, they don't seem to have learned the lessons of the last two years. If you want more Trump, this is how you get more Trump."

I don't understand that. The argument itself is a racist one. The argument is that somehow because of your skin color, you are less likely to have in your wallet a photo ID or you are less likely to be able to go to a government office and get a free photo ID.

So, they have been running ads on Facebook saying, hunter alert and basically what these ads are telling voters is that if you vote this election cycle, you may lose your out-of-state hunting license. And if you click on these ads, they basically take you to either the Democrat party's website that is essentially reiterating the same thing or a landing page on Facebook that just has the logos. And why this is important, the Department of Game and Fishing have - they've reached out to them and they've essentially said that they have no idea what the Democrat party in North Dakota is talking about. The Secretary of State had said the same thing and Heidi Heitkamp had actually transferred almost $3 million to the Democrat party of North Dakota. So, she had may be partially paid for these ads.

Not a rally, he wanted to talk about immigration. So that is what he has decided is going to be his closing argument going into Tuesday. Democrats, on the other hand are talking about health care and it could help them win back the House because the Republicans ran on it in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, they want it all and they didn't deliver on what they said they would do. I think the Republicans have missed an opportunity to talk more about health care because believe me, the Democrats are not just going to talk about it in 2018, this is going to be a major topic in 2020. Their policy, Medicare for all, not that popular. In a popular vote however, if U.S. people, they want single-payer health care. Obamacare more popular today than it was at any other time previously.

Let's just say that the Democrats take back the House, is Nancy Pelosi going to pass on an opportunity to put price controls on pharmaceutical drugs if President Trump is offering that? I mean, that would be quite remarkable if she doesn't want to do that. Just like would they pass on the ability to give amnesty to the dreamers? And for a little bit of border security? I mean, I think, Americans want some sort of compromise but I got to tell you, Tuck, between 2018 and 2020, if both sides go into this closing argument, on immigration and health care, and they both do okay, the Republicans keep the Senate, the Democrats take the House, what do you think people are going to run on in 2020?"

In response to this, the Center has sued saying the law infringes on religious freedom. Katie Anderson is Senior Counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom which is representing the Hope Center and she joins us tonight. Thanks so much for coming on. So, are we misstating that?

      "utterance": "I don't know but it's so important. I have spoken to some of the women at the shelter and they tell me the emotional and physical consequences for them if they run into a biological man where they are sleeping. And this all started because an individual who is male but identifies as female came to the shelter wanting to spend the night. He was intoxicated, he was clearly injured, and so the Hope Center paid for his taxi and sent him to the hospital to get the care that he needed, but because they didn't let him into the shelter, Anchorage is now after the Hope Center."

Many school districts across the country went along sending billions of dollars on computers. Did any of this improve the lives of children, help them to learn more? Of course not. It is become obvious that Tech is addictive, both physically and mentally harmful. Kids need less screen time, not more. It does not help them learn. Top Tech leaders know that and that's why \"The New York Times\" just reported Silicone valley elite send their own kids to screen-free private schools. And yet these programs are still happening just like big tobacco, the tech monopolies have no problem addicting children to a product they know is so harmful, they don't want their own families around it. The question is will they ever have to pay for what they have done? We'll keep you on that. That's it for us tonight, we'll be back tomorrow 8:00 PM with the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and group think."
