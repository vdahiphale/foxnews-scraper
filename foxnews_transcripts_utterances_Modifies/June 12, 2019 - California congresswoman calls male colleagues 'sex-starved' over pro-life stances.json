Breaking only moments ago from \"The New York Times,\" major new development in John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia probe, this is huge. By the way, if your name is Brennan, Clapper, or Comey, you may want to lawyer up because Durham is now seeking interviews especially with top CIA officers.  That's right. Investigation into the investigators is going to be all- encompassing like we have been telling you. It will likely now spread across continents. Pay attention to Italy, Great Britain, and Australia. According to \"The Times\", CIA Director Gina Haspel, rightly, is instructing her agency to fully cooperate and they will. From the dirty dossier, to the rampant spying against Trump associates, and then the leaking of sensitive material to rig an election, the single biggest abuse of power scandal in American history, the truth is now being covered.  The boomerang of all boomerangs of justice is in full swing. And high- ranking, former bureaucrats, they are in deep, deep trouble tonight. And there's no stopping this train.  And meanwhile, Democrats and, of course, their friends in the media mob, they are still fixated on one issue and one only -- raged psychosis against the president. As we speak, once again apoplectic. This is actually the most amazing set up you'll ever see. Brand-new interview clip between the president and ABCs Georgi Stephanopoulos, the resident Clinton sycophant. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Now, this is what's fascinating. Let's be very clears, you might want to listen. Listening is much different than, let's see, lying, spying, and paying for Russian lies and spreading it through deep state operatives and then using it as a basis for a FISA warrant, because Hillary Clinton -- if the media is outraged over, you might want to listen and then report it to the FBI, why are they not outraged about Hillary paying for Russian lies, disinformation, Comey generously using the unverifiable data from Russia to spy on the Trump campaign and get a FISA warrant.   No doubt, by the way, this will all get another round of fake, phony, moral selective outrage over that interview, but it's a perfect set up because if they are outraged about that, and how can you not be outraged over what I just said? Of course, that's all to be expected. In many ways, that was actually a genius set up because the media mob will fall right into his trap breathlessly spewing fake, phony outrage over a nonstory for days, we'll be showing you the tape this time tomorrow night, ignoring the real abuse of power that took place in 2016 and the real Russian dossier that was bought and paid for and then uses a basis to spy on the Trump campaign. More proof if you needed it the media mob is nothing more than an extension of the Democratic Party. Oh, they are worried about obstruction of justice, but only if it's Trump, not Hillary. They are worried about underlying crimes but only if it's Trump, not Hillary. They are worried about believing, but only if it bludgeons Trump, not the attorney -- the lieutenant governor of the state of Virginia, the commonwealth of Virginia, over serious sex allegations. So, all of this comes as top Democrats had their heads, I won't say though I want to, in the sand. Today, they turned Capitol Hill into the twilight zone. The known liar, the cowardly Adam Schiff -- come on the show, Schiff, come, please, four hours for you free. He held yet another hearing about his favorite fantasy, the Russia hoax. The only guy that's caught on tape colluding with Russians.  And Schiff knows there was zero Trump-Russia collusion. Four previous investigations all concluding pollution is a lie and a myth and unprovable, but that doesn't matter to the cowardly Adam Schiff because he is nothing more than a liar and a con artists, that's why he won't come on the show. His sole mission is to smear President Trump every second, hour, of every day, just like the mob and the media.   That's why the House Intel Committee chair held yet another sham hearing today on what he called disturbing findings, volume one of the Mueller report, read it. Don't forget the same volume that totally clear Trump and his entire campaign. It said, quote, the investigation did not establish - - Mr. Schiff, what part of this don't you understand -- that members of the campaign conspired or interfered with the Russian government in its election interference activities. The only one on phone call with Russia looking for disinformation is you, in a hoax. The only one that paid for Russian lies is your candidate, Hillary. Six hundred seventy-five days, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 500 witnesses, 230 orders for communication records, 19 hyper- partisan anti-Trump investigators and all Democratic donors, even Hillary Clinton's attorney, the worst attorney -- Andrew Weissmann on the face of the earth, over $25 million spent, and even Mueller's team found no collusion.  Instead, they were only able to produce a 400-some-odd-page document filled with smears, insinuation and even took an edited tape of the Trump attorney, Dowd, out of context, a heavily edited voice mail to make attorney John Dowd look bad. Wow. A total mischaracterization of Paul Manafort's business associate, the Mueller report totally admitted Fusion GPS -- they were complicit in paying for Russian lies and propaganda, they hired Steele on behalf of Hillary Clinton. And that's only the tip of the iceberg that they missed. And how could they not investigate the phony Russian dossier if you're investigating Russian interference in 2016? So, today's bogus hearing, Congressman Devin Nunes probably delivered the best speech of his career, he will join us in a minute. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Coming up, Congressman Nunes will expand more on what he is calling the Mueller dossier. I wish I thought of that, and its likely author, devout Trump hater, Andrew Weissmann. Now, he's the career prosecutor. Andrew Weissmann, that is the pit bull as labeled by \"The New York Times,\" of Mueller, actually attended the 2016 election night victory party for Hillary. He's also a partisan Democratic donor. His track record is horrific. Sidney Powell's book, \"Licensed to Lie\", just is a brutal takedown detailing Weissmann and his notorious withholding of exculpatory information and prosecutorial misconduct. In one case, remember, he sent four Merrill executives to prison for a year, that verdict overturned by the Fifth Circuit.  It was yet another case, he got overturned 9-0. What an achievement by the Supreme Court. Thousands of accounting Anderson Accounting employees, they lost their jobs because of Weissmann.  And tonight, we can report that Weissmann's biggest critic, Sidney Powell, thank goodness, has now been hired to represent Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. That's the legal team responsible for Flynn's guilty plea has been sacked. Powell who said 16 months ago blasting the Mueller witch hunt is now taking over. Now, word if he plans to withdraw, but a change of course looks imminent. Powell said 16 months ago he should withdraw that plea, I agree, especially in light of what the government did to a 33-year retired general, a war hero who served this country with honor and distinction. What they did is disgraceful.   Remember, Flynn was illegally unmasked, they leaked raw intelligence on him, spied on by high ranking U.S. government officials in 2016. And remember, after Trump was sworn in, day four of his administration, Comey sent agents to the White House to set a perjury trap for Flynn. They've already listened to the tape after the deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe said, Flynn, you don't need a lawyer. And Comey brags about setting up a 33-year veteran. This is a national disgrace.

I mean, not only did we see the congressional hearings up on Capitol Hill with Nunes really tackling and his opening statement really delivering a punch and a blow to Adam Schiff. But we also saw Donald Trump Jr. who was testifying behind closed doors. Now, remember, Donald Trump Jr. had already given 27 hours of testimony and he said before he went into this closed-door hearing, I'm going to give the exact same testimony I gave before, you know, even if it takes 27 hours. The biggest development, though, did come from General Flynn hiring Sidney Powell. She's a former federal prosecutor. I spoke with earlier today and she told me the most important point she wanted to make was that General Flynn will continue -- will continue to cooperate with the government but she made another really important point. She said it would take about 90 days to get through his file.   I mean, it's a massive, massive file, and she wants to go through it toothed comb, and she wants to ensure that she understands the case completely before sentencing. So, it looks like his sentencing hearing will possibly be pushed even further into the future. Right now, there is no data set.

That starts with a rigged investigation of Hillary, as usual.  Sara, great investigative reporting. We appreciate it. Now, tonight, if Democrats on the Hill were really interested in oversight, they would applaud the efforts of Attorney General Barr and Durham, the Inspector General Horowitz. Instead, they are, what, wanting to re- litigate, reinvestigate the how-many-years-old collusion, witch hunt narrative. This is now being a fifth time?  And today, Donald Trump Jr., I have no idea why he went, dragged before the Senate Intel Committee yet again, to answer the same questions again, that he has already answered on numerous occasions. So, when does this end? How many more investigations Democrats need? A hundred, 20, 50? How much more money most private American citizens that have been trying to serve their country, a duly elected president's agenda, how much more to these people have to spend in legal fees answering these obsessive- compulsive psychotic questions over and over again? Do they care about that at all?  Because now we are talking about abuse of power in yet another light. and there's no end in sight. Senator Kamala Harris openly dreaming about prosecuting the president, why? Because she doesn't agree with him. By the way, she can't defeat him in a general election, she's angry about that too.

But when I brought up the fact that we probably shouldn't be using counterintelligence capabilities in this country to target a political campaign, they just sat there. It was almost as though they had been coached by the Democrats to not say anything bad about the counterintelligence investigation that it occurred. And I'll tell you, if that's the attitude, I know we always say, this happened at the very top of the FBI, but I will tell you if that attitude permeated throughout the counterintelligence capabilities and if retired FBI agents think it's OK to use counterintelligence against political campaigns, I think we've gone a long way in this country. That used to be Democrats who didn't support the counterintelligence capabilities because they thought they were spying on their campaigns and on political enemies.

And - oh, the gun running, fast and furious scandals that led to the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. I have interviewed his brother a lot, have you? The ATF literally lost track of thousands of guns, Eric Holder tried to cover it all up - your administration. You actually gave the guns away to criminals, gangs, cartels - people died. The disastrous Iran deal, how about that one? Dropping over $1 billion in cash and other currency in the tarmac of radical, Islamic terrorists, the ones that chant \"Death to America\". And we can't forget about actually targeting the press and seizing the phone records of AP journalists, even spying on former Fox News reporter James Rosen. Literally investigating him under the Espionage Act for reporting on a classified document, not turning over his sources? Wow. And The Hill's John Solomon reporting. Biden faces serious pay-to-play allegations surrounding his son's dealings with Ukraine and China. Remember Biden bragging on tape about getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired, the one investigating his son? And leveraging American tax dollars and giving them six hours to fire him or he's out of there with their money? And, oh, the election meddling, a whole Russia thing, the media mob raging all about it - that happened on Biden and Obama's watch, all of it. And by the way, they were warned like people - by people like Devin Nunes who was on earlier. Top Obama appointees who oversaw rigged investigation in Hillary Clinton, an insurance policy that led to the biggest abuse of power, corruption, scandal in history? Let's see, they tried to rig a general election, FISA abuse, dirty Russian dossier with Russian lies. 200 percent increase in unmasking - 350, actually, by top Obama officials in 2016 alone. Why would some Susan Rice and Samantha Power and John Brennan - why would they need to unmask so many Americans at such a high new rate? That happened in the Biden-Obama years riddled with corruption. And by the way, we haven't even begun to go over his record. Oh, I can't wait. I've my own dossier, my own research. It's plagued by scandal and what did they know, when did they know it in all of this. Questions that Crazy Uncle Joe we'll have to ask. What would he do on the border? Did he think Obamacare was a good thing? Did it worked? Did everyone keep their doctors' plans and pay less? I don't think so. And the worst economy on record, the first administration to never reach 3 percent annual GDP growth, the worse labor participation rate, Joe, since the 70s, lowest homeownership rate in 51 years, worst recovery since the 40s, 13 million more Americans on food stamps in your 8 years, 8 million more Americans in poverty in your 8 years. What university of living in Joe? It literally is like this alternate reality, outright delusion, including new claims about curing cancer, along with an outright obsession with the President.

No doubt, by the way, this will all get another round of fake, phony, moral selective outrage over that interview, but it's a perfect set up because if they are outraged about that, and how can you not be outraged over what I just said? Of course, that's all to be expected. In many ways, that was actually a genius set up because the media mob will fall right into his trap breathlessly spewing fake, phony outrage over a nonstory for days, we'll be showing you the tape this time tomorrow night, ignoring the real abuse of power that took place in 2016 and the real Russian dossier that was bought and paid for and then uses a basis to spy on the Trump campaign. More proof if you needed it the media mob is nothing more than an extension of the Democratic Party. Oh, they are worried about obstruction of justice, but only if it's Trump, not Hillary. They are worried about underlying crimes but only if it's Trump, not Hillary. They are worried about believing, but only if it bludgeons Trump, not the attorney -- the lieutenant governor of the state of Virginia, the commonwealth of Virginia, over serious sex allegations. So, all of this comes as top Democrats had their heads, I won't say though I want to, in the sand. Today, they turned Capitol Hill into the twilight zone. The known liar, the cowardly Adam Schiff -- come on the show, Schiff, come, please, four hours for you free. He held yet another hearing about his favorite fantasy, the Russia hoax. The only guy that's caught on tape colluding with Russians. And Schiff knows there was zero Trump-Russia collusion. Four previous investigations all concluding pollution is a lie and a myth and unprovable, but that doesn't matter to the cowardly Adam Schiff because he is nothing more than a liar and a con artists, that's why he won't come on the show. His sole mission is to smear President Trump every second, hour, of every day, just like the mob and the media. That's why the House Intel Committee chair held yet another sham hearing today on what he called disturbing findings, volume one of the Mueller report, read it. Don't forget the same volume that totally clear Trump and his entire campaign. It said, quote, the investigation did not establish - - Mr. Schiff, what part of this don't you understand -- that members of the campaign conspired or interfered with the Russian government in its election interference activities. The only one on phone call with Russia looking for disinformation is you, in a hoax. The only one that paid for Russian lies is your candidate, Hillary. Six hundred seventy-five days, 2,800 subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 500 witnesses, 230 orders for communication records, 19 hyper- partisan anti-Trump investigators and all Democratic donors, even Hillary Clinton's attorney, the worst attorney -- Andrew Weissmann on the face of the earth, over $25 million spent, and even Mueller's team found no collusion. Instead, they were only able to produce a 400-some-odd-page document filled with smears, insinuation and even took an edited tape of the Trump attorney, Dowd, out of context, a heavily edited voice mail to make attorney John Dowd look bad. Wow. A total mischaracterization of Paul Manafort's business associate, the Mueller report totally admitted Fusion GPS -- they were complicit in paying for Russian lies and propaganda, they hired Steele on behalf of Hillary Clinton. And that's only the tip of the iceberg that they missed. And how could they not investigate the phony Russian dossier if you're investigating Russian interference in 2016?

Now, he's the career prosecutor. Andrew Weissmann, that is the pit bull as labeled by \"The New York Times,\" of Mueller, actually attended the 2016 election night victory party for Hillary. He's also a partisan Democratic donor. His track record is horrific. Sidney Powell's book, \"Licensed to Lie\", just is a brutal takedown detailing Weissmann and his notorious withholding of exculpatory information and prosecutorial misconduct. In one case, remember, he sent four Merrill executives to prison for a year, that verdict overturned by the Fifth Circuit. It was yet another case, he got overturned 9-0. What an achievement by the Supreme Court. Thousands of accounting Anderson Accounting employees, they lost their jobs because of Weissmann. And tonight, we can report that Weissmann's biggest critic, Sidney Powell, thank goodness, has now been hired to represent Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. That's the legal team responsible for Flynn's guilty plea has been sacked. Powell who said 16 months ago blasting the Mueller witch hunt is now taking over. Now, word if he plans to withdraw, but a change of course looks imminent. Powell said 16 months ago he should withdraw that plea, I agree, especially in light of what the government did to a 33-year retired general, a war hero who served this country with honor and distinction. What they did is disgraceful. Remember, Flynn was illegally unmasked, they leaked raw intelligence on him, spied on by high ranking U.S. government officials in 2016. And remember, after Trump was sworn in, day four of his administration, Comey sent agents to the White House to set a perjury trap for Flynn. They've already listened to the tape after the deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe said, Flynn, you don't need a lawyer. And Comey brags about setting up a 33-year veteran. This is a national disgrace.

Now, remember, Donald Trump Jr. had already given 27 hours of testimony and he said before he went into this closed-door hearing, I'm going to give the exact same testimony I gave before, you know, even if it takes 27 hours. The biggest development, though, did come from General Flynn hiring Sidney Powell. She's a former federal prosecutor. I spoke with earlier today and she told me the most important point she wanted to make was that General Flynn will continue -- will continue to cooperate with the government but she made another really important point. She said it would take about 90 days to get through his file. I mean, it's a massive, massive file, and she wants to go through it toothed comb, and she wants to ensure that she understands the case completely before sentencing.

She literally has Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the house only in name, name only, literally putting the pressure on. Is she going to cave to Ocasio-Cortez and her radical colleagues, their impeachment dreams? Joining us now, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Devin Nunes, and the Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows. I've got to say this about Mark, Jim Jordan, Devin Nunes, we'll add Doug Collins to the mix, and maybe Matt Gaetz, the freshman, he's overly ambitious but a good guy and he's really done a great job. Without you guys behind the scenes, because I've now -- we have now seen these closed-door testimonies. Without your efforts, we would not be here and this would likely have gotten away with.

And what was amazing to me that I think a lot of people didn't pay attention to, is there were two retired FBI agents on the stand, on the witness table, along with Andy McCarthy, who appears a lot on your show and others. What I was amazed that was the lack of concern by these former FBI agents, one of whom, Peter Strzok, used to work for. And, look, they serve their country and I'm sure they did a great job. But when I brought up the fact that we probably shouldn't be using counterintelligence capabilities in this country to target a political campaign, they just sat there. It was almost as though they had been coached by the Democrats to not say anything bad about the counterintelligence investigation that it occurred. And I'll tell you, if that's the attitude, I know we always say, this happened at the very top of the FBI, but I will tell you if that attitude permeated throughout the counterintelligence capabilities and if retired FBI agents think it's OK to use counterintelligence against political campaigns, I think we've gone a long way in this country. That used to be Democrats who didn't support the counterintelligence capabilities because they thought they were spying on their campaigns and on political enemies. That ends up, in fact, they took them over, they corrupted the whole thing and it seems like that's the attitude throughout the FBI, at least for the former, and foremost of the former officials."

He has seen much of a classified, Jim Jordan and I have not. So, we have been able to work together in a way that is about transparency for the American people. Here's the thing that dawned on me today. You had another Mueller hearing here in HPSCI, an open hearing, why was it open? Because they wanted to try to resurrect the whole Mueller narrative and trying to do their best to make sure that the American people are engaged. But the truth of the matter is, they didn't get the result they wanted. There was the old adage (ph), you know, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Well, they have tried and tried and tried and tried again and they will continue to try, but the problem is they know the truth. Many, even some of the witnesses today here on Capitol Hill, they are supposed to be experts. They haven't even read to the Steele dossier. That's how not credible that was."

He was in Italy, so that for sure brings up -- he could be part of the Italian government, some kind of asset there. He could be a British asset because he also lived in London. So, but there also -- it could be possible, quite frankly, that he was working for Fusion GPS or an operation like Fusion GPS through Christopher Steele. And what we still don't know at the heart of this is where did the Clinton campaign dirty operation that was run by Fusion GPS and the FBI -- they were on parallel tracks -- when did those merge? And that's really what I think myself and Mark Meadows have been trying to figure out for a long time. And hopefully, that's what the U.S. attorney out of Connecticut is going to get to the bottom of. We have a right to know what countries were involved in this."

So, people that perhaps were afraid under previous leadership to actually say, well, we knew this was wrong, they are coming forward now. And when we look at intelligence, we know that the intelligence community shares a lot of information. What we also know, what Devin Nunes knows, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and others that have been involved, is that the Steele dossier, Christopher Steele, his dossier not only doesn't have his origins with Fusion GPS and the Democratic national committee, but other players who are connected. Sidney Blumenthal and they were shopping it to every media outlet that they possibly could and the FBI knew it. That's the problem. The FBI knew it prior to that first FISA and here they are using it as credible information for a FISA application? I just think that that's totally wrong."

If you look at any of the dirty operations arms of the Clinton campaign, and there's a lot of people that were both at the DOJ involved in that, lots of people in the DOJ that were involved. Because, ultimately, that Steele dossier permeated all the way through ultimately to the special counsel. And I'll just close with this tonight -- I was finally able to see the scope of memo and remember, I had these concerns that it was based upon the Steele dossier.

And, again, in terms of Rachel Maddow who you mentioned earlier, it's why people like me, objective people, look at her moderating a debate and saying, \"Wait a minute that that can't happen\", because in 2016 she moderated a debate and actually went up on stage on national television and hugged Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on stage.

Lois Lerner or Susan Rice The Sunday Show lies after four Americans killed in Benghazi, and those Benghazi guys telling us right here on this show that there was a stand down order - pretty big scandal Uncle Joe. And - oh, the gun running, fast and furious scandals that led to the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. I have interviewed his brother a lot, have you? The ATF literally lost track of thousands of guns, Eric Holder tried to cover it all up - your administration. You actually gave the guns away to criminals, gangs, cartels - people died. The disastrous Iran deal, how about that one? Dropping over $1 billion in cash and other currency in the tarmac of radical, Islamic terrorists, the ones that chant \"Death to America\". And we can't forget about actually targeting the press and seizing the phone records of AP journalists, even spying on former Fox News reporter James Rosen. Literally investigating him under the Espionage Act for reporting on a classified document, not turning over his sources? Wow. And The Hill's John Solomon reporting. Biden faces serious pay-to-play allegations surrounding his son's dealings with Ukraine and China. Remember Biden bragging on tape about getting the Ukrainian prosecutor fired, the one investigating his son? And leveraging American tax dollars and giving them six hours to fire him or he's out of there with their money? And, oh, the election meddling, a whole Russia thing, the media mob raging all about it - that happened on Biden and Obama's watch, all of it. And by the way, they were warned like people - by people like Devin Nunes who was on earlier. Top Obama appointees who oversaw rigged investigation in Hillary Clinton, an insurance policy that led to the biggest abuse of power, corruption, scandal in history? Let's see, they tried to rig a general election, FISA abuse, dirty Russian dossier with Russian lies. 200 percent increase in unmasking - 350, actually, by top Obama officials in 2016 alone. Why would some Susan Rice and Samantha Power and John Brennan - why would they need to unmask so many Americans at such a high new rate? That happened in the Biden-Obama years riddled with corruption. And by the way, we haven't even begun to go over his record. Oh, I can't wait. I've my own dossier, my own research. It's plagued by scandal and what did they know, when did they know it in all of this. Questions that Crazy Uncle Joe we'll have to ask. What would he do on the border? Did he think Obamacare was a good thing? Did it worked? Did everyone keep their doctors' plans and pay less? I don't think so. And the worst economy on record, the first administration to never reach 3 percent annual GDP growth, the worse labor participation rate, Joe, since the 70s, lowest homeownership rate in 51 years, worst recovery since the 40s, 13 million more Americans on food stamps in your 8 years, 8 million more Americans in poverty in your 8 years. What university of living in Joe? It literally is like this alternate reality, outright delusion, including new claims about curing cancer, along with an outright obsession with the President.

You forgot things like - for instance, I want to see Joe Biden go to Michigan and talk about the Flint water crisis that happened under his watch where more than 100,000 kids were poisoned, because his EPA refused to tell the public what was going on and that they were drinking lead. I mean, they - you just go down the list, we don't have enough time on Fox News in 24 hours to go through the list of scandals that Joe Biden presided over."

      "utterance": "Well, I think a lot of people have come to the conclusion that Joe is flip-flop Joe. I mean, if you don't know your political philosophy after 40 years - over 40 years in politics, then why you running for President? Look, he has tried to link himself to President Obama, but if the truth be told, Obama has put him at arm's length. Remember, he Hillary Clinton was the most qualified person ever to run for President. So this is a guy that flip-flop - he was moderate Joe and now he's flip- flopping on every issue to get those democratic progressive voters, that's going to hurt him in Middle America and so I don't think he has a shot at this point. He was the one guy on the Left that could potentially get the middle people. He's not that guy anymore."

The Republicans don't have a prayer of winning there. And the Democrats know they can't possibly lose it, so why should they care or pay any attention to it, especially right now? They've got to do well in New Hampshire. They got to do well in Iowa - the hell with homelessness in California."

      "utterance": "Yes, obviously, I'm from California. I'm a Democrat. And here's what I can tell you as a conservative is that, the Democrats, whether it's Los Angeles or San Francisco or Chicago, the problems that the Democrats would normally need to address of their failed leadership is the fact that liberal policies do not work. So they can't address it. Because then that - the end result ends up being an admission of their own craven failure that they - they know their efforts have just been to gain power in these cities and then they - it looks like with Obamacare. You make things up as you go along, you make promises that you take advantage of people, you trick them into voting for you, and then you leave. They literally cannot address what's happening or fix it, because this is the end result of who they are and that's why nobody - the Democrats - nobody addresses the fact that gun control has failed in Chicago. They don't want to admit it. The condition of San Francisco, that the wage gap, the income gap, the - their policies creating homelessness, the gang problems, the open border all of the policies that they do to gain power destroy people's lives. So it's not even like we all are on the same road to Rome and we just disagree on style and substance. Their policies aren't ambivalent or neutral. They destroy things and we're seeing that in the liberal cities across this country."

And the Democrats are ignoring this, Sean, for the same reason that they ignored the number one social problem in this country and that is the breakdown of the nuclear intact family. 40% of kids now are raised without fathers, 25% in 1955 black kids were, now it's 70 percent, largely because - led by Democrats, what the government has done is incentivized women to marry the government and allowed men to abandon their financial and moral responsibility. So they can't address that any more than you can address the homelessness problem, because as Tammy pointed out, it is largely caused by left-wing policies. NIMBYism, rent control, Not in My Backyard, all these regulations that drive up the price of housing. Lee Ohanian is an economist at UCLA, Sean, he estimates that because of all the rigs houses in California costs 50 percent - 5-0 more than they ought to."
