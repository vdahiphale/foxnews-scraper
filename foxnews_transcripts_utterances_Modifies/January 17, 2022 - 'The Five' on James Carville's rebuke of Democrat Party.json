The FBI doing damage control over the way it first characterized a harrowing terror attack on a synagogue in Texas. A British national storming into the place of worship taking four hostages while demanding the release of a prisoner known as lady Al Qaeda. The gunman killed after an 11-hour standoff, thankfully all the hostages were able to escape physically unharmed, but this is how the FBI initially described the motive.",

The FBI is concerned about the perceptions of them being seen as intolerant, especially now in the age of woke that's more important than actually speaking the truth. And you are seeing this all throughout the White House and Joe and Joe Biden, especially, is that they are under the thumb of Twitter and they're kind of -- that's kind of where they anticipate the reactions. Meanwhile, normal people, people who turn on the news who aren't, you know, who don't work in politics or media, they only see two variables. The two variables are synagogue, Islamic terrorist. There are no other - there's no other contacts necessary for them. They don't need to see the big picture. You don't need the big picture here. You have the two -- the two variables. But then what happens is, they can make the conclusion that this is a work of Islamic terrorists and an anti-Semitic attack. But once you add the other variables, woke media, woke Twitter, woke politics, what you end up happening is, well this appears unrelated to anti-Semitism or terror. It really is about getting comes off at the street and the real terrorist is perhaps the NRA. So, this is what happens. The American public can see through that. And Joe can prattle on about gun control, but in his party killed gun control. You cannot energize criminals while disarming the public, right, between demonizing the police, the funding ideology, the defunding ideology. Lawful gun owners are going to be buying more guns.",

And then they do a raid immediately in England with associates or people affiliated with them. So, Scotland Yard didn't know anything about this, MI6 had no clue about this guy. This guy buys a hot gun off the street two weeks after he gets here? Who was the guy he bought the gun from? They don't even know how he died or who shot him. There's a lot of suspicious things about the story and a lot of unanswered questions. And hopefully, Joe has at least one of those answers in the next 48 hours because he should be asked about this. But Dana, if there someone foreign national radical Muslim who comes into this country and holds Jewish people hostage at a synagogue and then demands a release of an Al Qaeda prisoner? The FBI comes out and says, we can't rule out Trump supporters. Think about that. You know, we don't know if this motive was white raid or the Russians. I mean, that's really what they did here.

Meanwhile, normal people, people who turn on the news who aren't, you know, who don't work in politics or media, they only see two variables. The two variables are synagogue, Islamic terrorist. There are no other - there's no other contacts necessary for them. They don't need to see the big picture. You don't need the big picture here. You have the two -- the two variables. But then what happens is, they can make the conclusion that this is a work of Islamic terrorists and an anti-Semitic attack. But once you add the other variables, woke media, woke Twitter, woke politics, what you end up happening is, well this appears unrelated to anti-Semitism or terror. It really is about getting comes off at the street and the real terrorist is perhaps the NRA. So, this is what happens. The American public can see through that.

The FBI doing damage control over the way it first characterized a harrowing terror attack on a synagogue in Texas. A British national storming into the place of worship taking four hostages while demanding the release of a prisoner known as lady Al Qaeda. The gunman killed after an 11-hour standoff, thankfully all the hostages were able to escape physically unharmed, but this is how the FBI initially described the motive."

The FBI is concerned about the perceptions of them being seen as intolerant, especially now in the age of woke that's more important than actually speaking the truth. And you are seeing this all throughout the White House and Joe and Joe Biden, especially, is that they are under the thumb of Twitter and they're kind of -- that's kind of where they anticipate the reactions. Meanwhile, normal people, people who turn on the news who aren't, you know, who don't work in politics or media, they only see two variables. The two variables are synagogue, Islamic terrorist. There are no other - there's no other contacts necessary for them. They don't need to see the big picture. You don't need the big picture here. You have the two -- the two variables. But then what happens is, they can make the conclusion that this is a work of Islamic terrorists and an anti-Semitic attack. But once you add the other variables, woke media, woke Twitter, woke politics, what you end up happening is, well this appears unrelated to anti-Semitism or terror. It really is about getting comes off at the street and the real terrorist is perhaps the NRA. So, this is what happens. The American public can see through that. And Joe can prattle on about gun control, but in his party killed gun control. You cannot energize criminals while disarming the public, right, between demonizing the police, the funding ideology, the defunding ideology. Lawful gun owners are going to be buying more guns."

You gave him a visa two weeks ago to come into this country. What kind of visa was it? Did you vet him? Was he on a watch list? Usually, the feds are all over these people. And then they do a raid immediately in England with associates or people affiliated with them. So, Scotland Yard didn't know anything about this, MI6 had no clue about this guy. This guy buys a hot gun off the street two weeks after he gets here? Who was the guy he bought the gun from? They don't even know how he died or who shot him. There's a lot of suspicious things about the story and a lot of unanswered questions. And hopefully, Joe has at least one of those answers in the next 48 hours because he should be asked about this. But Dana, if there someone foreign national radical Muslim who comes into this country and holds Jewish people hostage at a synagogue and then demands a release of an Al Qaeda prisoner? The FBI comes out and says, we can't rule out Trump supporters. Think about that. You know, we don't know if this motive was white raid or the Russians. I mean, that's really what they did here. And that's how the FBI does it, that's by the book. Remember, Dana, the FBI has said publicly that the number one domestic terror threat --"

God forbid, there is a backlash vigilante in that dirty, southern state. We can't have that.

I don't blame him though and I won't go as far as Jesse blaming this on Biden. I think our intelligence operations and apparatus have to understand what communication was not there.

The FBI has done more to tarnished the trust in law enforcement, people in this country have for local and federal law enforcement than the progressive defund the police movement. And you know, they have been pretty awful about these things. And for that meathead spokesperson to come out and say, it had nothing to do with the fact that this was a synagogue, a Jewish house of worship, that's absolute baloney. And you know, everyone should be outraged about this. You have to be straightforward with people.

Dana knows as well as anyone, you are going to get negative coverage and positive coverage, but you can't bank on -- you can only bank on negative coverage and hope you get positive coverage. I think Carville had it right, tout the accomplishments. But I would add a couple more things. One, you got to fix the border and you got to demonstrate that you have a policy and that you are paying attention to it and that you are going to work to get it done. Two, a supply chain task force that every week we will give a sense of what we are doing to unclogged those lanes that are making it harder and really impossible for goods to get into the country. Which are, in many ways, is contributing heavily to inflation, to inflation woes. Three, stop trying to be the Senate leader, Mr. President. Be president. use the bully pulpit, advance your agenda that way and leave the process to Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi. You ought to get out and explain what's in what you want, why you want it and ask the country to support it.

He is like the sales guy that keeps on trying to sell you something but you are not there to buy. There used to be a guy at Long Island, I used to go to the store and I used to go and purchase Christmas. I'm like, Mike, where are the Christmas lights, what aisle? And he'd be like, no, no, no, let me show you these Adirondack chairs, Mr. Watters. I was like, Mike, I'm here for the lights, I don't want Adirondack chairs. He said, no, no, no, sit down in these chairs, trust me, you're going to love these chairs. I sit down to humor him, I said, Mike, they are great chairs, but I need Christmas lights. He said, you know what I'm going to do, don't tell the manager, Jesse, I'm going to knock off 10 percent on these chairs, don't tell anybody. I'm going to do this for you. They are basically free when you think about it. And I said, what are you talking about, Mike? First of all, these chairs have stickers on them that says sold. He goes, did not these chairs, these are floor examples, but they are backordered and you are going to get these chairs at about six months. So, it's the same thing with Biden. Like, he is selling us something that we don't want. And the stuff he is selling us but he can't even deliver like the voting thing and build back better. So, what are we doing? All we want is a nimble administration that's able to pivot away from their preplanned political agenda and towards the agenda of the American people. The things that we care about now, today, and they can't do it."

Thirty-three percent, you know, the average polling, the average approval rating for the president is anywhere from 40 percent to 44 percent, still not good."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, the Quinnipiac poll definitely lit a fire, I know some Democrats because it was a shocking one and it was considered possibly an outlier. Right? So, they wrote a memo from the White House and basically saying this is not really the case. Biden is actually fairly popular, everything is fine. And the ink was not even dry on that memo when the new CBS poll came out which basically reiterated what was said what the Quinnipiac said. And one of the big focus is, is the word focus in this poll. One of the things I thought it was interesting, it's only 33 percent think Biden and Democrats are focused on the key issues they care a lot about. So, they are selling Adirondack chairs when we came in for Christmas lights and people are irritated about it. Now, polls like this with the trajectory, you would expect to see some sort of possible leadership change or major change in direction, but everything I'm picking up is that there is not -- there is not one that they are going to continue to try to drive on voting rights in particular. And it's likely that they will lose that vote again tomorrow."

Joe Lockhart is saying the media -- by the way, in scientific terms he is a gibbering moron, I think we've understood this for a while. But you have to understand, there's actually very, very, very little bad coverage about Joe Biden. If you step, I mean, we talk about it all the time, but that's because that's what we do on this, but there is very little bad coverage on this. But it's not necessary because his ineptitude and decrepitude has become part of mainstream culture. It's like, you don't have to talk that bad about him. You don't have to criticize, because it has kind of been understood that this is kind of what we are stuck with. And it's probably -- and the saddest part about it is, and I'm beating a dead horse quite literally, Joe put wokeism before the welfare of the country.

Have you noticed that whenever we hear about this, the next step is, they are deranged, right, they are either mentally ill, homeless or the progressive D.A.'s? The only difference is one can shop at men's warehouse. But the Times Square pushers have been in and out of mental institutions for 20 years. So, you got to, first, you got to the obvious. And I think Mayor Adams, I'm praying because I know he watches The Five, that he -- that he understands this. If you live on the streets, you are probably mentally insane and inclined to do mentally insane things. So, we need to stop pretending that on the people -- many people on the street are it's either a lifestyle choice or some heroic veteran who just lost his apartment and he's out on the street. No, no, no, no. If you're alone male raging on the avenue doing all sorts of deviant things, you will ultimately hurt someone besides yourself. Again, drill down to the two basic variables. Remove the context, OK. Crazy man on the street is going to hurt you. So, the simple -- the simple solution is you need to take the crazy person off the street and put them in a place where he won't do crazy things. We have -- families have to sue the cities, the families of the victims, we got to repeal the laws that keep authorities from removing dangerous people from society. We need -- if we don't have the asylums because they're close, we got to reopen them. I'm happy to pay more tax money to that. Unfortunately New York City under De Blasio he took what was it, $800 million from us. We don't know where it went. But I'm praying that the new mayor gets this. I want him to understand this.

So, you have all of this happening across the country. There's a -- that's a very potent issue for the Midterm Elections and something that the Republicans could run on. But there has to be a real focus on what Greg was talking about in terms of let's -- what are we actually going to do about the homeless? And we've been talking about this for a long time. We really ought to do something about the homeless. And I agree, Greg. I think maybe if we could be assured that we're going to spend a billion dollars in New York City on the homeless, and we're going to get them help, and we're going to actually do something and not have to have a report that says, whoops, Mayor De Blasio's wife blew the money, we don't know where it is.

You know, you've had Measure H pass in Los Angeles. And the mayor there is throwing up his hands and said, no, this is a federal problem. Whatever they're doing, they've made it worse. They're throwing people away. They don't care about human beings.

Because what the mayor doesn't understand is, it is the randomness that is so scary. To think you can get on anywhere and just be attacked for nothing and there's nothing you can do about it. The only thing you can do about it is not go on the subway. That's what people are going to do. I'm not going to take my children on the subway. And the fact that this happened in the Time Square subway -- it's like the commercial nerve center of the entire city, the tourism mecca of the city - - this is why terrorists attack Time Square because of the population density, the fear factor psychologically.

In a way, Glenn Youngkin is the Eric Adams for the Republicans. He is a fresh face, elected during a time of turmoil, and then -- has an opportunity to just say you know what I'm going for it. There's also something different in Virginia that I don't necessarily like, but it is the way it is. They -- you can only have one term as governor. So, he doesn't have a re-election that he has to worry about. So, we can get in there. And he's got a short amount of time to do as much as he possibly can.

It paints everybody else is the oppressed. And research shows that the identity of victimhood gets you nowhere in life. I think it's not a good thing to start out a kid in that way. But I would also ask. Even though Psaki has already flamed him, the rest of Virginia should just give him a chance. Let's see how the policies affect the state. If it doesn't work, the Republicans are pragmatic. They listen and they will not call you a racist. That's the refreshing part.

Parents were not impressed by that. And you know, when they tried to take back the power and pull the shade back down and keep them out of the process, that's when there was an electoral revolts. So, yes, give them a chance. Give school choice a chance. Let the money follow the students because they screwed everything up, and he's absolutely right.

The FBI doing damage control over the way it first characterized a harrowing terror attack on a synagogue in Texas. A British national storming into the place of worship taking four hostages while demanding the release of a prisoner known as lady Al Qaeda. The gunman killed after an 11-hour standoff, thankfully all the hostages were able to escape physically unharmed, but this is how the FBI initially described the motive."

The FBI is concerned about the perceptions of them being seen as intolerant, especially now in the age of woke that's more important than actually speaking the truth. And you are seeing this all throughout the White House and Joe and Joe Biden, especially, is that they are under the thumb of Twitter and they're kind of -- that's kind of where they anticipate the reactions. Meanwhile, normal people, people who turn on the news who aren't, you know, who don't work in politics or media, they only see two variables. The two variables are synagogue, Islamic terrorist. There are no other - there's no other contacts necessary for them. They don't need to see the big picture. You don't need the big picture here. You have the two -- the two variables. But then what happens is, they can make the conclusion that this is a work of Islamic terrorists and an anti-Semitic attack. But once you add the other variables, woke media, woke Twitter, woke politics, what you end up happening is, well this appears unrelated to anti-Semitism or terror. It really is about getting comes off at the street and the real terrorist is perhaps the NRA. So, this is what happens. The American public can see through that. And Joe can prattle on about gun control, but in his party killed gun control. You cannot energize criminals while disarming the public, right, between demonizing the police, the funding ideology, the defunding ideology. Lawful gun owners are going to be buying more guns."

And then they do a raid immediately in England with associates or people affiliated with them. So, Scotland Yard didn't know anything about this, MI6 had no clue about this guy. This guy buys a hot gun off the street two weeks after he gets here? Who was the guy he bought the gun from? They don't even know how he died or who shot him. There's a lot of suspicious things about the story and a lot of unanswered questions. And hopefully, Joe has at least one of those answers in the next 48 hours because he should be asked about this. But Dana, if there someone foreign national radical Muslim who comes into this country and holds Jewish people hostage at a synagogue and then demands a release of an Al Qaeda prisoner? The FBI comes out and says, we can't rule out Trump supporters. Think about that. You know, we don't know if this motive was white raid or the Russians. I mean, that's really what they did here.

One, you got to fix the border and you got to demonstrate that you have a policy and that you are paying attention to it and that you are going to work to get it done. Two, a supply chain task force that every week we will give a sense of what we are doing to unclogged those lanes that are making it harder and really impossible for goods to get into the country. Which are, in many ways, is contributing heavily to inflation, to inflation woes. Three, stop trying to be the Senate leader, Mr. President. Be president. use the bully pulpit, advance your agenda that way and leave the process to Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi.

There used to be a guy at Long Island, I used to go to the store and I used to go and purchase Christmas. I'm like, Mike, where are the Christmas lights, what aisle? And he'd be like, no, no, no, let me show you these Adirondack chairs, Mr. Watters. I was like, Mike, I'm here for the lights, I don't want Adirondack chairs. He said, no, no, no, sit down in these chairs, trust me, you're going to love these chairs. I sit down to humor him, I said, Mike, they are great chairs, but I need Christmas lights. He said, you know what I'm going to do, don't tell the manager, Jesse, I'm going to knock off 10 percent on these chairs, don't tell anybody. I'm going to do this for you. They are basically free when you think about it. And I said, what are you talking about, Mike? First of all, these chairs have stickers on them that says sold. He goes, did not these chairs, these are floor examples, but they are backordered and you are going to get these chairs at about six months. So, it's the same thing with Biden. Like, he is selling us something that we don't want. And the stuff he is selling us but he can't even deliver like the voting thing and build back better. So, what are we doing? All we want is a nimble administration that's able to pivot away from their preplanned political agenda and towards the agenda of the American people.

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, the Quinnipiac poll definitely lit a fire, I know some Democrats because it was a shocking one and it was considered possibly an outlier. Right? So, they wrote a memo from the White House and basically saying this is not really the case. Biden is actually fairly popular, everything is fine. And the ink was not even dry on that memo when the new CBS poll came out which basically reiterated what was said what the Quinnipiac said. And one of the big focus is, is the word focus in this poll. One of the things I thought it was interesting, it's only 33 percent think Biden and Democrats are focused on the key issues they care a lot about. So, they are selling Adirondack chairs when we came in for Christmas lights and people are irritated about it. Now, polls like this with the trajectory, you would expect to see some sort of possible leadership change or major change in direction, but everything I'm picking up is that there is not -- there is not one that they are going to continue to try to drive on voting rights in particular. And it's likely that they will lose that vote again tomorrow."

Joe Lockhart is saying the media -- by the way, in scientific terms he is a gibbering moron, I think we've understood this for a while. But you have to understand, there's actually very, very, very little bad coverage about Joe Biden. If you step, I mean, we talk about it all the time, but that's because that's what we do on this, but there is very little bad coverage on this. But it's not necessary because his ineptitude and decrepitude has become part of mainstream culture. It's like, you don't have to talk that bad about him. You don't have to criticize, because it has kind of been understood that this is kind of what we are stuck with. And it's probably -- and the saddest part about it is, and I'm beating a dead horse quite literally, Joe put wokeism before the welfare of the country.

The only difference is one can shop at men's warehouse. But the Times Square pushers have been in and out of mental institutions for 20 years. So, you got to, first, you got to the obvious. And I think Mayor Adams, I'm praying because I know he watches The Five, that he -- that he understands this. If you live on the streets, you are probably mentally insane and inclined to do mentally insane things. So, we need to stop pretending that on the people -- many people on the street are it's either a lifestyle choice or some heroic veteran who just lost his apartment and he's out on the street. No, no, no, no. If you're alone male raging on the avenue doing all sorts of deviant things, you will ultimately hurt someone besides yourself. Again, drill down to the two basic variables. Remove the context, OK. Crazy man on the street is going to hurt you. So, the simple -- the simple solution is you need to take the crazy person off the street and put them in a place where he won't do crazy things. We have -- families have to sue the cities, the families of the victims, we got to repeal the laws that keep authorities from removing dangerous people from society. We need -- if we don't have the asylums because they're close, we got to reopen them. I'm happy to pay more tax money to that. Unfortunately New York City under De Blasio he took what was it, $800 million from us. We don't know where it went. But I'm praying that the new mayor gets this. I want him to understand this.

And in looking at some of these polls, generally, crime and fear is around five -- number five to 10 on issues of importance to people. For Republicans, it's a little higher, between four and eight. So, you have all of this happening across the country. There's a -- that's a very potent issue for the Midterm Elections and something that the Republicans could run on. But there has to be a real focus on what Greg was talking about in terms of let's -- what are we actually going to do about the homeless? And we've been talking about this for a long time. We really ought to do something about the homeless. And I agree, Greg. I think maybe if we could be assured that we're going to spend a billion dollars in New York City on the homeless, and we're going to get them help, and we're going to actually do something and not have to have a report that says, whoops, Mayor De Blasio's wife blew the money, we don't know where it is. That doesn't do anybody any good. But it also has to do with the district attorneys. I think that they know now that the focus is on them. Maybe that will help."

You know, you've had Measure H pass in Los Angeles. And the mayor there is throwing up his hands and said, no, this is a federal problem. Whatever they're doing, they've made it worse. They're throwing people away. They don't care about human beings. They just want to seem like they care, so they pump tons of money into these programs that ultimately do absolutely nothing but make the cities less safe and make the businesses want to move out of town because it's really hard to operate when you've got feces on your front steps."

There was something really real about it. And it's gone. COVID put it on the canvas and crime is probably going to keep it there. Because what the mayor doesn't understand is, it is the randomness that is so scary. To think you can get on anywhere and just be attacked for nothing and there's nothing you can do about it. The only thing you can do about it is not go on the subway. That's what people are going to do. I'm not going to take my children on the subway. And the fact that this happened in the Time Square subway -- it's like the commercial nerve center of the entire city, the tourism mecca of the city - - this is why terrorists attack Time Square because of the population density, the fear factor psychologically.

In a way, Glenn Youngkin is the Eric Adams for the Republicans. He is a fresh face, elected during a time of turmoil, and then -- has an opportunity to just say you know what I'm going for it. There's also something different in Virginia that I don't necessarily like, but it is the way it is. They -- you can only have one term as governor. So, he doesn't have a re-election that he has to worry about. So, we can get in there. And he's got a short amount of time to do as much as he possibly can.

It paints everybody else is the oppressed. And research shows that the identity of victimhood gets you nowhere in life. I think it's not a good thing to start out a kid in that way. But I would also ask. Even though Psaki has already flamed him, the rest of Virginia should just give him a chance. Let's see how the policies affect the state. If it doesn't work, the Republicans are pragmatic. They listen and they will not call you a racist. That's the refreshing part.

But you're talking about parents, who are -- they saw what happened in the education system when their kids were on lockdown learning remotely from their living rooms and bedrooms. Parents were not impressed by that. And you know, when they tried to take back the power and pull the shade back down and keep them out of the process, that's when there was an electoral revolts. So, yes, give them a chance. Give school choice a chance. Let the money follow the students because they screwed everything up, and he's absolutely right.

Where I agree with him wholeheartedly it's and it's been raised here, we need critical math being taught in school. When it critical languages being taught in school. We need critical history.
