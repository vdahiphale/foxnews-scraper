We don't know the details.   To the extent that it follows the broad framework and cuts $470 billion out of Medicare and a trillion out of Medicaid over 10 years, I would oppose that. To the extent it fails to really deliver significant tax relief to the middle class, I would oppose it. But I think there are things that we could and should be doing on a bipartisan basis. Neil, yesterday, I introduced a bill here in the Senate where my lead legislative partner in the House is Ted Poe, one of the most conservative House members from Houston, Texas. My partner here in the Senate is Jerry Moran of Kansas, a conservative Republican.  And it's a bill that would help finance energy production in the United States that is good for oil and gas and pipelines and for renewables.   I have got proposals, bipartisan proposals, that would help strengthen manufacturing. Neil, I do think there's things we can do in tax reform that will make it something that can get bipartisan support. But, so far, it's only been written by one party, and I think that will make it harder for it to succeed.",

That would mean a significant tax increase for a number of Delawareans and Delaware families if we got rid of state and local.
