This is “The Five.” Get ready to learn some very bad things. President Trump reacting to major developments in a DOJ review of the start of the Russia probe is now a criminal investigation. The change is significant because gives U.S. Attorney John Durham the power to subpoena witnesses and panel grand juries and file charges.  We're also learning that Durham's investigation has expanded because of new evidence and he is very interested in talking to former Obama intelligence officials John Brennan and James Clapper.

All of it false, the collusion narrative, the hoax for over two years and $45 million who were led down this path. You know, Russia, Russia, Russia, it became a bad joke.

But now it's very interesting because I don't think he was trying to engage in any sort of new marital concoction, but what I am saying is there were forces working against the president and it's now looking as though some of these things that at one point in our very recent path we would call conspiracy theories are bearing out in a way that it's happening so quickly with such depth and breadth. It's hard to wrap your head around.

This impeachment is predicated on the point that they know that they can't win an election so they're like the stupid kid who is terrified of failing a final. So what does he do? He calls in a bomb threat. This is their bomb threat. This is their way of not facing the music, not facing an election. But there's good news here, I think. I think the tide is turning against the Democrats because the process is so out of proportion to the infraction. There's so much effort to produce so little. It reminds me of the Oscars, right. It starts out interesting like you're watching the Oscars the first half an hour is great.   But when it's over, when the Oscars are over, you only remember one thing. How it went on too long, how bloated and grotesque it was, how pointless and how it wasted your time. That's how this process is going to look to America.

It's hard to wrap your head around.

He calls in a bomb threat. This is their bomb threat. This is their way of not facing the music, not facing an election. But there's good news here, I think. I think the tide is turning against the Democrats because the process is so out of proportion to the infraction. There's so much effort to produce so little. It reminds me of the Oscars, right. It starts out interesting like you're watching the Oscars the first half an hour is great. But when it's over, when the Oscars are over, you only remember one thing. How it went on too long, how bloated and grotesque it was, how pointless and how it wasted your time. That's how this process is going to look to America. The longer it goes on, the more likely the American public will detest it because you treat it like the Oscars, get it over with."

The pastor says that the cross was made by a member when they launched the campus ten years ago, some recalled it has been a reminder the Christ is still present amidst of their suffering and chaos.

What makes it even more interesting is that on the bench, Justice Thomas notoriously reticent to speak out, Clarence Thomas, was far more animated everybody said when he saw me in the court being admitted to practice before his High Court Supreme Court of the United States, then he was later Bush V Gore which was deciding who would be the 43rd President of the United States.
