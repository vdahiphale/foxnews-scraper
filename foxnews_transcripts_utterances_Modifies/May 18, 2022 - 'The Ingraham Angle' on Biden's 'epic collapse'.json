Late tonight, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the U.S. Marshal Service to assist in providing 24-hour security to justices because of all the threats that they've received. So in other words, all that calm and healing and serenity that Biden promised, it's been further eroded. This came after we learned that the Biden Department of Homeland Security took a break from targeting political opponents to issue what's a stunning document. In the memo obtained by Axios, we learned that the U.S. government is bracing for a potential surge in political violence once the court hands down the ruling, which is expected to overturn Roe v Wade. Now, when this document was leaked, the White House was given the chance to condemn it. But they chose not to, and even went so far as to say that Biden was energized by the unprecedented protests outside the justices' homes. Now, they brought this anger to the fore and now the only responsible thing to do is to release this ruling. Right. The court has to release the ruling now. And the leaker, are we ever going to find out who the leaker is? Chief Justice John Roberts, we await that. Now, we're going to have more on our panel on this topic in just a moment. But first, Biden's epic collapse. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'.",

This is a total and complete travesty. And by the way, the recession the inflation. It was preventable, but now it's too late.

Now, when Biden said, he'd have the most diverse cabinet in history, we didn't realize that also meant turning America into the third world, which brings us to setback number two.

As if it's being retooled to emerge better and stronger at some later date. This Orwellian nightmare is never going to see the light of day again, never. Hey, it's shocking that it actually lasted what three whole weeks, or about as long as CNN plus. And guess who the Washington Post resident TikTok reporter is blaming for this very real victory? The right wing media, of course. Now, contrary to The Post whining, that's not what killed it. The DHS thought police collapsed under its own weight and its own stupidity, and likely its own unconstitutionality. All right. The third pillar of the collapse is Democrat billionaires are basically saying, we can't take this anymore. Today, Elon Musk sent a simple tweet that read: \"In the past I voted Democrat, because they were mostly the kindness party. But they've become the party of division and hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican. Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold.\" All we can say is, Elon, welcome to the club. Now, this followed, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' slamming Biden on inflation last week. Remember, he said, \"The administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus into an already overheated inflationary economy and only Joe Manchin saved them from themselves. Inflation is a regressive tax that most hurts the least affluent. Misdirection doesn't help the country.\" Now, if only Jeff had listened to the 'Angle' a year ago, when we were begging Biden's economic team to listen to Larry Summers, who of course, saw all of this coming. But better late than never. Number four. Yesterday, Biden's dereliction on our southern border exploded into the headlines once again. We learned about a major drug smuggling tunnel linking Tijuana with San Diego. Did you see, it looked like it did have carpeting in it and full electricity. We have no idea the amount of deadly drugs that actually have come through it, and how many American lives have been destroyed with the help of it. But the sheer number of illegals crossing the border, that hit another high. DHS says, now that over 234,000 were encountered at the southern border in April alone. That, my friends, is the highest number ever recorded in the agency's history. Now, these numbers are - they're incomprehensible. The equivalent of medium-sized towns and cities now crossing nearly every month into the United States. And by the way, some were sent back. But nearly 118,000 were released just last month into the interior part of the United States. This is purposeful sabotage of America, the country we love, where - You have to think about legal immigrants, who have come here, who've worked so hard to come here and do it the right way, thinking to themselves, why did I bother doing it the right way? They're just walking right across. And every migrant who crosses will take resources from Americans in need. Have you been to your local train station lately? I have. Do you have tent cities out there, like we do in our nation's capital, homelessness, drug addiction. It's exploding across America. So why aren't we taking care of our own? And the fifth major sign of the coming Democrat wipe out were the results and turnout from Tuesday's primaries. Now, whichever way the Pennsylvania Senate race goes, one thing is for sure, America First is the dominant force now in Republican politics. Now, Oz promises he'll follow the policies of Trump on all major issues, and so does David McCormick, who's going to join us shortly by the way. In North Carolina, the GOP Senate nominee Ted Budd is MAGA all the way.",

That's what we need. The fact that the governor's races in places like Nebraska and Idaho didn't go Ultra MAGA, I think it says more about how tricky it is to wade into those state races. It says more about that than it does about the power of Trump's ideas. Remember, these five strikes that I just laid out, are only from the past 48 hours. And as his party's prospects become bleaker as the weeks wear on, Democrats - Biden's Democrats, I expect them to escalate things. It's going to get a lot uglier. You're going to have more racial recriminations, aggressive protests, demands for more mail-in ballots and dropboxes. Oh, Yes, just you watch. But as we saw with the massive GOP turnout in the primary so far, the momentum is with the Conservatives. Americans know they cannot afford any more of this epic failure. And that's the 'Angle'.

I think they were frustrated that even with Texas, essentially banning most abortions after a heartbeat is detected, or very - for much of the pregnancy. And with everyone knowing that Roe is about to be overturned or believing that to be the case, they were upset that they weren't getting a huge amount of outrage from it. There's so much failure in the Democrat party that they're resorting to trying to take that base. The people who really support abortion and get them outraged just to get some excitement going for their party.

Because as you point out every night, the justices ripped the decision away from the American people and put it in the hands of nine unelected Roe justices.

You wanted it, as did Barnette and others. And you didn't get it. But with these absentee votes, at least right now, you seem to be outpacing Oz. If that holds, what did you do to secure that?",

And I told you that even though it wasn't showing up in the polls, I felt huge excitement, and that definitely showed up yesterday. And I was really pleased with it. It was a record turnout in Pennsylvania. As you said with the three leading candidates, all running on an America First agenda. And our campaign had put a lot of energy and time into focusing on these absentee voters and focusing on our ground game. And so that has paid off big dividends. And there's a huge number of absentee ballots, which we're winning disproportionately. And that's why I have a lot of confidence, I'm going to win this. Because there's tens of thousands of outstanding absentee ballots. And I'll win those disproportionally and that'll put me over the top. And that's what you saw happen over the last 12 hours or so, is that Mehmet Oz's lead got cut by more than half because of the absentee ballots that came in.",

I said that, there are tens of thousands of absentee ballots that will be counted. And when they're counted, I will ultimately take the lead. And we're on that path, and I think it'll be a great moment for Pennsylvania and a great moment for our party because it'll offer the opportunity once we get through this and resolve this to bring our great party together. And I look forward to doing that. I think there's a great opportunity to bring our party together around in the America First agenda that can go into November and beat John Fetterman. And the great news is, there's lots of independents and conservative Democrats who are deeply offended by the extreme liberal socialist agenda.

Tell us why this is problematic, and it seems to be leading, in this case, to an attempted murder.",

And in this case, we seek the circumstance where obviously, since this guy got away, a couple of people have paid for it, dearly including obviously this young man who got shot. But I've got to tell you something, the people creating these policies are not people who should be doing it. And at the same time, we're coming up with wrongheaded policies, whether it be pursue policy based on the Toledo shooting, whether it be you have to do a report every time you unholster and point your weapon, which in my book, is a direct result that resulted in Ella French's murder, or the police reform act signed by the governor. Those pale by comparison to what has happened to the landscape of policing in this country, which I believe is what happened in this particular case. You are better off not doing anything than getting involved. And the officers on the street feel that way. Those officers could have very easily pursued that vehicle. It was 2:00 in the morning, probably not as many people on the street as 2:00 in the afternoon. But they chose not to do it because you are better off not doing anything.",

Late tonight, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the U.S. Marshal Service to assist in providing 24-hour security to justices because of all the threats that they've received. So in other words, all that calm and healing and serenity that Biden promised, it's been further eroded. This came after we learned that the Biden Department of Homeland Security took a break from targeting political opponents to issue what's a stunning document. In the memo obtained by Axios, we learned that the U.S. government is bracing for a potential surge in political violence once the court hands down the ruling, which is expected to overturn Roe v Wade. Now, when this document was leaked, the White House was given the chance to condemn it. But they chose not to, and even went so far as to say that Biden was energized by the unprecedented protests outside the justices' homes. Now, they brought this anger to the fore and now the only responsible thing to do is to release this ruling. Right. The court has to release the ruling now. And the leaker, are we ever going to find out who the leaker is? Chief Justice John Roberts, we await that. Now, we're going to have more on our panel on this topic in just a moment. But first, Biden's epic collapse. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'."

First, and the stock market is an indicator of this. We're riding toward recession on the wave of spending that we couldn't afford and we didn't need, on COVID, on infrastructure, on climate, on bailouts, and with $40 billion more soon slated to go out the window to Ukraine. This is a total and complete travesty. And by the way, the recession the inflation. It was preventable, but now it's too late. Meanwhile, mothers they're still struggling to find baby food, basic nutrition for their infants. Now, when Biden said, he'd have the most diverse cabinet in history, we didn't realize that also meant turning America into the third world, which brings us to setback number two.

The right wing media, of course. Now, contrary to The Post whining, that's not what killed it. The DHS thought police collapsed under its own weight and its own stupidity, and likely its own unconstitutionality."

But they've become the party of division and hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican. Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold.\" All we can say is, Elon, welcome to the club. Now, this followed, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' slamming Biden on inflation last week. Remember, he said, \"The administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus into an already overheated inflationary economy and only Joe Manchin saved them from themselves. Inflation is a regressive tax that most hurts the least affluent. Misdirection doesn't help the country.\" Now, if only Jeff had listened to the 'Angle' a year ago, when we were begging Biden's economic team to listen to Larry Summers, who of course, saw all of this coming. But better late than never. Number four. Yesterday, Biden's dereliction on our southern border exploded into the headlines once again. We learned about a major drug smuggling tunnel linking Tijuana with San Diego. Did you see, it looked like it did have carpeting in it and full electricity. We have no idea the amount of deadly drugs that actually have come through it, and how many American lives have been destroyed with the help of it. But the sheer number of illegals crossing the border, that hit another high. DHS says, now that over 234,000 were encountered at the southern border in April alone. That, my friends, is the highest number ever recorded in the agency's history. Now, these numbers are - they're incomprehensible. The equivalent of medium-sized towns and cities now crossing nearly every month into the United States. And by the way, some were sent back. But nearly 118,000 were released just last month into the interior part of the United States. This is purposeful sabotage of America, the country we love, where - You have to think about legal immigrants, who have come here, who've worked so hard to come here and do it the right way, thinking to themselves, why did I bother doing it the right way? They're just walking right across. And every migrant who crosses will take resources from Americans in need. Have you been to your local train station lately? I have. Do you have tent cities out there, like we do in our nation's capital, homelessness, drug addiction. It's exploding across America. So why aren't we taking care of our own? And the fifth major sign of the coming Democrat wipe out were the results and turnout from Tuesday's primaries. Now, whichever way the Pennsylvania Senate race goes, one thing is for sure, America First is the dominant force now in Republican politics. Now, Oz promises he'll follow the policies of Trump on all major issues, and so does David McCormick, who's going to join us shortly by the way.

That's what we need. The fact that the governor's races in places like Nebraska and Idaho didn't go Ultra MAGA, I think it says more about how tricky it is to wade into those state races. It says more about that than it does about the power of Trump's ideas. Remember, these five strikes that I just laid out, are only from the past 48 hours. And as his party's prospects become bleaker as the weeks wear on, Democrats - Biden's Democrats, I expect them to escalate things. It's going to get a lot uglier. You're going to have more racial recriminations, aggressive protests, demands for more mail-in ballots and dropboxes. Oh, Yes, just you watch. But as we saw with the massive GOP turnout in the primary so far, the momentum is with the Conservatives. Americans know they cannot afford any more of this epic failure. And that's the 'Angle'. All right. Joining us now is Mollie Hemingway, Fox News contributor and editor-in-chief at The Federalist; and Charlie Hurt, Fox News contributor as well and Washington Times opinion editor. Mollie, as we report at the top with the anger that Biden's DHS expects that we've already seen after the leak of that draft Roe opinion, now Democrats seem to be setting the stage for a really dirty and some say, potentially violent midterm election season.

      "utterance": "I think that's true. And I think that we've seen that with Democrats for the last few cycles, how they have actually been able to use street violence as part of their agenda, their campaign agenda. And it's pretty clear that this leak and the response to it was designed to gin up outrage. I think they were frustrated that even with Texas, essentially banning most abortions after a heartbeat is detected, or very - for much of the pregnancy. And with everyone knowing that Roe is about to be overturned or believing that to be the case, they were upset that they weren't getting a huge amount of outrage from it. There's so much failure in the Democrat party that they're resorting to trying to take that base. The people who really support abortion and get them outraged just to get some excitement going for their party. But I don't think it's going to be anywhere near enough with the economy failing and so many other things failing in the country."

Not that this is an important issue, but I think that the - most American people, whether wherever you come down on the issue of abortion, you believe that actually putting these questions in the hands of the electorate of the American people to pick their representatives, to make laws, that's actually an eminently sensible way of dealing with an issue that has divided this country for 50 years exactly. Because as you point out every night, the justices ripped the decision away from the American people and put it in the hands of nine unelected Roe justices. But we're entering a very - kind of a scary time right now. Because there's nothing more dangerous than dangerous - than desperate politicians, who have enjoyed power and have enjoyed complete power in Washington for a year now, for two years now. As they watch this unfold, and they watch the disasters that they have created, and even they realize that they're their fault, and that the American people are going to blame them for it in the election.

It has made tremendous gains in recent years with a wide variety of Americans of different ethnicities and economic classes, because it's creating policies that are appealing to those people. What we saw in the last five or six years with an embrace of protecting the border, of caring about middle class workers, of taking on global threats to the country, of not doing these never-ending wars without a clear entrance or exit strategy.

Takes a tragedy like this and uses it to advance some weird political agenda that they've got going. You've got to be really, really messed up in the head to see an opportunity, see this as an opportunity to do that kind of thing. But look at their two biggest agenda items, race - playing race politics, and global warming, which are both these fearmongering, really disgusting tactics. And the reason they do that, the reason Democrats resort to that is because they have no hope of actually fixing any of the real problems that affect people's lives. And in fact, they've made them worse, and those things are a distraction from it. And going back to Mollie's great point about the Republican party today, the reason so many Hispanic voters have come to the Republican Party is because they believe in a secure border too. And think about this, how racist is it that you have an entire Democrat Party who believes, Oh, you're a Hispanic voter, therefore you must love open borders? That's the most racist thing I've ever heard. I know. Plenty of - I know plenty of Hispanic voters. They want a secure border as much as anybody else."

Now, not many people know Pennsylvania's politics better than my next guest, Selena Zito, who's Washington Examiner national political reporter. Selena, thanks for being with us. Now, before we get into the surprises from last night, take us through where the outstanding vote will come from."

So I'll keep my eye on Luzerne County and Lancaster County. But also just to look at the military ballots in particular from Allegheny County, where McCormick has done very, very well, to understand what's going on in this election."

And that's a small - relatively small county. But the thought is, I guess, on a lot of these mail-in ballots, he's outpacing Oz. Why is that?"

And if you know anything about this conservative populist movement that's come through Pennsylvania, actually really beginning in 2006, when Republicans lost the House. But you saw voters becoming more anti-establishment, right, and moving towards for different candidates. And so, his energy has come from the west. So as you look at some of these counties that still have some outstanding, either mail-in ballots, or military ballots, those benefit McCormick. I mean, this is going to be incredibly tight results. However, if you ask me tonight whose campaign I would want to be in, it would probably be McCormick's."

Dave, thanks for being with us tonight. I know you're exhausted. It's - this is neck and neck between you and Oz right now. He got back from - he got the backing from Trump. You wanted it, as did Barnette and others. And you didn't get it. But with these absentee votes, at least right now, you seem to be outpacing Oz. If that holds, what did you do to secure that?"

And I told you that even though it wasn't showing up in the polls, I felt huge excitement, and that definitely showed up yesterday. And I was really pleased with it. It was a record turnout in Pennsylvania. As you said with the three leading candidates, all running on an America First agenda. And our campaign had put a lot of energy and time into focusing on these absentee voters and focusing on our ground game. And so that has paid off big dividends. And there's a huge number of absentee ballots, which we're winning disproportionately. And that's why I have a lot of confidence, I'm going to win this. Because there's tens of thousands of outstanding absentee ballots. And I'll win those disproportionally and that'll put me over the top. And that's what you saw happen over the last 12 hours or so, is that Mehmet Oz's lead got cut by more than half because of the absentee ballots that came in."

And I'm really pleased with where things stand. And if you look at just what's happened today, what I've been saying. And I said last night when we shut down for the evening. I said that, there are tens of thousands of absentee ballots that will be counted. And when they're counted, I will ultimately take the lead. And we're on that path, and I think it'll be a great moment for Pennsylvania and a great moment for our party because it'll offer the opportunity once we get through this and resolve this to bring our great party together. And I look forward to doing that. I think there's a great opportunity to bring our party together around in the America First agenda that can go into November and beat John Fetterman. And the great news is, there's lots of independents and conservative Democrats who are deeply offended by the extreme liberal socialist agenda. And that's an opportunity for us, as Republicans, to consolidate apart. I've met a number of Democrats, former Democrats that came into our party because of President Trump, and there's more opportunity there."

They haven't just been a failure for Republicans. They have been a failure for all Pennsylvanians and all Americans. And you can't run away from that. It is obvious with the inflation numbers. It is obvious with the war on energy that has made us dependent, driven up the price of fuel. It's obvious with the Fentanyl crisis we have in Pennsylvania. And John Fetterman is going to have to own that."

Now, Dave, given your background, I want to get your reaction to this. J.P. Morgan is saying that gas prices will surpass six dollars a gallon nationwide by August. That sent shutters down, shivers down everybody's spine today. What would that mean for Pennsylvanians?"

And the thing that really offends me about what is happening in gas prices is Joe Biden is trying to blame it on Putin. And when in fact, it's the direct consequence of these terrible policies that have made as energy dependent. We went overnight under President Trump from being energy exporters and on the way to energy dominance to being energy dependent. That's what's driving up the price of fuel. And you know this, of course. It hurts all of us, but it hurts working families in Pennsylvania and across our country the worst. It hurts small businesses that are getting crunched."

Tonight, we have some updates. One suspect finally has been caught, 19- year-old Tyshon Brownlee was charged yesterday with attempted murder and five counts of armed robbery. So why five, you might be asking? Because the day of the attack and the day before it, Brownlee was allegedly involved in four other robberies, one being just five minutes before Mr. Earley was shot. Just one hour before that, Chicago police decided not to chase the stolen BMW that this alleged attacker used. Joining me now, Garry McCarthy, former superintendent of the Chicago P.D. and current police chief of Willow Springs, Illinois. Garry, I want to be clear, I'm not blaming the officers here. It seems these chase rules about when you can chase or when you should chase involved like a big balancing test.

And in this case, we seek the circumstance where obviously, since this guy got away, a couple of people have paid for it, dearly including obviously this young man who got shot. But I've got to tell you something, the people creating these policies are not people who should be doing it. And at the same time, we're coming up with wrongheaded policies, whether it be pursue policy based on the Toledo shooting, whether it be you have to do a report every time you unholster and point your weapon, which in my book, is a direct result that resulted in Ella French's murder, or the police reform act signed by the governor. Those pale by comparison to what has happened to the landscape of policing in this country, which I believe is what happened in this particular case. You are better off not doing anything than getting involved. And the officers on the street feel that way. Those officers could have very easily pursued that vehicle. It was 2:00 in the morning, probably not as many people on the street as 2:00 in the afternoon. But they chose not to do it because you are better off not doing anything."
