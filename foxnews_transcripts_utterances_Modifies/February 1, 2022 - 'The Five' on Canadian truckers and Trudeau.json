She may feel safe in the White House, one of the most protected buildings in the United States, but not everyone feels safe in their workplace.\" And a new poll putting Americans at odds with the White House's assessment. Voters saying they are frustrated with how the president has responded to a spike in violence. Sixty-four percent disapprove of how Biden is tackling crime overall. And now some businesses feel forced to take matters into their own hands. A California jewelry store owner frustrated with local officials after fending off would-be robbers by himself.",

Right now, Joe is just trying to throw cash at the situation to get out of this. You know those guys in the movies, they just take a wad of cash and just throw it in your face and say, here, shut up. Go buy yourself a fleet of new squad cars. And that's what the Democrats do though. Afghanistan, the public education system, war on poverty, here's $1 trillion, now stop complaining. We care because we're spending a lot of money, the Democrats say. The Republicans don't care as much as we do. We just want you to take the money and shut the heck up. Right now, you could buy every single officer in the country, x-ray vision, a drug sniffing dog, and have them walk around with a stack of cash so just bribe informants, and it wouldn't do a damn thing because the D.A. is just going to let guys walk. The dumb laws are just going to let people walk. So until you fix that, throwing cash around is not a strategy. I think the calculation for Democrats is this. They actually think that black voters won't vote for them if they are tough on crime, like black mothers and fathers like the gun play. They like the stickups in their neighborhood. No one likes that. No one wants that. They want people to be tough on crime, but they also want people to be fair. Why can't Democrats strike that balance and why are they treating black neighborhoods different than white neighborhoods? Democrats wouldn't tolerate this kind of violence in their neighborhood. That's really disgusting. On COVID, can't have any rest on COVID. You have to wear a face shield. You have to stay home for days. You have to keep your kids home. But let's roll the dice on crime, right? Let's take an ex-con that's deranged in the head and like he shoots up a gas station, but let's let them out with no bail and just run the risk of doing it all over again. Doesn't make sense, does it?",

      "sentences": "Nobody does care. Let me say, they don't care until it affects them. Nearly all the victims of violent crime are black, right? And they would be alive right now if it wasn't for the manipulation of the police narratives by the media and the activists, right? So what happened was -- just to show you how disconnected the media is from the real world, in the days after these multiple cop killings and shootings, what did CNN ran? A special that highlighted police misconduct. This is like right around when the funerals are happening. And what they did is a typical kind of like clip job special where they take isolated incidents, put them together, no stats, and just make it out as misconduct against blacks. It's like the greatest hits for people who hate the police. And they were -- the argument was cops should not be pulling over people if they are armed, which obviously would not affect CNN at all because it's not like that's their problem. Everybody who works there is protected with armed security. So if you -- they're so -- if you actually knew a police officer, most of us do, all of us do, you would not have fallen for this anti-police narrative. And I do think the white-collar elitism that you find in the media has separated those people from knowing anybody, from plumbers to cops, not understanding their problems. Such a truths is that people either in this denial or this delusion don't live where the crime is. And their false reporting that it was hunting season on blacks by cops made it worse in the areas where there was black on black crime. We have - there's a study now that shows that Democrats believe that cops killed 1,000 black people when it was unarmed, well, maybe between 11 to two dozen, I think, averaging over the year. But that's because of the way it was reported. Roughly 50 percent of the homicides are done by 17 to 15 percent of the population. The cops need to focus on that area. But now they can't, right? They can't focus on that area, which created more black on black crime because they are not there policing. So who caused all this death? Who caused the Ferguson effect or the George Floyd effect now? Who caused that? Who caused the cops to retreat from the areas where they were needed most? It was the media. It was Black Lives Matter. It was the activists. And now you have thousands of black people who are dead that shouldn't be dead and it's on their doorstep.",

They have no interest in protecting the victims. And if the victim happens to be a police officer, then it's an even worse situation, you know, just let this guy ignore everything that has to do with his situation. But I think what's amazing about Jen Psaki and the Democrats is her response to that initial, you know, these people are in an alternate universe, she says that there was $350 million in the American Rescue Plan and \"The Washington Post\" gave it three at Pinocchio's when she said \"that money could have gone to police and not one Republican voted for it.\" Here is your response to that. Your response to that is that money wasn't earmarked for police. It could have been used for anyone of a number of things, and police were not specifically mandated to receive that money. That's number one. Number two, what we've got now is we've got Merrick Garland is coming to New York City I understand tomorrow along with Governor Hochul and the president and they're all going to come in and say we're going to take care of you all. We're going to protect you all. Nonsense. If you remember, Merrick Garland is the guy who came out and said, \"Yes, those parents are domestic terrorists (inaudible) FBI. I'm going to stick you way after those domestic terrorist parents.\" Then you've got Hochul who says yeah to the D.A. He bragged, \"The new prosecutor is not going to be tough on crime.\" She says \"Yes, you've got to be tough on crime,\" but then she goes wink-wink to her legislative friends in Albany. No, we're not going to change any of the bail laws. So we're going to let them out loose. So the Democrats want them out. That's part of their agenda.",

I think that the deaths of these two officers, Mora and Rivera, will be a seminal moment historically. I think that this is where the defund the police movement died. This is where cops were, again, the virtuous friend of the family. And I am deeply moved by their families and how they have spoken. I'm proud of the city. I'm proud of them. And I think that they really have changed things. I just want to say one thing about the self-defense shopkeepers. When I was a young reporter in this town, it was very common in bodegas, in the neighborhoods I knew best, where there, a guy would be hired, he'd be behind the counter or in the back room. He'd have a shotgun. And if something like this came in, he would come and fire off in above the heads. But this kind of nonsense would not happen, even in the city when it was really riddled in the crime when we were over 2,000 homicides a year. I want also to remember what I've said about technology. I think the way to beat this creepy trend is technology. There should be the explosive dyes that they have in money in the banks. Every one of these jewelry stores should be -- that the counters should be wired so that they have this exploding things. Sirens should go off.

You know, it is interesting that Jews -- generally speaking, someone wrote something very interesting. Jews who have never been seen as White by those for whom White is a moral good, are now seen as white by those for whom whiteness is an unmitigated evil. So, Black Lives Matter thinks of the Jews as being white, and yet, throughout history, Jews have been considered the inferior race, and were then subjected to the most horrific treatment because of their race. And race is more than just the color of your skin. Race is something deeply, deeply felt. I mean, the Germans could tell a Jew from a Christian, they took the man's pants down, so they were circumcised. They took the little babies out of the mother's hands. They committed atrocities that are so historic, that they dwarf everything -- slavery, and that in the Holocaust I think are the two worst stains on the human race.

She may feel safe in the White House, one of the most protected buildings in the United States, but not everyone feels safe in their workplace.\" And a new poll putting Americans at odds with the White House's assessment. Voters saying they are frustrated with how the president has responded to a spike in violence. Sixty-four percent disapprove of how Biden is tackling crime overall.

      "utterance": "Yes, but the Democrats are like, we're going to save your life from COVID, but you're on your own with crime. What sense does that make? Right now, Joe is just trying to throw cash at the situation to get out of this. You know those guys in the movies, they just take a wad of cash and just throw it in your face and say, here, shut up. Go buy yourself a fleet of new squad cars. And that's what the Democrats do though. Afghanistan, the public education system, war on poverty, here's $1 trillion, now stop complaining. We care because we're spending a lot of money, the Democrats say. The Republicans don't care as much as we do. We just want you to take the money and shut the heck up. Right now, you could buy every single officer in the country, x-ray vision, a drug sniffing dog, and have them walk around with a stack of cash so just bribe informants, and it wouldn't do a damn thing because the D.A. is just going to let guys walk. The dumb laws are just going to let people walk. So until you fix that, throwing cash around is not a strategy. I think the calculation for Democrats is this. They actually think that black voters won't vote for them if they are tough on crime, like black mothers and fathers like the gun play. They like the stickups in their neighborhood. No one likes that. No one wants that. They want people to be tough on crime, but they also want people to be fair. Why can't Democrats strike that balance and why are they treating black neighborhoods different than white neighborhoods? Democrats wouldn't tolerate this kind of violence in their neighborhood. That's really disgusting. On COVID, can't have any rest on COVID. You have to wear a face shield. You have to stay home for days. You have to keep your kids home. But let's roll the dice on crime, right? Let's take an ex-con that's deranged in the head and like he shoots up a gas station, but let's let them out with no bail and just run the risk of doing it all over again.

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Nobody does care. Let me say, they don't care until it affects them. Nearly all the victims of violent crime are black, right? And they would be alive right now if it wasn't for the manipulation of the police narratives by the media and the activists, right? So what happened was -- just to show you how disconnected the media is from the real world, in the days after these multiple cop killings and shootings, what did CNN ran? A special that highlighted police misconduct. This is like right around when the funerals are happening. And what they did is a typical kind of like clip job special where they take isolated incidents, put them together, no stats, and just make it out as misconduct against blacks. It's like the greatest hits for people who hate the police. And they were -- the argument was cops should not be pulling over people if they are armed, which obviously would not affect CNN at all because it's not like that's their problem. Everybody who works there is protected with armed security. So if you -- they're so -- if you actually knew a police officer, most of us do, all of us do, you would not have fallen for this anti-police narrative. And I do think the white-collar elitism that you find in the media has separated those people from knowing anybody, from plumbers to cops, not understanding their problems. Such a truths is that people either in this denial or this delusion don't live where the crime is. And their false reporting that it was hunting season on blacks by cops made it worse in the areas where there was black on black crime. We have - there's a study now that shows that Democrats believe that cops killed 1,000 black people when it was unarmed, well, maybe between 11 to two dozen, I think, averaging over the year. But that's because of the way it was reported. Roughly 50 percent of the homicides are done by 17 to 15 percent of the population. The cops need to focus on that area. But now they can't, right? They can't focus on that area, which created more black on black crime because they are not there policing. So who caused all this death? Who caused the Ferguson effect or the George Floyd effect now? Who caused that? Who caused the cops to retreat from the areas where they were needed most? It was the media. It was Black Lives Matter. It was the activists. And now you have thousands of black people who are dead that shouldn't be dead and it's on their doorstep."

One of her big complaints when she left is that the D.A. out, Chesa Boudin, has basically, that somebody in his office is withholding evidence about an officer- involved situation, Officer Stangle's case.

They have no interest in protecting the victims. And if the victim happens to be a police officer, then it's an even worse situation, you know, just let this guy ignore everything that has to do with his situation. But I think what's amazing about Jen Psaki and the Democrats is her response to that initial, you know, these people are in an alternate universe, she says that there was $350 million in the American Rescue Plan and \"The Washington Post\" gave it three at Pinocchio's when she said \"that money could have gone to police and not one Republican voted for it.\" Here is your response to that. Your response to that is that money wasn't earmarked for police. It could have been used for anyone of a number of things, and police were not specifically mandated to receive that money. That's number one. Number two, what we've got now is we've got Merrick Garland is coming to New York City I understand tomorrow along with Governor Hochul and the president and they're all going to come in and say we're going to take care of you all. We're going to protect you all. Nonsense. If you remember, Merrick Garland is the guy who came out and said, \"Yes, those parents are domestic terrorists (inaudible) FBI. I'm going to stick you way after those domestic terrorist parents.\" Then you've got Hochul who says yeah to the D.A. He bragged, \"The new prosecutor is not going to be tough on crime.\" She says \"Yes, you've got to be tough on crime,\" but then she goes wink-wink to her legislative friends in Albany. No, we're not going to change any of the bail laws. So we're going to let them out loose. So the Democrats want them out. That's part of their agenda."

I think that he's coming here is a good signal. They're also going to a crime riddled neighborhood in Queens I believe. So, I think that's good. I think that the deaths of these two officers, Mora and Rivera, will be a seminal moment historically. I think that this is where the defund the police movement died. This is where cops were, again, the virtuous friend of the family. And I am deeply moved by their families and how they have spoken. I'm proud of the city. I'm proud of them. And I think that they really have changed things. I just want to say one thing about the self-defense shopkeepers. When I was a young reporter in this town, it was very common in bodegas, in the neighborhoods I knew best, where there, a guy would be hired, he'd be behind the counter or in the back room. He'd have a shotgun. And if something like this came in, he would come and fire off in above the heads. But this kind of nonsense would not happen, even in the city when it was really riddled in the crime when we were over 2,000 homicides a year. I want also to remember what I've said about technology. I think the way to beat this creepy trend is technology. There should be the explosive dyes that they have in money in the banks. Every one of these jewelry stores should be -- that the counters should be wired so that they have this exploding things. Sirens should go off. We can't let them come in and fill their bags and leave because success just breeds more (inaudible)."

The afflicter of the injuries was the superior race going up to the Jews who were the inferior race. It was all about race. It is racism. Jews are a race. You know, it is interesting that Jews -- generally speaking, someone wrote something very interesting. Jews who have never been seen as White by those for whom White is a moral good, are now seen as white by those for whom whiteness is an unmitigated evil. So, Black Lives Matter thinks of the Jews as being white, and yet, throughout history, Jews have been considered the inferior race, and were then subjected to the most horrific treatment because of their race. And race is more than just the color of your skin. Race is something deeply, deeply felt. I mean, the Germans could tell a Jew from a Christian, they took the man's pants down, so they were circumcised. They took the little babies out of the mother's hands. They committed atrocities that are so historic, that they dwarf everything -- slavery, and that in the Holocaust I think are the two worst stains on the human race. But for Whoopi's uninformed stripping of my racial identity is something, love her though I might, I am deeply hurt by it."

And this whole idea that they had to delve deep to find out who was really a Jew, they didn't have to do that. You could start with a name like Goldberg, which you culturally appropriate it to yourself being born Karen Johnson. And at the end, the end of the day, what you've got is you've got a hatred of the so-called inferior race, and a worldview that says that whites of any type are oppressors, and therefore they can be -- they can all be coupled together irrespective of their a view by history.
