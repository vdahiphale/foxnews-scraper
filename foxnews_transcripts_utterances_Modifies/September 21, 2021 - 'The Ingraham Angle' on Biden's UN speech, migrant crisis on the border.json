      "sentences": "Wait, wait, wait, before Biden worries about lifting people up around the world, he should try lifting people up around America. A new poll found that on that very important question, our citizens are increasingly pessimistic. \"54 percent of registered voters say the country is heading in the wrong direction, 41 percent say it's on the right track. That's a stark difference from June. It's basically inverted when 53 percent of voters said the country was on the right track.\" Wow! Well, it's no wonder. Biden is a one man wrecking ball of a president. Everything he touches, I'm talking everything, every initiative he undertakes blows up on the American people. Now, the man who pledged to solve COVID, has presided over approximately 234,000 COVID deaths. And that's with the vaccines that the Trump administration handed him. Now, whenever the opportunity presents itself, Biden and company resort to threatening, bullying, punishing and isolating Americans, who for whatever reason, weren't convinced by their vaccine lobbying. And now millions of parents, even those who have been vaccinated themselves are outraged at coming vaccine mandates for kids. Now, when you really think about it, if Fauci could vaccinate infants in utero, he would. The risk benefit analysis is just completely irrelevant. Now, if Biden were smart, he would have nicely shown Dr. Fauci the door long ago. But let's face it, none of them can really quit COVID, because they like controlling people. And it's a good excuse to force mail-in ballots next year. That's an added bonus. Now, it may sound simplistic, but I think packed college football stadiums tell us a heck of a lot about the direction we're headed in politically next year. And it's not toward Biden. On the economy, Biden wants us all to surrender to the climate crazies, eliminate oil and gas as soon as possible, and live in a world where we travel less and earn less. Skyrocketing gas prices, inflation, tax hikes, it's all the cost of doing business in Biden's America. And Americans who are struggling to pay the bills, I guess they're supposed to just sit back and applaud when social justice fashionistas like AOC glide in and out of fancy galas and smile for the cameras. But where they don't want the cameras is where the real story gets really ugly for Biden, that's at our southern border. The citizens in Del Rio look like refugee camps in Sudan, squalor, hunger, children crying, makeshift shelters, please for help. Is this what Biden meant by build back better? It's criminal what they're doing. It's all part of Biden's nefarious and purposeful surrender of American sovereignty. But don't you dare ask him about it.",

Well, China has been waging a cold war against America, on our workers, and our military for decades. So the question is not whether we seek one, the question is whether or not we will fight back in it. Yet Joe Biden wouldn't even say the word, China. He's apparently too scared to even mention China's name in a speech addressed to the world's leaders. What kind of signal does that send to them?

I can tell you, it's not just Xi Jinping, every two-bit Chinese diplomat and apparatchik around the world goes in to the foreign ministries of countries and tells them that they should not listen to America.

The Afghanistan's a disaster, the border's a disaster, race relations are getting worse, stagflation is on the horizon. But we're going to have this happy therapeutic talk and we can talk our way through it. And I don't think that's going to work, because when things are going well, people have the luxury of whining about the President's tone. But when things are going bad and they're going bad, all the Jerry Ford like the win button and - we remember that out of the 70s, it doesn't work. And when we look at Biden's rhetoric, it's completely divorced from reality. He talks about brotherhood abroad. He left 8000 NATO troops (inaudible) in Afghanistan, and in most unilateral fashion that we haven't seen in 50 years. He talks about humanity, but we've got Dante's Inferno on the southern border. We haven't seen anything like it. So there's no connection between the rhetoric and the reality. And then finally, I think the UN stuff doesn't go well, when Tony Blinken says he was going to bite the UN and adjudicate race relations.

And there have been a few analyses done of the other ones, of the other deaths that could be related, and they found that they almost, in every case, had other very serious preexisting conditions, cancer, other very serious conditions. And so the number of truly healthy children who have died as a result of COVID is really microscopic. We don't have a great handle on it, but it's very, very small.

We, the Biden administration, are actively working with these social media platforms to limit what we the people can see. She said that from the press room talking about limiting the press in the White House, the plays that's supposed to be the center of freedom where free speech, where the bill of rights and the First Amendment matter. That is what is so frightening. But here's the good news. It's all starting to unravel. We have got this story. We have the fact that John Durham indicted Sussmann, not as some false statement, some simple false statement made to Durham and his investigators. No, it's not an a false statement indictment. It's the falls statement indictment. It's a false statement Sussmann made to FBI chief counsel Jim Baker back if 2016. So this, I think, is good news.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Wait, wait, wait, before Biden worries about lifting people up around the world, he should try lifting people up around America. A new poll found that on that very important question, our citizens are increasingly pessimistic. \"54 percent of registered voters say the country is heading in the wrong direction, 41 percent say it's on the right track. That's a stark difference from June. It's basically inverted when 53 percent of voters said the country was on the right track.\" Wow! Well, it's no wonder. Biden is a one man wrecking ball of a president. Everything he touches, I'm talking everything, every initiative he undertakes blows up on the American people. Now, the man who pledged to solve COVID, has presided over approximately 234,000 COVID deaths. And that's with the vaccines that the Trump administration handed him. Now, whenever the opportunity presents itself, Biden and company resort to threatening, bullying, punishing and isolating Americans, who for whatever reason, weren't convinced by their vaccine lobbying. And now millions of parents, even those who have been vaccinated themselves are outraged at coming vaccine mandates for kids. Now, when you really think about it, if Fauci could vaccinate infants in utero, he would. The risk benefit analysis is just completely irrelevant. Now, if Biden were smart, he would have nicely shown Dr. Fauci the door long ago. But let's face it, none of them can really quit COVID, because they like controlling people. And it's a good excuse to force mail-in ballots next year. That's an added bonus. Now, it may sound simplistic, but I think packed college football stadiums tell us a heck of a lot about the direction we're headed in politically next year. And it's not toward Biden. On the economy, Biden wants us all to surrender to the climate crazies, eliminate oil and gas as soon as possible, and live in a world where we travel less and earn less. Skyrocketing gas prices, inflation, tax hikes, it's all the cost of doing business in Biden's America. And Americans who are struggling to pay the bills, I guess they're supposed to just sit back and applaud when social justice fashionistas like AOC glide in and out of fancy galas and smile for the cameras. But where they don't want the cameras is where the real story gets really ugly for Biden, that's at our southern border. The citizens in Del Rio look like refugee camps in Sudan, squalor, hunger, children crying, makeshift shelters, please for help. Is this what Biden meant by build back better? It's criminal what they're doing. It's all part of Biden's nefarious and purposeful surrender of American sovereignty. But don't you dare ask him about it."

And in particular, as it relates to China, he bent over backwards to conciliate and appease the Chinese Communist Party. He said, we don't seek a new Cold War. Well, China has been waging a cold war against America, on our workers, and our military for decades. So the question is not whether we seek one, the question is whether or not we will fight back in it. Yet Joe Biden wouldn't even say the word, China. He's apparently too scared to even mention China's name in a speech addressed to the world's leaders. What kind of signal does that send to them?

Yet he presumes to lecture us, and that's because Joe Biden's administration basically accepts those terms. Remember, when Tony Blinken went up for a summit in Alaska and got lectured too, or Joe Biden's UN ambassador said that white supremacy was woven through the origins of this nation. I can tell you, it's not just Xi Jinping, every two-bit Chinese diplomat and apparatchik around the world goes in to the foreign ministries of countries and tells them that they should not listen to America. They should not lecture China about human rights, because America has its own problems with human rights.

But he lost the election, they feel, because he talked too tough. He was too blunt. He tweeted too much. So they feel, policy doesn't matter. The Afghanistan's a disaster, the border's a disaster, race relations are getting worse, stagflation is on the horizon. But we're going to have this happy therapeutic talk and we can talk our way through it. And I don't think that's going to work, because when things are going well, people have the luxury of whining about the President's tone. But when things are going bad and they're going bad, all the Jerry Ford like the win button and - we remember that out of the 70s, it doesn't work. And when we look at Biden's rhetoric, it's completely divorced from reality. He talks about brotherhood abroad. He left 8000 NATO troops (inaudible) in Afghanistan, and in most unilateral fashion that we haven't seen in 50 years. He talks about humanity, but we've got Dante's Inferno on the southern border. We haven't seen anything like it. So there's no connection between the rhetoric and the reality. And then finally, I think the UN stuff doesn't go well, when Tony Blinken says he was going to bite the UN and adjudicate race relations. And when they don't say a thing about the Uyghurs or we're going to praise the WHO when they said that China was very transparent about the coronavirus, and travel bans were xenophobic or racist.

So, you talk about unilateral disarmament, he allowed the foreigners to get questions and wouldn't allow the Americans. I mean, is he that infirm, Laura? Does the White House staff really think that the President is that weak that they have to go to these lengths to protect him? I was used to get in the practice out of the Oval Office. You have to let the meeting begin. But that was after two or three questions were asked to each Head of State. That is the routine. That's the norm. He is not strong enough to live up to those norms.

And especially then to lie about everything on the way out of the country, when he said Americans are having no difficulty getting to the airport when, of course, they were; when he said no foreigners were criticizing him when, of course, they were, especially German and British."

We use those rains to keep the people away from the horses, to protect those people. Those horses have stepped on people, they've kicked people before. They can injure people. You have to keep them away. And at the same time, you have to control the scene. We have a responsibility to everybody to control that scene, so it stays put. Those individuals were not listening to simple commands by law enforcement officers. So they had to do what was necessary to put them back in the situations where they could be under control.

What we saw today Del Rio, Texas, was kids in landfills, people in very bad conditions. Unfortunately, the Biden administration is not providing border patrol agents with the proper resources, or the facility so that we can hold these people.

There's also the fact that these people are being held in very, very bad conditions. We saw again very horrendous images of kids in what appeared to be like a landfill, a lot were infants.

In total the CDC estimates more than 900 kids aged zero to 17 died during the last two flu seasons. An even smaller timeframe than this pandemic. By comparison, 555 children have died with COVID throughout the entire pandemic. Horrible, of course, but Fauci is wrong. Kids aged five to 11, the group Pfizer wants an emergency use authorization for, have had a total of 112 COVID deaths since the pandemic started. There are over 28 million children in this age group. As Phil Kerpen points out, if you reasonably estimate 50 percent of those kids, which is well within the CDC estimates, 112 deaths out of 14 million would be one in 125,000. Phil Kerpen is here, president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. Phil, why is the left getting this wrong? Why?"

That doesn't mean that it can't kill children. All respiratory viruses do kill children sometimes, but by and large it's a very, very rare event. And this is not out of the ordinary for children. It's an out of ordinary risk for old people obviously, extremely deadly, but for children it's comparable to flu and RSV and all the other viruses that we've always been comfortable with children being exposed to."

    {
      "speaker": "KERPEN",
      "utterance": "Right. Even the numbers that we see from the CDC are almost certainly overstated. The CDC's own analysis of death certificates found that in the pediatric age group, at least 35 percent of the deaths had a cause of death that could not plausibly be related to COVID, things like homicides or accidents or things that just couldn't possibly been related to it. And there have been a few analyses done of the other ones, of the other deaths that could be related, and they found that they almost, in every case, had other very serious preexisting conditions, cancer, other very serious conditions. And so the number of truly healthy children who have died as a result of COVID is really microscopic. We don't have a great handle on it, but it's very, very small. One study Marty Makary did with his research team at Johns Hopkins, I think they identified one, one healthy children that had died with COVID. So it's probably more than that. They probably didn't find every single. But it's a very small amount."

She says basically these two sentences, most Americans now get much of their news from these social media platforms. We, the Biden administration, are actively working with these social media platforms to limit what we the people can see. She said that from the press room talking about limiting the press in the White House, the plays that's supposed to be the center of freedom where free speech, where the bill of rights and the First Amendment matter. That is what is so frightening. But here's the good news. It's all starting to unravel. We have got this story. We have the fact that John Durham indicted Sussmann, not as some false statement, some simple false statement made to Durham and his investigators. No, it's not an a false statement indictment. It's the falls statement indictment. It's a false statement Sussmann made to FBI chief counsel Jim Baker back if 2016. So this, I think, is good news. He is pointing to this same game that gets played with misinformation, feeding it to the press, feeding it to these federal agencies. This is an important, I think an important sign from the Durham investigation. I think this is all starting to unravel, and the American people are seeing it for what it is."
