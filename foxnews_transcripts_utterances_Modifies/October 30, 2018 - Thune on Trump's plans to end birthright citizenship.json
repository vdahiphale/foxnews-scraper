He's facing Democrat Andrew Gillum in a tough fight in the Florida governor's race.  Ron DeSantis will be here in a moment from now.  First, The Federalist's Emily Jashinsky on how things are shaping up. Let's start with that Florida race, Emily. It's a tight one.",

And, yesterday, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reminding that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are both Jewish as well, and that the president has Jewish grandchildren.  So this is something that hits very close to home for the president. There was some controversy about this visit as well. There was a group of people on the progressive wing of -- side of things, Jewish leaders who said they didn't want the president to come.  There was a petition with tens of thousands of signatures on it urging the president to not come.

He said that the 5,239 U.S. troops that have been ordered to the border is not the top-line number. He said there will be additional forces sent. He pushed back, however, on reports that 14,000 U.S. troops were being sent to the border. He said 1,000 U.S. troops have arrived in Texas. That number will rise to 1,800 by tomorrow. He said that so far none of those troops have arrived at the border. They are still at Laughlin Air Base in San Antonio. The Pentagon, not DHS, will pay for this deployment of troops. The comptroller here at the Pentagon is working on those figures now, and Congress will expect an answer soon. It's illegal to simply reprogram the defense budget without going to Congress.   In the past, DHS has reimbursed the Pentagon when troops were sent to the border. Bottom line is, it is expensive. Earlier this year, when the Pentagon since about 2,000 troops to the border, it costs $185 million. When President Bush sent 6,000 National Guard to the border, it costs $1.2 billion.  A senior U.S. official tells me that in addition to the 5,200 or so troops ordered to the border, an additional 2,000 active-duty U.S. troops are in ready-to-deploy status. Most of these troops will be engineers. U.S. Air Force plans to airlift 400 additional Border Patrol personnel as well. There will be three staging areas, we're told. The troops will set up temporary shelters for up to 2,400 Border Patrol. They are not building, however, camps for migrants.  General O'Shaughnessy added the U.S. military is currently putting the troops sent to the border through a training program on the rules for the use of force and what to do in the event of incidental contact with migrants. Again, those U.S. troops will be allowed to carry weapons for self-defense, but are not supposed to be having contact with migrants -- Charles.",

JOHN THUNE, R—S.D.: Well, first off, Charles, I think that the clip that you played -- played from the speaker probably gets it about right. I think that it's going to be very difficult, from a constitutional perspective, for the president to attempt through executive order to address this issue. There have been bills introduced in the past that have attempted to prospectively deal with this. And I think that's what Lindsey Graham is talking about. That may be a more appropriate way to do this. But I just think that the executive order path is something that conservatives basically attacked Democrats for doing and President Obama for doing when it came to the issue of immigration. And I think we need to -- we need to have that discussion in Congress. But I understand the president's frustration. We have got a broken immigration system. We have got way too many illegals coming across the border. He's expressed a great frustration with that and is trying to do what he can to address the issue. But I think, in the end, it's going to require Congress to engage on this, and hopefully to once and for all put a solution in place.",

But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life Synagogue wanted to have the president there. So he is paying his respects to the 11 people who died in that horrific shooting on Saturday morning. It was interesting to note that, as the president's motorcade pulled up, they pulled up right in front of those 11 makeshift stars Of David that had been placed out front the Tree of Life to honor the 11 people who died inside. From here, the president said that he is going to go to a hospital -- we're not sure which one at this point -- to visit with law enforcement officers who were wounded in that shoot-out when they responded to the shooting on Saturday. They managed to keep the shooter inside the synagogue, prevented him from getting outside, and took him down. And in the process, four officers were wounded. So the president is going to come in and thank them for the heroic work that they did. He will also meet with a few survivors of the Tree of Life Synagogue who were wounded, some of them gravely wounded, in that shooting on Saturday. His visit still the subject of some controversy there in Pittsburgh. The Democratic mayor, Bill Peduto, said that he is not going to go meet with the president at the synagogue or at the hospital. There were 11 progressive Jewish leaders who said they didn't want the president there unless he went further in denouncing white nationalism. There was also a petition that was signed and sent to the White House. But the president and the first lady, the first daughter and her husband and Steve Mnuchin were determined to go out there today and pay their respects.

So that's absolutely, I think, the right thing to watch for next week, is if they're actually able to in these states -- Florida is battleground state, but it's a red state.

There was a group of people on the progressive wing of -- side of things, Jewish leaders who said they didn't want the president to come.

He said that the 5,239 U.S. troops that have been ordered to the border is not the top-line number. He said there will be additional forces sent. He pushed back, however, on reports that 14,000 U.S. troops were being sent to the border. He said 1,000 U.S. troops have arrived in Texas. That number will rise to 1,800 by tomorrow. He said that so far none of those troops have arrived at the border. They are still at Laughlin Air Base in San Antonio. The Pentagon, not DHS, will pay for this deployment of troops. The comptroller here at the Pentagon is working on those figures now, and Congress will expect an answer soon. It's illegal to simply reprogram the defense budget without going to Congress. In the past, DHS has reimbursed the Pentagon when troops were sent to the border. Bottom line is, it is expensive. Earlier this year, when the Pentagon since about 2,000 troops to the border, it costs $185 million. When President Bush sent 6,000 National Guard to the border, it costs $1.2 billion. A senior U.S. official tells me that in addition to the 5,200 or so troops ordered to the border, an additional 2,000 active-duty U.S. troops are in ready-to-deploy status. Most of these troops will be engineers. U.S. Air Force plans to airlift 400 additional Border Patrol personnel as well. There will be three staging areas, we're told. The troops will set up temporary shelters for up to 2,400 Border Patrol. They are not building, however, camps for migrants. General O'Shaughnessy added the U.S. military is currently putting the troops sent to the border through a training program on the rules for the use of force and what to do in the event of incidental contact with migrants. Again, those U.S. troops will be allowed to carry weapons for self-defense, but are not supposed to be having contact with migrants -- Charles."

And the reason is, is because we have had good leadership and good policy, with a commitment to lower taxes. I think we're poised to do better than ever. Andrew Gillum is running on a 40 percent tax increase, which would cost jobs in Florida. It would cause businesses to leave, and it would prevent the flow of investment from coming into Florida. So it's a very, very critical decision for the people of Florida. I think we need to build off the success we have.

And so far, we have done better than we traditionally have of turning out voters in the mail and in the early vote. And if we continue that, we're going to be really, really tough to beat. It's also the fact that we just had two debates last week, and so voters I think just in the last week or two you are really starting to see the sharp differences.

The fact of the matter is, he is being held accountable, because he was not honest with the people of Florida about receiving thousands of dollars in illegal gifts from lobbyists and including an undercover FBI agent that had visits before the government. He turned around and gave the lobbyist a $2 million contract for a restaurant in Tallahassee. And so he's not been able to answer those questions. I held him accountable at the debate. There's a bunch of documents that have come out to show he's not telling the truth. And he says that that's mud, but I just think that that's accountability. When I was in the Congress, I declined all the perks. I declined the health care, the pension. I fought pay increases. I put taxpayers first. He's used office to feather his own nest, and that's just the fact."

And I think that's really going to help energize voters to come out. I mean, as you know, Charles, the president brought a lot of new voters to the table in 2016. And I think, for Republicans, if we convert them into habitual voters every midterm, that's a huge new source of support for us.

It's almost an enticement. And so I don't think that that's good policy. At the same time, the way the courts have ruled on it, I think there's a question about, can you do an executive order, can you do legislation? Do you need an amendment?

The president's visit does not come without controversy, though. The city's mayor, along with other local leaders, have said they would like the president to wait until after the funerals have been completed. The city has been beefing up security at Jewish schools, as well as at synagogues and at funerals that started today. And so police, the resources are stretched thin. And city officials wanted the president to wait, so that they were not further stretched in that time, but -- and I apologize, Charles. I'm just keeping a lookout here for the president, what we anticipate will be his arrival here. But amongst this controversy, there are also those here who say they are glad the president is coming to be able to express support on behalf of the entire nation. And that's what the president hopes to do with this trip. We do not -- we're not able to report the full details of his visit. But we do know the president has said he plans to visit a hospital where several survivors of the shooting are still recovering, including several officers. And we are also told he plans to meet with local Jewish leaders to express condolences on behalf of the nation for them as well. The president, though, says this is a time the nation needs to heal.

They don't necessarily believe in his politics, but, at the end of the day, they're scared of this whole going further left, it's further left than Clintonian. It's not -- it's not Obama.

And by coming here in the aftermath of this attack, he's really highlighting the horrific nature of it and the need for change that needs to happen at a presidential level that really no one else could bring in terms of focus and calling attention to that. And we have heard from number of Jewish members here that say that means a lot to them, that the president is taking the time out of his schedule, especially with the midterms coming up. He has a lot of campaign rallies going on. The fact that he's here, they feel like it makes a big statement to him. Others feel like the timing, they don't like it. They wish he would have waited a little bit longer.

I saw him walking into the synagogue shortly after the president and first lady entered there. And, of course, this is a very expansive investigation they are undertaking into this shooting. And we're told this crime scene, he described it as the most horrific crime scene he has seen in his over 20 years at the FBI. So with him being there, I'm sure he's going to be giving an update to the president on where things stand and possibly how things played out here when that attack happened on Saturday.

Lindsey -- Senator Lindsey Graham saying he will push -- present some legislation there. Just moments ago, Senator Grassley releasing a statement suggesting he's going to see how this goes. What are your thoughts on this potentially explosive move? SEN. JOHN THUNE, R—S.D.: Well, first off, Charles, I think that the clip that you played -- played from the speaker probably gets it about right. I think that it's going to be very difficult, from a constitutional perspective, for the president to attempt through executive order to address this issue. There have been bills introduced in the past that have attempted to prospectively deal with this. And I think that's what Lindsey Graham is talking about. That may be a more appropriate way to do this. But I just think that the executive order path is something that conservatives basically attacked Democrats for doing and President Obama for doing when it came to the issue of immigration. And I think we need to -- we need to have that discussion in Congress. But I understand the president's frustration. We have got a broken immigration system. We have got way too many illegals coming across the border. He's expressed a great frustration with that and is trying to do what he can to address the issue.

And even if you're seeking asylum, if you're a refugee fleeing persecution, there is a way that you can make your case and do it legally.

But Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life Synagogue wanted to have the president there. So he is paying his respects to the 11 people who died in that horrific shooting on Saturday morning. It was interesting to note that, as the president's motorcade pulled up, they pulled up right in front of those 11 makeshift stars Of David that had been placed out front the Tree of Life to honor the 11 people who died inside. From here, the president said that he is going to go to a hospital -- we're not sure which one at this point -- to visit with law enforcement officers who were wounded in that shoot-out when they responded to the shooting on Saturday. They managed to keep the shooter inside the synagogue, prevented him from getting outside, and took him down. And in the process, four officers were wounded. So the president is going to come in and thank them for the heroic work that they did. He will also meet with a few survivors of the Tree of Life Synagogue who were wounded, some of them gravely wounded, in that shooting on Saturday. His visit still the subject of some controversy there in Pittsburgh. The Democratic mayor, Bill Peduto, said that he is not going to go meet with the president at the synagogue or at the hospital. There were 11 progressive Jewish leaders who said they didn't want the president there unless he went further in denouncing white nationalism. There was also a petition that was signed and sent to the White House. But the president and the first lady, the first daughter and her husband and Steve Mnuchin were determined to go out there today and pay their respects. Interesting to note as well, Charles, that the first funeral was happening today as the president touched down there in Pittsburgh. But, for the president, it's a very important moment. He hopes this will be a unifying one for the country as well -- Charles."

      "utterance": "Yes, John. And thank you very much. And, to your point, we do see some signs out there, including one sign saying, \"President Trump, you're not welcome in Pittsburgh.\" So, a mixed reaction there, but John Roberts pointing out that the rabbi, the president of the Tree of Life, Rabbi Myers, invited President Trump. That's it for now. \"The Five\" starts now."
