So after former President Obama claimed credit for our current economic boom yesterday, President Trump fired back, saying the boom is due to rolling back Obama's policies by cutting regulations and taxes.  So who is right? Who cares? Think about it. The debate we are having isn't over how great things are. That ship has sailed. The media and the Dems see there is no more denying the success, so now it's about quibbling over credit. Fine, let the Dems have it. It won't win the elections but it might reduce their tears. And maybe Obama had something to do with today's economy.  I mean, without Obama, would we have Trump? The fact is this debate says a lot about life today. The Trump economy is so great that Trump haters now want credit for it. Next thing you know Obama will claim credit for putting kids in cages, and why not? He did do it before Trump, so it's confusing. In the Dems' world, Obama is not responsible for his results, only for the success of whoever came next.  Technically then, George Bush was responsible for Obama's success. And, of course, without W's dad, we would have no bubba. Couldn't you do this forever? Who gets credit for George Washington's success, George the Third, of course. Then there are those who just want the economy to tank because their hatred for Trump outweighs their love for the country, and also impeachment failed. So war erupts under Trump, a Twitter war. Like alot of the wars under Trump, non-violent, no body bags, just trash talk, and finger-pointing. I will take that over the other kind of wars any day. Just remember. If it hadn't been for smoke signals, there would be no Twitter. Maybe Liz Warren can take credit for that.",

You can't take credit for that. You can't take credit for that when you break up with her and then she gets re- married. That is not the point. The point is this. The stimulus was a punchline during the Obama administration. He said so himself. Remember, he was actually joking. Those shovel-ready jobs aren't so shovel-ready. Think about it this way. The Democrats first said that the economy was going to tank under Trump. Then they said it was Barack Obama's economy. Then they said there was going to be a recession.   And then they said it was only benefiting the rich. And now, they are back to saying that it's Barack Obama's economy. It doesn't make any sense because they can't talk about the economy, because they haven't done anything to help the economy. If there had been a Democrat who had taken the reins in 2016, you would've had strangling Obamacare regulations, a Green New Deal, Paris climate deal, war on coal, no new trade deals, tax hikes instead of the cuts, no bonuses. It would've been an absolute disaster. They can't name one single metric that has gotten worse when Trump came over and took over the Obama economy. Wages have gone up. Stock market has gone up. Manufacturing jobs up. Every job has gone up. They can't have a little fingerprint on any of this success. And the American people see that. And that's why they're giving Donald Trump credit for the good economy. They are saying they're optimistic. And they say they're better off now than they were three years ago. And that's why I believe he's going to win re-election.",

And that's something that, as you pointed out, that all Americans should want to feel. What is so interesting about this conversation we're having right now is that Democrats are sending such mixed messages. So by some, the economy is still horrible and the benefits have not been, in fact, felt by everyone, and then by others, no, it's amazing but this was started by Barack Obama, by then President Obama. And the reality is economic growth is driven by deregulation, and trade reform, and energy independence, and tax cuts.   And those are not things that the Democratic Party stands for, and that is not things that occurred under the Obama administration. And what is creating this stained wage increases is sustained job creation. And that's the result of that positive economic growth. And what I will continue say also is that for the Democratic Party that advocate for those that are unable to advocate for themselves.  Under this administration, not only have Asian-Americans, black-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, their wages have increased and unemployment rates decreased, but also those with only high school degrees. And so, for example, the 2020 candidates have been talking about wiping away college debt. I love that under this administration people don't need to go to college, because those with just high school degrees, their wages are increasing.",

It's the same reason they bought Avenatti, because the overreaching aim is to beat Trump, so they will adjust their principles and say they used to tell us and lecture us. You can't buy an election. Well, unless you can beat Trump. So they are adjusting their principles kind of the same way you can say the evangelicals adjusted their principles with Trump, which is fine. Because you want to win, if you think he is going to win. But if Bloomberg gets the nomination, what happens to the Sanders people. Because they are supporting Bernie not to beat Trump, they're supporting Bernie to support Bernie. So they're not buying into this. We need to beat Trump. They are into we like this guy. Meanwhile, everybody else is we need Trump out and it could be anyone.  So you can see that the passion is more on Bernie's side.

So after former President Obama claimed credit for our current economic boom yesterday, President Trump fired back, saying the boom is due to rolling back Obama's policies by cutting regulations and taxes. So who is right? Who cares? Think about it. The debate we are having isn't over how great things are. That ship has sailed. The media and the Dems see there is no more denying the success, so now it's about quibbling over credit. Fine, let the Dems have it. It won't win the elections but it might reduce their tears. And maybe Obama had something to do with today's economy. I mean, without Obama, would we have Trump? The fact is this debate says a lot about life today. The Trump economy is so great that Trump haters now want credit for it. Next thing you know Obama will claim credit for putting kids in cages, and why not? He did do it before Trump, so it's confusing. In the Dems' world, Obama is not responsible for his results, only for the success of whoever came next. Technically then, George Bush was responsible for Obama's success. And, of course, without W's dad, we would have no bubba. Couldn't you do this forever? Who gets credit for George Washington's success, George the Third, of course. Then there are those who just want the economy to tank because their hatred for Trump outweighs their love for the country, and also impeachment failed. So war erupts under Trump, a Twitter war. Like alot of the wars under Trump, non-violent, no body bags, just trash talk, and finger-pointing. I will take that over the other kind of wars any day. Just remember. If it hadn't been for smoke signals, there would be no Twitter. Maybe Liz Warren can take credit for that."

You can't take credit for that. You can't take credit for that when you break up with her and then she gets re- married. That is not the point. The point is this. The stimulus was a punchline during the Obama administration. He said so himself. Remember, he was actually joking. Those shovel-ready jobs aren't so shovel-ready. Think about it this way. The Democrats first said that the economy was going to tank under Trump. Then they said it was Barack Obama's economy. Then they said there was going to be a recession. And then they said it was only benefiting the rich. And now, they are back to saying that it's Barack Obama's economy. It doesn't make any sense because they can't talk about the economy, because they haven't done anything to help the economy. If there had been a Democrat who had taken the reins in 2016, you would've had strangling Obamacare regulations, a Green New Deal, Paris climate deal, war on coal, no new trade deals, tax hikes instead of the cuts, no bonuses. It would've been an absolute disaster. They can't name one single metric that has gotten worse when Trump came over and took over the Obama economy. Wages have gone up. Stock market has gone up. Manufacturing jobs up. Every job has gone up. They can't have a little fingerprint on any of this success. And the American people see that. And that's why they're giving Donald Trump credit for the good economy. They are saying they're optimistic. And they say they're better off now than they were three years ago. And that's why I believe he's going to win re-election."

And that's something that, as you pointed out, that all Americans should want to feel. What is so interesting about this conversation we're having right now is that Democrats are sending such mixed messages. So by some, the economy is still horrible and the benefits have not been, in fact, felt by everyone, and then by others, no, it's amazing but this was started by Barack Obama, by then President Obama. And the reality is economic growth is driven by deregulation, and trade reform, and energy independence, and tax cuts. And those are not things that the Democratic Party stands for, and that is not things that occurred under the Obama administration. And what is creating this stained wage increases is sustained job creation. And that's the result of that positive economic growth. And what I will continue say also is that for the Democratic Party that advocate for those that are unable to advocate for themselves. Under this administration, not only have Asian-Americans, black-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, their wages have increased and unemployment rates decreased, but also those with only high school degrees. And so, for example, the 2020 candidates have been talking about wiping away college debt. I love that under this administration people don't need to go to college, because those with just high school degrees, their wages are increasing."

It's the same reason they bought Avenatti, because the overreaching aim is to beat Trump, so they will adjust their principles and say they used to tell us and lecture us. You can't buy an election. Well, unless you can beat Trump. So they are adjusting their principles kind of the same way you can say the evangelicals adjusted their principles with Trump, which is fine. Because you want to win, if you think he is going to win. But if Bloomberg gets the nomination, what happens to the Sanders people. Because they are supporting Bernie not to beat Trump, they're supporting Bernie to support Bernie. So they're not buying into this. We need to beat Trump. They are into we like this guy. Meanwhile, everybody else is we need Trump out and it could be anyone. So you can see that the passion is more on Bernie's side. But with Bernie, it's like choosing the way you are going to be executed. If he is nominated, you got a socialist. If he's not nominated, you got chaos in your own party.

Eric Holder was a leader, and Bernie Sanders did embrace that. I wanted to say the President did release to non-violent individuals today, similar to Alice Johnson, so that's a good thing. But the problem with commuting or pardoning people like the former governor, we have too many corrupt elected officials in this country, too many people who are still stealing taxpayers money.

Bernie Kerik had renovations done to his apartment in exchange for a political favor and then lied about it. He's supposed to get two years according to the guidelines. He gets four. I mean, the guy is a patriot. He made a really bad judgment. It just seems like an overzealous sentence and prosecution. But if you look at when the left gets upset, I mean, there was that five-time illegal alien felon who murdered Kate Steinle, and he gets nothing. And the left was cheering. They were clapping. And now these guys get commutations or whatever after a lot of time served, and they're saying this is a grave miscarriage of justice? I mean, do these help Trump politically? Not really.
