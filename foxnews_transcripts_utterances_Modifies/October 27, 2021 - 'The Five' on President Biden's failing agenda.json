And then a Republican gets in the office and everything is his fault. Racism, sexism, your girlfriend has a drinking problem, everything on the earth is that president's problem. But the problem with Joe Biden is he is creating problems and then he is ignoring the problems he's creating. The American people want him to focus on the border and inflation.

They're buying the debt at the federal government issues. That alone is going to be a disaster. But I do love that if you're spending is going to be socialist, then the way you pay for it also needs to be socialist and they are talking about this new annual tax on realized capital gains which is a wealth tax, which is, I don't care what anybody says, you are confiscating people's wealth and it is fraught with peril, raises so many problems whether it's only for billionaires. My big fat side it's only for billionaires because what ends up happening is these taxes, this type of taxes never raises enough money. Billionaires are going to move so who does it end up hitting?

And as a result, that efficiency breeds a lot of things including profitability, including more investors but sometimes when if demand gets a little lopsided at one way, it creates problems. They didn't get all of this right with all of the stimulus and so forth. I'd much rather earn this and stop giving people too much during a crisis and during the moment we face than not. Further, Dagen said it as well. Since 2007, we've had nothing but an experiment with the Federal Reserve for. And some of it they've gotten right, some of it they've gotten wrong. I actually wish they had earned a little more a little more and sometimes maybe pulling back. And I think that's Summers (Ph) was saying a little while ago. He didn't -- I don't know if he was saying don't spend is much on stimulus although he did say a little of that. He was really concerned about the fed.

We've covered multiple stories in the last few weeks, those people should be held accountable and an investigation should be held -- done and those people should be held accountable if that story is right. Furthermore, we should not this -- we should not encourage parents to confront and try to threaten people with violence elected officials. Everybody should step back and do this.

The gun then went off killing the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring the film's director. Cast and crew members said they heard an assistant director yell cold gun before handing it to Baldwin, meaning it was safe to fire. And two people reportedly handled the weapon before giving it the Baldwin. This is an awful story, Greg.

I learned that within the first 10 minutes. I've been at gun ranges where even if you joke about stuff, they'll throw you out of the gun range. And -- or if anybody is just -- like, if anybody moves, they just literally will pound your arm and tell you to stop it. So, what happens in these movie sets is the play acting, nothing is real, always somehow encourages people to deviate from safe handling, right? The gun is like -- you watch them, they point guns in stupid ways an NRA instructor would have nipped this in the bud. The question is are they ever allowed on movie sets? That's like having a smart conservative on CNN. This is a case where the people that you scorn, if you're on -- if you're in Hollywood the people you scorn, right, Trump supporters, whatever you want to call them, NRA instructors, actually possess the skills that could help you. It is though -- if you have this -- if you're a conservative and you have to stomach the left-wing ideas of your yoga instructor, right? You understand that more likely he's going to be liberal. Then, you should get a real honest-to-God gun expert. He's probably going to be a Trump supporter. He's probably going to be an NRA instructor.

So, you know, shut up, you pampered shopaholic and start lowering your expectations, that happened a little during the last Democratic president or Barack Obama. We would get hit with a domestic terror attack and we were told that's your fault, you, Islamophobe. Or we would get high gas prices and they'd say you shouldn't have bought that gas guzzling SUV. And then a Republican gets in the office and everything is his fault. Racism, sexism, your girlfriend has a drinking problem, everything on the earth is that president's problem. But the problem with Joe Biden is he is creating problems and then he is ignoring the problems he's creating. The American people want him to focus on the border and inflation. He's not doing either one and that's why his poll numbers are sliding so dramatically. He's like either the Tinder date.

So now you are seeing Janet Yellen come out there, can she go one paternity like Mayor Pete did? Because every time she opens her mouth, I'm scared. She comes out and she misses inflation last year, she po-pooed it, that's a verb, and now we are hit with a major inflationary period. She says that's going to last until at least next year and then she says this, but we haven't lost control. It is in that reassuring from the treasury secretary? I feel so much better now that you guys haven't lost control but now you have high prices, you have high fuel prices and you have low growth and a weak dollar and that is a recipe for disaster."

They have no -- the Federal Reserve this is an unprecedented experiment of monetary policy of the amount of money they've been pumping into the system and they haven't even begun to start pulling back on it, they're monetizing on debt. They're buying the debt at the federal government issues. That alone is going to be a disaster. But I do love that if you're spending is going to be socialist, then the way you pay for it also needs to be socialist and they are talking about this new annual tax on realized capital gains which is a wealth tax, which is, I don't care what anybody says, you are confiscating people's wealth and it is fraught with peril, raises so many problems whether it's only for billionaires. My big fat side it's only for billionaires because what ends up happening is these taxes, this type of taxes never raises enough money. Billionaires are going to move so who does it end up hitting? People much lower on the financial scale. Look at alternative minimum tax originally designed to hit less than 200 people, it hit millions and millions of people --"

They have lost control. But the slogan is suck it up. And it's being pushed by the media as you saw with that article, the same media that vows any restrictions to act -- medical care access or housing by an illegal alien, that would be seen as bigoted. But if you're an American, you suck it up, you have to deal with loss. Right? You have to -- with diminished availability of products. So people who aren't from America or illegal aliens they get the carrot but it's the citizens who get the stick.

But I would remind everyone also we have incentivized investing in this country to invest in companies and to force management teams and companies to be really efficient. And as a result, that efficiency breeds a lot of things including profitability, including more investors but sometimes when if demand gets a little lopsided at one way, it creates problems. They didn't get all of this right with all of the stimulus and so forth. I'd much rather earn this and stop giving people too much during a crisis and during the moment we face than not. Further, Dagen said it as well. Since 2007, we've had nothing but an experiment with the Federal Reserve for. And some of it they've gotten right, some of it they've gotten wrong. I actually wish they had earned a little more a little more and sometimes maybe pulling back. And I think that's Summers (Ph) was saying a little while ago. He didn't -- I don't know if he was saying don't spend is much on stimulus although he did say a little of that. He was really concerned about the fed.

Instead, they just want to continue to fight which continues to ratcheted it up. And this is intensifying the GOP turn out in Virginia. If Youngkin does win, then this will be a big reason why and the fake outrage that the former president is talking about will be a big reason. But I'll point out when number two that you might have missed today. Fairfax County in northern Virginia is one of the most attractive counties for parents because it's got excellent schools, property tax is pretty high, but excellent schools. Since the pandemic started, 10,000 students have left. So, to me, a lot of parents have already voted in that northern Virginia suburb and that's where they are sending Biden tomorrow.

I wish some of the parents, those school board members who covered that Loudoun County story about the bathroom is one of the most haunting things. We've covered multiple stories in the last few weeks, those people should be held accountable and an investigation should be held -- done and those people should be held accountable if that story is right. Furthermore, we should not this -- we should not encourage parents to confront and try to threaten people with violence elected officials. Everybody should step back and do this. That's what I hope we do and I hope we all follow the words of Candace Rice (Ph) who said it best last week. Black kids don't need to sit in the classroom and told they are great and white kids be told that they are bad and white kids shouldn't be told they are great and black kids shouldn't be told they are bad. Better teachers, better school, and better curriculum can help. I don't mean to wag them like a golden retriever but all of that can help create that kind of situation.

This is a culture war his side started. This is a culture war his side is now losing and now he says this is a phony culture war. You don't -- you don't get to start a culture war and then call it phony once you start losing, that's not how this works and then all the parents if you are upset, your son is being called a racist, they're angry. Now, no, that's fake outrage. Your daughter gets raped by a guy wearing a skirt in the transgender bathroom, you're not really angry, you are just fake angry. And let me just tell you a little bit about how business works in TV, Barack Obama, Fox News covers the culture war that you started because it's real news so people come to Fox to watch real news. CNN doesn't cover this culture war story and so people don't want to go to CNN and their ratings go down. That's how this works.

      "speaker": "FORD JR.",
      "utterance": "New details on what happened just moments before the fatal movie set shooting involving Alec Baldwin. Affidavit said the actor was practicing cross-drawing a gun from its holster and aiming the gun it at the camera. The gun then went off killing the cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring the film's director. Cast and crew members said they heard an assistant director yell cold gun before handing it to Baldwin, meaning it was safe to fire. And two people reportedly handled the weapon before giving it the Baldwin. This is an awful story, Greg. I mean, and we'll -- the lawyers in the courts will sort through some of the liability issues here. But as we -- as things come out dripping that are so -- it just gives it even more color and more horror, what are your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's -- every piece of information paints a truly careless, reckless set. And whoever is in-charge of that is usually the producer, and Baldwin's a producer. But they're -- they violated some incredibly simple rules that even I learned when I got NRA instruction. You treat every gun as loaded. You don't point it in anyone. That's the bottom line. I learned that within the first 10 minutes. I've been at gun ranges where even if you joke about stuff, they'll throw you out of the gun range. And -- or if anybody is just -- like, if anybody moves, they just literally will pound your arm and tell you to stop it. So, what happens in these movie sets is the play acting, nothing is real, always somehow encourages people to deviate from safe handling, right? The gun is like -- you watch them, they point guns in stupid ways an NRA instructor would have nipped this in the bud. The question is are they ever allowed on movie sets? That's like having a smart conservative on CNN. This is a case where the people that you scorn, if you're on -- if you're in Hollywood the people you scorn, right, Trump supporters, whatever you want to call them, NRA instructors, actually possess the skills that could help you. It is though -- if you have this -- if you're a conservative and you have to stomach the left-wing ideas of your yoga instructor, right? You understand that more likely he's going to be liberal. Then, you should get a real honest-to-God gun expert. He's probably going to be a Trump supporter. He's probably going to be an NRA instructor. But instead, whoever was in charge of your safety, had no clue, no experience, no wisdom. And for that, a woman died."

      "speaker": "FORD JR.",

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I mean, I understand the desire to have real guns, like -- and the interesting thing about this the story line in the movie, one of the story lines is that a rancher gets accidentally killed. And so, I get it. Like, you want a vintage gun and it's there. And there's a lot of movie sets that use these. This doesn't happen often, obviously, thank goodness. I'm really interested in the liability perspective because again, you have the personal question, the carelessness, the recklessness, and then the production company. And I think that it could lead to something like what you're saying."

      "utterance": "Jesse, so we have the right to bear arms, but with that right comes great responsibility. Using the gun responsibly. Don't point it at someone. Check it. Clear it. Don't carry it around cavalierly. And I understand what the bad Greg was saying on Friday is that people who are irresponsible with their rights to bear arms shouldn't take away the right to bear arms from those people who use those rights responsibly like 99.9 percent of gun owners. That's what people are a little bit upset here with the situation. Baldwin was negligent. The crew was negligent and a woman died. And a lot of times, if you have an accident people still do get charged whether it's negligent homicide, manslaughter. And someone is going to have to investigate all of the things that went wrong and there were a half a dozen things that went wrong. And it there is a strong possibility that he may get charged as the producer and as the shooter."

It was the death of Vic Morrow and two kids with a helicopter crash. That was kind of the template for criminal lawyers and prosecutors to stay away from that.
