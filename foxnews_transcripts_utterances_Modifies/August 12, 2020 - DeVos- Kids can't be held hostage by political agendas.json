It's what your friends are going to be talking about tomorrow. So, buckle up and sit tight. Rudy Giuliani is going to join us on how Kamala Harris could use the DOJ as a tool for revenge and retribution. And President Trump today asked an important question that a lot of parents and taxpayers are asking, if a school is closed, how come they're getting the money. Why not give it to the students who are scrambling to get their education.  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is here exclusively. She'll tell us more. And it's Wednesday. You know what that means, Raymond Arroyo joins us for a Biden and Kamala file, Unseen and Seen. He's going to bring us all the moments that no one else has been able or maybe willing to show you.  But first, last night, Laura laid out much of what you need to know in order to honestly and objectively assess Kamala Harris as a career politician. But the media is flagrantly lying about who she really is. Remember yesterday, The New York Times called her a pragmatic moderate. George Stephanopoulos obediently echoed that line earlier today.

How moderate is it to support socialized medicine or mass gun confiscation? She wants open borders and then wants to give free health care for those who came here illegally. That's something most taxpaying American workers don't get.  Today, Politico wind up the ante claiming Senator Harris deftly hops between the Democratic Party's shifting tectonic plates. Now that swamp speak far, she's an unprincipled career who will do or say whatever she needs to in order to gain power. That's why she can pay homage to radical Leftist marching through our city streets and then share a toast with Wall Street executives later that night.   She has brought together the Amazons of the world with the anarchist. She works the levers of power whenever she can. Case and point, Kamala is the only candidate ever openly endorsed by CNN President Jeff Zucker. Back in 2009, he said, Kamala is not just important for the city of San Francisco, the state of California, but for the entire country. How do you figure see it, coverage is going to be slanted probably just as objective as always, which means one big biased bag of balloon juice? Bottom-line, this is a vice-presidential nominee who has confirmed the worst kept secret of the New Democrats. They've left most of America behind and it's time for folks to wake up and realize it. Joining me now Sara Carter, Fox News Contributor, and host of The Sara Carter Show Podcast. Also, with me former California Congressman Darrell Issa who spent a lot of years in the California delegation with Kamala Harris. Now Sara, this is the woman who would really be running things most likely if Joe Biden were to win in November. So, what would that mean for most Americans.",

He understands that he's aging that this is somebody that he wants to put in place, what it would mean is a radical agenda and somebody who's a chameleon. I mean she transforms herself whenever she wants into whatever she wants. You talked about CNN. Think about she said on CNN, I believe it was April 2019 when she was on with Don Lemon and she said, America should have a discussion about whether or not people in prison, prisoners should be able to vote. And she talks about the Green New Deal. She's for open borders. She doesn't believe that people who cross into the country illegally should ever be jailed or prosecuted. Yet the strange thing is, and the irony is, is that she was willing to prosecute so many people for minor crimes in California. In fact, she prosecuted more people than Joe Biden's insulted in his life. So, I mean, this is a person that is so wishy-washy, I think the American people will see right through it and they'll definitely see right through it before November. There's no way to kind of hide that record.  HUCKABEE: Speaking of the record, congressman, I say you've worked with Kamala Harris for a long time, you knew her from California, you knew her as the attorney general before she became the senator.

Not an easy thing to do for a seated Republican congressman, but the fact was we had a moderate Democrat and Loretta Sanchez by comparison, and the Left won out and she went on to the Senate. That's who she is.   But I think Sara said it very well. It's Chameleon Harris. That's what it's all about. She will change what she says she stands for at the drop of a coin. But at the end of the day, this is somebody owned by the progressive Left time and time again. And right now, she's backing away from the few things she ever did that might be considered to be pro law and order. And if that's gone, she has nothing.  HUCKABEE: Sara, I want you to react to James Clyburn's comment about the country and where it's headed, keeping in mind that if it weren't for Clyburn, Joe Biden wouldn't be the Democratic nominee.

The science is very clear on this. What's been very clear is that there is an alternative agenda that includes defunding the police, universal health care, destroying charter schools, eliminating the D.C.

It sounds like you're on board with that as well, Madam Secretary.  DEVOS: Well, that's absolutely right. Families need to have options. They need to have choices. They need to be able to find the right fit for their child or their children. And it's becoming ever more clear in the last few months that this is more and more necessary for families across the country. We've had an education system that's been static for decades, a one size fits all approach. And if we've learned anything in the last several months, it's that children are not one size fits all and their education needs are not one size fits all. And the response to this is has not been a one size fits all. We heard from a mom today who's starting with another group of families. One of these things, they're calling pods a small micro school in someone's home or a small building somewhere. There's many other families that are considering home schooling and there are other families that would like to send their child to a school, a private, maybe faith based school, many of which have demonstrated the ability to reopen again and are right on track with doing so.  We need to ensure that all families have those opportunities. And the president is absolutely right and strong in his support for advancing this notion of money following the student otherwise known as school choice. And Senator Tim Scott has introduced a bill that could do just that and Congress could take action to make sure that happens.",

She asked various Catholic nominees if they knew that the Knights of Columbus was a male-only institution that believed in traditional marriage, that believed in the rights of the unborn, or she characterized it, stood up against the reproductive rights of women. What she is basically saying with these questions is that if you are a person of faith, if you're a devout Catholic, and if you take the dogmas of the church seriously, biblically-based, that you're not qualified to sit on the bench.

Joe Biden now believes that the parishioners he attends church with at St. Joseph's Church and his pastor should pay for these abortions all across this country. It's really radical stuff.

It's what your friends are going to be talking about tomorrow. So, buckle up and sit tight. Rudy Giuliani is going to join us on how Kamala Harris could use the DOJ as a tool for revenge and retribution. And President Trump today asked an important question that a lot of parents and taxpayers are asking, if a school is closed, how come they're getting the money. Why not give it to the students who are scrambling to get their education. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is here exclusively. She'll tell us more. And it's Wednesday. You know what that means, Raymond Arroyo joins us for a Biden and Kamala file, Unseen and Seen. He's going to bring us all the moments that no one else has been able or maybe willing to show you. But first, last night, Laura laid out much of what you need to know in order to honestly and objectively assess Kamala Harris as a career politician. But the media is flagrantly lying about who she really is. Remember yesterday, The New York Times called her a pragmatic moderate. George Stephanopoulos obediently echoed that line earlier today.

How moderate is it to support socialized medicine or mass gun confiscation? She wants open borders and then wants to give free health care for those who came here illegally. That's something most taxpaying American workers don't get. Today, Politico wind up the ante claiming Senator Harris deftly hops between the Democratic Party's shifting tectonic plates. Now that swamp speak far, she's an unprincipled career who will do or say whatever she needs to in order to gain power. That's why she can pay homage to radical Leftist marching through our city streets and then share a toast with Wall Street executives later that night. She has brought together the Amazons of the world with the anarchist. She works the levers of power whenever she can. Case and point, Kamala is the only candidate ever openly endorsed by CNN President Jeff Zucker. Back in 2009, he said, Kamala is not just important for the city of San Francisco, the state of California, but for the entire country. How do you figure see it, coverage is going to be slanted probably just as objective as always, which means one big biased bag of balloon juice? Bottom-line, this is a vice-presidential nominee who has confirmed the worst kept secret of the New Democrats. They've left most of America behind and it's time for folks to wake up and realize it. Joining me now Sara Carter, Fox News Contributor, and host of The Sara Carter Show Podcast. Also, with me former California Congressman Darrell Issa who spent a lot of years in the California delegation with Kamala Harris.

I mean she transforms herself whenever she wants into whatever she wants. You talked about CNN. Think about she said on CNN, I believe it was April 2019 when she was on with Don Lemon and she said, America should have a discussion about whether or not people in prison, prisoners should be able to vote.

I believe this is going to be one of the most important elections in modern political history because it's going to determine the future of the United States. Do we want a United States that is based and I've said this before on American values and principles and freedom and capitalism and choice, or do we want a United States that is going to go to the radical Left, that we are going to lose all those freedoms?

He proved that he could outwork, as you know, Senator Clinton, and that's how he became the president.

I mean, she was a phony prosecutor. She prosecuted thousands and thousands of little people. 1500 marijuana smokers, but very few big drug dealers. She let every politically connected person go. She even let a guy go who murdered two people, including a journalist. She gave him probation. She was a horrible prosecutor. Her conviction rate was so low that she would plead cases out and people would just walk out. The murder rate went up substantially. And so, all you need to know about it, the murder rate went up substantially when she was district attorney and San Francisco, became very dangerous. So, she's a phony district attorney. She was a phony AG and she would do exactly what that man said. She's a very mean person. Nobody likes it."

Of course, as soon as they announced, she would be wonderful. We all know how that goes. I always said the vice presidency is a job nobody wants, and nobody ever turns it down. So, now we have Kamala Harris. But there are some issues with things that people have brought up. What you just talked about is one of the ways in which Tulsi Gabbard during the Democrat debates just basically took her down in the second debate. I know we're going to see this stuff again, because if the Democrats don't bring it up. I kind of got a feeling to the president's party."

I mean, I was a prosecutor for 17 years. I never prosecuted a single marijuana smoker. Instead, I prosecuted the heads of the Mafia, the heads of the Colombian cartels. She'd run away from a case like that. She ran away from investigating the Catholic Church, large numbers of files of pedophiles, she refused to release. She - look, there were hundreds of police shootings when she was D.A. She wouldn't touch them. She won't even investigate them. She's afraid to go after the police. She was afraid to go after the Catholic Church. Anybody connected to Willie Brown of politics? Oh, my God. They got the courthouse and she go after little people. She went after parents. She went after parents and put them in jail because their children were truant, including a woman whose child was very, very ill and she didn't bother to check. I mean, she's a horrible person. She is mean and she is an incompetent lawyer. And she was an incompetent D.A. and that's why she plead cases down, because otherwise she would've had no conviction rate. She couldn't convict anybody at trial. The guy who committed murder, who she let out, was finally convicted by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, which is a real district attorney's office."

But I want you to react to this tweet from the leading Never Trumper Bill Kristol. He said, just an innocent thought. We've seen Biden in office for over four decades and we've seen Trump nonstop for the last four years. We've seen enough to make up our minds about them. So, let's skip the presidential debates, but have three vice-presidential debates. They clearly know Joe Biden is not ready for debating Donald Trump.

It's vicious, it's awful. I feel sorry for him. But he shouldn't be president when he doesn't know what he's doing, when he can't finish a sentence, when he can't get through a thought without.

And President Trump has been really leaning into and boldly leading on ensuring that kids, kids' interests are being met and that parents and families and kids are not being held captive to other people's fears or agendas. And we have seen in all too many districts and all too many schools across the country, not actually addressing the needs of students, anticipating school in the fall, talking about keeping - we all want to ensure students and teachers are safe when they're in school again, but those things can be done and can be clearly accomplished. The science is very clear on this. What's been very clear is that there is an alternative agenda that includes defunding the police, universal health care, destroying charter schools, eliminating the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program. This is all what teachers' unions are demanding in order for kids for them to go back to school. I was really pleased to see that Governor Murphy in New Jersey has now joined Governor Cuomo and insisting that the option of in-person school has to be an option given to kids. Kids have got to be together. They have got to be with their peers and in classrooms with their teachers. And we need to ensure that this happens."

Because if I'm going to have to pay to get their education, I'd like to be able to have some money to do it. It sounds like you're on board with that as well, Madam Secretary.  DEVOS: Well, that's absolutely right. Families need to have options. They need to have choices. They need to be able to find the right fit for their child or their children. And it's becoming ever more clear in the last few months that this is more and more necessary for families across the country. We've had an education system that's been static for decades, a one size fits all approach. And if we've learned anything in the last several months, it's that children are not one size fits all and their education needs are not one size fits all. And the response to this is has not been a one size fits all. We heard from a mom today who's starting with another group of families. One of these things, they're calling pods a small micro school in someone's home or a small building somewhere. There's many other families that are considering home schooling and there are other families that would like to send their child to a school, a private, maybe faith based school, many of which have demonstrated the ability to reopen again and are right on track with doing so. We need to ensure that all families have those opportunities. And the president is absolutely right and strong in his support for advancing this notion of money following the student otherwise known as school choice.

      "utterance": "Well, that's going to take a long time, but I'd be concerned if they're fired, if their terms of employment are affected thereby. And look, we have to understand the propaganda nature of this. The same thing happened some years ago with the safe space movement, where faculty that were fully supportive of the homosexual rights agenda would put safe space stickers on their doors. The implication, of course, is if you didn't go along with that agenda and put that sticker up, you were an unsafe space. The same thing is being sought here. If you don't sign this antiracist pledge -- which is itself racist. The author of the language of this thing has admitted he wants reverse racism. If you don't sign it, then by definition you are the opposite of antiracist, which must be racist. It's pure propaganda. It has no place in an institution, a governmental institution, a public university. But at some point, we have got to quit calling them higher education. That's becoming a contradiction in terms."

And oddly, MSNBC cropped that cue card out of their on-air shot, as did the folks over at CNN. Now, due to Biden's condition, Governor, this campaign is scripted and totally controlled, really to the nth degree. Even today's big unveiling, it felt choreographed. They marched in in masks. There were no questions or conversations with any outsiders, which Biden explained away this way."

She echoed her own campaign slogan from the primaries, and something more."

      "speaker": "ARROYO",

They never touch. There's no contact, no real connection. So despite all the happy talk, despite all how close Biden and Harris are, except for matching masks, we saw nothing to reinforce their connection. So I guess they are committed to their running mate, COVID-19."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I've known John Kasich for a number of years. I'm really disappointed that he is letting his personal pain over being bested by Donald Trump four years ago turn him into a bitter and vengeful voice of never Trumpism. Four years ago, when he was the sitting governor of Ohio, he refused to so much as offer a welcome to his state for the Republican National Convention. But this time he's pledged he's going to speak at this year's Democrat Convention. And four years ago, he, like all of us who ran in the Republican primary, publicly pledged, even signed a document, that he would support the GOP nominee. He was dishonest about that, as well. Now, he says he's going to vote for a candidate who is for pro taxpayer- funded abortion, who is for same-sex marriage, and who would force the Little Sisters of the Poor, the Catholic nuns, to provide birth control and abortion pill coverage in their health care package. Biden is such a devout Catholic that he was the denied communion on the campaign trail last year, and his choice of Kamala Harris as vice president, no champion of issues that Christians and people of faith really care about. This is the same woman who last year implied that a federal judicial nominee's membership in the Knights of Columbus disqualified him from even sitting on the bench. Joining me now, Matt Schlapp, American Conservative Union chair. Matt, how can Joe Biden call himself a man of faith and bring on someone like Kamala Harris?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIR, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is a real problem, governor. If you look at the record of Kamala Harris while she's been in the Senate, she had a hostility toward Catholic nominees for the federal bench or other Trump positions like we've really never seen. We're back to the time 100 ago when it was Catholics need not apply. She asked various Catholic nominees if they knew that the Knights of Columbus was a male-only institution that believed in traditional marriage, that believed in the rights of the unborn, or she characterized it, stood up against the reproductive rights of women. What she is basically saying with these questions is that if you are a person of faith, if you're a devout Catholic, and if you take the dogmas of the church seriously, biblically-based, that you're not qualified to sit on the bench. Now, that runs counter to the history of this country and our constitutional order, which says there's no religious test in order to serve in this government. And this is bigotry, these questions were bigoted, and there's no room -- and Joe Biden shouldn't just not just go along with this. He should have called this type of bigotry out."

Even when the baby is born, it can still be killed. Joe Biden now believes that the parishioners he attends church with at St. Joseph's Church and his pastor should pay for these abortions all across this country. It's really radical stuff. They say my body, my choice. You know what, what I say to them is our soul, my soul, my choice. Allow Catholics, allow Christians to practice their faith fully. It's what makes America a special place."
