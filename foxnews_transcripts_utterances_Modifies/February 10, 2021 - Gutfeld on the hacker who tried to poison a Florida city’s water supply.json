I will give you an example, who is one of the people that the House impeachment people need to convince? Susan Collins of Maine. Now she may have already made up her mind. She voted that the bill was -- sorry, the trial is constitutional. Whether she will vote to convict, we'll wait and see.  However, remember the Kavanaugh hearing and Susan Collins was --",

Where are you sleeping? She is on her own while you and your Senate colleagues are trying to rush her through a hearing, et cetera. The whole boo-hoo-hoo thing, to me, I just -- I understand that there are politics involved here. I also understand there's very serious charges involved. Many of these rioters have been arrested. In fact, when the A.P. looked through and CNN also did a similar thing, they match -- they took many of the rioters who were arrested and looked at their voting records and I think it's really important to remember that many of them, most of them, they didn't even vote in November.   All right, so the Republicans have a right to separate from the violence and I think to the great majority, they have. On the politics of it, I understand sticking together. When it comes to the Democrats, I think that they know they are not going to get the votes to convict, but I also think that they think politically they don't have anything to lose.

But what I think America I hope is learning from this trial is that the Democrats and their media enablers have more rights than a private citizen. We always knew that the institutional press has more leeway in destroying your life, the defamation protections and things like that that, but there was a limit and it's always defined as you can't shout fire in a crowded theater, that is the limit. But the media and the politicians that you just talk about, Swalwell, they shout fire every single day to America, it's just that their version of shouting fire comes in different flavors. Police officers are more dangerous than criminals. That led to riots, right? There is a massive domestic terror network worse than ISIS. Well, that's going to lead to a police state.   All Trump supporters, including of course except your neighbor, are all immoral bigots. And remember, don't forget this, the earth only has eight years left. So, all of this contribute to a nihilistic, destructive mind- set. These are all versions of shouting fire. You can argue persuasively that the four years of shouting fire regarding Trump's presidency created a natural distrust in the election that took place, which people felt desired an audit. So that idea didn't come from Q, it came from you, the media. And this entire profit model for CNN in the last decade has been a cultural replication of shouting fire and it's all protected. Anderson Cooper on down. They all have more rights than you. They can call you racist, they can build a climate of division and make money off it, which leads to violence and misery, but they have more rights than you.  And so, they can sit here and they can point at you and say you are racist, and you're evil every night while they are doing something far worse. They are creating division and they are creating -- they're destroying the country.",

The left is saying that they have not only more rights than you, Greg, but what they are saying is that if they are attacked, they have more rights than the thousands who were attacked this past summer during the Black Lives Matter attack where 2,000 police officers were injured, where 30 people were killed, where people lost not only their business and their livelihoods but their hopes and their dreams and the possibility of making it to the next level of their life. OK? So, they are not just equal in terms of rights but also in terms of their lives are not equal, and that is established over and over again through this absurd political theater, is the absolute right word to use. Here's the bottom line, the people responsible for the riot on January 6th are the people who rioted and who convicted -- committed crimes. There are 120 people right now who have been prosecuted, as well they should be. It was an outrage. And what they are doing now is nothing but trying to tarnish Donald Trump so he can never run again and every Republican so that the Republican Party is in a tease saying, my gosh, what are we going to do?  Well, they better not forget that there are 75, 74 million people who voted for Donald Trump. You can try to dissipate, you can try to dispel him, you can do whatever you want through all this theater, but the bottom line is it doesn't matter. Even the Supreme Court doesn't think it matters because Justice Roberts never even showed up. So, what are we doing? Wasting time while Americans are out of jobs? We have a pandemic and China is on the rise.",

I mean, clearly, what's going on, on Capitol Hill today is an attempt to hold democracy and the Constitution up, to celebrate that as the basis that we are a country of laws.  We have seen the impeachment managers build a case block by block that sustains the idea that what Donald Trump did was incite that violence that took place on January 6th. So, to me, it's chilling. It was chilling to hear Trump supporters at a rally saying you know what, destroy the Republican Party. It's chilling to see his tweets attacking McConnell, threatening Vice President Pence.

It reads, quote, \"with NBA teams now in the process of welcoming fans back into their arenas, all teams will play the national anthem in keeping with long-standing league policy.\" End quote. And now Cuban reportedly says he reportedly says he will comply with the league's policy and play the national anthem tonight. Judge, I just want to start with you. The NBA season started in late December. Why do you think it took so long for this to become an issue? He hasn't been playing the anthem since then.",

But I think the telltale here is that Cuban said he would kneel too with his players if he had the chance. I think that tells the whole story. So, he can dance around well, it was a home game there was no one in the stands and now that the NBA has come out with a mandate, he's going to have to play it, but his heart is, I'd kneel with them too.

The Feds are trying to track down the hacker who tried to poison a Tampa Bay water supply by taking over control of a computer systems mouse. So, did I say feel good? I lied because it's actually lye. The hacker increased sodium hydroxide, that's lye, from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million. Lye is what you find in drain cleaners. Sprinkle a lye on a dead horse and you get a puddle of soap. CNN sprinkles it on the truth and calls it primetime. I bring this up for one reason. If we know one thing about government and the media, is that they can't do two things at once. Hell, they can barely do one thing at once. So, while this is happening, you got journalists chasing down problematic phrases instead of actual dangers. Meanwhile, impeachment part two is their theatrical therapy designed to please reporters and Dems alike because they are alike. It won't result in anything except delayed COVID relief and old Democrats mumbling at podiums. We've seen it before as real threats motor on. We knew this 20 years ago as we chased the carry -- Gary Condit case and obsessed over Bill Clinton's infidelities, al-Qaeda had other plans. The world doesn't stop for our pathetic news cycles. The world takes advantage of our media and our politicians. We were warned about the water supply before. Now, maybe it's not a hack but an error. But I'm no expert. I'm in the media. But I'm willing to bet not a single democrat senator cares much. There's a circus in town, and they're in box seats loading up on cotton candy and popcorn and lies. Let's hope they don't drink the water. So, Dana, here's the deal. I'm a little skeptical about certain things. I - - this bothers me because we know the water supply is a target. But whenever somebody says hack, it always turns out to be a mistake that somebody hits a button. Do you remember the missile scare in Hawaii or Anthony Weiner? It's always a hacker.

So, there's that piece of it. But the other thing, Greg.

I will give you an example, who is one of the people that the House impeachment people need to convince? Susan Collins of Maine. Now she may have already made up her mind. She voted that the bill was -- sorry, the trial is constitutional. Whether she will vote to convict, we'll wait and see. However, remember the Kavanaugh hearing and Susan Collins was --"

Where are you sleeping? She is on her own while you and your Senate colleagues are trying to rush her through a hearing, et cetera. The whole boo-hoo-hoo thing, to me, I just -- I understand that there are politics involved here. I also understand there's very serious charges involved. Many of these rioters have been arrested. In fact, when the A.P. looked through and CNN also did a similar thing, they match -- they took many of the rioters who were arrested and looked at their voting records and I think it's really important to remember that many of them, most of them, they didn't even vote in November. All right, so the Republicans have a right to separate from the violence and I think to the great majority, they have. On the politics of it, I understand sticking together. When it comes to the Democrats, I think that they know they are not going to get the votes to convict, but I also think that they think politically they don't have anything to lose.

But what I think America I hope is learning from this trial is that the Democrats and their media enablers have more rights than a private citizen. We always knew that the institutional press has more leeway in destroying your life, the defamation protections and things like that that, but there was a limit and it's always defined as you can't shout fire in a crowded theater, that is the limit. But the media and the politicians that you just talk about, Swalwell, they shout fire every single day to America, it's just that their version of shouting fire comes in different flavors. Police officers are more dangerous than criminals. That led to riots, right? There is a massive domestic terror network worse than ISIS. Well, that's going to lead to a police state. All Trump supporters, including of course except your neighbor, are all immoral bigots. And remember, don't forget this, the earth only has eight years left. So, all of this contribute to a nihilistic, destructive mind- set. These are all versions of shouting fire. You can argue persuasively that the four years of shouting fire regarding Trump's presidency created a natural distrust in the election that took place, which people felt desired an audit. So that idea didn't come from Q, it came from you, the media. And this entire profit model for CNN in the last decade has been a cultural replication of shouting fire and it's all protected. Anderson Cooper on down. They all have more rights than you. They can call you racist, they can build a climate of division and make money off it, which leads to violence and misery, but they have more rights than you. And so, they can sit here and they can point at you and say you are racist, and you're evil every night while they are doing something far worse. They are creating division and they are creating -- they're destroying the country."

      "utterance": "Well, I just want to respond first to what Greg is saying. The left is saying that they have not only more rights than you, Greg, but what they are saying is that if they are attacked, they have more rights than the thousands who were attacked this past summer during the Black Lives Matter attack where 2,000 police officers were injured, where 30 people were killed, where people lost not only their business and their livelihoods but their hopes and their dreams and the possibility of making it to the next level of their life. OK? So, they are not just equal in terms of rights but also in terms of their lives are not equal, and that is established over and over again through this absurd political theater, is the absolute right word to use. Here's the bottom line, the people responsible for the riot on January 6th are the people who rioted and who convicted -- committed crimes. There are 120 people right now who have been prosecuted, as well they should be. It was an outrage. And what they are doing now is nothing but trying to tarnish Donald Trump so he can never run again and every Republican so that the Republican Party is in a tease saying, my gosh, what are we going to do? Well, they better not forget that there are 75, 74 million people who voted for Donald Trump. You can try to dissipate, you can try to dispel him, you can do whatever you want through all this theater, but the bottom line is it doesn't matter. Even the Supreme Court doesn't think it matters because Justice Roberts never even showed up. So, what are we doing? Wasting time while Americans are out of jobs? We have a pandemic and China is on the rise."

Mayors, you know, unions, governors get involved and the president can be there in terms of encouraging, in terms of prodding, in terms of saying here's the best safety protocol for all the children and the teachers to get back, but this is a local decision. Biden's role is really to advise and to advise on the basis of what he gets from CDC and others, and that is where we should hold him accountable.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. Another huge controversy over the national anthem. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said he was putting a halt to playing the song before home games but the NBA is out with a statement. It reads, quote, \"with NBA teams now in the process of welcoming fans back into their arenas, all teams will play the national anthem in keeping with long-standing league policy.\" End quote. And now Cuban reportedly says he reportedly says he will comply with the league's policy and play the national anthem tonight. Judge, I just want to start with you. The NBA season started in late December. Why do you think it took so long for this to become an issue? He hasn't been playing the anthem since then."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it seems that it's because of the home games and now, you know, the NBA has pretty much issued, the officials at the NBA have pretty much issued that they will play the national anthem, and Mark Cuban has kind of given himself some leeway by saying, well, you know, they were really home games, there was no one in the stands, and now the people are coming in the stands then what we'll do is we'll play the national anthem. But I think the telltale here is that Cuban said he would kneel too with his players if he had the chance. I think that tells the whole story. So, he can dance around well, it was a home game there was no one in the stands and now that the NBA has come out with a mandate, he's going to have to play it, but his heart is, I'd kneel with them too. And then when you have Jen Psaki saying, you know, it recognizes the United States failings. I mean, you get so disgusted, do you really want people to come to games, you know, or do you want people to not watch them?"

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, he went full Kaepernick, and Juan, you never go full Kaepernick. What I think happened here, he was probably just trying to be the wokest NBA owner to recruit better. Because a lot of young NBA talent is pretty political, he thought it would help him sign them. But I don't know, I don't think this season ticket holders are going to be down with this. The NBA is not even down with this. I mean, kneeling is one thing. Canceling the anthem? I mean, we finally found out where the line is with social justice. And Mark flew right past it and got teed up big time. I couldn't believe the White House tried to both sides the issue of canceling the national anthem. They went squishy on canceling the national anthem, Juan. I mean, in basketball, you'd call that a brick."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So, Greg, I wanted to actually allow you to hear from Mark Cuban. Here's something he tweeted last year. He said, if you want to complain, complain to your boss, why don't -- doesn't your boss play the national anthem every day before you start at work? What do you think of that defense?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "That's actually not a bad defense because he is the boss and he's the owner, and he could do what he wants. We've seen this before when we were kids. If you and your sister were fighting over what to watch on TV, after a while a parent come in and turn the TV off. It's called why we can't have nice things, right? We can't have nice things because we're now, the media in general, are pledging allegiance to identity politics instead of the flag. It is his team. I don't think it's any call on his patriotism. He was trying to solve a problem that reflects a sad sign of the times where identity politics wherever it goes it destroys. It operates under the protective guise of protest. But once it gets inside the organism, whether it's sports or entertainment or TV shows, it unravels it. It splits instead of unites. All he's trying to do is trying to keep it from splitting even more. Unfortunately, it may not help."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, it's also over because Mark Cuban said, OK, I'm good. I'm going to play the anthem. Like, so -- instead of having any outrage, I'm going to tell you, do you know the history of why we play national anthems at sporting events? I will tell you the answer. World War I, a game between the Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs in 1918, that is a year that is familiar to Yankee fans as the last time the Sox won a World Series before 2012, if you remember that. I mean, I'm a history -- I'm a sports and a history buff, so I knew all of this. Anyway, that's why we do it. It's good. It's unifying. It's America. Let's just move on. No outrage."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You want to feel good story for today? The Feds are trying to track down the hacker who tried to poison a Tampa Bay water supply by taking over control of a computer systems mouse. So, did I say feel good? I lied because it's actually lye. The hacker increased sodium hydroxide, that's lye, from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million. Lye is what you find in drain cleaners. Sprinkle a lye on a dead horse and you get a puddle of soap. CNN sprinkles it on the truth and calls it primetime. I bring this up for one reason. If we know one thing about government and the media, is that they can't do two things at once. Hell, they can barely do one thing at once. So, while this is happening, you got journalists chasing down problematic phrases instead of actual dangers. Meanwhile, impeachment part two is their theatrical therapy designed to please reporters and Dems alike because they are alike. It won't result in anything except delayed COVID relief and old Democrats mumbling at podiums. We've seen it before as real threats motor on. We knew this 20 years ago as we chased the carry -- Gary Condit case and obsessed over Bill Clinton's infidelities, al-Qaeda had other plans. The world doesn't stop for our pathetic news cycles. The world takes advantage of our media and our politicians. We were warned about the water supply before. Now, maybe it's not a hack but an error. But I'm no expert. I'm in the media. But I'm willing to bet not a single democrat senator cares much. There's a circus in town, and they're in box seats loading up on cotton candy and popcorn and lies. Let's hope they don't drink the water. So, Dana, here's the deal. I'm a little skeptical about certain things. I - - this bothers me because we know the water supply is a target. But whenever somebody says hack, it always turns out to be a mistake that somebody hits a button. Do you remember the missile scare in Hawaii or Anthony Weiner? It's always a hacker. Do you think this -- I mean, is it possible that this actually is a hacker?"

      "speaker": "PERINO",

And if you remember, the other story that didn't get a lot of attention early last month was that of the solar winds hacking into not only big corporations in America but all across our government including at the Commerce Department and treasury department, and they were in there for months. They still might be in there. And actually, there's not been enough reporting on that, or basically, acknowledgment of the failure of our government to protect all of us from that. So, there's that piece of it. But the other thing, Greg. When I first heard this story the other night, you were the first person I thought of, not because I thought you were a hacker, but because 10 years ago, when we started THE FIVE, you kept talking about the hardening of soft targets and how technology and terrorism, wherever it was coming from, apparently, they don't even know if this came from inside the United States or outside or even if it was a hack to your point.

So, what we have to do is look at this, like you said, as a red flag, and promote whoever our cyber warfare guys are. Make them their own military branch like the Space Force. Give them their own uniforms. I guarantee you, this is the wave of the future. And I'm not scared of missiles anymore. I'm afraid of hackers, and I'm not afraid of much."

And it's now -- I mean, if you marry a drone with, you know, a packet of lye, how easy is that to just fly a drone over a reservoir? You don't need to hack?"

There have been hacked of hospitals, there have been hacked ransomware now. You know, people being extorted and all that. So, right now, it looks to me like cybercrime may be the most extensive crime impacting America because it's just everywhere. And you know, people talk about the hackers, but a hacker is an actual person, and maybe they're working for somebody. But we got to arrest them, we got to prosecute. We got to go after these people. Because when they're going after a water supply, that means that they're trying to kill us."

You know, cybercrime is probably the number one crime that affects Americans more than any other crime. And the hardening of the grid, and the hardening of anything that protects our water supply is essential. And shame on us if we don't take advantage of the fact that there have been many warnings and there's a lot to lose in this world where America is, you know, not the favorite of some outrageous evil countries. And I'll leave it at that"

I'm So excited to share this book with everyone. It feels like the right book at the right time. Less than a month now. And we are starting a new feature on our FIVE's Insta Story page, where we will be posting the list of songs we play on THE FIVE every day. I know you love my songs.
