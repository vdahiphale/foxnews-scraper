However, we also learned another campaign advisor George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. The president's response to the news, quote, sorry, but this is years ago before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign, but why aren't crooked Hillary and the Dems the focus?

However, we also learned another campaign advisor George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. The president's response to the news, quote, sorry, but this is years ago before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign, but why aren't crooked Hillary and the Dems the focus?

That's nothing else. I do sense a bit of deflation in the media. They're disappointed. They expected a pony for their birthday, and this is a goldfish. That's why you're seeing a lot of press saying, oh, this is only the first part. Just wait. Just wait. Just wait. And maybe they're right, but right now we knew this is coming.

I think there's more to come as well. And so I'm curious as to whether or not they're going to try to work or cut some kind of deal with him to get more information.

Papadopoulos is just some 30-year-old overly ambitious guy that tried to dig up dirt, failed. Remember, Brian Fallon, Hillary's spokesperson, said getting opposition research dirt from foreigners is a good thing. And then tried to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin. That got killed by the Trump campaign. So maybe he's cooperating now. There are some emails going back and forth. The White House provided the investigators with those emails, but now I'm hearing something like he may have been wearing a wire which I think scares everybody."

      "utterance": "Right. So Papadopoulos is probably the most furious of the issues today in terms of looking forward, if you want to look forward. But let's stop for a second before I get there and just talk about Manafort, because Manafort has an interesting history I think is pretty well known. Manafort worked in Reagan's campaign in the 80's, starts his own lobbying firm with Charlie Black and Roger Stone, another Trump intimate. And then, goes off afterwards and he's representing some absolutely reprehensible people around the world. I mean, so the question becomes, and I think this is one issue you raised earlier, Dana. Why would Donald Trump hire Paul Manafort? I mean, it's a real question."
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I mean, that's been known for a while. I mean, that was actually -- that was brought up at the time. But Manafort and his deputy, Rick gates, who also pleaded not guilty today, they were able to get the convention delegates."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No, that was after. That was after. He brings them back to, you know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "What I'm saying to you is we can hire lots of effective people who will employ all sorts of means in order to get what they want, but you don't bring them in if you're running for president and you realize this could have tremendous negative implications for you and for your reputation down the line. But to get back to Papadopoulos, I think that what we now understand is, and I think this is to me the most intriguing part he says he has a meeting with a professor over in London. And the professor says to him, oh, you know, Russia has a batch of emails on Hillary Clinton, a batch of dirt, right? And then we learn Roger Stone is saying, oh, yeah, more is coming. And then, guess what, more does come in terms of the hacked emails from John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. So the question is at that point."

    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "How we got from the emails? He, the professor, who has contacts with Russia, and in fact that's the reason Papadopoulos was meeting with him, the professor says to him we've got a batch of emails from the Clinton campaign."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Or and then there's another way to look at it, Greg, which is to say that they were blowing the kid off. A kid, he's 30 years old, and he's responsible for his actions. But that he's overzealous and they're basically like, please, would you just like -- please go away. This is not going to be a high-level thing. I don't know if that's what's going to happen. He pleaded guilty, so I guess."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

You know, I do think that the Manafort scandal, what you're seeing now, is I guess, when you look at it, a problem that you hoped to have because it means you won. It's like they hired this guy and they go, well, he's actually a pretty dark character. But if we win, we'll deal with it then.

Tony Podesta, the big Democratic power lobbying guy, who we found out about 2 weeks ago was being spoken to by the investigators on Mueller's team, he stepped down from his very prestigious lobbying firm today. What do you think that means?"

He worked on the inaugural committee -- or the transition period right after the election, and then the inaugural committee. So I think that was a little bit of a surprise. Like, oh, I never thought about him. I do think that in some ways people might have been surprised today that it wasn't Mike Flynn, the former national security advisor who's been on the campaign trail, who we know has been in contact with prosecutors in this case. So I don't know if there is more to come or not. I just -- I don't know. I feel like it's pretty locked up. This guy, Papadopoulos, got arrested in July, and we don't hear about it until today.

Who recovered the notes? I don't know if he recovered them when he busted into the guys house, but he has Manafort's notes from that meeting. So he's going to want to know from Manafort, what happened at the meeting, and secondly, was their follow-up to it? So that then leads -- and this is, you know, how you were thinking. You were saying, well, there's no direct tie. But if they know that in fact the Russians are taking certain steps then they're going to take may be coordinated.

Everybody knew before it was coming out, and it was leaked. So he's absolutely right, and he is a former prosecutor. He knows that is inappropriate, what transpired here. I mean, of course, there was speculation before, early on in the investigation. Obviously, Manafort. And we saw them target his house and go in there with a whole team, et cetera. That was also kind of unbecoming, in that it was done in such a large, like, splashy way. And now this situation. So you know, they have to do an investigation into that.

So people on the right will say, listen, when you add that to the fact that there's been a lot of high-profile Democratic attorneys assigned to this case; when you add that to the raid that was pretty strong; and the fact that Mueller is buddies with Comey; and Mueller was at the FBI when the Uranium One deal was looked at, and then the investigation was not followed through with.

These investigations should be open like the 9/11 Commission, where you take evidence in public, and it's conducted by nonpartisans. Because instead, what you have here is what Alan Dershowitz has coined the criminalization of political differences. He has a book out on it. And he's a legendary liberal. He's a progressive.

They've got really smart takes on things, and there's no age limit -- or age requirement to run for governor of Texas. So -- I'm sorry, Kansas. There's one Democrat and three Republicans.
