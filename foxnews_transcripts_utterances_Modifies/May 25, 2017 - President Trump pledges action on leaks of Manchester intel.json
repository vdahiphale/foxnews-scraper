You know, the plague of leaks at U.S. agencies took a troubling new turn today when police in the U.K. said, they will go and stop sharing intelligence and evidence with their U.S. counterparts because of the plague of leaks that have been coming out here at least to the United States, about the Manchester bombing.  They were infuriated in the U.K. when the name of the bomber was released in the United States before they were ready to release it. And then the fact that these photographs of bomb evidence showed up in \"The New York Times,\" it basically just hit the roof. So, Theresa May when she came to NATO today said that she was going to speak with President Trump about the intelligence sharing that's going on between the U.S. and the U.K. Listen here.",

DANA PERINO, CO-HOST Well, I think on the leak portion of this, that it is dangerous if you have an investigation that's ongoing and you reveal evidence to early. For example, some of the photographs that were put forward included pictures of a bolt that were used. So, you could conceivably trace that back. And people who are responsible could cover their tracks if they think that they are about to get made because of the investigation.  That said, it is possible that you could go through an investigation like this and find out that the leak was not necessarily meant to hurt President Trump or to hurt the U.K. investigation. This information was out there and available and there could have been a mixed communication between the Brits and the Americans. But obviously it should be investigated. I also think though, we have to remember that leakers are sometimes glamorized. Okay? And that would include somebody like an Ed Snowden. So, he becomes extremely famous and he is just praised from certain quarters, from all over the world. He is living the high life. Even though he has to live in Russia.",

But here's the worst part about this story for me. Their spokesperson, the spokesperson for the candidate lied about what happened and put out a statement saying something completely that didn't happen. On paper. They put it out there. And actually, there are eyewitnesses that happen to work for FOX News. And Alicia Cuna says, this is what I saw happened. She has three other witnesses. And this is what I think is really bad. If you think that you can actually lie about what happened and get away with it? Now, he is probably going to win tonight. Fine, here comes another winner to Washington, D.C.",

You know, the plague of leaks at U.S. agencies took a troubling new turn today when police in the U.K. said, they will go and stop sharing intelligence and evidence with their U.S. counterparts because of the plague of leaks that have been coming out here at least to the United States, about the Manchester bombing. They were infuriated in the U.K. when the name of the bomber was released in the United States before they were ready to release it. And then the fact that these photographs of bomb evidence showed up in \"The New York Times,\" it basically just hit the roof. So, Theresa May when she came to NATO today said that she was going to speak with President Trump about the intelligence sharing that's going on between the U.S. and the U.K. Listen here."

I'm asking the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to launch a complete review of this matter and if appropriate, the culprits should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\" Now, what he was addressing at the NATO Summit earlier today, President Trump really kind of appealed to the other 27 membered nations of the alliance to throw in more on the issue of terrorism than they have in the past. To become full partners in going after ISIS and the terrorism that it inspires. Listen to what the President said."

But the President would like to see them do that. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state as he was en route from Israel to Italy yesterday or the day before -- it's getting a little hazy now -- said that he thinks they will probably move in that direction but right now they are going to stay in an observational stand point -- Kimberly."

DANA PERINO, CO-HOST Well, I think on the leak portion of this, that it is dangerous if you have an investigation that's ongoing and you reveal evidence to early. For example, some of the photographs that were put forward included pictures of a bolt that were used. So, you could conceivably trace that back. And people who are responsible could cover their tracks if they think that they are about to get made because of the investigation. That said, it is possible that you could go through an investigation like this and find out that the leak was not necessarily meant to hurt President Trump or to hurt the U.K. investigation. This information was out there and available and there could have been a mixed communication between the Brits and the Americans. But obviously it should be investigated. I also think though, we have to remember that leakers are sometimes glamorized. Okay? And that would include somebody like an Ed Snowden. So, he becomes extremely famous and he is just praised from certain quarters, from all over the world. He is living the high life. Even though he has to live in Russia."

America is the big fish. And countries bristle when we don't do not observe their boundaries. Well, they know that we're the most powerful country in the world. We don't have to throw it in their face. They don't want to be the robin to our batman. Even though they are the robin to our batman.

And a lot of times, journalists, we saw it last week where they said, we are not going to reveal the city. We're just going to reveal the information that pertained to the leaks. You have got to deal with the leakers. And at the end of the day, all of these leakers report to one person. Donald J. Trump. He is the head of this government.

I am going to try to fix this and by 6 o'cloc tonight when Bret Baier was doing \"Special Report,\" he had breaking news alert, okay, just found out that the Brits now have said, okay, no problem, we will going to start sharing intelligence again.

He has to figure out a way to try to help them. Because when President Trump beat Hillary Clinton, now the Democrats are in the wilderness. They don't have anybody. There's a really interesting balance between allowing your success or the space he needs in order to be commander in chief and do it in his way and also trying to protect your legacy. I'm not sure what President Obama is going to come down on that but it look like it is going to be a lot more active."

No one is building a wall to hide. It's kind of a college freshman comment to make. Walls are made so you can hide behind them? Smart guy President Obama should live outside. We all live within walls. If walls imply you are a coward, President Obama should live on the street and prove that we don't need walls. They are the most practical thing on the planet. They protect you. The wall isn't for hiding. It's for protecting."

There's also weapons, the criminality in terms of building their and core group and jumble people into gangs and have them commit crime. Violence is at the core of it. It's not just isolated to drug trafficking. That is the reality of this situation. By the way, no problem with sessions and the rest of the DOJ saying let's get rid of ms-13 and other violent gangs that are plaguing our urban communities. That is the beginning of it. Bottom line, enforced immigration laws are on the book."

They should have somebody come at the point person that answers questions about Russian investigations and special counsel, because it allows them and freeze them up to be able to talk about jobs, economy, health care bill, foreign policy. Interestingly, when Bill Clinton did it he had Lanny Davis. Lanny Davis is one of the D.C. insider type lawyers. And also he knew all of the press. They all live together in northwest D.C.

It's not too late. He can turn this around and I think because of the situation with how the way the media and et cetera with all the Russian collusion investigation, this has now forced a hand in terms of -- now we have to deal with it. Let's put a team in place. I think he has some very good people that he is going to roll out on this. That is really going to shut this down, so the sooner the better."
