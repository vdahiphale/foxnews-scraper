But I wonder, does it confession happen because the guilt became too much? Or did they realize their confession no longer carries any real consequence? They get to have their cake and eat it too. Or in Brian Stelter's case, two cakes and a bucket of corndogs. So easy, so cheap. But so true. I speak of this tsunami of people now admitting the media covered up Hunter Biden's laptop, nearly two years later with Joe as president, people are starting to admit what we knew all along.",

Anyway, it's not just bill, even the Washington Post is owning up. They claim the Hunter story is an opportunity for reckoning while finally reporting on the multimillion dollar deals the president's son was making with the Chinese. And that doesn't even include the millions that he spent on hookers or kung pao chicken. If Hunter worked any harder for the Chinese, he'd spent his weekend sewing Nikes. The wild post admits the Biden family profited from trading overseas of his name. They say it doesn't mean Joe acted corruptly. You know, it's like corrupt people can't see corruption in other people, even when it's their job to do so and tell us about it. And if he's ne'er-do-well well son, suddenly earning millions is something he wouldn't notice. Like the growing stain on the front of his trousers. But then the post asked the dumbest question of the year. Why is confirmation of a story that surfaced in the fall of 2020 emerging only now? (INAUDIBLE) post. Why don't you ask your own news bureau? The press asking why the story is only emerging now. That's like O.J. Simpson asking what happened to his ex-wife Nicole. Or Scott Peterson putting up missing posters of his wife all around the neighborhood. Your hands were all over this. The Washington Post then noted that after the New York Post published a blockbuster piece \"Twitter blocked the story altogether. Suspended the New York Post's account for sharing. Facebook downranked the story and the algorithms that govern user's news feeds.\" Well, thanks, guys. We already knew this. There was a disinformation campaign all right but the culprits weren't chugging vodka in Moscow, they were sipping lattes in Silicon Valley. But now, the Washington Post and the New York Times have vouched for many of the e-mails, and cite the prompted allegations of a cover up or at best a double standard in the treatment of conservative and liberal politicians by mainstream media and social media sites. Well, hello there, sleepyheads. Did you have a nice nap? Of course, WaPo then offers a lame defense saying, we'd all been unwitting tools of Russian influence. So, it was only prudent to suspect of a similar plot here. But these editors weren't unwitting. They were just a bunch of tools. Because I don't remember that being prudent about those other phony plots. They were only prudent about one real one. And they conclude with this solemn idiocy. The lesson learned from 2016 was to air on the side of setting aside questionable material in the heat of a political campaign. The lesson learned from 2020 may well be that there's also a danger of suppressing accurate and relevant stories. So, you see what they did there? It was important to bury it then. But it's not to bury it now. Which means it's time for?",

Although with Biden inflation that's not worth only thousands. But could it be that the media knows indictments are coming down so why not speed it up? Get it over with away from 2024 while Joe is still in power. So, it's easy for him to pardon his son and maybe his brother. Before Joe is wheeled off on a two-wheel hand truck like Hannibal Lecter. Then the Dems can replace him with a candidate who doesn't need a cheat sheet to tell you his name and address. So, they suppress to win an election that confess to win another.

So, what happens when someone admits to wrongdoing years after the wrongdoing has been committed? For me, it was getting the Menudo tattoo removed. But I wonder, does it confession happen because the guilt became too much? Or did they realize their confession no longer carries any real consequence? They get to have their cake and eat it too. Or in Brian Stelter's case, two cakes and a bucket of corndogs. So easy, so cheap. But so true. I speak of this tsunami of people now admitting the media covered up Hunter Biden's laptop, nearly two years later with Joe as president, people are starting to admit what we knew all along."

And, you know, you made a living being ne'er-do-well who was taking money just because you were the vice president's son and you had influence. He got, I think, 4.8 -- yes, $8 million from Chinese energy companies. It looks like the left-wing media just buried the story because it wasn't part of their narrative. And that's why people don't trust the media.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "It looks like it. It's also like he's dare I say woke, but in a good way. Credit to Maher he's right, he's right. Anyway, it's not just bill, even the Washington Post is owning up. They claim the Hunter story is an opportunity for reckoning while finally reporting on the multimillion dollar deals the president's son was making with the Chinese. And that doesn't even include the millions that he spent on hookers or kung pao chicken. If Hunter worked any harder for the Chinese, he'd spent his weekend sewing Nikes. The wild post admits the Biden family profited from trading overseas of his name. They say it doesn't mean Joe acted corruptly. You know, it's like corrupt people can't see corruption in other people, even when it's their job to do so and tell us about it. And if he's ne'er-do-well well son, suddenly earning millions is something he wouldn't notice. Like the growing stain on the front of his trousers. But then the post asked the dumbest question of the year. Why is confirmation of a story that surfaced in the fall of 2020 emerging only now? (INAUDIBLE) post. Why don't you ask your own news bureau? The press asking why the story is only emerging now. That's like O.J. Simpson asking what happened to his ex-wife Nicole. Or Scott Peterson putting up missing posters of his wife all around the neighborhood. Your hands were all over this. The Washington Post then noted that after the New York Post published a blockbuster piece \"Twitter blocked the story altogether. Suspended the New York Post's account for sharing. Facebook downranked the story and the algorithms that govern user's news feeds.\" Well, thanks, guys. We already knew this. There was a disinformation campaign all right but the culprits weren't chugging vodka in Moscow, they were sipping lattes in Silicon Valley. But now, the Washington Post and the New York Times have vouched for many of the e-mails, and cite the prompted allegations of a cover up or at best a double standard in the treatment of conservative and liberal politicians by mainstream media and social media sites. Well, hello there, sleepyheads. Did you have a nice nap? Of course, WaPo then offers a lame defense saying, we'd all been unwitting tools of Russian influence. So, it was only prudent to suspect of a similar plot here. But these editors weren't unwitting. They were just a bunch of tools. Because I don't remember that being prudent about those other phony plots. They were only prudent about one real one. And they conclude with this solemn idiocy. The lesson learned from 2016 was to air on the side of setting aside questionable material in the heat of a political campaign. The lesson learned from 2020 may well be that there's also a danger of suppressing accurate and relevant stories. So, you see what they did there? It was important to bury it then. But it's not to bury it now. Which means it's time for?"

It's like paying a small fine for behavior that earns you millions. Sure, paying it sucks, but it still means you got the millions in the first place. Although with Biden inflation that's not worth only thousands. But could it be that the media knows indictments are coming down so why not speed it up? Get it over with away from 2024 while Joe is still in power. So, it's easy for him to pardon his son and maybe his brother. Before Joe is wheeled off on a two-wheel hand truck like Hannibal Lecter. Then the Dems can replace him with a candidate who doesn't need a cheat sheet to tell you his name and address. So, they suppress to win an election that confess to win another.

They make me look like Mr. Rogers. So, enter Elon Musk.

It makes him Twitter's largest shareholder, it's actually worth nearly $3 billion. To put that in perspective, that's $1 billion times three. Thank you."
