The president says the 4.1 percent growth in GDP in the second quarter shows his policies on trade and taxes and deregulation are working.

MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS & PUBLIC SERVICE: Look, first of all, we should all be celebrating 4.1 economic growth. That's a good number, a strong number. It also would have been the fifth strongest number of the Obama administration, right? The Obama administration -- this is the continuation of economic recovery that began in 2009 and 2010. That strong economy wasn't enough to save Democrats last time. It's not enough to say it will be enough to say it would save Republicans this time. I think Jonah's point cannot be overstated that for a lot of these voters, particularly suburban voters where gas prices are going up, where they are a little bit more uncertainty around health care. Add to that, some of these working-class voters who are getting hit by the results of the tariffs on steel and aluminum, who are getting hit by agricultural voters who are getting hit by issues like soybeans. There's enough economic uncertainty that even with the strong number I think Republicans are still facing a headwind.",

In a 2009 article, Kavanaugh wrote this, like civil suits, criminal investigations take the presidents focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people.

There's a case, the Espy (ph) case, closest one that you can find. He was a cabinet officer. And they said he could only be subpoenaed, in essence, taken away from his duties if there was no other way to get the information. So the president would at least have that privilege. Where he has the complete privilege and therefore can't be investigated at all, I really would have to do more research. I mean there's a good argument that that's the case.

I often see it stated as fact that Cohen knows where every body is buried. Actually, he doesn't. He knows where like, you know, maybe like 20 bodies are buried. But -- but there's probably, you know, whatever -- however many more. It's really Weisselberg, the lawyer who's been with Trump for decades, who actually started working for Trump's father, Fred Trump, who's just been subpoenaed, he's the guy who really has visibility.

So, these are really more just comments saying as interest rates are going up, it's something that the president has a concern. But let me be clear, he absolutely respects the independence of the Fed, and the issue is the market expects interest rates to keep going up. So, the only question is how far, and for how long? And we think the Fed will be very careful in managing the economy."

      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",

Twitter fell 20 percent Friday. And Intel and Apple also fell. Mr. Secretary, are you concerned about investors souring on tech stocks, especially those tech stocks involving social media, which is I think you would agree, have been big drivers of growth in the economy and big drivers of rise in the markets?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, I've always believed that diversified portfolios of U.S. stocks are great investments and will continue to be. As you can see, the market is not efficient. The fact that you could have a one-day correction of these magnitudes just goes to show you that in the short term, the market is not necessarily efficient, but I'm not concerned about this at all. And again, investors should have diversified portfolios. The tech stocks have obviously had an incredible run. And, you know, kind of -- you look at the Nasdaq, you look at the S&P, you look at the Dow, the markets obviously doing very well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's turn to trade. President Trump announced what he called a, quote, breakthrough agreement on trade with the European Union this week. But, sir, isn't he exaggerating a bit? There were no tariffs removed in his discussions with the European Commission, there were few specific commitments. There was one on soybeans, and there was no timetable. In fact, Mr. Secretary, all that the president and the president of the European Commission agreed on is to start talking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, that's actually not the case and let me just step back for a second. These talks started with the president of the G7 saying let's have no tariffs, no barriers, no subsidies. Those talks continued with the G7. I was at the G20. I met with my counterparts. And then when we had the Juncker, the president of the E.U., we specifically did go through a detailed discussion. We had several hours of kind of negotiating back and forth on an outline of an agreement and now, we have the hard work. But we've said, the first step is going to be to resolve the steel and aluminum tariffs and when we do that, the retaliatory tariffs will come off, but this was also an agreement to reduce tariffs significantly across the board and we have about a trillion dollars of trade. So, this is a -- this is a very big opportunity to do things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But, Mr. Secretary, let me give you one example of where the president and the administration makes it sound like there is a deal and the E.U. makes it sound like there isn't. Here's what the president said to farmers in Iowa this week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We just opened up you're up for you, farmers. If you are not going to be too angry with Trump, I can tell you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But as soon as he said that the spokesperson for the European Commission gave this response. Quote: Agriculture is out of the scope of these discussions. We are not negotiating about agricultural products. Mr. Secretary, you are at odds, the president is at odds with the European Union before the talks even start."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Chris, I was in the room and we had specific conversations about agriculture and the need to break down the barriers on agriculture and have more opportunities for our farmers. We specifically talked about soybeans, but we specifically agreed we'd look at these other markets, and it was very clear that our objective as part of this whole agreement is the Europeans have to open up more opportunities for our farmers and our agriculture. So, I can't comment on their comment. This will be an important part of any agreement we reached."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But let me just ask you directly because this is on the record. The spokesperson for the European commission said, let me quote it again, we are not negotiating about agricultural products. So, are you right, or is she right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Again, let me be clear, we had specific conversation about soybeans, that was step one. We discussed other areas. And, again, this is all part of a negotiation. It's -- we will have an agreement, so it will be in accomplishing agreement. We want to drop tariffs and barriers across the board. That's what we are focused on doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Forgive my skepticism and the skepticism of other people on this, Mr. Secretary, but I don't have to tell you, there's a big difference between trade talks and a trade deal. Here you were in May, here on \"Fox News Sunday\" talking about trade with China."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "We are putting the trade war on hold. So, right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But within weeks of your making that declaration on their show, President Trump announced $50 billion in new tariffs, or tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. So, you know, what looked like a truce one minute can fall apart the next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, you're right, these are complicated negotiations and these have to be turned into a real agreement that's literally hundreds and hundreds of pages. So, we're going to go part by part with Europe. I was down in Mexico last week. We had a terrific meeting with the new administration. The NAFTA talks are back on track. That's our number one priority now, to get NAFTA done. We are going to negotiate piece by piece with the E.U. And, you know, we continue to have conversations with China. And we'll see where we get, but you're right, these things have to be negotiated because the president is very clear, he doesn't just want talk, we need our counterparts to follow through and deliver, breaking down barriers and creating better opportunities so that we can reduce our giant trade deficit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Finally, Mr. Secretary, in response to farmers concerned about getting hit by tariffs, the administration announced this week a $12 billion package in emergency aid. I looked back to the record and you have spoken out several times against corporate welfare. So, when did handouts to farmers become strong, good, solid, conservative policy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, I don't think these are handouts. So, it would be one thing if we were just subsidizing markets, and that's not what we are doing here. This is a -- this is a short-term solution to deal with the retaliatory tariffs where you have people who put tariffs, which, by the way, are against WTO rules and unfair and targeting our farmers. So, we are sticking up for our farmers so that they don't get hurt in these trade discussions. These are not long-term subsidies for the industry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "And what do you say to some Republican senators who balked at this idea this week and said they need trade, not aid?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Well, we agree with that. The focus is trade, not aid, and that's why we're focused on negotiating these agreements. But again, the president is not willing to live with the status quo where other countries have taken advantage of the rules and had free trade here and our companies and our workers can compete fairly, and it's just not fair that China has complete open access to our markets and we have virtually limited access to their markets and forced joint ventures. And we are focused on, as we said, free and fair trade, let's take down all the barriers."

Jonah Goldberg of the National Review, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, Jonathan Swan, who covers the White House for \"Axios\", and Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner. Jonah, how big a deal is this 4.1 percent number GDP growth in the second quarter, and is it enough for Republicans to hang their hats on as they try to hold onto control of the House in November?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW",
      "utterance": "Historically, normally, you would think it would be, and it is a big deal -- 4.1 is a big number. The problem is, is that for the Republicans are suffering most are among essentially white college educated women in suburban districts. They seem to be immune to the boom in the economy and the gender gap is unprecedented for congressional candidates. And so, the idea that the economy alone is what these women are going to vote for when they are going to be the ones providing the margins of difference whether or not they are going to hold onto the House I think is unlikely and is probably very worrisome to the White House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Mo, there has been a lot of talk about a blue wave this November, a big Democratic pickup, may be control of the House, maybe even control of the Senate. But I think you would agree in the absence of where the economy is always the top issue and when you got strong economic growth, when you got historically low unemployment number, isn't that a pretty strong record for Republicans to run on? MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS & PUBLIC SERVICE: Look, first of all, we should all be celebrating 4.1 economic growth. That's a good number, a strong number. It also would have been the fifth strongest number of the Obama administration, right? The Obama administration -- this is the continuation of economic recovery that began in 2009 and 2010. That strong economy wasn't enough to save Democrats last time. It's not enough to say it will be enough to say it would save Republicans this time. I think Jonah's point cannot be overstated that for a lot of these voters, particularly suburban voters where gas prices are going up, where they are a little bit more uncertainty around health care. Add to that, some of these working-class voters who are getting hit by the results of the tariffs on steel and aluminum, who are getting hit by agricultural voters who are getting hit by issues like soybeans. There's enough economic uncertainty that even with the strong number I think Republicans are still facing a headwind."

      "speaker": "JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "Well, there is no dialing down of tariffs or intention, I mean, the tariffs all of remain in place, the steel and aluminum tariffs, and the retaliatory tariffs. And if what Secretary Mnuchin told you is true, which is the White House will only accept an encompassing -- I think he used the word encompassing deal, which includes agriculture, well, they're going to have some problems because every country, every bloc of countries has its pet political issues that they don't want to touch. For Germany, it's the cars. That's why cars weren't in that agreement. They were explicitly excluded. Non-auto industrial goods. Agriculture -- a big issue in Europe. Again, they are protected industries. So --"

You've got the objective page, zero tariffs on all industries. This is basically a narrower version of TTIP in the goals. And guess what? It's going to be really hard, like any massive trade negotiation. So, look, I don't have any indication that they are going to withdraw the steel and aluminum tariffs, but I do know that the Republicans on the Hill are putting immense pressure now on the administration quietly because they are worried. Your whole first conversation about the economy, Republicans on the Hill see the trade agenda as the biggest risk to that for the midterms."

The whole exercise of him coming here, meeting with the president and doing this joint press conference. Sometimes conflict resolution 101 tells you that when you have these really contentious negotiations, the two sides are really far apart, they are not agreeing on anything, this battle sort of reaching the tipping point where it becomes a war, the best thing to do is to just to agree to agree later on and to a certain extent, that was what they achieved coming out of this.

So, I don't know if this is just bluster, bluffing that he feels dissatisfied that in the negotiations he's had with members of the Senate that they haven't given him more or said to them is going to get what he wants for his wall.

He then proceeded to record two hours of that conversation. It makes him a total liar. I didn't know that.

His tapes are filled with lies, including the most basic of all, he wasn't recording it. But, no, he didn't like to them. Cohen, I -- is a reported -- this is a leak now, so I don't -- he may change it. Cohen -- you have to pick the day to figure out the story. So Cohen said that he was present at two different meetings. He was present at a meeting with Donald Junior, Jared, a group of other people, in which they talked about the meeting two days later with the Russians. Then he said he was present at a meeting, the day of the meeting, in the president's office, in which either Donald Junior, Jared or a few people came in and told the president. Every other participant in both those meetings say it is not true. There was no such meeting in advance. There was no such interruption. If he taped everything else, why the heck didn't he tape this? It's not on tape. And he's capable, I think, unfortunately, of doctoring tapes. Hasn't done that. It would be hard to do that now since we have an expert all over it. So it's just flat-out untrue. And what -- are you surprised he's lying? I mean I would have been surprised back then, but now that I know all this about him, it seems to me his default position is to lie. He's a bad liar because he lies in contradiction to tapes and he lies in contradiction to what I just said is probably supported by anywhere from two to five witnesses."

And the New York Times reporters who got the leak have confirmed that, which is unusual for them to do that. Maggie Haberman and Mike Schmidt. That leak did not come from us. The court order allows us to respond without waiving any privilege. Well, it's not my privilege, it's the president's privilege. If we have to defend him. That's exactly what we were doing. And it has been very helpful to us because now we've been able to put out the whole transcripts, which contradicts several things that Lanny Davis says. He's almost as bad as Cohen. I mean he's said that Cohen didn't intend to deceive when he did these tape recordings. What is it to take a phone, put it in a drawer and tell somebody you're not recording them if it isn't an intent to deceive?

In 1999, Kavanaugh said of the case in which the Supreme Court ordered Richard Nixon to turn over the White House tapes, quote, maybe Nixon -- the Nixon versus U.S. case -- was wrongly decided. In a 2009 article, Kavanaugh wrote this, like civil suits, criminal investigations take the presidents focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president. Question, is Judge Kavanaugh out right the law?"

      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "You know, I've looked at the law and I don't -- I really can't say those are legal opinions. Those are really just things he's saying. We don't see the authority. We don't see -- I mean I believe that the Constitution is clear that the president cannot be subpoenaed, or if he is subpoenaed he has a right to challenge it on the grounds that they haven't exhausted all other possibilities, that they don't have other ways to get the information. There's a case, the Espy (ph) case, closest one that you can find. He was a cabinet officer. And they said he could only be subpoenaed, in essence, taken away from his duties if there was no other way to get the information. So the president would at least have that privilege. Where he has the complete privilege and therefore can't be investigated at all, I really would have to do more research. I mean there's a good argument that that's the case. Other law review articles have said that. It does exist as the law in most countries, the head of state has immunity, until after he's out of office. But other countries it does. So that requires more analysis."

And I know that these off-the-cuff opinions like this, when somebody sits down and starts looking at the law as I was just doing, he may very well go in the other direction. So I wouldn't count on Kavanaugh's vote on this. This is a question of first impression. And the Trump situation is very different than the Nixon situation. So I don't think we get an edge one way or the other. I think the Supreme Court is about as straight as you're going to get in our country. And this is going to be a case that they're going to have to decide in the first instance. And it doesn't happen if they don't subpoena him. And no president has ever submitted to a subpoena. Even Clinton, who was subpoenaed, they had to withdraw it before he would testify."

And if you take Rudy Giuliani as a vessel for that anger and sort of, you know, going out and calling Cohen a pathological liar, et cetera, et cetera, I mean that's a pretty good proxy. But as a -- as -- as regards how much exposure he has, the one thing I will say is, people do misconceive Michael Cohen's role in Trump world. He was this sort of off the books kind of lawyer, as you can see from that tape recording, but it's not like he had full visibility over everything. I often see it stated as fact that Cohen knows where every body is buried. Actually, he doesn't. He knows where like, you know, maybe like 20 bodies are buried. But -- but there's probably, you know, whatever -- however many more. It's really Weisselberg, the lawyer who's been with Trump for decades, who actually started working for Trump's father, Fred Trump, who's just been subpoenaed, he's the guy who really has visibility.

But when Cohen says that Donald Trump knew about the meeting in Trump Tower, what that does is -- and also when we have this stuff about the payments, this wipes away a vast swath of the defenses at the White House and its biggest supporters have been making for a very, very long time. They can't keep saying things are fake news when the media is not even part of it, when it's a taped -- taped interview or a taped phone conversation and it -- it shrinks the circle of plausible deniability across a vast array of things.

I'm referring specifically to President Trump saying that he wasn't sure if he was going to take the intelligence community's assessment at face value that they -- that the Russians had interfered in the election. Pompeo said in that hearing a few moments after that exchange that the president did take the intelligence community's assessment at face value. That's a major sticking point. On the bigger issue of the Helsinki summit, he's almost having -- the president's almost having a little bit of a Barack Obama moment. Remember, in 2011, 2012, nobody wanted President Obama to be talking to the mullah's in Iran. Nobody in Congress. Nobody -- the American people didn't want this. And he wanted a deal.

So the president rescinds the invitation and then the Russians say, well, you know, you can always come to us. It's like Putin's just sitting there like a cat playing with a toy, right? He's just -- he's -- he is having the time of his life with this president of the United States. When the president -- and Gillian's point is right -- when the president is out there saying that he doesn't necessarily accept the intelligence community's assessment, and forced them to backpedal on that and say, no, I do, but then tweets within days that once again that it is a hoax, Putin is getting everything he wants out of this relationship and that is not a good thing for the United States."

He thinks that he can get a deal in Syria. I don't know what the deal looks like. Obviously, the official U.S. position is they want to get Iran as far out of Syria as possible. Whether Putin's willing to provide pressure, I think we should all be pretty skeptical about that. The one country that's actually quite happy with Trump's conversations with Putin is Israel. The Israelis are actually pretty happy with them having these discussions and they are wanting to push the Iranians as far away from their border as possible. And, of course, Bibi Netanyahu, the Israeli leader, actually has a pretty decent relationship with Putin. So, look, I think it's going to be very hard both -- because of domestic politics and, you know, the general public, but also Capitol Hill. These members are now getting pretty aggressive on Russia and wanting to sanction them further. So I think Trump's going to have a lot of trouble cutting anything that's --"

There was an announcement of a meeting, I think it was Friday, that the president had with the National Security Council and we were told this was a meeting about election meddling in 2018. And -- and what surprised me is to the best of my knowledge -- there may have been other meetings -- but this is the first one that they had announced. One would think that they would have done this some time ago."
