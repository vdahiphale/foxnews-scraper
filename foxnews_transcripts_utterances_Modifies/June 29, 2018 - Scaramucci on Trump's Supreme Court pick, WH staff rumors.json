That he's led to a disruption in your life or a lower living standard, or some kind of disavow of your quality of life. And the answer is there hasn't been any.  So, obviously, the economy does fall that will be an issue for all politicians and will be issued for all companies in America. And that'll be a lot of pain. So, I really wish that Bill didn't say that. Having said that, the very good news is the policies have been fantastic. The stimulus has been fantastic as relates to the tax cuts that they were celebrating earlier today.

The fact is there's lots of ways to figure out where someone is on an issue like Roe v. Wade. Many of the people on the list of 25 are very familiar to people in D.C. Many of them have come to conferences and their views are fairly well known so you don't have to ask the question.

And I say that, because some of the remains were returned over 20 years ago and still have not been identified. So the Department of Defense is not using updated DNA technology. They're using very expensive technology that takes four to five months for a test result to come in. Where, if they were using nuclear DNA technology the test results would come in within a week. They're 10 times less expensive than the DNA test that they're using now. And they have a higher degree of accuracy as far as identifying the particular soldiers.",

But the fact is, that by endorsing the sexual revolution and agreeing that we should just drop all of the old standards about how men should behave, what it meant to be a gentleman, that we kind of open the door to this kind of loutish, gross behavior that we have seen in so many men. And if women are pushing back against it, great. But they should understand the feminism bears some part of the responsibility for how we got here. That when they said, of course we don't want any particular sensitivity by men. We don't want you to hold doors. We don't want you to be gentlemen. That's condescending. Well, the result was, men didn't know how to behave. And some of them just defaulted to being jerks.",

But the president picked a great jurist last time. Justice Gorsuch is a -- is a phenomenal jurist. He'll pick a phenomenal jurist this time. What I -- what I definitely think, people should just relax for a second and give him the opportunity to pick somebody before they start digging trenches again, you know. So, this sort of weird, you know. I was thinking about Justice Scalia, we're talking about him earlier today. He was 97-0, Justice Scalia was appointed to the Supreme Court. And so we're in a situation now where it goes right down the partisan lines, you had to go into the nuclear option for this situation. But in the meantime, if you think about the quality of the people that the president is going to pick from an interview, these are all exceptional Americans, exceptional people. And so, I just hope we can just dial it back a little on the -- on the polemics if you will."

We can say they're speculate about that. But I mean, you know, what I --"

He's had issues, obviously, with me but I think he's owed the respect frankly, of having that conversation with the president.

They just severely just like the president. Some of it's more related to his style, it's really not related to the policies because I challenged, and I'm sure I'll get lit up on Twitter after I say this, but I challenge you to come up with one policy over the last 17 or 18 month that the president has promulgated. That he's led to a disruption in your life or a lower living standard, or some kind of disavow of your quality of life. And the answer is there hasn't been any. So, obviously, the economy does fall that will be an issue for all politicians and will be issued for all companies in America. And that'll be a lot of pain. So, I really wish that Bill didn't say that. Having said that, the very good news is the policies have been fantastic. The stimulus has been fantastic as relates to the tax cuts that they were celebrating earlier today. And I think, you're going to see maybe even a four and a half five percent print on GDP for the second quarter.

He recognizes that he has to close the gap here in terms of income spread and helping middle-class families and lower-middle-class families on the campaign that was his pledge.

And they know that he's using that as a cudgel to those towers to bring it down. And I would call on all corporations large and small to give the president a little bit of time to watch him work this thing the way he worked the North Korean situation. And so, for me, not by the end of the year, my guess is he's very close on NAFTA, he's very close on negotiating something with the E.U. And I think, it's going to be for good news for everybody."

The President also saying today that he plans to name that nominee before he leaves for Europe on July the 10th so we do expect that we will hear something by July 9th. Here now Jonathan Turley, Constitutional Law Attorney, and Washington University -- George Washington University Law Professor. Good to see you tonight, sir. Big week."

First of all, he spoke with Maria Bartiromo, the President did, and she asked him you know, are you going to want to know from this potential justice where they stand on Roe v. Wade and whether or not they would overturn. And he said he didn't think that he would get specific about that in his discussions with the potential justices. What do you think about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's an element of circumspection and restraint which is reassuring in the President. He's often a guy who sort of plays poker with the cards faced outward and that can be a liability it has in the past. Here he's playing this very smart and not asking those type of litmus questions because if he does the witness will have to address that. The fact is there's lots of ways to figure out where someone is on an issue like Roe v. Wade. Many of the people on the list of 25 are very familiar to people in D.C. Many of them have come to conferences and their views are fairly well known so you don't have to ask the question. I think what the President also knows is that he promised to put two or more pro-life justices on the court. If this justice doesn't prove to be pro-life, it would -- it could come back to haunt him during the next presidential campaign and so I suspect -- I suspect this will be on his mind."

      "speaker": "TURLEY",

I think they should be selected entirely on the basis of their intellectual contribution to the court. I testified at Neil Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing in the Senate and I testified in his favor because I believe that he's an intellectual the first order even if you disagree with his conclusions. That is, in fact, the model we should choose. It doesn't matter what sex or race or religion that person is. This is a court of nine. It is an honor to hold one of those seats and it shouldn't be given to you on optics."

July 9th, I mean, that that's a quick turnaround. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of political pressure here to get moving on this."

It worked very well for them. They're not going to hand it over to the Democrats. They're going to push a nominee through before the midterm elections. Now that means that there have to be careful because if you make a vetting mistake and you have to change horses, it doesn't give you a lot of time so that's why they're cutting this short."

It's like I honestly think that on election night we saw those people at the Javits Center waiting for Hillary Clinton and they were crying. And the next day you had the people in the Obama administration in the Rose Garden waiting for President Obama to comment on election and they had these long faces and they were all -- they've spent a lot of Democrats a year and a half emoting about things and kicking Sarah Sanders out of a restaurant and doing kind of these ridiculous things. And I think this week it's funny that this interview with Michael Moore on Thursday, it's like things finally got real. Democrats just spent a year and a half on Russia and everything else. And when you had the Supreme Court decisions which showed actually a travel ban is going to stick, and oh by the way, Justice Kennedy is stepping down and President Trump is actually president. Even though you don't want to acknowledge it, it got real."

But at some point there has to be an accounting for real changes, actual things that are happening and I think the situation at the border is a real situation. You can talk about whether or not you know it existed that in a similar way in the last administration.

In the past has used the return of our soldier's remains as a bargaining chip with the United States. The other issue that I'm very worried about is the Department of Defense and their capabilities, their competent, and the overall direction that they're using as far as identifying the remains. And I say that, because some of the remains were returned over 20 years ago and still have not been identified. So the Department of Defense is not using updated DNA technology. They're using very expensive technology that takes four to five months for a test result to come in. Where, if they were using nuclear DNA technology the test results would come in within a week. They're 10 times less expensive than the DNA test that they're using now. And they have a higher degree of accuracy as far as identifying the particular soldiers."

And just now, four years later, are identifying with the micro -- the mitochondrial DNA that Joan is referring to, which is really antiquated."

And when she moved, she sent letters to the Department of Defense indicating her new address and was there any updates or anything like that. And so I think we take it personally, this is something that since that generation has gone, we're the ones that hopefully will be able to bring our Uncle Bobby home and have a proper burial."

She believes the movement has lost its way. Earlier this week, I sat down with Mona Charen, the author of \"Sex Matters: How Modern Feminism Lost Touch With Science, Love, and Common Sense.\""

      "speaker": "CHAREN",
      "utterance": "It's supposed to be pro-woman. And in some ways it was. But the point of my book, feminism took a couple of really devastating wrong turns. One was in embracing the sexual revolution. And the other was in rejecting family life as a trap for women. And instead what we found, we've had 50 years now of experience with modern feminism. And what we've seen is families are disintegrating, women are struggling, single women are struggling to do everything themselves. Men are disconnected from their families and sometimes even from the workforce. It's time to rethink some of the assumptions that got us here."

    {
      "speaker": "CHAREN",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's really interesting. If you look at the general social survey, which they started asking questions in 1972, how happy are you, and what they noticed is that every year since, women have been less happy and men have gotten more happy. So if the feminist movement with all of its achievements were supposed to be the answer for women's happiness you wouldn't expect to see that men are now happier than women and women's happiness has steady declined. I think a lot of it is about how insecure modern women are. They don't have the structure of marriage, family, that security that women need because we are the ones who have babies and we do need to be taken care of when we're in those vulnerable stages of our lives."

It may mean having a fulfilled and happy and balanced life. And if that's your goal, then you definitely want to place family security right at the center of your life plan. Instead of something that you just hope will come along later. And that applies to men as well as women."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Very important to get to get to this question about the Me Too movement and how we got here. How did during the empowerment phase of women in this country, did we find ourselves falling prey to these awful situations with men?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAREN",
      "utterance": "Right. So in some ways I actually think the Me Too movement is good, because I think it's women saying I have had enough, it's almost you could interpret it as a rejection of the sexual revolution that the feminist unwisely endorsed in the 1970s and since then. But the fact is, that by endorsing the sexual revolution and agreeing that we should just drop all of the old standards about how men should behave, what it meant to be a gentleman, that we kind of open the door to this kind of loutish, gross behavior that we have seen in so many men. And if women are pushing back against it, great. But they should understand the feminism bears some part of the responsibility for how we got here. That when they said, of course we don't want any particular sensitivity by men. We don't want you to hold doors. We don't want you to be gentlemen. That's condescending. Well, the result was, men didn't know how to behave. And some of them just defaulted to being jerks."

    {
      "speaker": "CHAREN",
      "utterance": "Right. I think we actually need to return to some basic rules about behavior. One of them is, if you're married you absolutely shouldn't be looking or touching anybody who isn't your spouse. But also, you know, just basic things like so many of these women who came forward with the Me Too movement, were saying well, they went to Harvey Weinstein's hotel room for a business meeting. They didn't know that that's something you shouldn't do. Well, that should be just part of the rules. That there's never a reason for a male boss to ask a woman to come to his hotel room for a business meeting. And women should be empowered, really empowered, right, to say not happening. Not appropriate."

Wendi Winters, the special publications editor. Gerald Fischman, editorial page editor. Rebecca Smith, a sales assistant, and writer John McNamara. Inside the paper they left the opinion page blank. The editor writing only this, \"Today we are speechless. This page is intentionally left blank to commemorate the victims of yesterday's shooting at our office. Tomorrow this Capital page will return to its steady purpose of offering readers informed opinions about the world around them that they might be better citizens.\" Our thoughts and prayers are with the Capital Gazette staff and their families tonight.
