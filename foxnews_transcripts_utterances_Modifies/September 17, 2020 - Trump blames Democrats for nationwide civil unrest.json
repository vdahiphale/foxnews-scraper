The president said during a history event this afternoon at the National Archives here in Washington, American school children are being indoctrinated in propaganda aimed at making them ashamed of their country. The president will leave the White House shortly for a campaign stop in Wisconsin. If he speaks to reporters along the way, we'll bring it to you here.

Fox 29 in Philadelphia, as police hunts for suspects after a hail of gunfire, left to men dead and two wounded on a city basketball court. Officers found the four victims in a park in the city Spring Garden neighborhood last night. Fox 11 in Los Angeles as crew members on a dive boat that caught fire killing 34 people say they were never instructed on emergency procedures. National Transportation Safety Board investigators say the cause of that blaze aboard the conception remains undetermined. And this is a live look at Miami from our affiliate Fox 7. One of big stories there tonight, police officers respond to a report of a monkey on the run near Tampa. Police ended up in a foot pursuit with a monkey named Abu.

It's not decided until Election Day or the days after. But let's look at the other battleground states in white. If they go to form like traditionally, they do, some place like Texas would go Republican. Let's say Georgia goes Republican as well. Ohio, where it's very close but it goes to Donald Trump. Iowa Trump is up; we'll give him that as well. North Carolina, 15 electoral votes. A lot of focus on the state of Pennsylvania. Let's give it to Donald Trump pulling out Pennsylvania. Take a look at Florida. The Real Clear Politics Average of polls, it's about one point. But let's say Donald Trump wins his home state of Florida, 268 electoral votes at that point. All right, now, let's look out west. Arizona, 11 electoral votes. This is a very close race. The Senate race there seems like it's leaning towards the Democrat at this point. Let's say Arizona which has been purple goes to Joe Biden. He also picks up Nevada and New Hampshire. Then, let's go to the Midwest, he wins in Michigan and in Wisconsin. There you have a race, 260 to 260 with Minnesota's 10 electoral votes remaining. Now, currently, Joe Biden is ahead depending on the poll ahead fairly substantially, but there are some polls that is very tight. The Trump campaign is focusing on Minnesota. Obviously, if it goes to Joe Biden, he wins. But the political and economic price tag of the violence, the summer racial unrest, and violence.

Bill said it's a wealthy country. It's about to be the number one economy in the world. So this isn't like the cold war where you can force Russia to spend itself into bankruptcy. That isn't going to be possible with China. I think that generally right now voters are not focused on foreign policy, but China is the number one threat. The Trump administration has been trying at least earlier in the campaign to say that Biden was soft on China, but I think there's a surprising amount of agreement between the two parties on how serious this threat is.",

But indeed, one of the reasons the Chinese economy is so intertwined with the U.S. economy is because for decades now, politicians in America have entwined the two economies willingly, even as China was eating our lunch. And it was President Trump as the first politician to come along to sound the alarm of the dangers of that. But I would also say that I do think that voters, probably a surprising number of voters have been for a long time very cognizant of the dangers that are posed by China. They have watched their own factories and their own neighborhoods get unbolted and sent that China. They've seen their jobs disappear to China. And then you have something like this virus that has come from China. All of those things come together in a way that makes people very, very suspicious of China and very wary of all of the deals that our American politicians have gotten us involved in with China.

It's not decided until Election Day or the days after. But let's look at the other battleground states in white. If they go to form like traditionally, they do, some place like Texas would go Republican. Let's say Georgia goes Republican as well. Ohio, where it's very close but it goes to Donald Trump. Iowa Trump is up; we'll give him that as well. North Carolina, 15 electoral votes. A lot of focus on the state of Pennsylvania. Let's give it to Donald Trump pulling out Pennsylvania. Take a look at Florida. The Real Clear Politics Average of polls, it's about one point. But let's say Donald Trump wins his home state of Florida, 268 electoral votes at that point. All right, now, let's look out west. Arizona, 11 electoral votes. This is a very close race. The Senate race there seems like it's leaning towards the Democrat at this point. Let's say Arizona which has been purple goes to Joe Biden. He also picks up Nevada and New Hampshire. Then, let's go to the Midwest, he wins in Michigan and in Wisconsin. There you have a race, 260 to 260 with Minnesota's 10 electoral votes remaining. Now, currently, Joe Biden is ahead depending on the poll ahead fairly substantially, but there are some polls that is very tight. The Trump campaign is focusing on Minnesota. Obviously, if it goes to Joe Biden, he wins. But the political and economic price tag of the violence, the summer racial unrest, and violence.

Pennsylvania's highest court has given the Democratic Party a series of victories related to November's presidential election. One of today's decisions was in a lawsuit that sought favorable fixes to glitches and gray areas in the mail-in voting law. The Court granted Democrats request to order a three-day extension of Pennsylvania's Election Day deadline to count mail-in ballots. That's three days after Election Day. It also authorized satellite election offices and drop boxes to head off an avalanche of mail ballots in Philadelphia and its populist suburbs.

The Declaration was aspirational, but the Constitution gave us a system to preserve it and has done very well. And I think what the president was talking about is there is a philosophical assumption now that the United States was born in corruption because of slavery and is forever stained by it. And the danger with that is, one, we have our flaws, but in terms of advancing freedom, there's few parallels. And also, these kinds of things are designed not to encourage a debate over history but to forestall it, because if you question if, then you're considered a racist too."

If you're talking about reviving civics education or really learning about the Constitution, people should be taught that. But I would like to know how many schools in America have adopted \"The 1619 Project,\" which is controversial and debated among American historians, as their curriculum. So I think that for an election that is focusing on the pandemic and the recession, this seems to be a little off message.

CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\":  Absolutely, Bret. I don't think that this is a niche issue. It may have been at one point, and certainly this is the sort of thing that President Trump's base, this is what got him elected, these are the people that got him elected, the people that most revere the founding documents and things that Bill McGurn just mentioned. But I think that at this point in our history, I think that this reaches far beyond that niche. I think that it reaches into a lot of suburban folks and a lot of people who are more politically moderate who maybe didn't vote for Trump the first time, and they are looking around and they're seeing cities on fire. They are seeing this culture of hatred towards police. They are seeing all of these things that have made America the unique place, the extraordinary place that it is, being torn down. And this is kind of sweet honey for them, the idea that there's somebody who doesn't care what anybody thinks and is walking out of there and absolutely weathering the accusations that maybe he's racist or something like that because he is celebrating these things that not only make America great, but offer an opportunity for all those people that the rioters claim to care the most about.

He encouraged the prosecutors to seek a number of federal charges, including under a rarely used sedition law.\" The Justice Department just put out a clarification in which they say it's not rarely used, including Section 2384, which is what they are talking about under a statute. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade brought charges under this section against nine defendants in 2010.

He's the top law-enforcement official in the country. But it's interesting, you've got Barr warring with his own department. You've got the president yesterday warring with the CDC director and saying he is confused, throwing him under the bus. There's a lot of turmoil inside this administration. Now, in terms of the Trump administration's push on law and order, wanting to crackdown on demonstrators, that is something they clearly think is going to help them in the suburbs. There's polling that shows that suburban voters who feel unsafe tend to gravitate towards Trump. Suburban voters that feel more safe, they're not really worried about rioters coming to their neighborhood or cul-de-sac, they are more inclined to vote for Biden. So it's possible that the Trump administration, Bill Barr is pushing this, is on to something that is going to help them in the election."

Another person who leaves. We have a letter from her, the beautiful going away letter ever.

He is allowed to make policy whether he's dealing with the CDC director or his attorney general. The president is the one that got elected. Nobody else got elected. The more alarming thing, though, is about that phone call between A.G. Barr and his attorneys, and the idea that the attorney general of the United States cannot have a phone call with underlings who are lawyers, who have certain rules that they are supposed to abide by, have a conversation about legal strategies without it leaking, I don't think that that says something so much about the administration as it says about the bureaucracy that is in place that is standing and doing everything it can to prevent President Trump from focusing on the priorities that got him elected president of the United States."

And what's different with the old cold war is that China may be a communist nation officially, but it's also a very wealthy nation with a very dynamic economy, and we haven't faced that problem before. And that economy is entwined with ours. So it's very hard to figure out ways to punish China that don't hurt some of our own people. But, as I think they're saying, the threat is very real. I think China and Russia are both threats, and we have to deal with both of them. You think of World War II, the devastation, and it was two countries, Germany and Japan, and much smaller. And now we have on the European side, Russia, much larger, more powerful than Germany, and you've got China, much larger than Japan. So this is the big challenge of the 21st century."

Bill said it's a wealthy country. It's about to be the number one economy in the world. So this isn't like the cold war where you can force Russia to spend itself into bankruptcy. That isn't going to be possible with China. I think that generally right now voters are not focused on foreign policy, but China is the number one threat. The Trump administration has been trying at least earlier in the campaign to say that Biden was soft on China, but I think there's a surprising amount of agreement between the two parties on how serious this threat is."

      "utterance": "Thank goodness the current administration is taking that threat seriously and trying to do something about it, and doing something about it, I don't know, before the election, which is an improvement over the last time. But indeed, one of the reasons the Chinese economy is so intertwined with the U.S. economy is because for decades now, politicians in America have entwined the two economies willingly, even as China was eating our lunch. And it was President Trump as the first politician to come along to sound the alarm of the dangers of that. But I would also say that I do think that voters, probably a surprising number of voters have been for a long time very cognizant of the dangers that are posed by China. They have watched their own factories and their own neighborhoods get unbolted and sent that China. They've seen their jobs disappear to China. And then you have something like this virus that has come from China. All of those things come together in a way that makes people very, very suspicious of China and very wary of all of the deals that our American politicians have gotten us involved in with China. And so in that regard it can be helpful to President Trump in the election."

How much do you think foreign policy will factor in?"

As Mara mentioned, Joe Biden is echoing a lot of things on China that the president is saying, that we need to get tough on them. The real question is what you do, what are your levers. Obviously we can sanction them. We can't really stop them in a lot of things. So that is a dilemma. I think it's not just a matter of just the economy. A lot of people don't like China. They feel they have stolen our jobs, they're stealing our intellectual property, they're cheating in every organization that they belong to. But I think we're going to have to meet them on many, many different levels. You look at the people at our universities that are spying for China now.
