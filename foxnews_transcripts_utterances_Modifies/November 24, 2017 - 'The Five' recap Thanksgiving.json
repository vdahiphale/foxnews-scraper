You know, this comparison reflects the prison of two ideas. You know, in the media we're expected to be one way or the other. You're either on the Trump train or you think he's evil. And it creates this delusion that Scott Adams talks about, the two movie phenomenon where America is experiencing the same material, but they're seeing two entirely different movies. They see Trump as evil. Everybody else says things are pretty good. The fact is, the thing that makes me laugh, especially living in New York, an educated person on the coast who can constantly go about predicting a Trump apocalypse, a Trump caused apocalypse, will still go home back to a hip wine bar, peck at his iPhone, check his 401(k), and watch prices fall on technology that 15 years ago a king wouldn't be able to get. The things are pretty good and it's reality, as you were saying, in their face. There is no apocalypse. Things are pretty good.

But, I can't say that because that apology isn't for me and it isn't for you. It's for people like Kathie Lee Gifford. His apology should be incredibly direct, very specific. It's not about greeting and shaking hands. It's about shoving your tongue down the throat of an unwilling participant. That's what this is about. So, as a start for him this weekend, he should direct his apologies in a highly specific manner. And, there might be people inclined to forgive him. I know Leann Tweeden, she forgave him when he apologized to her. And that's a start. You can't do these meandering apologies where did you go, you know, I hope that, you know, I'm sorry for the people who might have felt bad about what I did. You know, he said, \"I really screwed up.

Charlie Rose, for example, Exhibit A, said he was, quote, \"embarrassed\" in his official statement by the claims brought against him. Well, guess what, Charlie Rose?

There's love in the air, because it might be actually time for another royal wedding on the horizon here. A lot of speculation about Prince Harry and Megan Markel. The announcement should be pretty soon, I'm hoping. Bookmakers in Britain recently suspended betting on whether another royal engagement will take place, which could be an indication that the news is coming soon. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace Friday refused to comment even to us, stating that they would not give a running commentary on Harry's love life."

A young woman, Kate McClure (ph), who lives in New Jersey, ran out of gas driving on the interstate from New Jersey. She was going down to Philadelphia in October. She panicked, understandably. A man approached her car, introduced himself. Said, \"I'm Johnny. Please stay here. Lock your doors. I'll go get you some gas. He went to the gas station and used his last $20 -- it turns out he was homeless -- to buy her gas so she could get on her way. She then drove away, very thankful, came back to visit the spot a number of times, dropped off warm clothes and food, and water, and started a GoFundMe page to help him get back on his feet. And it's raised over $300,000 now."
