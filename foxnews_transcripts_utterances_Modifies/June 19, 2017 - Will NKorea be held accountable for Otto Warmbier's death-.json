Otto Warmbier, the American who was just released by North Korea after nearly a year and a half in captivity, has died. He passed away earlier after being sent home in a vegetative state by the ruthless regime last week. Otto was only 22- years-old. Our prayers go out to his family and to all who loved him and prayed for his safe return.  His father Fred fought back tears Thursday while holding a news conference on his son's release. He didn't hold back his anger at North Korea, however, for terrorizing his son.",

Now Marco Rubio who was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said make no mistake, Warmbier was murdered by the North Korean regime.  So that clock on our end, there will be pressure to try to speed it up, I think that President Trump is well guided by Mattis, Tillerson, McMaster and lots of other people. But also that we get to the question about, what do we do with China, and the question of how long are we willing to be patient with China before they start doing something? There was an article in \"The New York Times\" over the weekend that said that basically they are just slow walking the pressure that President Trump asked them to put on North Korea, that they are just sort of like waiting, and so I think that is where you will see the next step is where Tillerson is probably pressing through China.",

When you hear the legal scholars talking about it reviewing, thus far, no evidence of collusion, no evidence of obstruction of justice, they are desperate to try to find something to pin him within his administration. And that is what you see. But the problem is, the people that are suffering and losing the most with this, the American taxpayers because on and on, you have these investigations, you have this money spent, and then like, Newt just said, what are we going to have -- a special counsel to investigate the special counsel, it just seems like it is never-ending. Now, one of the optimistics like Dana said, potentially three months from now, we are going to put a rest to this.

Five anonymous sources, and then they'll have to, oh, we'll wait, that isn't actually true, and then they come forward with another story and they couldn't get the collusion.

Otto Warmbier, the American who was just released by North Korea after nearly a year and a half in captivity, has died. He passed away earlier after being sent home in a vegetative state by the ruthless regime last week. Otto was only 22- years-old. Our prayers go out to his family and to all who loved him and prayed for his safe return. His father Fred fought back tears Thursday while holding a news conference on his son's release. He didn't hold back his anger at North Korea, however, for terrorizing his son."

It is a brutal regime, and we will be able to handle it."

Kill him so it makes him look like natural causes, so you know, it removes confrontation, and perhaps open talks, or you do the other thing, which is what we happen to be doing, which may be the only solution, which is you just kind of like, let it go, and you treat North Korea like that weird house in your neighborhood, that your parents say, don't go by that house, whatever you do, don't go in that house. It's a strange family, they do weird things, steer clear across the street, don't go near it, it is the weird haunted house on planet earth, and you don't go near it, you just wait and wait and wait until time -- may be the guy's heart gives out, natural causes, who knows?

      "utterance": "And President Obama tried his way, I don't think that was working, and now we have a situation that probably even more dire and more sinister based in the near term. One of the things that Secretary Tillerson said is that it was unjust imprisonment but he did go as far as to say that the North Koreans are responsible for the murder of Mr. Warmbier. Now Marco Rubio who was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said make no mistake, Warmbier was murdered by the North Korean regime. So that clock on our end, there will be pressure to try to speed it up, I think that President Trump is well guided by Mattis, Tillerson, McMaster and lots of other people. But also that we get to the question about, what do we do with China, and the question of how long are we willing to be patient with China before they start doing something? There was an article in \"The New York Times\" over the weekend that said that basically they are just slow walking the pressure that President Trump asked them to put on North Korea, that they are just sort of like waiting, and so I think that is where you will see the next step is where Tillerson is probably pressing through China."

      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "We need to accelerate all pressure on China in order to solve this problem. Make no mistake, this was an act of war, and I think President Trump needs to respond accordingly. It was premeditated, it was savage, it was humiliating, and it was depraved, it was disgusting. And what happens in a hostage situation? You know, when the guys start killing the hostages, that's when the team go in and takes action. I don't know if you have to do it overtly or covertly or what, but it's not just this, when they are test firing missiles, when they are trading in elicit arms and drugs. And you know, causing chaos with their neighbors, something has to be done here because right now, I guess a coup is potentially on the table, they have these war games in South Korea, decapitation squad or something like that where if anything does does stop on the DMC, what they'll do is, you know, they'll take out some military installations but they will also go after the leadership in a very targeted and effective way, there was reports that some special operators were doing the war games with the South Koreans. There is the, I think with the USS Michigan, one of our tax subs, it's off the coast there that often helps transport the Seal Team Six guys. So, you know, that is on the table, and I think he needs to understand it is on the table because I think President Trump, and I haven't ever seen him that disturbed or emotional in a very long time during those remarks right there. I am sure he takes this personally."

So you know, Greg said it and kind of an explicit way that, you know, they dumped him. I mean, they were getting rid of him. It's not that this was a result of anything that wasn't being done previously. The pressure has been put there and I think President Trump has put more pressure. He tried to get presidency of China to agree to something. He thought that meeting in April that Xi had bought into the idea that you know what, this is a dangerous situation for the globe, for the world."

There was no responsiveness to the treaties that are signed in terms of how do you deal with people around the world.

It was a pretty decisive thing to do. I don't know what the equivalent is there, I do know that when growing up with the cold war, that was mutually assure distraction, Russia knew that we could kill them, and we knew that they could kill us. The difference is that with North Korea is that, we can kill them, but there is a 50/50 shot with them, and generally, it's more about the people around North Korea that you worry about, so we are hamstrung in the sense of what do you do in a retaliation with brute force? So what is left, and that is covert or strategic maneuvers -- seems like the only way to go."

Talk about racism, why would she do that? To avoid the shooter's beliefs? He was her network's biggest fan.

Washed-up \"Star Trek\" troll George Takei copied Joy: \"The officer who saved bigoted, homophobic Rep. Steve Scalise during baseball practice was a black lesbian.\" So who was he insulting? Scalise who trusted this woman with his life or the woman herself? George seemed surprised that the officer did her job. It is creepy. Now maybe it is rude to point out how repugnant this is, but at least I am not doing it while Joy or George are in medical crisis. Scalise may have been in a medically induced coma, but these people are in moral ones.

And that is what you see. But the problem is, the people that are suffering and losing the most with this, the American taxpayers because on and on, you have these investigations, you have this money spent, and then like, Newt just said, what are we going to have -- a special counsel to investigate the special counsel, it just seems like it is never-ending. Now, one of the optimistics like Dana said, potentially three months from now, we are going to put a rest to this. But I am not confident at all that that is going to satiate their appetite for trying to destroy the 45th president of the United States. I mean, it is quite apparent to me. And they will say anything or do anything, when you see the papers, being very loose with their standards. Five anonymous sources, and then they'll have to, oh, we'll wait, that isn't actually true, and then they come forward with another story and they couldn't get the collusion. And now, they are going for the obstruction of justice, even though the head of the FBI said that he didn't think feel that the president was trying to do this or throw them off course or obstruct justice.

What we know is that, as we point on the show, I think Dana did last week, that now, people who are involved are being asked to testify, and their lawyers and everybody else in the spotlight is talking, so that's what's going on. The reality is, though, I mean, it's very difficult reality that Angus King, the senator from Maine said this investigation is just getting started. It's closer to the start than to the end. He said about 20 percent. And Adam Schiff, the congressman from California, on the house intel committee said basically there is evidence, but not sufficient to present to anybody.

I don't know who said that, maybe it's the new new. It wasn't my idea.

After today in Paris, a man rammed his car, carrying explosives, into a police vehicle, only the attacker died, thankfully. Greg, in London, this is kind of an interesting thing, so remember the terrorist -- so he is to worship at this mosque, the government in Britain actually shut down this mosque, and after a period of time, the community came together, they reopen it, it was really considered a model of assimilation.

It's an incredibly difficult problem to deal with, because as we've seen over and over again in some instances there were hints, they were leaks, they were suggestions that certain people should have been more closely monitored, that they presented as those that might commit acts of jihad, but then we have an issue of resources. And then you have the issue of balancing people's privacy interest. And you have an interest of, OK, as a society we want to maintain liberty and freedom, you know, but at what cost are we willing to allow this and to be loose at the expense of public safety and the loss of human life. And this is not a problem that's unique to the United States, it's all across Europe. We see it in the Middle East. And it doesn't, in my opinion, seem to be getting better, you know, in terms of what they're doing. When you see some of the countries in Europe that have been quite permissive in terms of multi-culturalism, and wanting not to offend -- OK. Assimilation, you bring up a great point. This was one of the places -- it's a mosque that was really trying to assimilate and be integrative into the community, it's like awful that this happened, someone in the -- trying to prevent them from harming the man who was committing this act of terror against them. But I'm telling you, people in Europe should be really frustrated with this.

But you know what, obviously, he's got a lot on his plate. And it would be wise for him to tweet something about that, maybe he's watching this show tonight. He'll tweet something. How are you doing, Mr. President? I want to say something that Greg talk about and it's about motivation. I want to say first, obviously, the guy who perpetrated this attack is a sicko, and he deserves to rot in hell. But let's talk about motivation for a second. When a Muslim terrorist commits a heinous act like this, and everyone says he was motivated by radical Islam, the left never wants to say that. Oh, no, we don't know what his motivation is. Religion has nothing to do with it. But then when some Christian guy from England perpetrates an act of terror against Muslims, immediately, the left says it's Islamophobia. They know is Islamophobia, they're so quick to know. I mean, I wish they'd use that as their standard. And think about it, this is actual Islamophobia. We actually found a concrete example of Islamophobia for the first time."

And it's suggested itself is that he's interested in one type of terror, and that's where we get into the back and forth. And the back and forth has been pointed out in this discussion takes us nowhere. It's a loser. I mean, the idea that innocent people worshiping should be attached, and if the guy is not only saved by a Muslim, but then as he's leaving is screaming I wished I'd killed more Muslims."

I can't stand petition gatherers, people that are upset by speech, or somebody coming to make a speech -- any effort to stop something, I find kind of pathetic. But the left has been doing this for decades, let them only look. But in this case, it's a win-win because the play is designed to create this kind of disruption, and it's fulfilled so that the person gets to be on a TV show, and the play gets more notoriety, so it's a win- win. Everybody wins."

But I mean at the same time, maybe conservatives do need to start protesting like this because the left has been firebombing things, damaging property, holding up streets and everything for the last decade, and the media never covers it. A conservative yells at someone during a play, and it's like international news."

Let them go and do this. If people want to go watch it and see, a lot of people felt that it's portrayed the character Julius Caesar ad President Trump in a sympathetic way, almost, in the end. So I guess its arts. So it's open to interpretation. I understand -- my objection to the play was just when the assassination attempt on -- it's just such awful timing, and so that bothers me personally, so that I didn't like."

Fitted sheets, it took me a half-hour because my wife is away to put on one sheet, half-an-hour. They need to put an L for length and a W for width on the fitted sheets because I keep going around, and when I put the one thing down the other one pops up, the other one gets loose on the other corner of the bed. And so I run over, I try to put that one on that one, and I'm putting it down, and then the other one."

The city of Seattle finally opens its new Jimi Hendrix Park, the city honoring its native son who died in 1970, still revered as one of the greatest guitarist and rock performer ever. The park features a purple walkway embedded with Hendrix lyrics. Meanwhile, in Minneapolis, the Minnesota Twins celebrated their own rock legend, Prince. What they did was terrific, they handed out beautiful purple rain umbrellas, purple rain cover art under the umbrella, during the seven inning stretch the stance became a sea of purple rain."

The fed arrest is close to 40 accused MS-13 gangbangers in the city of Long Island last week. So since January of 2016, alarming 38 percent of all homicides in Nassau County, Long Island, have been linked to MS-13. So this is a great progress for the notorious criminal enterprise.
