We're currently seeing the Middle East unravel faster than Ilhan Omar's marriage to her brother. We're seeing inflation roaring back like that wrasse Kat got at Coachella. We're seeing absurd gas prices and a gas shortage. We're at the mercy of criminals trying to shut down a pipeline and a president who actually did shut one down. And speaking of, we have a bumbling leader who scares no one except young women who use Herbal Essence shampoo. Oh, he'll send a stern letter to our adversaries as long as it's before his 4:00 p.m. bedtime. Unemployment rising as benefits keep flowing. Crime is back and bloodier than ever we're witnessing shootings and murders like never before. Well, not exactly never before. We have seen it before. In fact, we've seen it all before. It's called",

On the plus side if this continues, we might get another one of these. Yeah, remember that? That was the 70s. But maybe we have. Yes. Seriously she is this generation Farrah Fawcett. Or maybe Jacqueline Smith. I can't make up my mind. But why should I? She didn't until a few years ago. And by the way, it's not like I'm stalking you, Caitlin. OK? You D.M.'d me first. And then I figured I should start working my magic on you. And then she ghosts me, speed goes on Hannity. I get it. You're trans and you still date women, whatever. But I feel like I was led on and it kind of hurts. Just like the 70s. And just like today, the crime, the joblessness, the turmoil of it, unstable world questioning America's resilience. And also, no coincidence Joe Biden's in D.C. The fact is we're learning a harsh lesson here. That progress and stability and success is just one liberal away from disaster. Just one liberal away. Think about that. Everything great about America can be unraveled by one leftist with some power and a vendetta gets America. And we have an administration crawling with them. Now take New York, Rudy Giuliani took a city rife with rampant crime and hopelessness and turn it into the number one global tourist attraction. And then Bloomberg inherited it and didn't screw it up totally. But then this ghoul came along. A vile groundhog murdering idiot so clueless to human motivation that he might actually be from another planet. I think they call it Shatturn. It's like a giant lumbering Frankenstein made up of parts from lesser idiots. And it took only one card carrying anti-American commie to drag the city back down to its worst and two if you count his wife. So now we have Gotham City but minus the Batman. But it's not just NYC, it's every city run by Dems. And now it's America. Joe Biden was so nostalgic for those years when he had real hair that he took his back there in a matter of months. It's a pattern. Republicans create the bank account that the Democrats end up blowing like Hunter's backup eight ball. Saddled with the attention span and fruit flies high on crank with I.Q.s lower than CNN's ratings. Libs see the progress made by Republicans as wrong, and therefore an opportunity to experiment. And we are there guinea pigs. Our jobs, our healthcare education system. And it's those experiments that lead to the devastation. It's a cycle. Liberals like spoiled children ruin things which Republicans like patient parents fix. And that creates a false sense of security that allows liberals to return and ruin them again. I say we put them up for adoption so we could have nice things in the House again. I wonder what the angry white male thinks.",

One was Chinese and the other one was Chinese. We had almost no options for pornography, unless you count the sexy Indian girl on the lender lakes box. Sometimes we got creative and we went to work on the Sears catalog with an eraser. Nobody understands that. We had no choice but to save ourselves. But now it's different. We have Netflix and Hulu. There are 407 ESPN channels. delivers. And so does your dealer Kat. Decriminalized pot keeps us ambivalent in China and Disney keeps us distracted.

And speaking of, we have a bumbling leader who scares no one except young women who use Herbal Essence shampoo. Oh, he'll send a stern letter to our adversaries as long as it's before his 4:00 p.m. bedtime. Unemployment rising as benefits keep flowing.

On the plus side if this continues, we might get another one of these. Yeah, remember that? That was the 70s. But maybe we have. Yes. Seriously she is this generation Farrah Fawcett. Or maybe Jacqueline Smith. I can't make up my mind. But why should I? She didn't until a few years ago. And by the way, it's not like I'm stalking you, Caitlin. OK? You D.M.'d me first. And then I figured I should start working my magic on you. And then she ghosts me, speed goes on Hannity. I get it. You're trans and you still date women, whatever. But I feel like I was led on and it kind of hurts. Just like the 70s. And just like today, the crime, the joblessness, the turmoil of it, unstable world questioning America's resilience. And also, no coincidence Joe Biden's in D.C. The fact is we're learning a harsh lesson here. That progress and stability and success is just one liberal away from disaster. Just one liberal away. Think about that. Everything great about America can be unraveled by one leftist with some power and a vendetta gets America. And we have an administration crawling with them. Now take New York, Rudy Giuliani took a city rife with rampant crime and hopelessness and turn it into the number one global tourist attraction. And then Bloomberg inherited it and didn't screw it up totally. But then this ghoul came along. A vile groundhog murdering idiot so clueless to human motivation that he might actually be from another planet. I think they call it Shatturn. It's like a giant lumbering Frankenstein made up of parts from lesser idiots. And it took only one card carrying anti-American commie to drag the city back down to its worst and two if you count his wife. So now we have Gotham City but minus the Batman. But it's not just NYC, it's every city run by Dems. And now it's America. Joe Biden was so nostalgic for those years when he had real hair that he took his back there in a matter of months. It's a pattern. Republicans create the bank account that the Democrats end up blowing like Hunter's backup eight ball. Saddled with the attention span and fruit flies high on crank with I.Q.s lower than CNN's ratings. Libs see the progress made by Republicans as wrong, and therefore an opportunity to experiment. And we are there guinea pigs. Our jobs, our healthcare education system. And it's those experiments that lead to the devastation. It's a cycle. Liberals like spoiled children ruin things which Republicans like patient parents fix. And that creates a false sense of security that allows liberals to return and ruin them again. I say we put them up for adoption so we could have nice things in the House again. I wonder what the angry white male thinks."

Sometimes we got creative and we went to work on the Sears catalog with an eraser. Nobody understands that. We had no choice but to save ourselves. But now it's different. We have Netflix and Hulu.

Maybe we just let them chase the pronouns that these activists and leave us all alone. All right, my favorite block. Up next, who made the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? It's a story no other show is talking about, to my knowledge, anyway."

Crocus has been snubbed. That's got me screaming into the night, Crocus fans. Instead, here's who made the cut and what's been called the most diverse. Thank you. Finally, a diverse class in rock hall history. This is what we need. We got the Gogos, we got Todd Rundgren, who is this sis-normative male, we have Jay Z, we have Tina Turner and Carole King who are already in the hall, but as co-inductees with their respective husbands. Finally, the Foo Fighters. So, I got, I got to say, Foo Fighters, they've really been mailing it in recently. Take a look at their last concert."

They were a very innovative band. Plus, Charlotte Caffey, they said that she couldn't tour because she had carpal tunnel syndrome, but she actually was addicted to heroin, but that that is not a Hall of Fame Rock and Roll move, I don't know what is.
