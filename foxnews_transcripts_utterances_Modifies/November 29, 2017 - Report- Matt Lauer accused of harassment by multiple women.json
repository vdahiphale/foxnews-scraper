Seems to be with Lauer, quite pervasive. But it's not just a pattern of abuse, it is a pattern of acquiescence. When you're at a company and you make a lot of money, the people around that person won't listen to you because he feels he can do what he wants. In a weird way, a lot of these people seem like children, like they have to be told how to act because they've been told yes so many times. Throughout their lives they've been told yes. The idea of somebody saying no makes no sense to them. So they just bring you into an office and then they press a button behind their desk so the door locks. I would like to see that conversation with office services. Like I can understand getting a clap-on light, clap-off, but saying I'd like a button behind my desk to lock the door when I need it so I can have sex with a stranger.

That's been about a year now -- within the last year. One thing that's different with NBC I thought from the others so far is that NBC got ahead of the news coverage. I wondered about that with CBS and others. You know that these reporters are working on stories. With CBS, for example, the Washington Post story ran, and then the news came out that they were going to suspend and fire Charlie Rose.  In this case, I suppose what happened was that -- because the young woman, I don't know young, the woman came forward to the NBC executive at the same time they knew that these stories were being worked on by various publications, the New York Times and others, that they went ahead into their own investigation and took very decisive action beforehand, so that they actually got to announce the news.

Whether they were really decisive, we don't really know that because they could have known about these things for a very long time and because of the avalanche of reporters about to break something that could have forced their hand also, this woman coming forward. But, you know, when Savannah Guthrie said what she said today, I think myself and many people here can understand what she's saying. On the one hand if you work with someone for many, many years and you admire that person and you know that person closely, you feel very sad for that person to crash and burn.  But, at the same time, you feel horribly saddened for the alleged victims of any sort of sexual harassment or impropriety. So it's a very complicated and complex situation for everybody when they're involved and they're working with people that deal like this. This guy made so much money for NBC News. It can't really be understated. This Today Show was the cornerstone of the network. And they made I think hundreds of millions of dollars each year in profit, profit for this network. And Matt Lauer was paid very handsomely. I think he just signed a $20 million a year contract. And it's like the New England Patriots losing Tom Brady. It's their franchise quarterback.

I mean, I was surprised in reading not only about the button behind the desk that Greg mentioned, but that they called Matt Lauer last night before he went to bed to let him know but they didn't tell anybody on the staff until this morning when the Today Show staff was coming in. So my take on this though, Kimberly, is that we're in a moment in American culture, I think no question, when you wake up, I mean, it was shocking to me. I thought, really? They fired Matt Lauer? As Jesse said, he was kind of the central pillar of NBC for a long time. And I agree with you, Jesse, I think a lot of companies have to have a different way of thinking that now you can't just say revenue and profit is the be-all and end-all. In fact, there's going to be social consequences and repercussions as a result of backing this. I think back to what happened with Anita Hill and the kind of outpouring. Now you have the hashtag #metoo movement. On the political front here, I'm so interested in the idea that President Trump continues to get involved. He was tweeting on this this morning and saying you know, that Andy Lack, the president, he said go look at Andy Lack's past. I don't even know what that referred to, but apparently something there. So to me what this boils down to then is you get a situation in our country at this moment where, you know, in the political support that's going on, you have Republican saying, oh, look, the liberals, the Democrats, they don't apply the same standard to their people that they impose on a President Trump or a Roy Moore down in Alabama, who, by the way, is now apparently back in the lead in the polls in his Alabama senate race. Then you see NBC, which is always positive as the left, takes such immediate action. There's more pressure now on Conyers to resign.",

According to The Washington Examiner, the writer of this piece, Martinez, was arrested in D.C. during Trump's inauguration and tried to crowdfund for legal fees. That's not surprising. That figures. What's surprising is that in an era of safe spaces, where students get out of classes or ban speeches because of diverse opinions in words, a college paper in Texas can run this savage call to violence. And as Hollywood creates movies and TV shows that push the myth that America is a sexist, racist tyranny, a college paper would happily run a piece that essentially calls for genocide.

Andy Lack, the news chairman at the Peacock Network released a statement this morning that says a complaint was filed last night by a colleague and there is reason to believe it wasn't an isolated incident, and now we know it may not have been. In a piece just published by Variety, it's reported that Lauer is accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. Co-host Savannah Guthrie found out Lauer was let go this morning and had the emotional and difficult task of breaking the news to the world."

And I'm heartbroken for the brave colleagues who came forward to tell her story and any other women who have their own stories to tell. And we are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks. How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly, and I don't know the answer to that. As painful as it is, this moment in our culture and this change had to happen."

FNC is like the first kid on the block who got chicken pox and all the other kids laughed. And then it spread and they're all going holy crap. Is this perfect-geddon ever going to end. Seems to be with Lauer, quite pervasive. But it's not just a pattern of abuse, it is a pattern of acquiescence. When you're at a company and you make a lot of money, the people around that person won't listen to you because he feels he can do what he wants. In a weird way, a lot of these people seem like children, like they have to be told how to act because they've been told yes so many times. Throughout their lives they've been told yes. The idea of somebody saying no makes no sense to them. So they just bring you into an office and then they press a button behind their desk so the door locks. I would like to see that conversation with office services. Like I can understand getting a clap-on light, clap-off, but saying I'd like a button behind my desk to lock the door when I need it so I can have sex with a stranger. It's kind of a hard conversation to have."

      "utterance": "As these revelations have come out, like the Harvey Weinstein one was kind of -- I think one of the biggest. And then, every day, though, you can have another story like this. Just last week, you had CBS's Charlie Rose. And I do think about how all of these other networks covered Fox News when we went through our own difficulties. That's been about a year now -- within the last year. One thing that's different with NBC I thought from the others so far is that NBC got ahead of the news coverage. I wondered about that with CBS and others. You know that these reporters are working on stories. With CBS, for example, the Washington Post story ran, and then the news came out that they were going to suspend and fire Charlie Rose. In this case, I suppose what happened was that -- because the young woman, I don't know young, the woman came forward to the NBC executive at the same time they knew that these stories were being worked on by various publications, the New York Times and others, that they went ahead into their own investigation and took very decisive action beforehand, so that they actually got to announce the news. NBC announced the news. It wasn't --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Only NBC News knows how far back the allegations go. Whether they were really decisive, we don't really know that because they could have known about these things for a very long time and because of the avalanche of reporters about to break something that could have forced their hand also, this woman coming forward. But, you know, when Savannah Guthrie said what she said today, I think myself and many people here can understand what she's saying. On the one hand if you work with someone for many, many years and you admire that person and you know that person closely, you feel very sad for that person to crash and burn. But, at the same time, you feel horribly saddened for the alleged victims of any sort of sexual harassment or impropriety. So it's a very complicated and complex situation for everybody when they're involved and they're working with people that deal like this. This guy made so much money for NBC News. It can't really be understated. This Today Show was the cornerstone of the network. And they made I think hundreds of millions of dollars each year in profit, profit for this network. And Matt Lauer was paid very handsomely. I think he just signed a $20 million a year contract. And it's like the New England Patriots losing Tom Brady. It's their franchise quarterback. The key to the offense, so to speak."

You remember in the financial crisis when, you know, these companies are doing a lot of bad things, but they're making a lot of money for shareholders, and then they crashed the system and then they get bailed out. So perpetuates bad behavior. Now people are saying, you know what, not too big to fail. They're allowed to let bad people go, or people that are accused of doing bad things go. And they're willing to take the hit and start fresh. And I think that's kind of going to be the new outlook when you handle these things. Start fresh."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "So Juan, to the allegations also that the New York Times was about to release the story that NBC knew that other stories were about to drop, like they've got ahead of this, what do you think about how this was handled, and in fact how they handled the communications with Savannah today letting the viewers know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "I really don't have much to say about it. I mean, I was surprised in reading not only about the button behind the desk that Greg mentioned, but that they called Matt Lauer last night before he went to bed to let him know but they didn't tell anybody on the staff until this morning when the Today Show staff was coming in. So my take on this though, Kimberly, is that we're in a moment in American culture, I think no question, when you wake up, I mean, it was shocking to me. I thought, really? They fired Matt Lauer? As Jesse said, he was kind of the central pillar of NBC for a long time. And I agree with you, Jesse, I think a lot of companies have to have a different way of thinking that now you can't just say revenue and profit is the be-all and end-all. In fact, there's going to be social consequences and repercussions as a result of backing this. I think back to what happened with Anita Hill and the kind of outpouring. Now you have the hashtag #metoo movement. On the political front here, I'm so interested in the idea that President Trump continues to get involved. He was tweeting on this this morning and saying you know, that Andy Lack, the president, he said go look at Andy Lack's past. I don't even know what that referred to, but apparently something there. So to me what this boils down to then is you get a situation in our country at this moment where, you know, in the political support that's going on, you have Republican saying, oh, look, the liberals, the Democrats, they don't apply the same standard to their people that they impose on a President Trump or a Roy Moore down in Alabama, who, by the way, is now apparently back in the lead in the polls in his Alabama senate race. Then you see NBC, which is always positive as the left, takes such immediate action. There's more pressure now on Conyers to resign."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I don't think this is a political story by any means. I think it's of cultural significance. There is no due process right now. And so, we're talking about a sea change. People keep talking about a sea change, but also it could be a panic. When the entry for allegations becomes lower and there is no investigation, there's no questioning by law enforcement, no time frame to allow an accused to try to defend themselves. So the workplace and the surrounding universe of public opinion is operating now like a college campus. On college campuses, administrators could adjudicate an assault case. That's what's happening now. We're adjudicating law enforcement. Now, if someone accuses you of assault, which is what we're hearing here with Matt Lauer, the law should be involved."

We have to worry not just about women but about men because these are your brothers and your sons, you know, they're your siblings, they're your fathers or grandfathers. You have to somehow create a process for these people to answer. I mean, the way Matt Lauer -- the way this reads, the man is a creep. But a lot of people might not be creeps."

Anything where you're alone with someone who you work with, there is now a climate of fear. And you don't want women unfairly punished and not included in meetings or in sessions where you're kicking around ideas because of the fear of some sort of unfair retaliation.

And you think about what happened last week when Al Franken gave his sound apology -- apology, and gets the question, what would you have thought two weeks ago? He said this never would have occurred to me. And I have to wonder, when they were actually doing the commentary or interviews about what was happening at Fox News, if internally that they had any idea that their behavior was going to come back to haunt them.

I think that Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the senate, has been riding a very close watch on those two because he worries that in fact a populist Trump movement, Trump won both states big, could lead them to lose their seats.

Some justices signal they want to impose limits on the government's ability to track the movement of Americans. A ruling is due by the end of June. So just to lay out for everybody the scenario, the case involves a man, Tim Carpenter, who was suspected of involvement in nine robberies of T-Mobile and RadioShack stores in Ohio and Michigan. And the government then looked at his data, you know, where he received and made phone calls, and based on the cell phone towers, which are able to give you the vicinity that the phone is in, said he was near each of these crimes.

So in that sense, I don't think you have a problem. I mean, you could go to a judge on it to be extra careful, because what you don't want to do is have a case then kicked back or reversed on appeal because you did one of these things, which was a warrantless, you know, seizure of information and violating the Fourth Amendment rights. So it gets a little bit tricky, and I'm curious to see how the court comes down on this, because it is -- people are going to complain about their privacy and say, well, you should take the time to go to the court. But the flip side of it, you lose that moment that's right then, contemporaneous with the crime that's going on if you do that. Versus going ahead and tracking and pinning.

If you think -- here's a great example that they -- a good example to use. Somalia has no security whatsoever. You'd assume they would be as free as ever. One of the least free countries in the world. Infrastructure that guarantee security also guarantees freedom. Poor people in Somalia would love to have the security we do. They would have the freedom that we do. I think we live in an era of luxury secluded from threats. Yet, we have no idea what's going on around us. Therefore when we see these stories, we go \"Oh, my God.

You are both the dominant apparatus on the planet and the void in which all other cultures upon meeting you die.\" I've got to say that is some amazing writing, as evil as it is. According to The Washington Examiner, the writer of this piece, Martinez, was arrested in D.C. during Trump's inauguration and tried to crowdfund for legal fees. That's not surprising. That figures. What's surprising is that in an era of safe spaces, where students get out of classes or ban speeches because of diverse opinions in words, a college paper in Texas can run this savage call to violence. And as Hollywood creates movies and TV shows that push the myth that America is a sexist, racist tyranny, a college paper would happily run a piece that essentially calls for genocide.
