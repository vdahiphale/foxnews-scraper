But first, tragedy at a synagogue just outside San Diego. A white 19-year-old gunman storming into a service on the final day of Passover in Poway, California, killing one woman and injuring three others including a little girl. The suspect taken into custody. President Trump addressing the shooting earlier today.",

Officials confirming for us a few -- just a while ago that one person has died -- a woman -- in that shooting at the Chabad of Poway Synagogue and the suspect is in custody. The Mayor calling the incident a hate crime saying the community will come through the tragedy though united. Four patients were transported to the Palomar Medical Center. Now we know one of them has passed away. There are still two adult males and a little girl currently in stable condition. So far it's unclear though how many were inside the synagogue at time of the shooting, but the San Diego Sheriff's Department says at least 100 witnesses are still waiting to be interviewed.  We're also starting to hear from some of those witnesses about what happened. Official say the 19-year-old white male suspect was engaged by an off duty Border Patrol agent who was inside the synagogue at the time the shooting unfolded. The suspect was able to get away though, then a short time later, authorities say he surrendered to a K9 officer without incident.   An AR-type rifle was spotted in in the suspect's vehicle. The shooting happened shortly before 11:30 this morning, just as worshippers were beginning and all-day Passover Service, which was scheduled to end tonight with the Passover meal -- Jesse.",

They say he has some sort of manifesto that he posted online last night.

One thing to point out, though, that I talked about earlier, there's the synagogue where the shooting happened, and then next door, there's also a Christian Church. And there are at least a couple of other houses of worship right in that area, as well as a Hebrew School attached to the synagogue. So it was an area with plenty of houses of worship, if someone was planning on carrying something like this out. We are hoping to hear more from authorities. You mentioned the social media aspect, like a possible manifesto. That's something that that we have not been able to confirm. But we're hoping that when they talk to us, sometime, anytime now that they might shed some light on that as well.",

As I said Fox News has not been able to independently confirm the identity of the shooter, although some local affiliates down in Southern California have confirmed to their estimation who this guy is and again, he was inspired allegedly by the mosque shooter in New Zealand and also the synagogue shooter in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Again, we have not been able to confirm this, but local reporting does suggest that he was a vicious anti-Semite who did not support Donald Trump because of Donald Trump's support of Israel. That is what the local affiliates have been reporting. Again, Fox has not been able to independently confirm, but we're going to stay with this story as it develops. Marianne, thank you very much.",

I mean, these threats, history has shown us we cannot look at these and take them with a grain of salt. We have to act on those quickly.

He came out with, we believe a bulletproof vest. Some of those reports have suggested and he was taken into custody. And now he's being, I'm sure, interrogated very aggressively. When you have a guy is in custody this soon after a shooting like this, what's going on inside that detention facility?",

How long has he been planning this? Were there red flags, other than this alleged manifesto that we've could have seen earlier? Of course, they want to search his house, they want to search his vehicle. They want to search social media, his computer, his electronics, maybe even phone records. Because, you know, keep in mind, Jesse, this investigation is still early on. We think we have the bullet points of it, that it was a hate crime. This guy is 19 years old.

The adult male -- one adult males is in stable condition at the hospital and the juvenile has been in stable condition. She has been transported to Rady Children's Hospital. We're currently working with the Escondido Police Department and the FBI to determine Ernest's possible involvement in the arson at the mosque in Escondido about a month ago, and the additional -- the San Diego Sheriff's Department and the San Diego Police Department are conducting additional patrols at houses of worship throughout the San Diego County.   As I stated before, the Anti-Defamation League is offering crisis trauma counseling at Poway High School. And there's also a county crisis line that is available to anybody that needs their services. That's 888-724- 7270. That's 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We urge everyone to stay vigilant and report any unusual circumstances to 911 and I guarantee you, they will be properly investigated and responded to. We're lucky in San Diego County to have the kind of cooperation we do. Just a few of the agencies have been working on this case so far the with the Sheriff's Department and the San Diego Police Department, San Diego Fire, San Diego FBI, California Highway Patrol, Escondido Police Department, ATF, California Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Border Patrol.

He identified the gunman as John Ernest, 19-year-old white male. Clean record, also suspectedly involved in a mosque burning that occurred about a month earlier in Escondido, California which is very interesting.  They are looking through the manifesto right now. And we will bring you more as the story develops, but we want to bring in Fox Nation host, Tomi Lahren; the host of the \"Michael Knowles Show,\" Mike Knowles and media reporter for The Hill, Joe Concha. Joe, I'll begin with you. It looks like there's a real pattern now if you just look at the last year of people targeting houses of worship. You've seen synagogue shootings, you've seen mosque attacks, Easter attacks all over the world. There's nothing really you can do to prevent that, you're not going to put armed guards all over every single house of worship in the world. But what does it tell you as a pattern that's developing in terms of hate crimes and violence? JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, \"THE HILL\": It shows that a lone wolf knows what a soft target is, Jesse and a soft target is exactly as you described, a synagogue, a church. We saw it with Dylann Roof down in Charleston. We see it here in California. We saw it in New Zealand.  As you said, there is no real way to protect these places unless you're going to put an armed guard in every place and that still doesn't guarantee anything. So as far as solutions, I honestly right now, live television couldn't tell you what they are. I just don't like the fact that every time this happens, we have to then point to -- does this person support this politician, with that politician. When a shooter shot up that softball field in Virginia with Republican lawmakers, and he was a Bernie Sanders supporter, nobody should have pointed to Bernie Sanders. And same with Donald Trump and that sick individual that sent bombs around to Democratic lawmakers, former presidents, CNN, no one should have pointed Donald Trump and said \"Oh, that's the reason.\" The people that carry out these crimes, these hideous acts, they are to blame. And by the way, Jesse, let's not share this person's name. Let's not plaster his face all over news. It's irrelevant, almost. And it only leads to copycats in these situations, Jesse.",

You know, we mentioned, Joe did the manifesto and people right now, you know, scouring the manifesto trying to link politicians or ideology to it. We can only report that some of the local affiliates in Southern California have started to go through the manifesto. The guy is obviously a rabid anti-Semite, and he said he does not support Donald Trump, because of his support for Israel. But this is going to be politicized. You know it and I know it. MICHAEL KNOWLES, HOST, \"THE MICHAEL KNOWLES SHOW\": I've actually just finished reading the alleged manifesto, as you say, as certain facts become clear, the author of this manifesto spent an inordinate amount of time in the darkest recesses of the internet, the language that he uses, the imagery that he uses come from those sorts of places. He is clearly a rabid anti-Semite. He despises President Trump. He despises conservatives, as he says, because they don't conserve anything. On and on, this is boilerplate, white supremacist ideology. As you're seeing already happened, people are going to try to politicize this for their own agendas. They're going to use it to try to promote certain gun control laws or other laws, other ways that they say could have prevented the shooting.  I think all of that is hypothetical. I don't see a lot of evidence for how this awful shooting could have been prevented. What we can do right now is pray for the victims, pray for the woman who was killed, pray for those who were injured, to pray for the survivors as Passover comes to an end. And we can hope for a policy that might give us some modicum of justice moving forward, that justice is dealt swiftly, and that capital punishment is dealt swiftly to this awful murderer and we can regain some semblance of justice for this awful tragedy.",

I know what a great community it is. But I also don't think we can lose in this discussion, the Border Patrol agent who stood up and we don't know if he returned fire, but you know, there's some reports that he struck the getaway vehicle. When we're talking about what we can do to prevent these things. There's not a lot that we can do because it is a soft target. But if you look at the continuous incidents of soft targets, you can see that they go there because they don't believe anyone is going to be armed unable to return fire. So the fact that this Border Patrol agent off duty, stood up and had a firearm and was able to return fire or at least strike the getaway vehicle what we're hearing, that's one of the things that I look at and say not only do I commend our Border Patrol agents, but I look at someone who is a concealed carry holder that was able to return fire.

Officials confirming for us a few -- just a while ago that one person has died -- a woman -- in that shooting at the Chabad of Poway Synagogue and the suspect is in custody. The Mayor calling the incident a hate crime saying the community will come through the tragedy though united. Four patients were transported to the Palomar Medical Center. Now we know one of them has passed away. There are still two adult males and a little girl currently in stable condition. So far it's unclear though how many were inside the synagogue at time of the shooting, but the San Diego Sheriff's Department says at least 100 witnesses are still waiting to be interviewed. We're also starting to hear from some of those witnesses about what happened. Official say the 19-year-old white male suspect was engaged by an off duty Border Patrol agent who was inside the synagogue at the time the shooting unfolded. The suspect was able to get away though, then a short time later, authorities say he surrendered to a K9 officer without incident. An AR-type rifle was spotted in in the suspect's vehicle. The shooting happened shortly before 11:30 this morning, just as worshippers were beginning and all-day Passover Service, which was scheduled to end tonight with the Passover meal -- Jesse."

They say he has some sort of manifesto that he posted online last night. And it looks like he was kind of a copycat guy, talked a lot about the shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand, the guy that targeted the mosque.

One thing to point out, though, that I talked about earlier, there's the synagogue where the shooting happened, and then next door, there's also a Christian Church. And there are at least a couple of other houses of worship right in that area, as well as a Hebrew School attached to the synagogue. So it was an area with plenty of houses of worship, if someone was planning on carrying something like this out. We are hoping to hear more from authorities. You mentioned the social media aspect, like a possible manifesto. That's something that that we have not been able to confirm.

Again, we have not been able to confirm this, but local reporting does suggest that he was a vicious anti-Semite who did not support Donald Trump because of Donald Trump's support of Israel. That is what the local affiliates have been reporting. Again, Fox has not been able to independently confirm, but we're going to stay with this story as it develops. Marianne, thank you very much."

I mean, these threats, history has shown us we cannot look at these and take them with a grain of salt. We have to act on those quickly.

We heard reports that he made fired around into the suspect's vehicle, a high-speed chase ensued, and then other law enforcement officials were able to stop him on the freeway and apprehend him. He came out with, we believe a bulletproof vest. Some of those reports have suggested and he was taken into custody. And now he's being, I'm sure, interrogated very aggressively. When you have a guy is in custody this soon after a shooting like this, what's going on inside that detention facility?"

How long has he been planning this? Were there red flags, other than this alleged manifesto that we've could have seen earlier? Of course, they want to search his house, they want to search his vehicle. They want to search social media, his computer, his electronics, maybe even phone records. Because, you know, keep in mind, Jesse, this investigation is still early on. We think we have the bullet points of it, that it was a hate crime. This guy is 19 years old.

The adult male -- one adult males is in stable condition at the hospital and the juvenile has been in stable condition. She has been transported to Rady Children's Hospital. We're currently working with the Escondido Police Department and the FBI to determine Ernest's possible involvement in the arson at the mosque in Escondido about a month ago, and the additional -- the San Diego Sheriff's Department and the San Diego Police Department are conducting additional patrols at houses of worship throughout the San Diego County. As I stated before, the Anti-Defamation League is offering crisis trauma counseling at Poway High School. And there's also a county crisis line that is available to anybody that needs their services. That's 888-724- 7270. That's 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We urge everyone to stay vigilant and report any unusual circumstances to 911 and I guarantee you, they will be properly investigated and responded to.

      "utterance": "Okay, that was the San Diego County Sheriff William Gore delivering a briefing after the synagogue shooting in Southern California today that claimed the life of one woman, injuring three others. He identified the gunman as John Ernest, 19-year-old white male. Clean record, also suspectedly involved in a mosque burning that occurred about a month earlier in Escondido, California which is very interesting. They are looking through the manifesto right now. And we will bring you more as the story develops, but we want to bring in Fox Nation host, Tomi Lahren; the host of the \"Michael Knowles Show,\" Mike Knowles and media reporter for The Hill, Joe Concha. Joe, I'll begin with you. It looks like there's a real pattern now if you just look at the last year of people targeting houses of worship. You've seen synagogue shootings, you've seen mosque attacks, Easter attacks all over the world. There's nothing really you can do to prevent that, you're not going to put armed guards all over every single house of worship in the world. But what does it tell you as a pattern that's developing in terms of hate crimes and violence? JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, \"THE HILL\": It shows that a lone wolf knows what a soft target is, Jesse and a soft target is exactly as you described, a synagogue, a church. We saw it with Dylann Roof down in Charleston. We see it here in California. We saw it in New Zealand. As you said, there is no real way to protect these places unless you're going to put an armed guard in every place and that still doesn't guarantee anything. So as far as solutions, I honestly right now, live television couldn't tell you what they are. I just don't like the fact that every time this happens, we have to then point to -- does this person support this politician, with that politician. When a shooter shot up that softball field in Virginia with Republican lawmakers, and he was a Bernie Sanders supporter, nobody should have pointed to Bernie Sanders. And same with Donald Trump and that sick individual that sent bombs around to Democratic lawmakers, former presidents, CNN, no one should have pointed Donald Trump and said \"Oh, that's the reason.\" The people that carry out these crimes, these hideous acts, they are to blame. And by the way, Jesse, let's not share this person's name. Let's not plaster his face all over news. It's irrelevant, almost. And it only leads to copycats in these situations, Jesse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "And this looks like a copycat situation, Michael, because the guy allegedly if you look at the manifesto, was inspired by the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, also the New Zealand attack as well. You know, we mentioned, Joe did the manifesto and people right now, you know, scouring the manifesto trying to link politicians or ideology to it. We can only report that some of the local affiliates in Southern California have started to go through the manifesto. The guy is obviously a rabid anti-Semite, and he said he does not support Donald Trump, because of his support for Israel. But this is going to be politicized. You know it and I know it. MICHAEL KNOWLES, HOST, \"THE MICHAEL KNOWLES SHOW\": I've actually just finished reading the alleged manifesto, as you say, as certain facts become clear, the author of this manifesto spent an inordinate amount of time in the darkest recesses of the internet, the language that he uses, the imagery that he uses come from those sorts of places. He is clearly a rabid anti-Semite. He despises President Trump. He despises conservatives, as he says, because they don't conserve anything. On and on, this is boilerplate, white supremacist ideology. As you're seeing already happened, people are going to try to politicize this for their own agendas. They're going to use it to try to promote certain gun control laws or other laws, other ways that they say could have prevented the shooting. I think all of that is hypothetical. I don't see a lot of evidence for how this awful shooting could have been prevented. What we can do right now is pray for the victims, pray for the woman who was killed, pray for those who were injured, to pray for the survivors as Passover comes to an end. And we can hope for a policy that might give us some modicum of justice moving forward, that justice is dealt swiftly, and that capital punishment is dealt swiftly to this awful murderer and we can regain some semblance of justice for this awful tragedy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "It's interesting that you mentioned capital punishment because Tomi, I recall covering a story just a couple months ago, where then Mayor of San Francisco, but Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, I believe got rid of capital punishment through some sort of executive action. And you know, after something like this, it just seems like terrible timing."

    {
      "speaker": "TOMI LAHREN, FOX NATION HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, he put a moratorium on the death penalty, even though California voters actually voted to speed up the process for execution. So he went against the will of Californians. But Jesse, I've got tell you, I'm here in Los Angeles, I'm fairly close to where this occurred right outside of San Diego. So my heart breaks for that community because I've been to that community. I know what a great community it is. But I also don't think we can lose in this discussion, the Border Patrol agent who stood up and we don't know if he returned fire, but you know, there's some reports that he struck the getaway vehicle. When we're talking about what we can do to prevent these things. There's not a lot that we can do because it is a soft target. But if you look at the continuous incidents of soft targets, you can see that they go there because they don't believe anyone is going to be armed unable to return fire. So the fact that this Border Patrol agent off duty, stood up and had a firearm and was able to return fire or at least strike the getaway vehicle what we're hearing, that's one of the things that I look at and say not only do I commend our Border Patrol agents, but I look at someone who is a concealed carry holder that was able to return fire. And I look at it as a victory for the Second Amendment even here in California."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

You're going to hear people from both sides of the political spectrum, talking about gun rights, gun control. But if you just look at the facts of the case, if you have people with a gun, good guys, they can deter bad guys who are armed and this seems like one of those examples."

    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",

There are still 300 million people, 300 million guns that are out there, and you're not going to start confiscating them because you know, who knows what that would lead to? So yes, when you look at situations like this, as a journalist, you say, okay, let's say even the most staunch gun control laws were on the books, could this crime have been prevented from happening? And in this case, from what we're seeing, from what we know, right now? No, that's not the case that even if you had the staunchest gun control laws, that this still unfortunately, would have happened, because sick people do sick things.

I expect to hear a lot about the no collusion, no obstruction. We expect to hear about the hot economy. First quarter growth at 3.2. Fantastic number. And also I'm sure we'll hear a little bit about Bernie Sanders, who made some news this week at a Town Hall saying he wanted the Boston bomber to be able to vote from behind bars.
