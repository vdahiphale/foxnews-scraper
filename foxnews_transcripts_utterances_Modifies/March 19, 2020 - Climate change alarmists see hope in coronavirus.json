      "sentences": "All right, I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. We've been telling you, for days, about a new drug that could drastically change the trajectory of the Coronavirus, maybe even get us out of our houses sooner, and it looks like people are finally listening.  Plus, new fears, this has not been reported, of cardiac complications associated with the disease. See, people think it's just respiratory, where I'm going to talk to an expert on the short- and long-term effects of this.  And the Senate's new aid package could put some money in your pocket. But is that the best way to steady the economy amid this outbreak? Steve Moore is here on that, the dangers of this Stimulus plan.  Also ahead, there are some on the Left who seem to be happy about the Coronavirus. Who are they? Well maybe happy. They're happy about the effect maybe, not to the people, but to the climate. Climate activists, they're thrilled. I'll explain why, later on in the show. But first, moments ago, California Governor Gavin Newsom ordering everyone in the State to stay at home, and it's called a Stay Safe order or something.  Jeff Paul in the West Coast Newsroom has all the details. Jeff?",

And essentially, the - the idea here is to keep people from mingling, from being out together, and doing things that aren't absolutely necessary.  Now, under this order, which goes into effect tonight, things that will stay open are essentials like gas stations, pharmacy, grocery stores, things that provide food, banks, Laundromat, laundry service.   Things that might not be able to do under this order, especially here in the City of L.A., because Mayor Garcetti announced something similar, a little bit earlier today, really, you shouldn't be going to work, here in L.A., unless it's one of these essential services, and really shouldn't be out visiting anybody at a hospital right now because that could put you further at risk. One other thing that the Governor announced on this was that hospitalizations could surge, so that's part of it. They're worried about how the impact of this virus could have on hospitals, could surge up to 19,500 patients, which is well beyond capacity. Again, this is a developing story. And we'll - we'll keep our eyes on it right now, Laura, back to you.",

I mean I'm one of them. It gets depressing after a while. Well the numbers around the world are still increasing, 240,000 people infected, over 9,800 dead. The elderly are living in fear.  Families are wondering when the heck their lives are ever going to be normal again. And without their school routines, take it from me, I'm living with this, many children are anxious, parents, just a little stressed.   A restaurateur, and neighbor, a dear, dear man, a friend of mine had to let go 300 employees today. Some of these folks have been with him for 20 years. He was heartbroken. It just seems like a never-ending stream of bad news. But, but there are important signs of hope. Light, you could see it. Look closely, it's at the end of the tunnel.  Companies in the United States, and elsewhere, are stepping up and retooling their operations to turn out medical supplies, hand sanitizers, ventilators, and more help for all of us to fight this Coronavirus. More people, and this is really good, are getting tested every day. Between March 2nd and March 14th, 10.4 million lab tests were put into the healthcare system, 45,000 people have been tested through the CDC, remember, I was complaining about the CDC, well 45,000, 63,000 have already been tested by commercial labs, 20,000 tests already resolved. Hundreds of thousands more are coming in the next week.  Look, the President wanted results. He's impatient for results, and he got them. And he got them when Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, pushed for the private sector to take this up, along with a massive deregulatory push.",

Now, let's hope that number holds over time, and especially as more people are tested worldwide, even those who are asymptomatic.

We think it works in two ways. As you know, the death rate goes up, as the age goes up.  And what I think is that the more mature your immune response, the more likely you are to have a, what we call, a cytokine storm, which means that people with viral pneumonias die because their lungs fill up with fluids, largely from an immune response. And this drug works, not only inhibiting virus replication, but also inhibits the immune response, so you don't get the tremendous amount of inflammation.

However, that data may be changing coming out of Italy and Europe where we hear more alarming results that cardiac complications may be more common. And also, in the cases in the United States, we see late complications on the heart. So, this is alarming. This is unknown. We don't have the data. The data is coming. But when something is unknown, and alarming, that obviously creates fear. So, we need the data to clarify that, and alleviate the fears, and that will probably clear the path to go forward.

It includes sending checks out to every American, up to $1,200 per person. Now, relief is needed, we all know that, because many Americans are already filing for unemployment benefits, a looming recession, some say it's already here. The Labor Department is reporting now that 280,000 people lost their jobs in the last week. At this rate, we could stand to lose over 1 million jobs, I can't even say that, it's so heartbreaking, just over the next month. And experts are predicting job losses could total 3.5 million by the summer. We better get going on these antivirals. McConnell's bill also earmarks over $350 billion for loans to businesses, which he insists is not a bailout to the special interests. He's carving out nearly $60 billion just for the airline industry. Do they need taxpayer support? Even if it's a loan, is that better? And remember, this bill still needs to get through a Democrat-controlled House. But they do say they're all working together. So, if their last Coronavirus bill is any guide, they're going to try to fill McConnell's plan in the House with all sorts of little goody - goody grab bags, a Christmas tree, put their ornaments on it and giveaways to their friends.  But there's also another risk, and it's something that endangered our economic recovery during the Great Depression.

It put the adjective \"Great\" into the phrase because we had unemployment for 10 percent (ph). Think of that in contrast to now, and our Dow did not come back the whole decade.

What is the rest pathway, Steve? And is - are they on the right track? STEVE MOORE, SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER TRUMP 2016, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION ECONOMIST: Well, you know, I'm sort of frustrated with - with this whole Stimulus idea because Stimulus has never worked. In fact, I have a piece in The Wall Street Journal on Saturday with the title \"Stimulus never works.\" Amity is right about what happened in the 1930s. By the way, there's a whole mythology about how wonderful the New Deal was because the Left wrote the history books, and that's what everybody learns. But Amity is exactly right. It didn't work in the 1930s. We had double- digit unemployment throughout Franklin Roosevelt's Presidency. And then, of course, we tried this, as you recall, you know, Laura, back in '90 - 2009, when Barack Obama was President. Remember, Laura, the shovel- ready projects, and the $830 billion we were going to spend, which was going to spring the economy back to life? And - and remember, by the way, Joe Biden had, remember, his Summer of Recovery. It never happened. It was the worst recovery from a recession we've had, going back to the Great Depression. Even by Obama's own numbers, the economy would have been better, and would have healed faster if we had not spent any of that money. So, my first advice to Donald Trump is, don't do what we did in 2009, under Obama, because it didn't work. And - and, by the way, if he puts in place policies that actually hurt the economy, and some of these policies would, you know, you're talking about President Joe Biden, he's got to have a growth plan. Laffer and I and - and Steve Forbes and I have talked about the idea of suspending the payroll tax for the rest of the year to give businesses an incentive to hire more workers because it would be a tax cut for every one of the 26 million small businesses in the country.",

We've been telling you, for days, about a new drug that could drastically change the trajectory of the Coronavirus, maybe even get us out of our houses sooner, and it looks like people are finally listening. Plus, new fears, this has not been reported, of cardiac complications associated with the disease. See, people think it's just respiratory, where I'm going to talk to an expert on the short- and long-term effects of this. And the Senate's new aid package could put some money in your pocket. But is that the best way to steady the economy amid this outbreak? Steve Moore is here on that, the dangers of this Stimulus plan. Also ahead, there are some on the Left who seem to be happy about the Coronavirus. Who are they? Well maybe happy. They're happy about the effect maybe, not to the people, but to the climate. Climate activists, they're thrilled. I'll explain why, later on in the show. But first, moments ago, California Governor Gavin Newsom ordering everyone in the State to stay at home, and it's called a Stay Safe order or something. Jeff Paul in the West Coast Newsroom has all the details. Jeff?"

And essentially, the - the idea here is to keep people from mingling, from being out together, and doing things that aren't absolutely necessary. Now, under this order, which goes into effect tonight, things that will stay open are essentials like gas stations, pharmacy, grocery stores, things that provide food, banks, Laundromat, laundry service. Things that might not be able to do under this order, especially here in the City of L.A., because Mayor Garcetti announced something similar, a little bit earlier today, really, you shouldn't be going to work, here in L.A., unless it's one of these essential services, and really shouldn't be out visiting anybody at a hospital right now because that could put you further at risk. One other thing that the Governor announced on this was that hospitalizations could surge, so that's part of it. They're worried about how the impact of this virus could have on hospitals, could surge up to 19,500 patients, which is well beyond capacity. Again, this is a developing story.

I mean I'm one of them. It gets depressing after a while. Well the numbers around the world are still increasing, 240,000 people infected, over 9,800 dead. The elderly are living in fear. Families are wondering when the heck their lives are ever going to be normal again. And without their school routines, take it from me, I'm living with this, many children are anxious, parents, just a little stressed. A restaurateur, and neighbor, a dear, dear man, a friend of mine had to let go 300 employees today. Some of these folks have been with him for 20 years. He was heartbroken. It just seems like a never-ending stream of bad news. But, but there are important signs of hope. Light, you could see it. Look closely, it's at the end of the tunnel. Companies in the United States, and elsewhere, are stepping up and retooling their operations to turn out medical supplies, hand sanitizers, ventilators, and more help for all of us to fight this Coronavirus. More people, and this is really good, are getting tested every day. Between March 2nd and March 14th, 10.4 million lab tests were put into the healthcare system, 45,000 people have been tested through the CDC, remember, I was complaining about the CDC, well 45,000, 63,000 have already been tested by commercial labs, 20,000 tests already resolved. Hundreds of thousands more are coming in the next week. Look, the President wanted results. He's impatient for results, and he got them. And he got them when Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, pushed for the private sector to take this up, along with a massive deregulatory push."

We don't want anyone to die. But that's at least 50 percent lower as a mortality rate than has been previously reported in many different outlets. Now, let's hope that number holds over time, and especially as more people are tested worldwide, even those who are asymptomatic. But perhaps the best news of all is about a drug I brought to your attention on Monday night. Now, at first, it kind of seemed to me, I'm a little skeptical, all that, it seemed too good to be true.

I'll happily volunteer. If you're looking for volunteers, OK, I'll volunteer. The FDA - FDA needs to hop onto this pronto. It looks like they are. That's great news. Now, seeing the President snap his team into action, and in the process, harnessing the full power of the government, all of the government, the private sector, and our citizens, who are doing great acts of selflessness during this entire crisis, it gives all of us hope in this really difficult time. As we've done with polio, and the measles, and so much else, we'll find the answers we need. We've beaten diseases in the past, and we'll do it again. And that's The Angle. So, how beneficial is Hydroxychloroquine? My next guest says doctors are already using this treatment in the United States successfully.

And the problem is these patients are coming in quite sick. And when they get to a very difficult respiratory status, the doctors are using Hydroxychloroquine with or without a drug called Zithromax or Azithromycin, and that's showing tremendous activity. And we have not had a death in our Hospital. We have probably close to a 100 patients, and not had any deaths. But I've talked to many of my colleagues at other hospitals in New York, and they also are using Hydroxychloroquine, although the supplies are running down. So, any kind of supplements to those supplies would be much appreciated."

      "speaker": "GRACE",
      "utterance": "Yes. There are people out in the West Coast who are looking at it in people who are virus-positive, but don't show many of the symptoms, and they're looking for the clearance of the virus by this drug. We think it works in two ways. As you know, the death rate goes up, as the age goes up. And what I think is that the more mature your immune response, the more likely you are to have a, what we call, a cytokine storm, which means that people with viral pneumonias die because their lungs fill up with fluids, largely from an immune response. And this drug works, not only inhibiting virus replication, but also inhibits the immune response, so you don't get the tremendous amount of inflammation. That's why the drug is also used in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus."

So, we should be able to get answers on this pretty quickly. That could be a game-changer if what you're seeing, what your - your colleagues are seeing in Lenox Hill pans out, because what they're seeing in China and France is stunning - are stunning results with this drug."

      "speaker": "GRACE",
      "utterance": "Well we don't have enough test kits. And we didn't have them here largely because the CDC tried to internalize, and make the test kits all part of their program, rather than having it throughout the entire private sector. And we're paying a price for that. And now, once we have enough test kits out, and get the public private sectors producing these kits, we'll have - be able to get that denominator down pat."

Joining me now is Dr. Michael Orlov, Cardiologist at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston. Doctor, how is the Coronavirus associated with heart problems, and what are you seeing with all of the Chinese research that's coming out, just on that aspect of it?"

    {
      "speaker": "DR. MICHAEL ORLOV, ST. ELIZABETH'S MEDICAL CENTER",
      "utterance": "Well Laura, this is fascinating problem because the initial data from China showed that the effect of Coronavirus on the heart is relatively small, so it was seen in about 8 percent of patients, who had severe, severe cardiac problems. And lesser - lesser cardiac problems were observed a little bit more frequently. However, that data may be changing coming out of Italy and Europe where we hear more alarming results that cardiac complications may be more common. And also, in the cases in the United States, we see late complications on the heart. So, this is alarming. This is unknown. We don't have the data. The data is coming. But when something is unknown, and alarming, that obviously creates fear. So, we need the data to clarify that, and alleviate the fears, and that will probably clear the path to go forward. However, having said that, cardiac complications are also very complex, and require complex treatment, and complex devices, to help to support the body while it's fighting the virus, and those devices are in relatively short supply. We need to be prepared to be quickly equipped with them, mobilize those--"

My concern is that Hydroxychloroquine is supposedly manufactured only by one producer. And we need to make, if it's effective, we need to make it quickly available, like many, many other things that are lacking, that are missing. I was going to bring up some simple things because simple things work. And miracle drugs are perfect. But we just need to do simple measures like public gatherings, people should observe that. That's very important. Also, personal protective equipment, need to be made available. In the frontlines, we don't have enough. This is just missing again because the manufacturing is done elsewhere. It's overseas. And we don't have enough masks, enough other protective equipment. It should be made available quickly along with a miracle drug."

      "utterance": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today proposing a third Coronavirus economic aid package. Now, his plan will likely cost more than $1 trillion. It includes sending checks out to every American, up to $1,200 per person. Now, relief is needed, we all know that, because many Americans are already filing for unemployment benefits, a looming recession, some say it's already here. The Labor Department is reporting now that 280,000 people lost their jobs in the last week. At this rate, we could stand to lose over 1 million jobs, I can't even say that, it's so heartbreaking, just over the next month. And experts are predicting job losses could total 3.5 million by the summer. We better get going on these antivirals. McConnell's bill also earmarks over $350 billion for loans to businesses, which he insists is not a bailout to the special interests. He's carving out nearly $60 billion just for the airline industry. Do they need taxpayer support? Even if it's a loan, is that better? And remember, this bill still needs to get through a Democrat-controlled House. But they do say they're all working together. So, if their last Coronavirus bill is any guide, they're going to try to fill McConnell's plan in the House with all sorts of little goody - goody grab bags, a Christmas tree, put their ornaments on it and giveaways to their friends. But there's also another risk, and it's something that endangered our economic recovery during the Great Depression. Joining me now is Amity Shlaes, Chairman of the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, Author of \"Great Society,\" and Steve Moore, Senior Economic Adviser to Trump 2016 Campaign, and Author of \"Trumponomics.\" Amity, I told everybody you're going to come back tonight, OK, because you were - you were telling us last night, and I rudely cut you off that we should avoid doing the things that FDR did in the 30s that hurt our recovery. What were you referring to, specifically?"

And what President Roosevelt did, as lovable as and inspiring as it was, prolonged the Great Depression. It put the adjective \"Great\" into the phrase because we had unemployment for 10 percent (ph). Think of that in contrast to now, and our Dow did not come back the whole decade. Imagine if we told ourselves now the Dow will never get back to where it was three weeks ago. And so, we're really in the rocking chair, you know. That's awfully disconcerting. And bottom line, what happened was the government intervened too much."

It is - it is just a month ago we're the strongest economy in the world, strongest economy in decades. And now, here we are, shuttered in place, or whatever we're calling it, \"Safe space, safe distancing,\" and people are out of work, can't go anywhere, can't do anything, can't spend money on anything. What is the rest pathway, Steve? And is - are they on the right track? STEVE MOORE, SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER TRUMP 2016, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION ECONOMIST: Well, you know, I'm sort of frustrated with - with this whole Stimulus idea because Stimulus has never worked. In fact, I have a piece in The Wall Street Journal on Saturday with the title \"Stimulus never works.\" Amity is right about what happened in the 1930s. By the way, there's a whole mythology about how wonderful the New Deal was because the Left wrote the history books, and that's what everybody learns. But Amity is exactly right. It didn't work in the 1930s. We had double- digit unemployment throughout Franklin Roosevelt's Presidency. And then, of course, we tried this, as you recall, you know, Laura, back in '90 - 2009, when Barack Obama was President. Remember, Laura, the shovel- ready projects, and the $830 billion we were going to spend, which was going to spring the economy back to life? And - and remember, by the way, Joe Biden had, remember, his Summer of Recovery. It never happened. It was the worst recovery from a recession we've had, going back to the Great Depression. Even by Obama's own numbers, the economy would have been better, and would have healed faster if we had not spent any of that money. So, my first advice to Donald Trump is, don't do what we did in 2009, under Obama, because it didn't work. And - and, by the way, if he puts in place policies that actually hurt the economy, and some of these policies would, you know, you're talking about President Joe Biden, he's got to have a growth plan. Laffer and I and - and Steve Forbes and I have talked about the idea of suspending the payroll tax for the rest of the year to give businesses an incentive to hire more workers because it would be a tax cut for every one of the 26 million small businesses in the country."

You say you can't say things, and you are absolutely correct. An example, what if we cut the capital gains tax by half and forget about the surcharge, just go from 20 to 10? What if we talked about that? You would instantly be attacked for helping the rich. But every economist, including all the way over on the left among the Marxists, knows that if you cut the capital gains tax rate by half, then international investment would raise our stock market tomorrow. It is just that they don't dare say it. The Republicans act like Democrats in elections. And it's unfortunate. There are many more steps to growth we could take, we just have to be a little bit braver than we are currently being. The Republican Party is almost indistinguishable, unfortunately, from the Democratic Party. I work on Calvin Coolidge, and he had a completely different vision, let me say."

They have actually declined by 35 percent when you look at the emissions from electricity production, mostly thanks to the fracking, natural gas revolution. So if you are looking for a model for how to deal with claimant change, how to reduce carbon emissions and improve the environment, you want a lot of economic growth and prosperity.

I think that is a very minority view, it's a very dark view. I think the truth is that economic growth and lifting people out of poverty has been the most important way to reduce air pollution, to reduce humankind's negative impacts on the natural environment. The truth is that air pollution has been in decline in the United States since the late 1960s. Carbon emissions, obviously, peaked over a decade and a half ago. In Europe, carbon emissions peaked in the 70s. The good news is that the switch to natural gas and nuclear means that it's unlikely that temperatures are going to get very high. It is probably going to peak under three degrees temperature increase since preindustrial times.

I haven't heard many people claiming that there is any causal connection. But what you said is exactly right. Who would have thought that the wet live markets in China would be a major source of global chaos, of this economic challenges we're going to be having of mass death. But that is the reality, and experts have been warning against Chinese markets, those live markets where the animals are on top of each other. They're very unsanitary. We have been worrying about those for two decades now.
