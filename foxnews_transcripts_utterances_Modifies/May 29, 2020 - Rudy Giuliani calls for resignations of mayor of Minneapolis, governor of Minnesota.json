      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\" this Friday night. We begin with a FOX News alert, a curfew has just this very minute now been enacted in Minneapolis following a violent night of rioting that resulted in destruction of property of over 170 businesses impacted and frankly something I never thought I'd see in my adult lifetime that we'd ever see in this country -- the torching of a police precinct and they didn't defend it. And more all-out carnage across the country tonight.  And we'll be following these protests in multiple cities all throughout the hour, full live reports from the ground, straight ahead.  At this hour, the protests in Atlanta -- they are getting more tense. Breaking moments ago, a squad car was smashed.  But we start tonight in Minneapolis, a city in turmoil, a city in chaos, and a city being destroyed as we speak in front of the whole country to watch. According to local officials, more than 170 businesses now have been damaged or looted, along with dozens of fires in one location after another. Just look at your screen.  Now, these businesses include major chain retailers like Target, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, McDonald's, CVS, Goodwill, along with dozens and dozens and dozens of small businesses, including jewelry stores, convenience stores, pizza parlors, pawnshops, and the list goes on. We'll show you that list throughout the show. This type of violence, this sort of destruction of property, it is dangerous to every city where this is happening. And let me be clear, all of it is unacceptable.  And, by the way, how could the governor of the state ever allow this to happen? Or the mayor of Minneapolis? The governor of Minnesota -- how did they let this happen?   These are real businesses. These are real American workers already struggling enough right now. Order must be restored immediately. It is sad to watch all of this unfold. It is our horrific display of violence that does not honor George Floyd's memory in any way, shape, manner, or form. We have these updates on the case coming up tonight, including the arrest and the charging today of the officer at the center of all of this.   But first, here for a live report from Minneapolis, FOX News correspondent Mike Tobin. He is in Minneapolis again tonight for us. Mike, things seem to be heating up.",

      "sentences": "They have been. It's been a remarkable 15 minutes. Minnesota state patrol and the big speaker truck came to where the line of protesters were. They announced that they needed to disperse, if they remain, they will be in violation of the order to clear the streets, and then they backed out.  Both the state troopers with their truncheons and riot gear at the ready, as well as the guardsmen carrying M-16s, a few M4s, mostly M-16s, some of them with magazines and some of them not, and they all backed up. They had some conflict back and forth with the demonstrators in the street. They threw some bottles with some kind of white liquid, and the state troopers responded with a little bit of teargas, really wasn't a massive amount and they all backed up.   You can see some green smoke in the foreground, I can't tell you where that is coming from, but we're all the way back now to the third precinct building. The fence is backed up in front of the third precinct building after it was ripped down last night. And you can see the front of the third precinct was torched. Those are the flames you saw late last night. The liquor store across the street now is gutted, the kids are throwing things and they're tipping things over. But they really can't add to the destruction that happened last night. The only thing they've got probably is that fence, which was I guess re-erected at some point throughout the day.  I just heard a loud pop come I can't tell you what that is, Sean, but the crowd is back in the middle of the intersection of Lake and Minnehaha where we saw so much destruction last night, this is kind of the epicenter because we are so close to the third precinct, all of the fires and all of the looting, most of the vandalism, I should say most of the fires, most of the looting centralized in this area, Sean.",

They made their strategic decision to retreat, but you still don't have the situation resolved here as you've got chaos once again in front of the third precinct building.

      "sentences": "Good evening to you, Sean.   Outside of the White House here at 9:00, we've got a crowd of maybe 100, 150. Earlier today, though, this protest grew very quickly and things got quite confrontational along the north fence line of the White House. They are some bicycle barricades that separate the north fence of the White House from Pennsylvania Avenue, and the protesters began to shove those over. That did not go over very well with the Secret Service who initially appeared to be caught off guard, reinforcements came in, and they were able to push the protesters back pretty quickly, the protesters left. And right now, Sean, at 9:00, we got protests at three places in Washington, D.C. and growing. We have the White House here with chants of Black Lives Matter with the president upstairs conceivably in the residence. We got protests outside the Trump hotel, and then also the protesters have made their way to the Capitol Hill.  This is the first night, Sean, of what they call stay-at-home lite here in Washington, D.C. So they lifted a lot of the coronavirus restrictions and they are certainly out in force in the streets and as protest numbers seem to be growing, at least in this way, we have not seen the confrontation with the Secret Service that happened a couple of hours ago, although based on the number of Secret Service agents lining the fence line now, you have to think they are at least prepared for it.  We've been through this before in different ways with protests out here in Lafayette Park and every time, at least the number of times I've been back inside the White House as part of the White House unit, it is incredible, the amount of supplies and at the ready, both ammunition, weapons, shields, and riot gear they keep back here inside the White House, Sean.",

What happened earlier, and I think we may have some video of it is that the barricades were pushed down by the protesters, and that got the Secret Service's attention. They stayed back as they are now and let people chant and let people be very angry, and cause a ruckus, if you will, in Lafayette Park. As soon as those barricades got pushed down, that's when the Secret Service responded, we had the pushing the bicycle barricades back and using the barricades to keep the crowd back, big reinforcement of Secret Service agents and officers came out here to the north fence line and on the White House was locked down.  I'm not sure whether that lockdown has still been in effect or whether the White House has lifted it. We did see a of members of the press be let out.

That's in reference to George Floyd's final words.  And tonight, seeing the tensions escalated in Atlanta. There, we are seeing groups gathered, thousands of them gathered outside of the CNN headquarters, we've seen they've smashed windows, they've been shoving police officers, even lighting some cars on fire there at the scene, and this is all after that viral video, of course, in Minneapolis on Monday went viral, that a video a police officer kneeling on an unarmed black man's neck until he eventually stopped breathing. And all of this is really here and around the country encouraging people and motivating them, they say, to come out of their quarantine and speak up and stand up together.  Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp tweeted, encouraging people to exercise their constitutional right but to do so safely because of COVID-19 concerns. Here in New York, the crowd of protesters marched from downtown Manhattan to Brooklyn, thousands surrounding the Barclays Center, nearby stores and side streets. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's urging protesters to direct their anger not at police, the men and women at the NYPD, but at elected leaders.  While the gatherings tonight so far have been relatively peaceful, we have seen some changes just within the last 30 minutes or so. We're seeing more police officers there in Brooklyn than we have throughout the day, also brought in those buses in to be able to haul away basically anyone who gets out of control. Again, we haven't seen that many arrest today, but we will see following this -- Sean.",

Bill, the latest in L.A. It's still early out there.  BILL MELUGIN, FOX-11 LOS ANGELES REPORTER: Yes, Sean. Good evening. I can tell you here in Los Angeles, we are bracing for what could be a lengthy weekend of protests. There was one under way as I speak right now, several blocks away protesters trying to get onto a busy freeway here in downtown L.A. There is a line of police officers trying to stop them, several other protests already scheduled for tomorrow. But here in L.A., everything started on Wednesday really. If we can pull up some video, this is when those protesters successfully did get onto the 101 Freeway in downtown L.A.., this was in the middle of rush hour. They got onto all lanes of traffic blocking all traffic on both sides of the freeway. California Highway Patrol, a couple of cruiser stopped by to break it up and they were severely outnumbered. And you could take a look at what happened, the protesters immediately swarmed those CHP cruisers, attacking them, kicking them, taking skateboards and throwing them through the windshield of these cruisers. One man jumped unto the hood of the CHP cruiser, the car took off, he fell off and split his head open. And that turned into a big media ordeal out here in Los Angeles.  But again, protests underway here in Los Angeles tonight, very early in the evening, just behind me here at LAPD headquarters. This is where they've got all their metal barricades set up out front. They've got riot police standing out in front guarding because their building was tagged and vandalized in recent nights.  For the most part, the protests here in Los Angeles have been peaceful. However, there have been some bad actors that have infiltrated these protests, have started throwing things at officers, have started attacking their vehicles and vandalizing buildings. And for that reason, LAPD police chief Michael Moore put out a statement essentially telling the protesters, look, we hear you, we're going to let you protest, we're going to protect your right to do so, we understand why you were angry. However, we are drawing the line when it comes to officer safety and public safety. They say if they see anybody being attacked, any buildings being vandalized, they're going to step it up and those people will be arrested -- Sean.",

Courtney Godfrey in Minneapolis tonight for us reporting there. We just spoke with Mike Tobin. Courtney, what is going on where you are? COURTNEY GODFREY, FOX 9 MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL REPORTER: Yes. Hey, Sean, we are out here in Minneapolis. Probably about 15 minutes ago, the state patrol and the National Guard, they told the protesters to back up, and if they didn't, they were going to start arresting. Shortly after that, they started firing tear gas which the protesters then threw back.   I will tell you, one of our private security that's with us here today, he served in Iraq and he told me he never thought that he would see a scene like he saw in Iraq here at home. The protesters now have moved closer, so the street was closed off, Sean. The street was completely closed off and the National Guard retreated, and now everybody has moved in on Lake Street. Now, this is the street that was completely destroyed, mostly immigrant run businesses on the street. Now, it's opened up again to protesters like we saw the first two nights. Now, that curfew just going into effect a short while ago clearly the state patrol is saying they are going to enforce that curfew. What will happen next, we just don't know, but these protesters out here, they have come with jugs of milk, they have come with the attitude that they will be out there and they are going to stay out here. They say they want those three other officers arrested and they will protest and they will riot until that happens.",

It means that the officer is charged with acting in a depraved mind, with a reckless disregard for human life. Under Minnesota law, that is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. First-degree murder so you understand and remember, this is eventually going to go before a jury of 12 individuals with a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. First-degree murder would require intent and premeditation. That tape does not give us any premeditation evidence or intent for that matter. A second degree would require intent but not the premeditation. Again, a high standard based on the take according to all the lawyers I have talked to. The standard for a conviction, remember, criminal trial, beyond a reasonable doubt. Twelve jurors must agree. Can you prove first degree murder? Well, and get a conviction based on the evidence we have now? Can you do it with second-degree murder? You would need more evidence.  In my opinion, many independent lawyers I've talked to than just the tape we have seen so far, well, there might be incriminating evidence that we don't know about yet. Now, I also want to be very clear there's a big difference between a riot and a peaceful protest. Apparently, my so-called friends in the mob and the media, they are having a very hard time making a distinction. There is a big difference between peaceful marching, honoring Mr. Floyd's life, demanding justice, and burning down buildings, destroying businesses, looting, breaking, stealing and advocating for violence. The country is pretty much in universal agreement on the videotape and the death of George Floyd and about how outrageous it looks and is. It is an abuse of power for law enforcement to the highest degree. We need accountability and justice because what makes this case so unique is the amount of standard running time, different angles and tape evidence for extended periods. You don't see resistance anywhere, yet we see the officer pushing down Mr. Floyd's neck for eight-plus solid minutes. Went on for seven minutes, 55 seconds tape, and it was happening before the camera started rolling. It is chilling. It's shaking America, and the American people to its core. Remember, the president, he took the lead on this from day one. He ordered the FBI, the DOJ, to conduct a full investigation. He made it clear this would be a top priority. He wanted this investigation expedited, and he said to the people, justice will be served, and reach out to the family, and apparently spoke to them earlier today. The president is clear: we do not want this violence to continue. And they do not want to dishonor the memory of George Floyd.  Unfortunately, well, with 170 stores that we are counting, anarchy and chaos are raining as we saw all throughout the night last night. Radical rioters exploiting this death of Mr. Floyd committing crimes, justifying crimes, threatening more violence. One agitator actually saying, quote, one of ours, two of yours. Take a look.",

I never thought in my life that I watch a police precinct overtaken, destroyed like what we saw last night. We are all watching this unfold last night, at least tonight, we see a police presence.  Last night I'm thinking, OK, where the police? Where's the National Guard that have been called up? Over 170 businesses, windows smashed, some of them burned, two dozen destroyed, it puts an entire community of innocent people and innocent law enforcement at risk here. And also, you're destroying the entire community. You're taking away jobs when we are living in a time where we need every job, as we now open the country hopefully safely.

Look at this tweet, NBC's Craig Melvin, quote: While the situation on the ground in Minneapolis is fluid and there has been violence, it is most accurate that this time to describe what is happening here as protests, not riots. That's apparently network policy over there at NBC. A hundred seventy stores impacted, looting, rioting, Melvin, whoever you are, that is called a riot. Look at your screen. There is not peaceful protesting by many in this crowd. Far left filmmaker Michael Moore writing, quote, good citizens burning down the evil police precinct of Minnesota after all police were out and safe. Oh, I'm glad you know that, Michael. All police should go home, no violence please.  Really? That's one of the dumbest things you've ever said, and you've set a lot of dumb things, Michael Moore, in the course of your lifetime. Police headquarters, he writes, must be demolished by the city tomorrow as a show of contrition to black America.

And not only that, over at fake news CNN, they actually are comparing a detention of a CNN crew last night to George Floyd's death, prompting a very strong chorus, I think justified, of backlash. By the way, and I believe in freedom of the press, but comparing that to the death of this man is just the typical we get from fake news CNN. And why the media mob be downplaying these acts of violence that we are seeing with our own eyes in Minnesota.  Burning down buildings is not about protesting what happened to George Floyd and his death, it doesn't honor his memory. These are agitators exploiting a crisis, sowing more discord, hate, division and putting lives at risk. Look at your screen. Open your eyes, those of you in the psychotic media mob. By the way, we now look at pictures in Brooklyn, New York, and now, Barack Obama's weighing in with remarks that frankly are not particularly helpful, especially considering his history of other reckless remarks when it comes to police and the race. And you might remember Ferguson, hands up, don't shoot. Yes, remember, that didn't work out the way the mob and the media were telling people then, because there were many eyewitnesses at the end of that case that actually confirmed Officer Darrell Wilson story about Michael Brown. Remember. He said in part, it's natural for us to wish for life to get back to normal, he said, as the pandemic, economic crisis upend everything around us, but we have to remember, for millions of Americans to be treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly normal. Obama might also want a reminder about the Cambridge police acting stupidly, and the Trayvon Martin case ended up being the eyewitness. Ferguson, Baltimore, his comments by his own attorney general that were cowards in America on the issue of race. Now, we are in agreement, George Floyd's death is tragic, unacceptable. What's also unacceptable is what we are now seeing happening in cities all across the country. That's not acceptable -- the destruction of businesses, workers who are already struggling trying to restore order. It's time for the police to do their job.  This is the Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, what he said earlier today.",

The CDC has been in the news recently, they did a study and they found out over the last 45 years, police shootings and killings of blacks have declined 75 percent while the shootings of whites have flat-lined. In fact, an officer is 18-point times more likely to be shot by a black man than an unarmed black man to be killed by a cop. When this happens, it is rare. We should deal with them on a case-by-case basis and not act as if this is some sort of reflection of how cops are all across America. They've never been better trained or educated, they've never been trained in more de-escalation tactics than ever.

We've learned some lessons from Ferguson, and when you organize the protests, meaning set up barriers, right, make them move along, put them in a designated area. There are big lessons.

What happens in many of these cases, that they are either professional paid protesters, Antifa, people that are outside of the community that comment and disrupt it. If you don't believe me, just look at the reports in Ferguson after everything was said and done. Most of the IDs were people, 70 percent of them, were from outside of the city. So they don't care about burning down the city because they don't have to deal with the repercussions afterwards, which is sad because this was the first time I think in this country where you had a universal agreement between liberals, conservatives, and libertarians like me that have been screaming forever about civil liberties, and this moment is being ruined by people that have their own personal agenda, and this is a failure of leadership. I saw the governor's press conference today, and I could not believe that he admitted that he was not prepared. He called the National Guard last night after they did no prep work. Now, we are talking about Wednesday, the city was on fire. You would think they would have some strategy session with the state police and National Guard, but no, they didn't do that.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\" this Friday night. We begin with a FOX News alert, a curfew has just this very minute now been enacted in Minneapolis following a violent night of rioting that resulted in destruction of property of over 170 businesses impacted and frankly something I never thought I'd see in my adult lifetime that we'd ever see in this country -- the torching of a police precinct and they didn't defend it. And more all-out carnage across the country tonight. And we'll be following these protests in multiple cities all throughout the hour, full live reports from the ground, straight ahead. At this hour, the protests in Atlanta -- they are getting more tense. Breaking moments ago, a squad car was smashed. But we start tonight in Minneapolis, a city in turmoil, a city in chaos, and a city being destroyed as we speak in front of the whole country to watch. According to local officials, more than 170 businesses now have been damaged or looted, along with dozens of fires in one location after another. Just look at your screen. Now, these businesses include major chain retailers like Target, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, McDonald's, CVS, Goodwill, along with dozens and dozens and dozens of small businesses, including jewelry stores, convenience stores, pizza parlors, pawnshops, and the list goes on. We'll show you that list throughout the show. This type of violence, this sort of destruction of property, it is dangerous to every city where this is happening. And let me be clear, all of it is unacceptable. And, by the way, how could the governor of the state ever allow this to happen? Or the mayor of Minneapolis? The governor of Minnesota -- how did they let this happen? These are real businesses. These are real American workers already struggling enough right now. Order must be restored immediately. It is sad to watch all of this unfold. It is our horrific display of violence that does not honor George Floyd's memory in any way, shape, manner, or form. We have these updates on the case coming up tonight, including the arrest and the charging today of the officer at the center of all of this. But first, here for a live report from Minneapolis, FOX News correspondent Mike Tobin. He is in Minneapolis again tonight for us. Mike, things seem to be heating up."

      "utterance": "They have been. It's been a remarkable 15 minutes. Minnesota state patrol and the big speaker truck came to where the line of protesters were. They announced that they needed to disperse, if they remain, they will be in violation of the order to clear the streets, and then they backed out. Both the state troopers with their truncheons and riot gear at the ready, as well as the guardsmen carrying M-16s, a few M4s, mostly M-16s, some of them with magazines and some of them not, and they all backed up. They had some conflict back and forth with the demonstrators in the street. They threw some bottles with some kind of white liquid, and the state troopers responded with a little bit of teargas, really wasn't a massive amount and they all backed up. You can see some green smoke in the foreground, I can't tell you where that is coming from, but we're all the way back now to the third precinct building. The fence is backed up in front of the third precinct building after it was ripped down last night. And you can see the front of the third precinct was torched. Those are the flames you saw late last night. The liquor store across the street now is gutted, the kids are throwing things and they're tipping things over. But they really can't add to the destruction that happened last night. The only thing they've got probably is that fence, which was I guess re-erected at some point throughout the day. I just heard a loud pop come I can't tell you what that is, Sean, but the crowd is back in the middle of the intersection of Lake and Minnehaha where we saw so much destruction last night, this is kind of the epicenter because we are so close to the third precinct, all of the fires and all of the looting, most of the vandalism, I should say most of the fires, most of the looting centralized in this area, Sean."

Also what I see are buses, and I'm going to presume that you've got personnel in those buses and now the kids are running. So let's see what we've got here. Where were the police last night, see they made a decision based on the orders of Mayor Jacob Frey to back off, avoid the friction some of the symbolism of the third precinct building was less important than a life. They made their strategic decision to retreat, but you still don't have the situation resolved here as you've got chaos once again in front of the third precinct building. Smoke -- they just made another announcement that the demonstrators need to disperse and they're not going to follow that order first time around. So let's see where we go with this, Sean."

      "utterance": "Good evening to you, Sean. Outside of the White House here at 9:00, we've got a crowd of maybe 100, 150. Earlier today, though, this protest grew very quickly and things got quite confrontational along the north fence line of the White House. They are some bicycle barricades that separate the north fence of the White House from Pennsylvania Avenue, and the protesters began to shove those over. That did not go over very well with the Secret Service who initially appeared to be caught off guard, reinforcements came in, and they were able to push the protesters back pretty quickly, the protesters left. And right now, Sean, at 9:00, we got protests at three places in Washington, D.C. and growing. We have the White House here with chants of Black Lives Matter with the president upstairs conceivably in the residence. We got protests outside the Trump hotel, and then also the protesters have made their way to the Capitol Hill. This is the first night, Sean, of what they call stay-at-home lite here in Washington, D.C. So they lifted a lot of the coronavirus restrictions and they are certainly out in force in the streets and as protest numbers seem to be growing, at least in this way, we have not seen the confrontation with the Secret Service that happened a couple of hours ago, although based on the number of Secret Service agents lining the fence line now, you have to think they are at least prepared for it. We've been through this before in different ways with protests out here in Lafayette Park and every time, at least the number of times I've been back inside the White House as part of the White House unit, it is incredible, the amount of supplies and at the ready, both ammunition, weapons, shields, and riot gear they keep back here inside the White House, Sean."

      "utterance": "The White House -- the Secret Service locked the White House down because the barricades were breached. I don't know if you can see it, but if Doug pans that way, you can see this line of barricades, and those are the bicycle barricades that give the secret service a buffer zone, and then you can see the plywood wall and then the new fence line, the 13-foot fence being built here behind that which will be the north lawn of the White House. What happened earlier, and I think we may have some video of it is that the barricades were pushed down by the protesters, and that got the Secret Service's attention. They stayed back as they are now and let people chant and let people be very angry, and cause a ruckus, if you will, in Lafayette Park. As soon as those barricades got pushed down, that's when the Secret Service responded, we had the pushing the bicycle barricades back and using the barricades to keep the crowd back, big reinforcement of Secret Service agents and officers came out here to the north fence line and on the White House was locked down. I'm not sure whether that lockdown has still been in effect or whether the White House has lifted it. We did see a of members of the press be let out. So, it would lead you to believe the Secret Service feels at least right now they have things more under control."

But Atlanta is a place where we can set an example of prosperity, and we've done that for generations. People like Dr. King, Maynard Jackson, Ambassador Young, have paved the way for us. And when everything else goes away, when you don't get treated right in New York, when you don't get treated right in L.A., when you don't get treated right in Detroit, when you don't get treated right in St. Louis, when you don't get treated right in Alabama, Atlanta has been here for us.

That's in reference to George Floyd's final words. And tonight, seeing the tensions escalated in Atlanta. There, we are seeing groups gathered, thousands of them gathered outside of the CNN headquarters, we've seen they've smashed windows, they've been shoving police officers, even lighting some cars on fire there at the scene, and this is all after that viral video, of course, in Minneapolis on Monday went viral, that a video a police officer kneeling on an unarmed black man's neck until he eventually stopped breathing. And all of this is really here and around the country encouraging people and motivating them, they say, to come out of their quarantine and speak up and stand up together. Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp tweeted, encouraging people to exercise their constitutional right but to do so safely because of COVID-19 concerns. Here in New York, the crowd of protesters marched from downtown Manhattan to Brooklyn, thousands surrounding the Barclays Center, nearby stores and side streets. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio's urging protesters to direct their anger not at police, the men and women at the NYPD, but at elected leaders. While the gatherings tonight so far have been relatively peaceful, we have seen some changes just within the last 30 minutes or so. We're seeing more police officers there in Brooklyn than we have throughout the day, also brought in those buses in to be able to haul away basically anyone who gets out of control. Again, we haven't seen that many arrest today, but we will see following this -- Sean."

Bill, the latest in L.A. It's still early out there. BILL MELUGIN, FOX-11 LOS ANGELES REPORTER: Yes, Sean. Good evening. I can tell you here in Los Angeles, we are bracing for what could be a lengthy weekend of protests. There was one under way as I speak right now, several blocks away protesters trying to get onto a busy freeway here in downtown L.A. There is a line of police officers trying to stop them, several other protests already scheduled for tomorrow. But here in L.A., everything started on Wednesday really. If we can pull up some video, this is when those protesters successfully did get onto the 101 Freeway in downtown L.A.., this was in the middle of rush hour. They got onto all lanes of traffic blocking all traffic on both sides of the freeway. California Highway Patrol, a couple of cruiser stopped by to break it up and they were severely outnumbered. And you could take a look at what happened, the protesters immediately swarmed those CHP cruisers, attacking them, kicking them, taking skateboards and throwing them through the windshield of these cruisers. One man jumped unto the hood of the CHP cruiser, the car took off, he fell off and split his head open. And that turned into a big media ordeal out here in Los Angeles. But again, protests underway here in Los Angeles tonight, very early in the evening, just behind me here at LAPD headquarters. This is where they've got all their metal barricades set up out front. They've got riot police standing out in front guarding because their building was tagged and vandalized in recent nights. For the most part, the protests here in Los Angeles have been peaceful. However, there have been some bad actors that have infiltrated these protests, have started throwing things at officers, have started attacking their vehicles and vandalizing buildings. And for that reason, LAPD police chief Michael Moore put out a statement essentially telling the protesters, look, we hear you, we're going to let you protest, we're going to protect your right to do so, we understand why you were angry. However, we are drawing the line when it comes to officer safety and public safety. They say if they see anybody being attacked, any buildings being vandalized, they're going to step it up and those people will be arrested -- Sean."

Courtney Godfrey in Minneapolis tonight for us reporting there. We just spoke with Mike Tobin. Courtney, what is going on where you are? COURTNEY GODFREY, FOX 9 MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL REPORTER: Yes. Hey, Sean, we are out here in Minneapolis. Probably about 15 minutes ago, the state patrol and the National Guard, they told the protesters to back up, and if they didn't, they were going to start arresting. Shortly after that, they started firing tear gas which the protesters then threw back. I will tell you, one of our private security that's with us here today, he served in Iraq and he told me he never thought that he would see a scene like he saw in Iraq here at home. The protesters now have moved closer, so the street was closed off, Sean. The street was completely closed off and the National Guard retreated, and now everybody has moved in on Lake Street. Now, this is the street that was completely destroyed, mostly immigrant run businesses on the street. Now, it's opened up again to protesters like we saw the first two nights. Now, that curfew just going into effect a short while ago clearly the state patrol is saying they are going to enforce that curfew. What will happen next, we just don't know, but these protesters out here, they have come with jugs of milk, they have come with the attitude that they will be out there and they are going to stay out here. They say they want those three other officers arrested and they will protest and they will riot until that happens."

This is not -- this is -- in a case, there is not Republican/Democrat disagreement here. Liberal/conservative disagreement. There is universal condemnation of that eight-minute video of the knee pushing Mr. Floyd's head right into the pavement. Here is the county attorney discussing the charges earlier today. Let's take a look."

      "utterance": "Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is in custody. He has been charged with third-degree murder. We are in the process of continuing to review the evidence. There may be subsequent charges later. This investigation is ongoing. We felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator. I must say that this case has moved with extraordinary speed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Four days, to be exact. To explain, third-degree murder is commonly known as depraved heart murder. It means that the officer is charged with acting in a depraved mind, with a reckless disregard for human life. Under Minnesota law, that is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. First-degree murder so you understand and remember, this is eventually going to go before a jury of 12 individuals with a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. First-degree murder would require intent and premeditation. That tape does not give us any premeditation evidence or intent for that matter. A second degree would require intent but not the premeditation. Again, a high standard based on the take according to all the lawyers I have talked to. The standard for a conviction, remember, criminal trial, beyond a reasonable doubt. Twelve jurors must agree. Can you prove first degree murder? Well, and get a conviction based on the evidence we have now? Can you do it with second-degree murder? You would need more evidence. In my opinion, many independent lawyers I've talked to than just the tape we have seen so far, well, there might be incriminating evidence that we don't know about yet. Now, I also want to be very clear there's a big difference between a riot and a peaceful protest. Apparently, my so-called friends in the mob and the media, they are having a very hard time making a distinction. There is a big difference between peaceful marching, honoring Mr. Floyd's life, demanding justice, and burning down buildings, destroying businesses, looting, breaking, stealing and advocating for violence. The country is pretty much in universal agreement on the videotape and the death of George Floyd and about how outrageous it looks and is. It is an abuse of power for law enforcement to the highest degree. We need accountability and justice because what makes this case so unique is the amount of standard running time, different angles and tape evidence for extended periods. You don't see resistance anywhere, yet we see the officer pushing down Mr. Floyd's neck for eight-plus solid minutes. Went on for seven minutes, 55 seconds tape, and it was happening before the camera started rolling. It is chilling. It's shaking America, and the American people to its core. Remember, the president, he took the lead on this from day one. He ordered the FBI, the DOJ, to conduct a full investigation. He made it clear this would be a top priority. He wanted this investigation expedited, and he said to the people, justice will be served, and reach out to the family, and apparently spoke to them earlier today."

It looks like perhaps, well, they are looking up the meaning things are being thrown at them by those people. By the way, that's not peaceful protesting. That would be called rioting. I never thought in my life that I watch a police precinct overtaken, destroyed like what we saw last night. We are all watching this unfold last night, at least tonight, we see a police presence. Last night I'm thinking, OK, where the police? Where's the National Guard that have been called up? Over 170 businesses, windows smashed, some of them burned, two dozen destroyed, it puts an entire community of innocent people and innocent law enforcement at risk here. And also, you're destroying the entire community. You're taking away jobs when we are living in a time where we need every job, as we now open the country hopefully safely. Here's a bigger question, why are there people on the left in the mob and the media, well, celebrities, they've seemed to be encouraging the violence?

There is not peaceful protesting by many in this crowd. Far left filmmaker Michael Moore writing, quote, good citizens burning down the evil police precinct of Minnesota after all police were out and safe. Oh, I'm glad you know that, Michael.

And not only that, over at fake news CNN, they actually are comparing a detention of a CNN crew last night to George Floyd's death, prompting a very strong chorus, I think justified, of backlash. By the way, and I believe in freedom of the press, but comparing that to the death of this man is just the typical we get from fake news CNN. And why the media mob be downplaying these acts of violence that we are seeing with our own eyes in Minnesota. Burning down buildings is not about protesting what happened to George Floyd and his death, it doesn't honor his memory. These are agitators exploiting a crisis, sowing more discord, hate, division and putting lives at risk. Look at your screen. Open your eyes, those of you in the psychotic media mob. By the way, we now look at pictures in Brooklyn, New York, and now, Barack Obama's weighing in with remarks that frankly are not particularly helpful, especially considering his history of other reckless remarks when it comes to police and the race. And you might remember Ferguson, hands up, don't shoot. Yes, remember, that didn't work out the way the mob and the media were telling people then, because there were many eyewitnesses at the end of that case that actually confirmed Officer Darrell Wilson story about Michael Brown. Remember. He said in part, it's natural for us to wish for life to get back to normal, he said, as the pandemic, economic crisis upend everything around us, but we have to remember, for millions of Americans to be treated differently on account of race is tragically, painfully, maddeningly normal. Obama might also want a reminder about the Cambridge police acting stupidly, and the Trayvon Martin case ended up being the eyewitness. Ferguson, Baltimore, his comments by his own attorney general that were cowards in America on the issue of race. Now, we are in agreement, George Floyd's death is tragic, unacceptable. What's also unacceptable is what we are now seeing happening in cities all across the country. That's not acceptable -- the destruction of businesses, workers who are already struggling trying to restore order. It's time for the police to do their job.

There is universal acceptance that the murder of George Floyd was wrong. We agree with that. I am disappointed, shocked that there has been no Democratic lawmakers the last 72 hours who have focused on the criminal activity of these individuals who are not protesting. These are criminals, and they -- and they are breaking the law, using the guise of caring about George Floyd. It's not happening. And I encourage all of you Democratic lawmakers, all you lawmakers, to stand up and criticize these criminals. I have tremendous credibility as a civil rights attorney. I agree with Sean Hannity. I thank the president for spending prompt action of giving the attorney general involved in this and the county district attorney for filing charges. But what cannot happen is this Democratic silence -- and let me just tell you the truth why, because these Democratic lawmakers do not want to alienate black voters. I've got news for you, you're alienating me. I'm a black voter and you have lost me and doing something about these criminals."

The premise is that there's a systemic, structural, institutional racism by the cops against black people, and the evidence is to the contrary. The CDC has been in the news recently, they did a study and they found out over the last 45 years, police shootings and killings of blacks have declined 75 percent while the shootings of whites have flat-lined. In fact, an officer is 18-point times more likely to be shot by a black man than an unarmed black man to be killed by a cop. When this happens, it is rare. We should deal with them on a case-by-case basis and not act as if this is some sort of reflection of how cops are all across America. They've never been better trained or educated, they've never been trained in more de-escalation tactics than ever. The police department is not an institutionalized racist department, and that's what's causing all these people to do it."

There's no reason to believe that justice will not be served. The cops are fired right away. The main cop has been arrested and they're still rioting.

That it's rioters now even taking over the police precinct. How in the world do you let rioters take over a police station? Why didn't the city's Democratic mayor and governor do anything about this? They literally backed away. Anyway, we are now checking in. We'll go back to Mike Tobin in a second. But, first, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, you dealt with some tough days in New York City, your years as mayor with all of this.

You just didn't riot -- under me, Bratton, Safir, and Bernie Kerik. I'm sorry. They never even tried. So, what -- what should happen here -- what should happen here is somebody should take over. Progressive Democrats are incapable of keeping their people safe because they have criminal family policies that are pathetic, that are dangerous, and now, we are seeing the results are only there, but watch the cities that start burning. They are all going to be run by so- called progressive, idiot Democrats who let criminals out of jail, who set bail for murderers and who encourage this kind of thing. Giving up a police precinct, the mayor should resign. Telling police officers to flee a precinct, he should resign and be replaced by somebody who can protect his people. The governor should resign, because he's had four days to protect his people. He's not doing it. This is about protecting people's property and protecting people's lives. One man has died already. How many more are going to die before somebody starts to protect the people of Minnesota, Minneapolis, the people of Atlanta, the people of New York? De Blasio is just as incapable of doing it."

And, right, George Floyd's memory is what matters here, Breonna Mitchell, you know, Ahmaud. All of those things that have happened that put forth a good conversation and because you can have right now this issue to move the ball forward, we're missing that opportunity because all of this -- the violence that's going on across the country. I hope that it ends right. But let me say something else, Sean. We've learned some lessons from Ferguson, and when you organize the protests, meaning set up barriers, right, make them move along, put them in a designated area. There are big lessons.

So, Sean, it's kind of weird because with quarantine and everything, I'm so used to being in the midst of these protests, on the ground reporting, it's kind of weird not being there with them. But I have so many sources on the ground and they tell me it's the same thing that happened with Ferguson and Baltimore. What happens in many of these cases, that they are either professional paid protesters, Antifa, people that are outside of the community that comment and disrupt it. If you don't believe me, just look at the reports in Ferguson after everything was said and done. Most of the IDs were people, 70 percent of them, were from outside of the city. So they don't care about burning down the city because they don't have to deal with the repercussions afterwards, which is sad because this was the first time I think in this country where you had a universal agreement between liberals, conservatives, and libertarians like me that have been screaming forever about civil liberties, and this moment is being ruined by people that have their own personal agenda, and this is a failure of leadership. I saw the governor's press conference today, and I could not believe that he admitted that he was not prepared. He called the National Guard last night after they did no prep work. Now, we are talking about Wednesday, the city was on fire. You would think they would have some strategy session with the state police and National Guard, but no, they didn't do that. They allowed it to happen again on Thursday night. And what we are seeing right now is because of the lack of preparation and coordination, it may happen again tonight."

      "utterance": "Lawrence Jones, thank you. Daryl Parks, thank you. We know -- and by the way, Mayor de Blasio, where are you? Where is your police department? Governor Cuomo, where are you? The governor in Minnesota, where are you tonight? Where are you? Where are your police departments? Why did -- we now have reports in New York, police cars on fire, and it's a huge fire apparently that is existing in there. We have other reports breaking that protesters are blocking responding units while rioters attack the NYPD 88 precinct which was confirmed by Bernie Kerik. Down in Atlanta, apparently, some type of flash bang, some type of fireworks was thrown into the lobby of CNN headquarters, which just happened as well. And then you have the riot police, National Guard completely apparently abandoning the perimeter that they have set up earlier. We go back to Mike Tobin. He's on the ground. He's in Minneapolis when this is all happening. So they were supposed to have a curfew 57 minutes ago, Mike Tobin, and the crowds are going by the second, and I'm praying that we don't see a replay of last night. But I don't see the governor or the mayor or anyone they are learning their lesson from last night."

      "utterance": "Well, I can tell you what I know on the ground. What was seen as this crowd that was concentrated in the area of the third precinct is now spread out. So, it's possible what -- the technique here were their strategy was to give these protesters a line in the sand, get them geared up for a big conflict, then don't give them the big conflict because what's happening now is there going for a walk, their numbers are spreading out, looks like something is on fire off in the distance there, haven't got that far so can't tell you exactly what it is. But for the most part, what we are seeing now since we left that area of the third precinct is there just walking. I don't see any destruction, a lot of horn honking and vulgarity and that sort of thing, but the destruction that we saw last night, widespread lighting on fires, not seeing it, Sean. So quite possibly, the idea was Lucy kicking -- Lucy and Charlie with the football come and give him the football, take it away, let all the tension dissipate on its own. Quite possibly, that's what we are seeing materialize here, Sean."
