Can't they watch this woman's performance on \"The Daily Show\"? What is fascinating, Laura, what Juan missed is that 95 percent of these jokes were in better Republicans. She did not spread it around. She just targeted mostly women. Sixty seven minutes straight were vile, repulsive jokes aimed -- and they weren't jokes. They were attacks aimed at women.

Kennard is right. It will take a long time to prove their objectivity after this heinous display. The fact that the Correspondents Association is now talking about reformatting their dinner, rather than just doing what they need to do, which is soul-searching, about bias and the fact that it exists, just demonstrates the problem anew.

They are an industry in decline and they are in decline because half of America, the conservative half, does not trust them. Events like this just make it worse and the press still doesn't understand how bad last night was.

They have to see just how vulgar and low it was to understand how far we've sunk with the media and the so-called defense of the First Amendment. The double standard here is glaring for anyone who wants to see it, about the treatment of women, the \"Me Too Movement,\" \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" all of that. LEE HABEEB, HOST, \"OUR AMERICAN STORIES\": You know, what's funny, Laura, is for the last few weeks we've heard the press excoriated for lack of vetting by the White House. They didn't do a proper job with the Veterans Affairs gentleman who was ultimately dismissed and yet they could not vet this comedian? Don't they have YouTube? Don't they have Google? Can't they watch this woman's performance on \"The Daily Show\"? What is fascinating, Laura, what Juan missed is that 95 percent of these jokes were in better Republicans. She did not spread it around. She just targeted mostly women. Sixty seven minutes straight were vile, repulsive jokes aimed -- and they weren't jokes. They were attacks aimed at women. These weren't just jokes. It was like a public shaming. It was just disgraceful. To listen to the audience' laugh, and we wish we could see who was laughing and at what, because these jokes were disgraceful, and the laughs continued. and they continued. On the key here, Laura, there was a winner here. They were two winners. One was a comedian because my goodness, she's going to get a really big deal with HBO.

I think the Democrats tend to always take it too far. They go too far to the left and they end up offending people who might not even be all that political, but they find this gross.

Republicans don't go, elected officials don't go, staff don't go. Certainly, President Trump won't go. I remember when I did used to go to the dinner and the humor actually was pretty good back then, this was 15 years ago. It wasn't as cutting or nasty. Even then, it had a red carpet, Hollywood celebrities, preparties, post parties, how much on earth did they pay this comedian for this? At a time when newsrooms are going broke and laying people off, how much did they lay out for all of the entertainment, the lavishness? This is not what the press is supposed to be about. That is why the prices distancing themselves, especially from the blue-collar workers who elected Donald Trump, people and the Democrats, and the press never saw their story prior to 2016.

This is from October, last year. \"The liberal world order with its foundation in multilateralism, its global norms and values, its open societies and markets, is in danger. Donald Trump is the first U.S. president since World War II to fundamentally question the ideas and institutions of the liberal international order.\" And Ric, I would say about that, yes, he is, and yes, he's right, because America needs to focus on keeping ourselves strong and helping our allies, but the multilateralism sometimes only goes so far."

You look at agencies, multilateral agencies like the U.N. or NATO, and we have paid a significant amount, and I think it is the right question to say, are we getting enough? Is there enough U.S. leadership? And that is exactly what President Trump brought to the table with Angela Merkel. But I do have to say this, Laura. When it was all done, when we were all finished with the press conference, the president took the chancellor up to the residence with the vice president and myself and gave a personal tour of the vice president -- of the residence, the presidential residence at the White House. That was the first time that the chancellor had been up there. It was shocking to hear that she had never been able to see the Lincoln Bedroom, never been able to see the Gettysburg Address.

Victor Yanez agreed to cooperate with prosecutors two years ago after he was allegedly found with counterfeit prescription labels. But that didn't slow him down. Yanez was charged with marijuana possession and speeding last September, and when officers raided his girlfriend's luxury condo two weeks later, they say he was brandishing an AK-47. Although Yanez surrendered peacefully, officers say they found more than 2,200 grams of marijuana, more than 1,000 grams of the club drug molly, and more than 100 counterfeit prescription labels. Let's bring in someone who knows all the sordid details, \"Miami Herald\" reporter David Ovalle. David, great to see you. This is a wild story. I read this this morning, very early. And it does seem like it is something out of \"Scarface.\" Tell me about this lovely gentleman. DAVID OVALLE, REPORTER, \"THE MIAMI HERALD\": It is certainly something out of Miami, 2018. We've had a lot of these cases of suspected drug dealers and convicted drug dealers who are younger folks. These are not the stock and trade cocaine toughs from the cocaine cowboy days of the 1980s, but these are younger people who are tech savvy, who know how to order drugs from China, from the Internet, from the dark web, people who know how to get marijuana from states where it's legal, and also know how to sell prescription strength cough syrup to a lot of the club scene down here. So it is sort of a new breed of drug dealers in Miami. It is not to say that the old cocaine days of the past are gone by any means --"

At the \"Miami Herald\" we did a series a couple of years ago called \"Pipeline China\" where we chronicled all the different club drugs and the fentanyl coming over from China, it's easy as going on the internet. And we ha college students, we had veterans, we had strippers, we had all these people that were involved in bringing these drugs over to Miami, making it one of the largest synthetic drug capitals in the country.
