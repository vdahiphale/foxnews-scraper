      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. If you think about it, it turns out that revolutions cover a multitude of sins. Once every conversation in your country turns political, only the politicians benefit from it. In a normal moment, the people in charge would be in deep trouble right now, the rest of us might be asking the hard questions about why things seem to be falling apart at the most basic level.  Why our streets are filthy? Why violent crime is rising? Why nothing seems to work?  We pay a lot to keep the society functioning, all of us of all parties, and suddenly we're not getting a lot in return for that. It's not a very good deal.  But in the age of BLM, our leaders don't have to answer for this. They just give speeches about social justice and they're insulated from all criticism. If you persist in bothering them about their incompetence, they'll have you arrested for hate crimes. So revolution is the best thing that ever happened to our political class.  You see that with perfect clarity in New York City. Just a few months ago, Bill de Blasio was a national joke. Not anymore. Now de Blasio is his generation's Al Sharpton. He is a protest leader fighting in the streets for Civil Rights. The good news is de Blasio no longer has even to pretend to run New York City. And he is not. His public schools, for example, are failing.  In New York, which is the biggest school system in the country, fewer than half the students are proficient in English and Math. That is a disaster, most of all, for the students themselves. Why is that happening? Why are the schools failing?   City officials don't want to have that conversation. Acknowledging there's a massive problem might require them to do something to fix it. Their donors and the teachers unions oppose change of any kind. Unless, of course it's a raise. Now leaders in New York don't have to address this, they can ignore their failing schools. Instead of helping to kids to learn, the city can just blame racism and call it a day. That may seem like a weird strategy, kind of a strange explanation in New York -- racism -- because the school population in New York is fully 84 percent nonwhite, so not that many white kids to blame. But that has not stopped the Chancellor of the school system. He recently issued a statement pledging his commitment to anti-racism and to quote, \"work every day to undo these systems of injustice.\"   You'll notice the Chancellor was not more specific than that. He didn't specify which systems of injustice he was talking about, or how they work, and maybe that's because the kids with the highest test scores in New York City are not white. They're Asian. Asian students score far higher than any other ethnic group in New York City, not just higher scores in Math, but also higher scores in English proficiency. And that seems odd. So many of these students come from poor immigrant families where no one at home speaks English. So at first glance, these kids don't seem to have much privilege. So, how are they so successful? Well, racism, obviously. There's no other possible explanation for disparate test scores, we're told that every day.  But it must be a very stealthy kind of racism they're practicing. Indeed, this is an especially diabolical strain of racism, one that helps nonwhite immigrant kids, most of all. It is a quote, \"System of injustice that allows penniless foreigners from faraway countries to arrive here with no language skills whatsoever and still shoot to the top of the academic ratings.\"   Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, what we're dealing with here is systemic racism at its most systemic. The mayor's wife is in charge of fixing problems like this. Mrs. de Blasio was the city's systemic racism czar, but in the end, she wasn't any more specific about the problem than the Chancellor of schools had been. She didn't explain how this kind of diabolical racism actually works.  What she did say, the one thing she was absolutely confident about is that white people are to blame.",

They were teaching my son and the students in his class which are primarily first and second generation immigrant students, that we are not equal, that in fact, white students have inherited a legacy of racism from their grandparents and parents, and that their grandparents and parents may not even be aware that they've inherited this legacy and passed it on.

And that's -- this is the common language of our schools today and it's what Bill de Blasio is pushing. It's what the schools are pushing. It is what we saw on the Community Education Council that you showed. And it's pretty common. It's what's being taught and it's being taught to the exclusion of American History.  It's being taught to the exclusion of the belief that we're all equal under the law, that we're all equal in the eyes of God.

It's not engendering equality, and it's not going to create an actual group of educated children.

But they don't understand that the mob is mainly for these people who are going after whatever online. I mean, not only is it by and large, just sort of leftwing nut jobs.

And as soon as you know that you can stand fast and stand strong in what you believe, if you're completely convinced you did nothing wrong. You know, recently in my case, I made a really funny joke intentionally to annoy two different groups of people, and it worked supremely well. But so, but if you kind of know -- if you believe in yourself and you can send -- now average people are never going to be prepared for this and they shouldn't have to be. But if enough people start standing up to the mob and refuse to bow down to them, then we start to win. You know, the biggest fear for many people is losing their jobs. And you know, a lot of corporations just want to avoid the headache. They don't really care. They want the easiest way out. So if we start convincing corporations and companies to just ignore it.

That's just days before Stone was expected to report to prison for the rest of his useful and expected life. His arrest and his trial were nakedly political. It was a setup. Stone posed no risk to law enforcement. He was a late middle aged man without a gun, and yet the F.B.I. swarmed his house in a pre-dawn raid, tipped off CNN, which was there to lovingly chronicle it and later lied about it. The presiding judge, a political activist called Amy Berman Jackson issued a gag order that prohibited Stone from defending himself in public or making a living. She bankrupted him as a result. Even though many public figures have faced no consequences for lying to Congress, Jim Clapper, for example, Stone was one of the few to face prison time. He would have faced more than three years again, essentially a life sentence. So again, Roger Stone's sentence has been commuted by the President. This is good news. Keep a sharp eye out for the ghouls out there, who will lecture you about how this is a violation of the rule of law, even as our most basic laws are ignored completely by the mob. They don't care about the law. They care about putting their political opponents in prison and tonight, they're not going to be able to, thank God.

We reported on this all the way back in February, we were probably the first to actually interview Dr. Andre Kalil, who is the lead investigator in remdesivir. This drug is a very clever drug by the way because it insinuates itself into COVID-19, into the SAR-COV-2 virus and the virus mistakes it for a building block. Meanwhile, the antiviral drug stops it from growing. And tonight, Gilead has announced that their data shows that it decreases the death rate in severely-ill patients by 60 percent in the hospitals, 60 percent, and improves the quality of life, it improves clinical outcomes. This is huge and they're coming up now with an inhaled version. The one that's out now is intravenous and the inhaled version may be able to be used much earlier. We're getting hundreds of thousands of doses through Health and Human Services. This is a real game changer. Very exciting news. The second news tonight is on the vaccine front, BioNTech, which is a vaccine manufacturer working together with our own Pfizer has come up with information that their first studies on what's called a messenger RNA vaccine, Tucker, this vaccine is also very clever. It's a genetic strand of material that teaches yourselves to make the spike protein that's on the virus and guess what happens next? That protein causes an immune response. You know, what the news is today? They have discovered that the immune response, the antibodies are greater than the amount of antibodies made by somebody recovering from COVID-19. In fact, my inside medical sources tell me that the kind of antibodies being made are neutralizing antibodies, the very kind you need to neutralize this virus. Next stop 30,000 people will be tested. BioNTech and Pfizer are predicting they're going to have a vaccine by the end of the year. This looks very, very promising, Tucker. Hats off to Dr. Kalil. Hats off to the vaccine scientists. In fact, I want to give a hats off to the whole idea of science, not politics, science, battling COVID-19 in the middle of a pandemic, and winning. What a sign of hope for the weekend -- Tucker.",

She knows that and she's still discarded it and this, that's called a hate crime defending your street against vandals, but tearing down a symbol that was put up against hate, that's somehow okay.

Like most places in this country, Melrose is a thoroughly multiracial town. All kinds of people live there. Most of them get along with each other because most Americans get along with each other. The city was telling its citizens, we care about all of you, and good for them. But apparently nobody had warned the mayor of Melrose about this. The mayor is a man called Mayor Paul Brodeur. Brodeur was outraged by the idea that Melrose would care about everyone. In Melrose, he insisted, only some lives matter. Everyone else can drop dead. Brodeur immediately issued a public apology for the existence of the sign and then ordered an investigation into how it got there. The police department promptly launched an investigation. So Brodeur doesn't care about all lives and he is not going to pretend that he does. Melrose, Mass is just that kind of town. So if you think about going there, you'd better check to see if you're on the approved care list before you visit. Otherwise, you can be certain they won't guarantee your safety in Melrose because they just don't care. Meanwhile, in California, the Governor, Gavin Newsom is planning to release another 8,000 prisoners this summer. They've done a lot of that, they're doing more. He says it's to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Many local jurisdictions in the state have already emptied their holding cells. Crime rates have soared nationally. We've seen a lot of it. Los Angeles alone released nearly 2,000 inmates in March. In May, the LA County Sheriff said inmates were deliberately trying to infect themselves with coronavirus. They wanted early release. They're not stupid. But none of that matters in California because crime doesn't matter to the people who run it. That's when the state is already has stopped enforcing many laws. They've seen a massive rise in organized shoplifting rings, theft, and other crimes. Of course they have. There are thousands of cases of coronavirus in California's prison system by the way. So, if you let all of these inmates out, will they infect everyone else? Of course, they will. But nobody seems to care. Who is benefiting from this? The people who run Boise, Idaho. They're laughing as everyone with a motor vehicle in the State of California loads up with their possessions and moves to Boise. Boise, this is for you. That's it for us. Have the best weekend.

      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Happy Friday. If you think about it, it turns out that revolutions cover a multitude of sins. Once every conversation in your country turns political, only the politicians benefit from it. In a normal moment, the people in charge would be in deep trouble right now, the rest of us might be asking the hard questions about why things seem to be falling apart at the most basic level. Why our streets are filthy? Why violent crime is rising? Why nothing seems to work? We pay a lot to keep the society functioning, all of us of all parties, and suddenly we're not getting a lot in return for that. It's not a very good deal. But in the age of BLM, our leaders don't have to answer for this. They just give speeches about social justice and they're insulated from all criticism. If you persist in bothering them about their incompetence, they'll have you arrested for hate crimes. So revolution is the best thing that ever happened to our political class. You see that with perfect clarity in New York City. Just a few months ago, Bill de Blasio was a national joke. Not anymore. Now de Blasio is his generation's Al Sharpton. He is a protest leader fighting in the streets for Civil Rights. The good news is de Blasio no longer has even to pretend to run New York City. And he is not. His public schools, for example, are failing. In New York, which is the biggest school system in the country, fewer than half the students are proficient in English and Math. That is a disaster, most of all, for the students themselves. Why is that happening? Why are the schools failing? City officials don't want to have that conversation. Acknowledging there's a massive problem might require them to do something to fix it. Their donors and the teachers unions oppose change of any kind. Unless, of course it's a raise. Now leaders in New York don't have to address this, they can ignore their failing schools. Instead of helping to kids to learn, the city can just blame racism and call it a day. That may seem like a weird strategy, kind of a strange explanation in New York -- racism -- because the school population in New York is fully 84 percent nonwhite, so not that many white kids to blame. But that has not stopped the Chancellor of the school system. He recently issued a statement pledging his commitment to anti-racism and to quote, \"work every day to undo these systems of injustice.\" You'll notice the Chancellor was not more specific than that. He didn't specify which systems of injustice he was talking about, or how they work, and maybe that's because the kids with the highest test scores in New York City are not white. They're Asian. Asian students score far higher than any other ethnic group in New York City, not just higher scores in Math, but also higher scores in English proficiency. And that seems odd. So many of these students come from poor immigrant families where no one at home speaks English. So at first glance, these kids don't seem to have much privilege. So, how are they so successful? Well, racism, obviously. There's no other possible explanation for disparate test scores, we're told that every day. But it must be a very stealthy kind of racism they're practicing. Indeed, this is an especially diabolical strain of racism, one that helps nonwhite immigrant kids, most of all. It is a quote, \"System of injustice that allows penniless foreigners from faraway countries to arrive here with no language skills whatsoever and still shoot to the top of the academic ratings.\" Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, what we're dealing with here is systemic racism at its most systemic. The mayor's wife is in charge of fixing problems like this. Mrs. de Blasio was the city's systemic racism czar, but in the end, she wasn't any more specific about the problem than the Chancellor of schools had been. She didn't explain how this kind of diabolical racism actually works. What she did say, the one thing she was absolutely confident about is that white people are to blame."

ROBIN DIANGELO, AUTHOR, \"WHITE FRAGILITY\": I'll never forget asking a group, okay, so what if you could just give us feedback on our inevitable and often unaware racist assumptions and behaviors and I'll never forget this black man raising his hand and saying, \"It would be revolutionary.\" Revolutionary that we would receive the feedback with grace, reflect and seek to change our behavior.

And what was really interesting to me is that with lessons in anti-racism, they were teaching bias where perhaps none had existed before. They were teaching my son and the students in his class which are primarily first and second generation immigrant students, that we are not equal, that in fact, white students have inherited a legacy of racism from their grandparents and parents, and that their grandparents and parents may not even be aware that they've inherited this legacy and passed it on.

If they did this to I don't know, gay kids or kids of any -- Filipino kids, there would immediately be a government response. We'd shut the school down. You're not allowed to do that. Why is this allowed to happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMMONS",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's allowed to happen because critical race theory is incredibly pervasive in the American educational system. The teachers who teach the kids in schools have studied critical race theory. They've gone through excessive anti-racist and anti-bias training and they think that this is all very normal to talk about how black children should primarily be pitied for the suffering that has come to them at the hands of, you know, the white oppressors, and that white students are primarily oppressors. And that's -- this is the common language of our schools today and it's what Bill de Blasio is pushing. It's what the schools are pushing. It is what we saw on the Community Education Council that you showed. And it's pretty common. It's what's being taught and it's being taught to the exclusion of American History. It's being taught to the exclusion of the belief that we're all equal under the law, that we're all equal in the eyes of God. And, you know, really, it's very un-American to teach this kind of bias, to teach racism where perhaps none existed before."

And I think that parents need to understand that pulling their kids out of school and doing homeschool and things like that might be great for their own kids. But it's not going to be great for the future of American students and the future of America's leaders. So parents need to get involved in their public school district, and they need to speak up and they need to say, you know, the truth, which is that anti-racism, the way that it's currently being taught and the way that it's currently being indoctrinated into America's students from very low grades -- from elementary school on up -- is not American. It's not engendering equality, and it's not going to create an actual group of educated children. It's just going to create a bunch of people who feel bad for themselves and feel bad for others and are ashamed of who they are and where they came from. It's unacceptable."

But they don't understand that the mob is mainly for these people who are going after whatever online. I mean, not only is it by and large, just sort of leftwing nut jobs. But you know, it's not real life for these people. They live on their computer. It's a video game for them, you know. And as soon as you sort of realize that, it doesn't mean anything. And as soon as you know that you can stand fast and stand strong in what you believe, if you're completely convinced you did nothing wrong. You know, recently in my case, I made a really funny joke intentionally to annoy two different groups of people, and it worked supremely well. But so, but if you kind of know -- if you believe in yourself and you can send -- now average people are never going to be prepared for this and they shouldn't have to be. But if enough people start standing up to the mob and refuse to bow down to them, then we start to win. You know, the biggest fear for many people is losing their jobs. And you know, a lot of corporations just want to avoid the headache. They don't really care. They want the easiest way out. So if we start convincing corporations and companies to just ignore it. If everyone knows that if ever the mob comes through that it'll be over in maybe 36 hours, then I think that that starts to lessen their power."

However, why do people who are about to be fired for example, telling a joke make it so easy for their employers? Why not just go completely ballistic in HR and say, you know, it's going to be a bigger problem for you if you fire me. I'm not going willingly to my fate. I'm sorry, I'm resisting.

It's about the line of acceptable discourse. It's about what is socially acceptable to talk about and not talk about. And there's a very small class of people who have designed those rules, and they've done it for political power, for political reasons. They want to frighten everyone. But there's this idea called preference falsification that was written about a lot after the fall of the Soviet Union. And it's the idea that people -- and we saw this a lot in 2016 with election polls -- it's the idea that people will not publicly express what they truly feel if it's not socially acceptable."

      "utterance": "We have a Fox News Alert for you. We can confirm tonight that the President has commuted -- just commuted -- the sentence of Roger Stone. That's just days before Stone was expected to report to prison for the rest of his useful and expected life. His arrest and his trial were nakedly political. It was a setup. Stone posed no risk to law enforcement. He was a late middle aged man without a gun, and yet the F.B.I. swarmed his house in a pre-dawn raid, tipped off CNN, which was there to lovingly chronicle it and later lied about it. The presiding judge, a political activist called Amy Berman Jackson issued a gag order that prohibited Stone from defending himself in public or making a living. She bankrupted him as a result. Even though many public figures have faced no consequences for lying to Congress, Jim Clapper, for example, Stone was one of the few to face prison time. He would have faced more than three years again, essentially a life sentence. So again, Roger Stone's sentence has been commuted by the President. This is good news. Keep a sharp eye out for the ghouls out there, who will lecture you about how this is a violation of the rule of law, even as our most basic laws are ignored completely by the mob. They don't care about the law. They care about putting their political opponents in prison and tonight, they're not going to be able to, thank God. Joe Biden, little out of it, let's be completely honest. So, he is the perfect vessel for the activists in his party to transform the country. Details on that just ahead."

      "utterance": "When Joe Biden first arrived in the U.S. Senate, sounds like a joke, actually, many of you were not alive when that happened, but it was a long time ago. Gasoline cost 39 cents a gallon. The Sears Tower had just been built. The Miami Dolphins were good. He ran for President three times, committed quite a few gaffes. The years went on and over time, the life drained from Joe Biden like sands through an hourglass. And he became empty, in effect, an empty vessel -- perfect for the ideologues transforming his party to transform the country. Ned Ryun has watched all of it happen. He is the founder and CEO of American Majority. He joins us tonight. Ned, thanks so much for coming on. I think a lot of us have misread Joe Biden, because we knew Joe Biden. Anyone who has covered politics, who has been in Washington for on those, Joe Biden, most people including me have always kind of liked Joe Biden, because he's -- you know, he's a hugger, in a good way. But that Joe Biden is gone, and then you realize that's not a defect. That's the point. That's why the party likes him."

      "speaker": "NED RYUN, FOUNDER AND CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY",
      "utterance": "That is the point. I mean, he is -- literally Joe Biden is now the front man for the AOC-Sanders agenda. I mean, the Democratic establishment realized Sanders was never going to cut it as the nominee in a General Election. You put Biden on the front of it, but it's the Sanders agenda in the back. It's like lipstick on a pig, still the pig of socialism. And you realize Biden -- he is an empty vessel. He is a Trojan horse as Trump has described him. He is not writing his tweets. He's not writing whatever is in his teleprompter that he can barely even get out correctly. And it looks like AOC and Sanders are actually writing all of his policy because they're using him to achieve their ends. They want to get universal healthcare, including for illegals, amnesty, reparations, free college, the Green New Deal. And I will say this, Tucker, the thing that's scary about all of this, if they are given power; that is an agenda that is only accomplished by coercion. This is coercive socialism. But to bring it even closer to home, Biden says he wants to end shareholder capitalism, and I want people listening tonight to understand it. He is talking about you. If you have a 401(k) and a pension plan, if you're a blue collar worker, a union member, a retiree sitting in Florida living off your 401(k) or pension, a suburbanite with retirement plans, Joe Biden is saying, he is going to end shareholder capitalism. You are all shareholder capitalists. He's talking about destroying your dreams and ending your way of life."

And I tell people this Tucker, the thing that's pretty staggering about all of this, should Biden win, God forbid that he does, that we're not going to have free and fair elections again. I mean, you talked about amnesty last night for tens of million -- potentially tens of millions of illegal immigrants. You tack on universal mail-in ballots, free and fair elections are over and people have asked me, can we always say this is the most important election of our lifetime. I think you have to go back to 1860 to fully understand the implications of 2020. I mean, Donald Trump is the last bulwark for the Republic, and if he doesn't win, it's a descent to darkness."

There's a clip going around from an exchange he had on Telemundo in which he seems to say that the White House is suggesting that's not what he meant and that's not what he plans to do. Do you have clarity on that?"

It's the Buy America Executive Order that should have been signed three months ago. Coming into the elections, we are 16 weeks away. You should not be signing anything in any way that gives amnesty to anyone and those that are advising him to do such a thing, he needs to shut them out and follow his instincts. I have told him, he's got some of the best instincts in politics that I've seen in years. Shut those voices out. Follow your instincts. It's what helped him win in 2016 and will lead them to victory again in 2020, but only if he shuts those voices out."

And so you have a lot of people propagating China's narratives in this country, because it is politically expedient for them to do so in the short term, and of course, we are in a political season. But as she says, this is not an issue of politics, and it's very important that we listen to what she says, because it does corroborate much of what we know about what the World Health Organization and China were doing in that critical January period."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "You know, we don't know. I mean, there's two main theories, of course. One of them is this was a zoonotic transfer in the wild, from an animal to human. The other is that this was an accidental release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And I have to say that my view is the latter one, because most diseases in China originate and these coronavirus diseases originate in southern China. All of a sudden, we have one originating in the middle of China within 20 miles of China's P4 biosafety lab. That is extremely suspicious. We know that a Chinese Major General was put in charge of the lab sometime around March and I believe that she cleaned up the lab to prevent the world from knowing any evidence of what was going on."

    {
      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "Yes, what we're seeing is the World Health Organization covering up for China. They've now got two researchers in Beijing to prepare the way for a third W.H.O. mission to China, but they're only studying the zoonotic transfer. They're not going to Wuhan from what we can tell. They're not going to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. So really, this is an attempt to bolster China's narrative, which was built I think -- this narrative was built by China to really divert attention away from what it was doing in that biosafety lab."

      "speaker": "DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Tucker, this is good news for the weekend in the world of science against COVID. Let's start with remdesivir, the antiviral drug. We reported on this all the way back in February, we were probably the first to actually interview Dr. Andre Kalil, who is the lead investigator in remdesivir. This drug is a very clever drug by the way because it insinuates itself into COVID-19, into the SAR-COV-2 virus and the virus mistakes it for a building block. Meanwhile, the antiviral drug stops it from growing. And tonight, Gilead has announced that their data shows that it decreases the death rate in severely-ill patients by 60 percent in the hospitals, 60 percent, and improves the quality of life, it improves clinical outcomes. This is huge and they're coming up now with an inhaled version. The one that's out now is intravenous and the inhaled version may be able to be used much earlier. We're getting hundreds of thousands of doses through Health and Human Services. This is a real game changer. Very exciting news. The second news tonight is on the vaccine front, BioNTech, which is a vaccine manufacturer working together with our own Pfizer has come up with information that their first studies on what's called a messenger RNA vaccine, Tucker, this vaccine is also very clever. It's a genetic strand of material that teaches yourselves to make the spike protein that's on the virus and guess what happens next? That protein causes an immune response. You know, what the news is today? They have discovered that the immune response, the antibodies are greater than the amount of antibodies made by somebody recovering from COVID-19. In fact, my inside medical sources tell me that the kind of antibodies being made are neutralizing antibodies, the very kind you need to neutralize this virus. Next stop 30,000 people will be tested. BioNTech and Pfizer are predicting they're going to have a vaccine by the end of the year. This looks very, very promising, Tucker. Hats off to Dr. Kalil. Hats off to the vaccine scientists. In fact, I want to give a hats off to the whole idea of science, not politics, science, battling COVID-19 in the middle of a pandemic, and winning. What a sign of hope for the weekend -- Tucker."

He's the Senior Editor of \"The Federalist.\" We're happy to have him on with us tonight. Chris, thanks so much for coming on. Why should we care about statues being toppled? CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Because statues are always followed by people. Every time in history, Tucker, that we've seen statues taken down from ancient Rome to France where they started with symbols like a large empty prison and then they started attacking churches to here in America where they started with the statue of a Confederate soldier and quickly moved to some mob violence, to hanging statues in the streets, to point down our founders. Revolutionaries and mobs that go after the symbols of a civilization never just want to stop at a symbol. They're not just angry at a statue, they're angry at what it represents. What it represents is people, a civic society, this country, and they will not stop until real blood is spilled in a targeted way."

As you've talked about it numerous times, you go out -- you have a society that is willing to defend itself to build monuments. That's a society that believes in itself. A society that stops building monuments doesn't believe in itself anymore, and a society like ours led by people like Pelosi who actively cheer or watch as they are torn down, that society is on its death watch."

So it's not as if symbols don't matter to the left. They matter very, very much. How disingenuous is it for them to pretend they don't matter."

Columbus State was first celebrated after a mass lynching of Italian men by an angry mob in a race attack. That's when Columbus Day was a one off holiday. This country made a lot of progress against persecution of Italians, and celebrating Columbus as the person who discovered our country against great odds. The son of a weaver as Ronald Reagan pointed out when he dedicated the statue in 1980. She knows that and she's still discarded it and this, that's called a hate crime defending your street against vandals, but tearing down a symbol that was put up against hate, that's somehow okay.

A lot of them in Washington, D.C. who live in my neighborhood when they came to our neighborhood to tear down a statue of Lincoln and a freed man, the people hid in their homes. People were upset. A couple of neighbors came out, but that's where Congress and senators live, a lot of them. Well, they live behind big walled-in places, and they hope that they won't be hurt. Just like we saw in Seattle when the mayor said that going to her house, well, that was over the line or go into the U.S. Capitol, put state workers at risk. She wanted to hold the mob accountable for that. But physically attacking police officers, shooting people in the streets and trying to lynch business owners, she felt protected from that. It was distant. They're just praying that they'll be last and King Mob generally comes for everyone at the end."

Just like when we saw Italians defending the Columbus statue in Philadelphia, the mayor brought the full force of the law down on them. But feigned lynching and actual hangings from nooses of the statue we saw down in the south, and people being attacked, reporters being attacked, people we know being attacked. That's okay. Those are leaders that are afraid."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "The other day, a reassuring sign appeared on the streets of Melrose, Massachusetts, \"The safety of all lives matters,\" it read and that makes sense. Like most places in this country, Melrose is a thoroughly multiracial town. All kinds of people live there. Most of them get along with each other because most Americans get along with each other. The city was telling its citizens, we care about all of you, and good for them. But apparently nobody had warned the mayor of Melrose about this. The mayor is a man called Mayor Paul Brodeur. Brodeur was outraged by the idea that Melrose would care about everyone. In Melrose, he insisted, only some lives matter. Everyone else can drop dead. Brodeur immediately issued a public apology for the existence of the sign and then ordered an investigation into how it got there. The police department promptly launched an investigation. So Brodeur doesn't care about all lives and he is not going to pretend that he does. Melrose, Mass is just that kind of town. So if you think about going there, you'd better check to see if you're on the approved care list before you visit. Otherwise, you can be certain they won't guarantee your safety in Melrose because they just don't care. Meanwhile, in California, the Governor, Gavin Newsom is planning to release another 8,000 prisoners this summer. They've done a lot of that, they're doing more. He says it's to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Many local jurisdictions in the state have already emptied their holding cells. Crime rates have soared nationally. We've seen a lot of it. Los Angeles alone released nearly 2,000 inmates in March. In May, the LA County Sheriff said inmates were deliberately trying to infect themselves with coronavirus. They wanted early release. They're not stupid. But none of that matters in California because crime doesn't matter to the people who run it. That's when the state is already has stopped enforcing many laws. They've seen a massive rise in organized shoplifting rings, theft, and other crimes. Of course they have. There are thousands of cases of coronavirus in California's prison system by the way. So, if you let all of these inmates out, will they infect everyone else? Of course, they will. But nobody seems to care. Who is benefiting from this? The people who run Boise, Idaho. They're laughing as everyone with a motor vehicle in the State of California loads up with their possessions and moves to Boise. Boise, this is for you. That's it for us. Have the best weekend.
