Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"  And the Dow nearly 300-point surge evaporating as the news first hit the tape, as expected, the Fed hiking interest rates, not expected, some of the details after that announcement, which trigger more to come, and not as few as people thought.  It plans that we're building on the sell side, with the Fed chief talking and talking and talking, and that got investors worrying and worrying and worrying. And it got us thinking of this as a bear approaches a Florida home. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Oh, Neil, that was a perfect segue with the bears.   But like you said, you had the Fed that did allude to a cautious approach, but not cautious enough for investors, because you did see some drastic swings today, more than 600 points just on the Dow alone, seeing it close down 1.5 percent, like you mentioned, the Nasdaq also down over 2 percent, and the S&P 500 over a percentage-and-a-half. So you have these swings that constantly seem to be happening. But if you look at the intraday -- and we're going to bring that up again because I know you already discussed it -- you had the Fed already -- pretty much investors bake in the fact that there was going to be an interest rate hike. That was in the markets, why we saw some positive territory in the morning. Then you hit 2:00 p.m., the fact that there's two more hikes in 2019, a further hike proposed for 2020, and that's where you started to see the downward trend. Investors are parsing through the details. Then the Q&A with Jay Powell happened. So that was why the uptick went up.  And then later on, you saw it close down. Which sectors are we seeing some weakness across the board? You're seeing technology being hit the hardest, energy, followed by financials. The stocks that you're seeing on your screen now, biggest losers on the Dow, that would be intel, Nike, Apple. Look at that.   You can see Boeing down 2.6 percent, Amex down 2 percent. Want to talk about some of the winners, though, on the New York Stock Exchange. This would be GE, 5.1 percent. Reason being, there was a variable positive analyst report coming from Vertical Research, well- respected analyst. And he said that although the company's a little bit risky, there is some near-term liquidity. Therefore, he is rating GE as a buy.  You're also seeing a slight uptick with Verizon, just some green, when we're seeing so much red right now. I want to turn to Micron. Micron shares, let's -- oh, down 7.8 percent for the day. Reason being disappointing guidance coming from the company. And then let's look at the 10-year and the two-year spreads over here. We have been talking about this quite some time, the flattening of the yield curve. You can see it at 2.78 percent.  Part of the reason why we saw the financial sector get hit, because you're not gaining as much in the future when you're holding a 10-year bond, so down 4.3 basis points.  And then I want to end on oil, because this came up in the Q&A with Jay Powell, the fact that these inflationary concerns usually are triggered by an increase in oil. And look at that. We have oil at less than $50 a barrel. Yes, it's up a almost a buck today, but it's definitely off the highs that we saw in September, when it was above $75 U.S. a barrel -- Neil.",

      "sentences": "So, as Kristina pointed out here, everything was hunky-dory. The markets had expected this quarter-point hike in interest rates. What they didn't expect were some of the things that Jerome Powell said, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, afterwards, in which he oftentimes pooh-poohed whatever's going on in the markets and said, by and large -- not exactly word for word -- that he doesn't stress about the markets. Gary Kaltbaum was saying maybe he should. Quoting from Gary, a very, very good market read over the many decades I have known him, looking at trends that he thinks the Fed should pay attention to, because the markets are telling a story.  Quoting Gary here: \"Transports in a bear market are not telegraphing anything. Russell 2000, a collection of largely small stocks in a bear market, not telegraphing anything. Regional banks in a bear market not telegraphing anything. Oil prices crashing not telegraphing everything. Three-quarters of the S&P 500 in a bear market not telegraphing anything. Restaurants in a bear market, 10-year yield down to 2.77 percent not telegraphing anything.\"  You can see the trend that he's showing here, that the markets are doing all of this in an environment that the Fed chief, according to Gary, chooses to ignore. \"We have no problem with the raising of rates,\" Kaltbaum writes. \"We really don't have a problem with him saying they are looking to raise some more. The market will have a problem knowing that the Fed has absolutely no clue what the market's own action is telegraphing as of this second. And that is a worry.\"   To FBN's Deirdre Bolton on the fallout from this on a host of various things that you buy.",

    {
      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "Yes, Neil, I'm going to go back to that image that you brought in with the bear, because when the Fed raises rates, as it did, the prime rate goes higher.  And, as we know, banks set their lending rates on prime. It's a domino effect.  Let's go over the types of loans that are affected, so anything variable, basically, so credit cards. That's one way. Auto loans. Sometimes, auto dealers will make up for it. But brass tacks, it goes higher. Adjustable- rate mortgages also go higher. And then also if you're doing any work on your home, home equity lines of credit, they go higher. So borrowing becomes more expensive for all of us as individuals. Also gets more expensive for any kind of company that wants to borrow for any reason. So President Trump has spoken out, as we know, against rising rates. So love him or hate him, it's in part because of that dynamic. The Fed's interest rate increases do act to slow the economy.   I want to bring you back to that credit card example because this affects so many Americans. Average credit card rates right now, 17.6 percent. That's why, if you're a millennial, your parents just tell you to pay this off right away. But according to Bankrate, for a $10,000 credit card balance, a quarter-of-a-point hike, as we saw today, is likely to add $2 a month to the minimum monthly payments.  And that doesn't seem like a lot, but over 12 months, you keep carrying, it does add up. Now, on the flip side, with higher rates, savers are rewarded, because bank customers do see noticeably higher savings rates. The only trick about that is, it takes a little time to make its way through the system.  So this is, of course, what we have been talking about, what we have been seeing, the Federal Reserve's activity. And I think, Neil, the point today was that the Fed, while it said it was perhaps not going to be as aggressive as previously thought, it wasn't really as dovish as a lot of investors had thought.",

Traditionally, you wouldn't expect a reaction from the president or from the White House. But, as we know, the president has broken with this tradition.  For example, in just the last days, weeks and months leading into this, the president at one point said the Federal Reserve had gone crazy. He said that Jay Powell, that he wasn't happy with the job that the Fed chair was doing. Ahead of this interest rate increase just yesterday, the president also warned the Fed in a tweet that they shouldn't make another mistake, as he put it.  At his news conference just a little while ago, Powell was asked about all of this, about many of the president's comments, and he brushed aside the president's criticisms.",

I mean, we saw one of the biggest slides in the S&P 500 today that we have seen in this whole sell- off that started back in October. And here's what I don't get. Late in November, Fed Chairman Powell was talking at the New York Economic Club about being close to neutral, about having much more of, say, a dovish outlook with respect to what the Fed was going to do, as they, say, deliberate data that's come in since then, right?   So, going forward in November, he said, we're going to watch the data, we're going to be careful. Since then, as Gary Kaltbaum noted, as you wrote, as you read there that he wrote, which is, sentiment has fallen off. Business sentiment is falling off. Homebuilder sentiment is falling off. The market is falling off. Interest rates, by the way, have gone down over that period, telling the Fed that they need to back off. Yet they hike another interest rate hike today. So, to me, it doesn't make sense that Chairman Powell said he was going to get more dovish, and didn't. And it doesn't seem like they're watching the market or the data at all.",

And he reduced it down from three to two. So he's still out of touch with reality. I think that shook up the markets.  But, on the other hand, I think he gave a fair assessment, in that he's going to continue to hike. It's hard -- it's hard to say policy is tight right now, when you have sure rates still accommodative, below the neutral rate, and you have less than 4 percent unemployment. I mean, why in the world would you not continue to raise rates? I mean, understand people worried about yield curve inversion. But the Fed looks at the three-month, 10-year. They don't really care as much about the 5- 30, the 2-10, et cetera. And that's still holding up. I mean, we're far -- we're far away from like a real inversion.

What worries them is when it switches around and the short-term rates get higher than the longer-term rates, all but presaging a recession almost 100 percent of the time.  So that was fueling a lot of this as well. In the meantime, I told you how we might be avoiding a government shutdown. I stress might, because everyone has to go along.

Specifically, the lawsuit approaches and touches on the fact that not only did Facebook fail to protect users, but they also engaged in active deception, both with accessing the data, as well as what they did with the data. And that goes to the testimony before Congress that the 2011 agreement with the FTC was complied with. Furthermore, the A.G. is asking for not only an injunction, so to increase that policy of protecting data, but restitution costs and penalties. And it can be amended. So, in light of this regulatory information about Amazon and Bing and basically the fact that no one's data was protected outside of their permission, including with hardware companies like BlackBerry, Facebook is facing such a dark hole.

We begin with Kristina."

      "utterance": "Oh, Neil, that was a perfect segue with the bears. But like you said, you had the Fed that did allude to a cautious approach, but not cautious enough for investors, because you did see some drastic swings today, more than 600 points just on the Dow alone, seeing it close down 1.5 percent, like you mentioned, the Nasdaq also down over 2 percent, and the S&P 500 over a percentage-and-a-half. So you have these swings that constantly seem to be happening. But if you look at the intraday -- and we're going to bring that up again because I know you already discussed it -- you had the Fed already -- pretty much investors bake in the fact that there was going to be an interest rate hike. That was in the markets, why we saw some positive territory in the morning. Then you hit 2:00 p.m., the fact that there's two more hikes in 2019, a further hike proposed for 2020, and that's where you started to see the downward trend. Investors are parsing through the details. Then the Q&A with Jay Powell happened. So that was why the uptick went up. And then later on, you saw it close down. Which sectors are we seeing some weakness across the board? You're seeing technology being hit the hardest, energy, followed by financials. The stocks that you're seeing on your screen now, biggest losers on the Dow, that would be intel, Nike, Apple. Look at that. You can see Boeing down 2.6 percent, Amex down 2 percent. Want to talk about some of the winners, though, on the New York Stock Exchange. This would be GE, 5.1 percent. Reason being, there was a variable positive analyst report coming from Vertical Research, well- respected analyst. And he said that although the company's a little bit risky, there is some near-term liquidity. Therefore, he is rating GE as a buy. You're also seeing a slight uptick with Verizon, just some green, when we're seeing so much red right now. I want to turn to Micron. Micron shares, let's -- oh, down 7.8 percent for the day. Reason being disappointing guidance coming from the company. And then let's look at the 10-year and the two-year spreads over here. We have been talking about this quite some time, the flattening of the yield curve. You can see it at 2.78 percent. Part of the reason why we saw the financial sector get hit, because you're not gaining as much in the future when you're holding a 10-year bond, so down 4.3 basis points. And then I want to end on oil, because this came up in the Q&A with Jay Powell, the fact that these inflationary concerns usually are triggered by an increase in oil. And look at that. We have oil at less than $50 a barrel. Yes, it's up a almost a buck today, but it's definitely off the highs that we saw in September, when it was above $75 U.S. a barrel -- Neil."

What they didn't expect were some of the things that Jerome Powell said, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, afterwards, in which he oftentimes pooh-poohed whatever's going on in the markets and said, by and large -- not exactly word for word -- that he doesn't stress about the markets. Gary Kaltbaum was saying maybe he should. Quoting from Gary, a very, very good market read over the many decades I have known him, looking at trends that he thinks the Fed should pay attention to, because the markets are telling a story."

Restaurants in a bear market, 10-year yield down to 2.77 percent not telegraphing anything.\" You can see the trend that he's showing here, that the markets are doing all of this in an environment that the Fed chief, according to Gary, chooses to ignore. \"We have no problem with the raising of rates,\" Kaltbaum writes. \"We really don't have a problem with him saying they are looking to raise some more. The market will have a problem knowing that the Fed has absolutely no clue what the market's own action is telegraphing as of this second. And that is a worry.\" To FBN's Deirdre Bolton on the fallout from this on a host of various things that you buy."

    {
      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, I'm going to go back to that image that you brought in with the bear, because when the Fed raises rates, as it did, the prime rate goes higher. And, as we know, banks set their lending rates on prime. It's a domino effect. Let's go over the types of loans that are affected, so anything variable, basically, so credit cards. That's one way. Auto loans. Sometimes, auto dealers will make up for it. But brass tacks, it goes higher. Adjustable- rate mortgages also go higher. And then also if you're doing any work on your home, home equity lines of credit, they go higher. So borrowing becomes more expensive for all of us as individuals. Also gets more expensive for any kind of company that wants to borrow for any reason. So President Trump has spoken out, as we know, against rising rates. So love him or hate him, it's in part because of that dynamic. The Fed's interest rate increases do act to slow the economy. I want to bring you back to that credit card example because this affects so many Americans. Average credit card rates right now, 17.6 percent. That's why, if you're a millennial, your parents just tell you to pay this off right away. But according to Bankrate, for a $10,000 credit card balance, a quarter-of-a-point hike, as we saw today, is likely to add $2 a month to the minimum monthly payments. And that doesn't seem like a lot, but over 12 months, you keep carrying, it does add up. Now, on the flip side, with higher rates, savers are rewarded, because bank customers do see noticeably higher savings rates. The only trick about that is, it takes a little time to make its way through the system. So this is, of course, what we have been talking about, what we have been seeing, the Federal Reserve's activity. And I think, Neil, the point today was that the Fed, while it said it was perhaps not going to be as aggressive as previously thought, it wasn't really as dovish as a lot of investors had thought."

Traditionally, you wouldn't expect a reaction from the president or from the White House. But, as we know, the president has broken with this tradition. For example, in just the last days, weeks and months leading into this, the president at one point said the Federal Reserve had gone crazy. He said that Jay Powell, that he wasn't happy with the job that the Fed chair was doing. Ahead of this interest rate increase just yesterday, the president also warned the Fed in a tweet that they shouldn't make another mistake, as he put it. At his news conference just a little while ago, Powell was asked about all of this, about many of the president's comments, and he brushed aside the president's criticisms."

Did the Fed get it right this time? Or did the president? Remember, the president was highly critical of a move right now, as Blake pointed out, that inflation was very low, the dollar was very strong, no need to move. The Fed did move. The markets were OK with that move. It was the words that the Fed chairman was speaking that telegraph that there's only a slight change in forward policy. Market watcher Larry Shover says that the Fed is on the right track. Scott Martin disagrees. Scott, what do you not like here?"

      "speaker": "SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT",
      "utterance": "I don't like market's reaction, Neil. I mean, front and center is the reaction today. I mean, we saw one of the biggest slides in the S&P 500 today that we have seen in this whole sell- off that started back in October. And here's what I don't get. Late in November, Fed Chairman Powell was talking at the New York Economic Club about being close to neutral, about having much more of, say, a dovish outlook with respect to what the Fed was going to do, as they, say, deliberate data that's come in since then, right? So, going forward in November, he said, we're going to watch the data, we're going to be careful. Since then, as Gary Kaltbaum noted, as you wrote, as you read there that he wrote, which is, sentiment has fallen off. Business sentiment is falling off. Homebuilder sentiment is falling off. The market is falling off. Interest rates, by the way, have gone down over that period, telling the Fed that they need to back off. Yet they hike another interest rate hike today. So, to me, it doesn't make sense that Chairman Powell said he was going to get more dovish, and didn't. And it doesn't seem like they're watching the market or the data at all."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, Larry, if I read or tried to read between the lines -- you guys are much better at that than I am -- from the Federal Reserve chairman, it's that: I'm going to still be hiking next year, just maybe one less hike than was out there. And I think people who respond to that say, really? Or what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY SHOVER, SOLUTIONS FUNDS GROUP",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I think they responded a couple of ways. And one is that the market responded that implied rate hikes for next year is less than half, meaning less than one. And he reduced it down from three to two. So he's still out of touch with reality. I think that shook up the markets. But, on the other hand, I think he gave a fair assessment, in that he's going to continue to hike. It's hard -- it's hard to say policy is tight right now, when you have sure rates still accommodative, below the neutral rate, and you have less than 4 percent unemployment. I mean, why in the world would you not continue to raise rates? I mean, understand people worried about yield curve inversion. But the Fed looks at the three-month, 10-year. They don't really care as much about the 5- 30, the 2-10, et cetera. And that's still holding up. I mean, we're far -- we're far away from like a real inversion. And inversions with real rates where they are today is much different than before."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. All right, gentlemen, I'm very sorry for truncating this. We are following this and other news developments, including progress on a government shutdown that looks like it won't happen for the time being. But, again, you heard Larry refer to this yield curve inversion, the tightening between short-term rates going all the way up to 10-year note. They're almost even now. What worries them is when it switches around and the short-term rates get higher than the longer-term rates, all but presaging a recession almost 100 percent of the time. So that was fueling a lot of this as well. In the meantime, I told you how we might be avoiding a government shutdown. I stress might, because everyone has to go along. No word from the president whether he will. The Democratic incoming House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, who is all but here to say he has no choice, he's next."

If Democrats said no, he was going to shut down the government. That doesn't look like the case right now. It's not that simple. It's a quick extension that decides this issue sometime in February, or punts it to that long. Let's get the read from House Majority Leader Democrat Steny Hoyer. Congressman, very good to have you.

The fact is, Neil, as you know, we have agreement on 95, 96 percent of the seven remaining appropriation bills. We ought to pass that agreement and just leave for later, if necessary, the big disagreement we have over the wall. I think McCain (sic) knows that he's not going to be able to pass the wall through the Senate, and he's certainly not going to be able to pass the wall through the House next year. We're for border security. We want to strengthen border security. We have done that in the -- in the homeland security bill. But it's not the wall, from the president's standpoint. So we're just kicking the ball down the road. And we're going to have a fight, a disagreement and more doubt about whether or not we're going to keep government operating in an effective, efficient manner on February.

We ought to leave that, if we can't decide that. That's what compromise is about. You figure out, what can we agree on. Well, we have agreed upon 95, 96 percent. We ought to pass that. And that which we can't agree on, we will have to argue about and see if we can reach agreement later on. But what we have done is simply kick the whole can down the road, and without a solution, and we're just delaying the fight until February, and the doubt, I might say, until February.

I think Congressman Hoyer is correct that Mitch McConnell wouldn't be bringing it to the floor if he didn't have some confidence that this is going to pass. And I do know the president does not want to shut the government down, but he also doesn't want to keep continually pushing forward this immigration problem that we have. You know, asylum claims are up 1700 percent in the past 18 years -- in the past eight years. You have 90 percent more people trying to cross illegally over the border right now than you did a year ago. You have 12,000 kids that have come unaccompanied that are under the care of HHS. I mean, this is a crisis. Democrats were very reasonable in 2013, when they all agreed to pass reasonable immigration reform. And now they won't come to the table. And the president is saying, enough is enough."

And let's let the Democrats really explain to the American people why they are not willing to deal with comprehensive -- comprehensive immigration reform. When they take the leadership, they're going to have to address this with their constituents. Everybody is seeing these caravans continuing to grow. We know this is a crisis. You know, Neil, the other thing is, there are 800,000 cases pending right now on the courts for asylum claims. We just do not have the judicial bandwidth, we do not have the agent bandwidth with our ICE agents to continue to have this influx of people coming into our country. It has to be solved. Why won't Democrats work on this? You know why? Because President Trump wants it. And that is just not good governance.

I think he's looking at other options besides getting this through Congress. And the president recognizes that the areas where we do have walls, where we actually do have physical borders, like Yuma, like El Paso, like San Diego, crossings are down 90 percent. It works."

And now we get revelations in a New York Times study, an investigation -- excuse me -- that says that is exactly what is going on. And it might have involved a lot of other players getting their hands on that information, including Amazon and Netflix, a host of others. Let's get the read from attorney Emily Compagno. How big a deal is this, Emily?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "It's a tremendous deal, Neil. And I want to point out as well the timing of the fact that the D.C.'s Circuit attorney general just filed lawsuit against Facebook. And here's why that's so important and relevant to the revelations that came from The New York Times yesterday. Specifically, the lawsuit approaches and touches on the fact that not only did Facebook fail to protect users, but they also engaged in active deception, both with accessing the data, as well as what they did with the data. And that goes to the testimony before Congress that the 2011 agreement with the FTC was complied with. Furthermore, the A.G. is asking for not only an injunction, so to increase that policy of protecting data, but restitution costs and penalties. And it can be amended. So, in light of this regulatory information about Amazon and Bing and basically the fact that no one's data was protected outside of their permission, including with hardware companies like BlackBerry, Facebook is facing such a dark hole. And know too that this lawsuit is the first effort by U.S. regulators to actually penalize them. So this is where it becomes real."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. So when Zuckerberg was up on the Hill, testifying about this, and a number of congressmen raised this back and forth, are you doing this, no, no, no, no, and I know Netflix and Spotify and Amazon and Microsoft in variant ways, Emily, said that we were not part of this or whatever. So, I don't know their full statements of deniability. I do remember Zuckerberg denying that this kind of thing was happening at the time. Could he have been ignorant about it, or was he holding something back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "He can certainly argue an ignorance. But I will point out that there's a whole host of charges and allegations that can surface that aren't necessarily criminal when we talk about perjury and the like. And that has to do with investor fraud. That has to do with mismanagement. That has to do with faith in terms of a director in an operation of a business. So he could be facing, if he was ignorant, then an argument that he should have known, right? And that's letting investors and obviously users and consumers down as well. So, honestly, either way that he tries to defend it, he's not in a good position, especially as well that additional argument that, well, these second parties were extensions of Facebook, because we're hearing different comments and explanations by Facebook as to how it circumnavigated the policies that they put in place after the 2011 agreement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I'm just wondering. Obviously, we're not seeing a mass affection from Facebook by users, better than a billion worldwide, but it is giving those in Congress pause. And it's the one thing that's uniting both Republicans and Democrats, not only to initiate hearings, but to really watch this company closely. It's having a chilling effect as well on others with whom Facebook does business. Is all of this justified?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, in the interest of protecting consumers, it's certainly justified, because we have seen what happened when Facebook didn't comply with a policy set forth. And as a lawmaker said today, look, we don't want to have to regulate you, but we will, if we are finding out, which we did, that tens of millions of users' data was breached and accessed without consent, and then disseminated for profit, essentially. That's something that's inexcusable, and that's why there's three different U.S. agencies investigating them right now, FTC, SEC and the DOJ, and, again, in addition to this lawsuit, which other agencies can join. So, going forward, I think it behooves us. If Facebook doesn't comply voluntarily, then over-regulation is probably needed."

Now, the conversation about entitlements, spending and debt would be absolutely different without Speaker Ryan, without Chairman Ryan, as chairman of both the Budget and the Ways and Means Committee. He was able to offer leadership on those issues. We wouldn't even have the lexicon to talk about tackling these problems if we didn't have his leadership on these issues.

And then during his time as speaker, the deficit actually went up almost $350 billion. So he, I think, will be remembered as someone who really tried, but he couldn't actually pull it off."

      "utterance": "All right, FOX News can confirm that the president is seriously considering withdrawing all our troops from Syria. The Wall Street Journal the first to report the administration was even thinking about the move. Retired Three-Star General Jerry Boykin joins the right now, a former Green Beret commander as well. You do not mess with the general, so I will not."

      "utterance": "I would say I ask two questions. Number one, what does your intelligence community say? Do they agree that ISIS is decimated and now would be the proper time to pull out? The second question I would ask, is what are you planning for the Kurds? What are you planning for the Christians up in that area and the Yazidis? You cannot leave them vulnerable. And I am afraid the president may be on dangerous ground here. I want him to succeed, because he's been so good with our military, allowing them to fight to win. But I don't want to see it blown now."

      "utterance": "Yes, I'm absolutely concerned about leaving Russia there to essentially control Syria, along with their allies the Iranians. But the other thing is, you still have a lot of other terrorist groups that are not ISIS. But there are still Iranian -- I mean, Syrian terrorist groups in there. And what are they going to do once they don't have the U.S. presence there? Who are they going to go after? It's not just Bashar al-Assad and his government. In fact, some of them are going to go after the Kurds and the Christians, just like the Turks will."

      "speaker": "BOYKIN",
      "utterance": "ISIS is in at least 34 other countries. This -- it's misleading to say they're destroyed. What the president said was that they -- they have been destroyed in Syria. That may be true. I sort of doubt that they're destroyed. I think there are still remnants of ISIS there. But they are still in 34 other countries. And their ideology is very much alive. We have to be very careful here. I think this is dangerous ground, Neil."

We had a better-than-800-point swing in the markets here, at first happy that the Federal Reserve was going to only hike interest rates a quarter- point, not happy that it is still, by and large, going to stick to its plan to keep hiking rates next year, maybe one less hike, but still hikes, and the Federal Reserve chairman, who has essentially ignored the markets telling him, you know what? We're panicking. Will they still panic tomorrow? We will see. \"The Five\" is now. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
