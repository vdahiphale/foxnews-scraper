This as some new FOX polls came out. Next steps on Obamacare, people saying keep it, make it better, 60 percent in this poll, throw it out and start over, 33 percent. Job approval, job performance approval ticking up one point from May. And disapproval at the same. And then issues facing the country that are important they are extremely or very concerned about, and you can see health care tops the list right now, 82 percent. The future of the country, 81 percent. And you see the rest there.  With that, let's bring in our panel: Steve Hilton is a former adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron, he's also the host of \"The Next Revolution\" right here on Fox News Channel; Amy Walter, national for The Cook Political Report, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Amy, today's pitch. I heard some people on other channels saying where was that guy as President Trump was putting the screws to the Senate GOP?",

They are saying actually keep it and make it better. That's not a message that's going through.  The president's overall approval rating on the issue is the lowest of anything that he is doing. He's doing better on the economy than on health care. And so part of the job of being president is making the sell, making the hard sell and making the case. The president didn't do it. There were no members in the Senate that did it.   When I turned on the television, the only senators that were on television were ones who were saying the problems they had with it. And then when it came to the actual advertising that voters get to see on their television sets, I looked from the end of May to the middle of July, about $6 million had been spent on advertising focused on this health care bill, $5.8 million of it was negative and told the senators to vote against it.

I think the biggest story here in all the talk of is the bill collapsing or not, is Obamacare collapsing or not, I think the real question is, actually, is the Republican Party collapsing? Because if they can't do something like this, if the gap between the moderates, the conservatives and then let's not forget the populists, the new populist wing, just so big that they can't get anything done, then there really are questions. \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote about what is the point of the party?

They wanted to get health care reform so they could have a new, a better bottom line to work with in doing tax reform. So it was kind of an inside baseball parliamentary maneuver.

This criticism, I think, just reveals the shallowness and superficiality of the critics. What they are really upset about is the style, how things are done, whether protocol was kept.  Actually, I'm sure President Obama did all the right things, took all the right translators along, but look at the results of his relationship with Putin. It was that relationship that emboldened Putin to invade Ukraine because he knew Obama wouldn't do anything about it. So that's what we should be focused on. What's the outcome from these kinds of relationships. And since it was all done right before and ended with a bad outcome, maybe doing it differently might produce a different result.
