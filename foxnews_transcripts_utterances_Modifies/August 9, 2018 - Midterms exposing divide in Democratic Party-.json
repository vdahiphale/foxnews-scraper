He wrote: \"The whole country needs to see every tweet, every rally, every word, and every reaction so that they can ask themselves, is this who I want my kids to see as our president?\" What a great idea. Because remember what happened the last time the media covered every tweet, every rally, every word, and every reaction of Donald Trump? When every wink, nudge, cough became part of the media's Snark-nado? They've elected Donald Trump, the bozos. Yes, there were like 300 Republican candidates, but all the yahoos in the press chased the orange meteor precisely for the things they hate about him now. Trump was great TV. He was shocking. Screw Rick Perry, Rand Paul, and all those other nobodies. This guy makes chance into a sure thing. Trump got like a billion-dollars-worth of free airtime and not led by Fox News who actually featured commentators who challenge Trump over his behavior and beliefs. It was CNN who led the charge and assorted other drips who didn't seem to mind because they thought Hillary had it in the bag anyway, and they had no other way to get people to watch their boring, mindless coverage. So telling the media to focus on Trump's behavior, you're in effect saying: Hey, remember how we elected Trump in 2016? Let's do it again. Isn't that true, Morgan? It seems like Friedman has amnesia.

And as you talked about Hillary Clinton, I think if we brought anyone from her campaign on right now, they would blame Jim Comey, right, for what he did, you know, a few weeks before the election. So I do think that Mueller has to be careful, and I do think that even though he has a lot of credibility, there's legitimate reasons when the president says there are 17 angry Democrats and people that attended Hillary's election night party and people who donated. For the average American watching it, my problem with that is that we have lost both sides, different points have lost faith and credibility in this FBI and then the DOJ. And I don't think that's a good thing. I think during the election, Democrats were mad at the FBI. Now, Republicans are. And it's not good for this to be partisan. We need to have a set of rules where they say, OK, there is no standard, right? There's only the memo written in 2012 from the then attorney general. So we need to have a standard as we get closer to elections. What is the standard that we're all going? Why, am I really boring you that much?",

Mollie has been a key part of our team over the last few months, she's -- there she is. She's going to be headed back to the University of Maryland in the fall so she can cheer on the terrapins. So to Mollie and all of our college associates, congratulations, thank you, and go do a good semester's worth of work and maybe we'll hire you one day. OK, Greg.",

She's like the best advertisement for Republicans. But she represents a wing of the Democratic Party that's very fervent, energetic, but it is not the Nancy Pelosi mainstream wing of let's get things done. There is a division within the Democratic Party that I think bodes well for Republicans. I don't think Trump or the Republicans are out of the woods by any means. But I do think that at this stage with, you know, what is it? Less than three months to go before the election, the Democrats could be far more united, far more formidable. They have put up some good candidates. I mean, the guy running against Balderson in Ohio, good Danny boy is a good candidate. Came up short.

Because remember what happened the last time the media covered every tweet, every rally, every word, and every reaction of Donald Trump? When every wink, nudge, cough became part of the media's Snark-nado? They've elected Donald Trump, the bozos. Yes, there were like 300 Republican candidates, but all the yahoos in the press chased the orange meteor precisely for the things they hate about him now. Trump was great TV. He was shocking. Screw Rick Perry, Rand Paul, and all those other nobodies. This guy makes chance into a sure thing. Trump got like a billion-dollars-worth of free airtime and not led by Fox News who actually featured commentators who challenge Trump over his behavior and beliefs.

So I do think that Mueller has to be careful, and I do think that even though he has a lot of credibility, there's legitimate reasons when the president says there are 17 angry Democrats and people that attended Hillary's election night party and people who donated. For the average American watching it, my problem with that is that we have lost both sides, different points have lost faith and credibility in this FBI and then the DOJ. And I don't think that's a good thing. I think during the election, Democrats were mad at the FBI. Now, Republicans are. And it's not good for this to be partisan. We need to have a set of rules where they say, OK, there is no standard, right? There's only the memo written in 2012 from the then attorney general. So we need to have a standard as we get closer to elections. What is the standard that we're all going? Why, am I really boring you that much?"
