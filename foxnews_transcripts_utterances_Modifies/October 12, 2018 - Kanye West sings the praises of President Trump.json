I couldn't get it out there, Josh. That was something today, in the words of President Trump. What does that do? It was a surreal moment on TV, we hadn't seen anything like that in the Oval Office.

But it reminded me that this could be a lost opportunity for President Trump. If he focused on the criminal justice reform, which was why Kanye West was at the White House and the first place, that could have been an opportunity early on in his presidency to expand his coalition to win over some African-Americans to the Trump side. It really was an amazing moment where you had one of the most famous African-American celebrities really hugging President Trump, but it feels like it's little late in the game for that and doesn't feel like this came at the right time for this president.  There's certainly some opportunities as we get closer to the midterms for Trump to build some new supporters, but I don't think he is going to really move the needle a whole lot politically.",

You have a very prominent black celebrity aligning himself with the president, and there's something very threatening about that, not just in terms of celebrity, but also in race issues.

You see Lindsey Graham, you saw Marco Rubio, also, some of the hawks on the Senate side that really want action. They want sanctions, and they want to have some arms deals retreated. But the White House doesn't want to do that. And Jared Kushner has had a close relationship with the Saudi leadership, and I think they have a lot, they want contain Iran, they have a lot at stake with the Saudi relationship and they don't want to jeopardize it."

      "utterance": "That's what I was going to say, how are we going to know actually, are we going to feel like it is a very definitive case that can be solved? We may get more intelligence. And if so the action would really be to do the thing that, as Josh pointed out, the president does seem very hesitant to do, which is stop sales, especially arms sales to Saudi Arabia. And you could have a really tremendous impact on the Saudi infrastructure and what they are doing right now, their place in the world militarily if the U.S. did put sanctions on soon."

      "utterance": "The idea that you would just take them at their word that they know exactly what is going on seems really premature. And when you are making decisions about how to deal with allies, you should always be focused on your national interest. Kidnapping or killing a journalist is a horrible thing. This happens a lot, that a lot of people get kidnapped and killed. It's not worse if it happens to a journalist and someone else, but you still have to make your decisions about what's in the best interest of your country and not get too emotional."
