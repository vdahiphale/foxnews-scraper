Let us know and we will make sure it's a Valentine's Day to remember.\" Now, you know that I am a law in order guy, not this show. That sucks. I mean, the real thing, but this creeps me out. Mainly because you never want to rely on bitter exes for anything. She or he could call 911 and say are holed up in a basement with an arsenal larger than the Sinaloa?",

He allegedly stabbed her 40 times after following her into a Chinatown apartment early Sunday. The killer, you already know the drill. Living in a shelter because there's no place for the criminally deranged. They should have tried getting him a job as a CNN producer. He had dozens of arrests and was is busted on January 6th, but fried on supervised release. Yes, supervised release. How does that work? Unless that means a cop following this cycle around 24/7. I don't want to hear about it anymore because it doesn't work at all. Meanwhile, actual January 6th, 2020 defendants weren't even given bail. So, this guy is locked up, he finally figured out how to stay arrested. Murder someone. That's the bar now for inclusion, which coincidentally is the same bar gangs like M.S.-13 use for initiation, because nothing else sticks in a hells cape where felony assault and grand larceny are like ripping off the tag from a mattress. But hey, if only one of the killers' exes had seen the ATF tweet, who knew? We could have tricked him with a Whitman's Sampler or have his ex make a reservation at Applebee's and then slap the cuffs on him during desert. But what's the point of having people narc on each other, when you don't even lock up the people you already busted? It's the cart before the police horse. Maybe figure out how to keep these monsters behind bars before you figure out clever ways to grab more. They need to figure this out. Just look at what we did five years ago before Democrats screwed this -- up. Right now, heinous criminals roam like free range chicken, and progressive D.A.s hide from the mayhem they cause. No wonder they love mask mandates. I'd wear a mask too if I were them. These crimes keep happening and what follows outrage mostly on Fox, then it's forgotten. Rinse blood, and repeat. Many victims are Asian. When will the Asian leaders who represent them do something big? Creating a cupids when 800 crime line on Valentine's Day is not enough. And forget platitudes about stopping Asian hate, homeless thugs don't read tweets from the mayor's office. It's up to you, Asian groups, because other groups just aren't that into you. There's no Asian Lives Matter group fighting on your behalf. Instead, they judge you as a group they're trying to keep out of college. And they call that anti-racist. And don't expect help from the Dems either, they're literally -- they literally doubt that women exist. Hell AOC just blamed the crime surge on the expired Child Tax Credit.",

I'd ask where you bend but we all know planning trips to Florida. We've talked to the victim's families as we pored over the stats, and so far not one person was beaten to death for baby formula. In fact, the people struggling in this lockdown economy aren't stealing baby formula at all. They're wondering why they're no longer safe on their way home. AOC, these victims aren't ideas or political constructs. These are women who bleed to death when they are stabbed. AOC claimed her life was in danger because of a riot in a building she wasn't even in, but dismisses actual murder as a problem over taxes. What's next? Her critics are sexually frustrated? Christina Yuna Lee wasn't butchered to death over baby formula in an environment of violence. She was a young Asian woman followed to her home, where that became an environment of violence. That AOC in her side helped create while living in a safe, make-believe abstract world. And they dusted the murder scene for prints.

But if you're one of the nine people who still watches MSNBC or CNN, you wouldn't have heard a peep about it. A media watchdog group reports that neither network dedicated any primetime coverage to it on Monday, instead focusing on Trump's finances, and of course, the January 6th Committee. Despite that, you know, this is a big story. But it's an inconvenient one for the left-wing media for it totally undercuts their portrayal of Russia-gate from the very beginning. It's like a sociology degree. They wasted four years of your life. They dismiss Trump's claims then and dismiss this latest report now, because it makes the media, the deep state Democrats look bad, which they don't like and makes us look better, which they don't like even more.

Dating expert Alex Miller Brook told the Daily Mail that singles can protect themselves by either asking their dates to elaborate on their views on issues like feminism and climate change, or by waiting to share their views on those issues. So, dates can't use them to manipulate you. Which sounds like a fun evening. Or you could meet them at a hip downtown cafe, then see if they smash the windows. My idea when you're with a date, turn on \"Don Lemon Tonight,\" if they don't immediately run from the room screaming and throwing up, then you probably found someone who will throw vegan burritos at cops with you.

He allegedly stabbed her 40 times after following her into a Chinatown apartment early Sunday. The killer, you already know the drill. Living in a shelter because there's no place for the criminally deranged. They should have tried getting him a job as a CNN producer. He had dozens of arrests and was is busted on January 6th, but fried on supervised release. Yes, supervised release. How does that work? Unless that means a cop following this cycle around 24/7. I don't want to hear about it anymore because it doesn't work at all. Meanwhile, actual January 6th, 2020 defendants weren't even given bail. So, this guy is locked up, he finally figured out how to stay arrested. Murder someone. That's the bar now for inclusion, which coincidentally is the same bar gangs like M.S.-13 use for initiation, because nothing else sticks in a hells cape where felony assault and grand larceny are like ripping off the tag from a mattress. But hey, if only one of the killers' exes had seen the ATF tweet, who knew? We could have tricked him with a Whitman's Sampler or have his ex make a reservation at Applebee's and then slap the cuffs on him during desert. But what's the point of having people narc on each other, when you don't even lock up the people you already busted? It's the cart before the police horse. Maybe figure out how to keep these monsters behind bars before you figure out clever ways to grab more. They need to figure this out. Just look at what we did five years ago before Democrats screwed this -- up. Right now, heinous criminals roam like free range chicken, and progressive D.A.s hide from the mayhem they cause. No wonder they love mask mandates. I'd wear a mask too if I were them. These crimes keep happening and what follows outrage mostly on Fox, then it's forgotten. Rinse blood, and repeat. Many victims are Asian. When will the Asian leaders who represent them do something big? Creating a cupids when 800 crime line on Valentine's Day is not enough. And forget platitudes about stopping Asian hate, homeless thugs don't read tweets from the mayor's office. It's up to you, Asian groups, because other groups just aren't that into you. There's no Asian Lives Matter group fighting on your behalf. Instead, they judge you as a group they're trying to keep out of college. And they call that anti-racist. And don't expect help from the Dems either, they're literally -- they literally doubt that women exist. Hell AOC just blamed the crime surge on the expired Child Tax Credit."

Actually, these environments of violence weren't so violent before loons like her got into power. And sorry, lady, we talk about this stuff every day. I'd ask where you bend but we all know planning trips to Florida. We've talked to the victim's families as we pored over the stats, and so far not one person was beaten to death for baby formula. In fact, the people struggling in this lockdown economy aren't stealing baby formula at all. They're wondering why they're no longer safe on their way home. AOC, these victims aren't ideas or political constructs. These are women who bleed to death when they are stabbed. AOC claimed her life was in danger because of a riot in a building she wasn't even in, but dismisses actual murder as a problem over taxes. What's next? Her critics are sexually frustrated? Christina Yuna Lee wasn't butchered to death over baby formula in an environment of violence. She was a young Asian woman followed to her home, where that became an environment of violence. That AOC in her side helped create while living in a safe, make-believe abstract world. And they dusted the murder scene for prints. They may not have found yours, AOC, but your bad ideas were an accessory."

But the act also allows banks to freeze personal accounts with anyone linked to the protest without a court order.

But if you're one of the nine people who still watches MSNBC or CNN, you wouldn't have heard a peep about it. A media watchdog group reports that neither network dedicated any primetime coverage to it on Monday, instead focusing on Trump's finances, and of course, the January 6th Committee. Despite that, you know, this is a big story. But it's an inconvenient one for the left-wing media for it totally undercuts their portrayal of Russia-gate from the very beginning. It's like a sociology degree. They wasted four years of your life. They dismiss Trump's claims then and dismiss this latest report now, because it makes the media, the deep state Democrats look bad, which they don't like and makes us look better, which they don't like even more.

So, dates can't use them to manipulate you. Which sounds like a fun evening. Or you could meet them at a hip downtown cafe, then see if they smash the windows.
