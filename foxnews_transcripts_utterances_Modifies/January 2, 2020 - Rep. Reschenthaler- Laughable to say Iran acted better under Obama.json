      "sentences": "Tonight, on \"The Story,\" former Congressman Trey Gowdy with live reaction to a stunning admission that seem to prove President Trump right. One of the loudest pro-impeachment voices in Congress. Democrat Al Green revealing just how long he's been planning to impeach the president. Plus, Sean Spicer and Richard Fowler on how the president is winning the battle of the biggest bank account heading into the 2020 election. Bernie outpacing Biden and the rest of the pack, but can any of the candidates compete with the president's massive fundraising haul.  And New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio slamming Domino's pizza for jockeying up the price of a pie around Times Square to 30 bucks a pop on New Year's. John Stossel joins the debate and says De Blasio needs a little lesson in the principles of supply and demand.  Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry in for Martha MacCallum. And this is \"The Story.\"  A lot to get to. But first breaking this hour, Iraqi security officials revealing at least three rockets were just fired at Baghdad International Airport. The rocket has landed near the cargo hall killing four people. No word yet on who is responsible for this fresh attack, but it comes as Iran is warning the U.S. tonight that it has, quote, unquote, \"the power to break America.\" As hundreds more of our troops deployed to the Mideast in the wake of the Iranian-backed militias attacking the U.S. embassy in Iraq. Defense Secretary Mark Esper acknowledged to Fox today tensions are high. He signaled the attacks on Americans may not be over and he had a blunt warning for Tehran.",

The money that Iran got back under the nuclear deal was its own money that had been frozen in accounts since we put sanctions in place. They undertook the severe restrictions; they got the sanctions release.  That was the deal. And we believed that that was the best way to get these restrictions on Iran on their nuclear program which is the biggest threat to Israel, the biggest threat to us and our allies.

The president does have a strategy, it's called maximum pressure. It's denying funds that cause anti-regime protest in Iran, in Lebanon and in Syria. What we are seeing in Iraq right now is the Iranian regime trying to strike back at the president. The president is going to keep the strategy in mind. But do you know why this is a success, Ed?

The timing here could be key because the judge's recusal comes just days after a private investigator firm out of Florida filed a notice claiming Hunter Biden was part of a money-laundering scheme. But as soon as that claim was filed, Judge Don McSpadden struct it from the record, saying it wasn't relevant to the paternity case. But the investigative firm then refile the claim, saying it provided bank documents to Lunden Roberts, she is the mother of Biden's child. Proving that Hunter Biden was involved in fraud and counterfeiting. Judge McSpadden been recused himself before he could issue a new ruling. Biden's attorney called the investigative firm's documents a, quote, \"scheme by a nonparty simply to make scandalous allegations.\" And the attorney for Lunden Roberts says the judge's recusal was a sign of integrity. Quoting here, \"it highlights the ethos and values that make the judiciary such a powerful separate branch of government. Our client sincerely thanks Judge McSpadden for his time and attention to what has become a difficult and convoluted child-support matter.\" But it is notable that Hunter Biden has refused to answer basic questions about his finances and has failed to abide by the judge's ruling that he released five years of bank records, including his time on the board of Burisma where he reportedly earned $50,000 a month. Biden's bank records could also shed more light on his various investments involving China. Lunden Roberts says Biden hasn't given him any child support for more than a year.

They are doing it to bring to relieve pressure. Domestically you have a lot of folks in Iran. They are trying to move to a pro-western, pro-Democratic state and overthrow the ayatollah, that is true. But it's also a way to bring discord to the Middle East, to try to drive a wedge between the Americans and the Iraqis, particularly the Sunni Iraqis.

We are now almost at the end of the first term of President Trump. It's what his strategy is. You know, I believe the point of the nuclear deal without having something to replace it was a mistake. A strategic mistake. People may not have liked everything about the nuclear deal but under that agreement there were severe restrictions on Iran's nuclear program. Today, those restrictions aren't in place and there is nothing to replace it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "So, the concept of the nuclear agreement, the reason Congress passed sanctions was, under the premise, that if Iran undertakes severe restrictions to their nuclear program, they will get sanctions relief. That was always the trade-off that went into any concept of negotiation. The question was always what those restrictions should look like and what that sanctions relief should look like. The money that Iran got back under the nuclear deal was its own money that had been frozen in accounts since we put sanctions in place. They undertook the severe restrictions; they got the sanctions release. That was the deal. And we believed that that was the best way to get these restrictions on Iran on their nuclear program which is the biggest threat to Israel, the biggest threat to us and our allies. They've always had money, they used to fund Hezbollah. The Iran nuclear deal did not change that."

And he has a new op-ed in Foxnews.com that says that some of the money you're talking about actually went on to fund terror. It went on to fund Palestinian terror, number one. And number two, that Iran's 2016 military budget after you had signed the nuclear deal went up 90 percent to $100 billion after the deal. Does that sound like Iran was pulling back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",

That's why we maintain that the terrorism sanctions, the sanctions on their ballistic missiles and the sanction on human rights under the deal. We just release the sanctions on their nuclear program and we maintain the pressure on those other areas, Ed. But you and I are having an interesting intellectual discussion about the deal that's no longer in place. Right? The question on the table today --"

He and his administration are racketing up the pressure on Iran taking these very public air strikes against Iranian-backed militias in Iraq. You know, the Israelis have been taking strikes against these same kinds of militias in Iraq and in Syria, but they are doing it more quietly. They're trying to send the message that this is unacceptable, that they have a red line that will not be crossed, but they are doing in a way that doesn't increase the tension on the ground which is really counterproductive for American interest."

He was asked about the strategy with Iran. In part, here's what he said. \"We are not looking for regime change, I'm looking to have Iran say no to nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons for Iran and I think we will make a deal.\" What's wrong with that? What's wrong with saying I want to make sure that one of our mortal enemies that funds terror around the world doesn't have nuclear weapons. Isn't that a strategy?"

So that's actually not a strategy, that's a statement of principle. Underneath that how do you go after Iranian-back militias in Iraq? How do you up the pressure on them in Syria? The one thing that President Trump has done in Syria withdrawing our troops actually emboldened Iran there. It gave them more leverage there. So, when I look at the region, I see that Iran is doing a lot of very bad things. I see that they are a threat to our friends and partners. What I don't see is anything from the Trump administration that is a strategic look, how are we going to get back to the nuclear deal? How are we going to bring our allies on board?"

And as you said, it used the windfall of sanctions relief to spend on terrorism. It was a disaster the president did a good thing of getting out of it. The president does have a strategy, it's called maximum pressure. It's denying funds that cause anti-regime protest in Iran, in Lebanon and in Syria. What we are seeing in Iraq right now is the Iranian regime trying to strike back at the president. The president is going to keep the strategy in mind. But do you know why this is a success, Ed? Because the president knows there is no easy solution. There is no quick fix. He's not going to conduct air strikes against Iran without a clear strategy and a good justification, and he's not going to get back into a disaster of a weak deal like Obama's nuclear deal."

When you say we are not going to bomb Tehran, then what was Secretary Esper telling Fox today when he said there's going to be severe consequences if Iran keeps this up?

How do you get Iran to knock this off without military action?"

This may wind up costing them somehow seats but I don't think it will cost them the whole House. They're not going to win in November 2020. I always thought, Ed, this is more about retaking the Senate, putting Cory Gardner, Susan Collins, Martha McSally, and Tom Tillis in tough spots. Because even if President Trump wins in 2020, if he doesn't have the Senate, he's essentially a neutered president, he can't get his cabinet through and he can't get judges through, and he couldn't get the Supreme Court they can see through. So, I've always thought this was much more about the Senate than it is about removing him from office because that is not going to happen."

In addition to being an incredible courtroom lawyer, John was the United States attorney in Texas, he also understands the politics. He's on the judiciary and House intel, so he's watched Schiff and Nadler. He's conducted the depositions, he's defended depositions. If there needs to be someone with a political background to understand the chronology and the process, Ratcliffe would be fantastic. But the president would win if the vote was today. And I don't like surprises. I don't like witnesses that I don't know what they are going to say. If the vote were today, the president would win. So, my advice to him is, go with the defense team you've got now. Cipollone, Ratcliffe, Pam Bondi, Jay Sekulow, and then get to the vote as quickly as possible. Don't inject any surprises or witnesses that you don't know what they're going to say. It's just not good in a trial for there to be a lot of surprises."

While those candidates are running a primary campaign, trying to win states like Iowa and New Hampshire and focusing on super Tuesday, the president and his team have been focused on the general election on those swing-state voters in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania. So, here is the important thing. For the first time in history, you have this political triad, you have the campaign and the RNC integrated and coordinated in a way that's never been done before focused on the general election. And then you have us in America First Policies and PAC they are flying overhead supporting the president's allies' policies and reelection campaign and providing that support in a way that is never happened in terms of those three entities focused on a general election this early.

Our chief breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher has the story. Good evening, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Good evening, Ed. The timing here could be key because the judge's recusal comes just days after a private investigator firm out of Florida filed a notice claiming Hunter Biden was part of a money-laundering scheme. But as soon as that claim was filed, Judge Don McSpadden struct it from the record, saying it wasn't relevant to the paternity case. But the investigative firm then refile the claim, saying it provided bank documents to Lunden Roberts, she is the mother of Biden's child. Proving that Hunter Biden was involved in fraud and counterfeiting. Judge McSpadden been recused himself before he could issue a new ruling. Biden's attorney called the investigative firm's documents a, quote, \"scheme by a nonparty simply to make scandalous allegations.\" And the attorney for Lunden Roberts says the judge's recusal was a sign of integrity. Quoting here, \"it highlights the ethos and values that make the judiciary such a powerful separate branch of government. Our client sincerely thanks Judge McSpadden for his time and attention to what has become a difficult and convoluted child-support matter.\" But it is notable that Hunter Biden has refused to answer basic questions about his finances and has failed to abide by the judge's ruling that he released five years of bank records, including his time on the board of Burisma where he reportedly earned $50,000 a month. Biden's bank records could also shed more light on his various investments involving China. Lunden Roberts says Biden hasn't given him any child support for more than a year. A hearing in the case is schedule for next week and a new judge has already been assigned, Ed."

There is mounting media criticism of President Trump on this because the question is being asked, what has he gotten for his year and a half of personal diplomacy with this dictator. And I think it's a fair question because when Trump first had the original summit, he himself said, I'm trying something different. This may not work, and if it doesn't, I will admit that I will go back to a tougher approach. While as you saw in that clip, he's not acknowledging failure despite Kim's words.

You could see in that New York Times report, Congressman Lee Zeldin, a Republican, \"Iraq mourners? It's like Zarif, as in the foreign minister of Iran has become the managing editor of the New York Times.
