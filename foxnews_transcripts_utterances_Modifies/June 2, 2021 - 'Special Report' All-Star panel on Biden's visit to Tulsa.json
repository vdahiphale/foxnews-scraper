We know that there is definitely a pause and a delay there with regard to that.  But it's interesting you brought up Senator Tim Scott because he said America is not racist. And actually, President Biden agrees with him.  Here's what the president said, quote, \"I don't think America is racist. But I think the overhang from all of the Jim Crow and, before that, slavery had a cost. We know of the cost in Tulsa.\" And a lot of people didn't. A lot of people not just in Oklahoma but in other states in this country, their children didn't learn about it 30 plus or even less years ago because it wasn't in the schoolbooks.   It may not be pretty. Warts and all, Bill said, and I would agree with that, but we need to know history. And we need to know that our history has been violent and has been racist. And it doesn't mean that we're bad people. It doesn't mean that our nation is racist. But we can't just say because we elected an African-American, a biracial man, a black man as president, and a woman of color as vice president, on the ticket with Joe Biden, that that is gone, because it clearly isn't. And I know, I can sit here and say that as a white woman. Juan can certainly speak on this panel to that more so. And even Senator Tim Scott.  But there is definitely still pain in this country. We have seen, whether it's George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer, or whether it's individuals who just don't feel that they get the fair opportunity with the same supplies in their school districts, the same opportunity to go to school because of money and the income gap, especially with the inequality and disparity in income in our nation, the opportunity with jobs, or, quite frankly, still the divide along the lines of color. And it's not just along black and white, but often along a rainbow of colors and white. And that needs to change.",

But after testing over 80,000 animals they could not find the link. And quite frankly, speaking of that link, I don't know if we'll ever find the true link to the lab because we know China is not going to let us in. They're not now, and they didn't over a year ago when we sent investigators in. So sadly, we may never know the truth, but I think it was more not believing politicians over scientists at the time.",

Let me step into Trey's shoes and your shoes for a second, Shannon.   Preponderance of the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt -- where do we think this came from? Scott Gottlieb nailed it. They won't allow the blood tests. They won't allow us to talk to the people who were in there. The people who were infected, they wouldn't allow their people to travel inside the country, but they let people travel outside the country. Total stonewall about allowing any evidence or investigation of the source of it. Next they will be blaming Switzerland and New Zealand. It's ridiculous. We know exactly who is culpable here.",

That's one of the advantages in the USA, we have lawsuits and whistleblowers. You don't see that in China.

Tim Scott was an eyewitness to the pain of racism in this country, but he is the first to note the progress that we have made. And he spends most of his time talking about the promise of this country. Yes, there was pain. Yes, there has been progress. Most of all, there is the promise of this country. But we're going to have to decide when we reach racial fairness by doing what Dr. King says, which is judging people based on the content of their character and not the color of their skin, or government putting its finger on the scale and deciding we're going to make amends by doing thus. And I like Dr. King's way. Judge people in a color-blind society based on the content of their character. That's the promise, I think, of America."

They say those conversations are continuing. It is a complex issue, and they are working on trying to find common ground. But he also is part of a new RNC ad that says this White House is focusing on things that divide Americans instead of bringing them together. Here's a bit of that ad."

      "utterance": "First of all, if we're talking about the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act, the House did pass it along bipartisan lines, and Senator Scott is pushing from the right to work with the left in the Senate. We know that there is definitely a pause and a delay there with regard to that. But it's interesting you brought up Senator Tim Scott because he said America is not racist. And actually, President Biden agrees with him. Here's what the president said, quote, \"I don't think America is racist. But I think the overhang from all of the Jim Crow and, before that, slavery had a cost. We know of the cost in Tulsa.\" And a lot of people didn't. A lot of people not just in Oklahoma but in other states in this country, their children didn't learn about it 30 plus or even less years ago because it wasn't in the schoolbooks. It may not be pretty. Warts and all, Bill said, and I would agree with that, but we need to know history. And we need to know that our history has been violent and has been racist. And it doesn't mean that we're bad people. It doesn't mean that our nation is racist. But we can't just say because we elected an African-American, a biracial man, a black man as president, and a woman of color as vice president, on the ticket with Joe Biden, that that is gone, because it clearly isn't. And I know, I can sit here and say that as a white woman. Juan can certainly speak on this panel to that more so. And even Senator Tim Scott. But there is definitely still pain in this country. We have seen, whether it's George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer, or whether it's individuals who just don't feel that they get the fair opportunity with the same supplies in their school districts, the same opportunity to go to school because of money and the income gap, especially with the inequality and disparity in income in our nation, the opportunity with jobs, or, quite frankly, still the divide along the lines of color. And it's not just along black and white, but often along a rainbow of colors and white. And that needs to change."

They could provide the source strains, some of the original strains. They've refused to do that.

      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Shannon, you're a much better lawyer than I am, but nothing gets better with time in the justice system. Absolutely nothing. I think the heartbreaking part about this is how it reflects the culture that we live in, our friends are never wrong and our enemies are never right. Tom Cotton and John Ratcliffe and others were saying, hey, we should take a look at the origins of this virus, but because they're Republicans, they were panned by the media. I thought that's what science was, look at everything until it is discounted. Now we've come full circle, and it appears that Cotton and John weren't quite as dumb as the media told us they were."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",

But clearly they were. And Leslie, we're continuing to hear, last week we heard this, it was through the weekend and some of the Sunday shows as well, a number of folks in the mainstream media pointing at the Trump administration saying it's your fault we didn't take it seriously, instead of we didn't investigate it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I understand quite frankly where a lot of people were questioning politicians, whether it be Tom Cotton or former President Trump, because the majority of scientists in the medical community, science community, internationally, not just here and not just Anthony Fauci, they said, you know what, COVID-19's daddy and granddaddy were both animal vector borne viruses, as most are, quite frankly, and that's what they thought. But after testing over 80,000 animals they could not find the link. And quite frankly, speaking of that link, I don't know if we'll ever find the true link to the lab because we know China is not going to let us in. They're not now, and they didn't over a year ago when we sent investigators in. So sadly, we may never know the truth, but I think it was more not believing politicians over scientists at the time."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Bill, we don't -- it doesn't seem like we have a different universe of information, not too much than we did a year ago. As Trey said, things break down the further you are away in time from trying to get your hands on evidence. So where are we to attribute this pivot now where there are so many out there saying, OK, the lab leak theory is legit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "The reason for the pivot is that Donald Trump is gone, and it's astounding to me to see how much coverage an ABC journalist got for saying we just have to admit sometimes something Donald Trump said was right. Oh, my God. People are getting the vapors in the newsrooms. Something he said was right, because people wouldn't look at it fairly and they wouldn't look at it objectively. Let me step into Trey's shoes and your shoes for a second, Shannon. Preponderance of the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt -- where do we think this came from? Scott Gottlieb nailed it. They won't allow the blood tests. They won't allow us to talk to the people who were in there. The people who were infected, they wouldn't allow their people to travel inside the country, but they let people travel outside the country. Total stonewall about allowing any evidence or investigation of the source of it. Next they will be blaming Switzerland and New Zealand. It's ridiculous. We know exactly who is culpable here."

      "utterance": "Well, I think that's difficult for what you've heard from the other panelists, Shannon. I don't think China is going to be forthcoming. I think they have a reputation as a repressive authoritarian regime. They don't -- they threaten people who tell the truth. They don't reward them. That's one of the advantages in the USA, we have lawsuits and whistleblowers. You don't see that in China. And I think that when you look at this, the important part here for us as Americans is that President Biden has said, let's have a full investigation. He wants it in 90 days. That's important given that pandemics going forward are going to come."
