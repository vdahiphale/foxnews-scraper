I'm David Asman, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" Coming up, we're going to be talking to former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf.

Today, standing next to Guatemala's president, Alejandro Giammattei, this is what she had to say to the Guatemalans.",

They're also working on an anti-smuggling task force that will also work with Guatemala. We visited Villa Nueva. This is home to where the largest slum in Guatemala is, some 400,000 people living in some pretty dire conditions, some making $2 a day, others making nothing at all. They said that they're leaving and wanting to leave because of lack of opportunity. I asked, who's thought about going to the United States? And everybody has forget. Why? The money. No, there's no money. That's the number one reason. The mayor of Villa Nueva says the problem is, is that the money given to the national government rarely ever makes it to the local municipalities. People do not feel or see the difference. And then they flee their country -- David.",

But visiting that Southwest border, talking to the men and women of Border Patrol and the law enforcement agents, as well as the migrants, she needs to understand what is causing them to make this very dangerous journey. Is it jobs, is it economic opportunity, or is it the persecution that they're talking about? And so she can talk with some of these individuals firsthand, so as she talks with Guatemala and others, she has a firsthand account of what some of these migrants are going through. But probably the most important is -- to visit that Southwest border is to show support to the men and women of Border Patrol. These are law enforcement officers that are -- go to work every day that are facing a historic crisis and surge of individuals at that border and are doing their very best to keep that border under control and secure and safe. And having the vice president or the president of the United States come down there and show their support goes a long way for these patriots.",

No, there's no money. That's the number one reason. The mayor of Villa Nueva says the problem is, is that the money given to the national government rarely ever makes it to the local municipalities.

But visiting that Southwest border, talking to the men and women of Border Patrol and the law enforcement agents, as well as the migrants, she needs to understand what is causing them to make this very dangerous journey. Is it jobs, is it economic opportunity, or is it the persecution that they're talking about? And so she can talk with some of these individuals firsthand, so as she talks with Guatemala and others, she has a firsthand account of what some of these migrants are going through. But probably the most important is -- to visit that Southwest border is to show support to the men and women of Border Patrol. These are law enforcement officers that are -- go to work every day that are facing a historic crisis and surge of individuals at that border and are doing their very best to keep that border under control and secure and safe. And having the vice president or the president of the United States come down there and show their support goes a long way for these patriots."

The point is, is that people on the left have denigrated the character of border agents and denigrated the character of ICE agents. We need them desperately. And they are putting their lives on the line at the border every day. Just to emphasize your point, don't they deserve the respect of a visit from the vice president?"

But that's part of her job, right, is to understand the reality of what's going on there, so that she can make informed decisions, along with the president, and certainly on her international trips, and start talking to them with some firsthand knowledge.

I think there are symbolic gestures at that. But the bottom line is this. People are concerned about the process today. They want to see the vice president or even the president visit the border. They want this issue addressed. Now, certainly, it's not one of the most pressing issues to the American people right now. We are just coming over a pandemic. When you look at the issues that are most important to Americans, immigration is no longer in the top three. It's now about the fifth issue. So, you can see the reason they probably deprioritize it is because of public sentiment and all the other things that they have going on. But, certainly, this is something that the American people care about. It's certainly something that people don't approve of right now how Joe Biden and his administration has handled it."

And you mentioned efforts on climate change. That's because there are food shortages in Guatemala, and the fact that a lot of farmland has been ruined. There are people who are food-insecure. When people can't feed their babies, what do they do? They leave.

And all she has done is go 2,000 miles away from the Southern border to have a photo-op with a world leader. That's all this is about. She needs to go to the border.

It should have been obvious to Fauci when you interviewed him in January 20, just as this thing was starting to spread. If you go back throughout the course of the modern history of the Chinese Communist Party, their first instinct is to lie, to cover up, to control inflammation. And they have done that with aplomb throughout this crisis. Have they made people available, the people who got sick or who were working at the Wuhan Institute of Virology? No. Have they provided data to us and the WHO? No. And for Fauci to say that, it's a good thing that he's unfireable.

The interests of the party, the interests of the state trump everything else. We don't know if that happened.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Republican, under President Trump, tax cuts, did the opposite. By lowering our tax rate, redesigning our tax code, we leapfrogged to the most competitive economy in the world.

But the problem is, all of them land one way or another on working families. As you know, corporates -- corporations don't pay taxes. They collect them. And so those taxes land on, the burden lands on the workers in the company, the families who've invested for their retirement, the communities where those companies are located."

So, Royal Caribbean, headquartered here in Port Miami, reversed its previous stance and now is saying, we're not going to require any cruise passengers absolutely have a vaccine. We still recommend it. But they don't have to be mandatory. You still don't have to wear masks on the ships. And you can go out and have some fun. Cruising, though, from Florida ports -- and that's Port of Miami, the cruise ship capital of the world, Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, and Port Canaveral, the top three ports, still remains in flux, because the state of Florida, led by Governor Ron DeSantis, has filed suit against the CDC, challenging its authority to mandate vaccinated passengers.

U.S. cruises from U.S. ports still at least a couple weeks ago away. The millennium left St. Maarten Saturday on its way to Barbados, where it is today, Curacao and Aruba. Since this is an international-only cruise, the CDC guidelines and recommendations don't apply. But, still, all passengers 16 and older and 100 percent of the crew had to be vaccinated, which is what the CDC wants and the industry has mostly gone along with. There was COVID testing available before boarding. And the ship is fully rigged with new air purifiers and an abundance of disinfectant and cleaning. We spoke with a guy who is on the boat. And he says it's wonderful. It's 30 percent packed, which is pretty much like an empty cruise ship, like a private yacht, but that everybody on board is super happy to be cruising again, David."

Dr. Bob Lahita from the Institute of Autoimmune and Rheumatic Diseases, director at St. Joseph's Health is here to discuss this. So, Doctor, I'm not going to ask you to get into legal stuff, a lot of which judges are having difficulty to figure out now, whether the CDC has the power to do this. But can you blame Governor DeSantis, after all of the missteps that the CDC has made just on masks alone, one time saying one thing and next week saying another, one week saying that kids outside in summer camps have to wear masks, the next week saying, indoors, you don't have to wear? I mean, there have been so many mixed messages from the CDC. DeSantis is saying, hey, we're going to with our standards, not the CDC's."

If these were FDA-approved solidly, I guess there would be some legal ground to mandate them. But I don't think, based on Governor DeSantis' experience opening up Florida, I think is a wonderful thing. And he's been exceedingly successful in doing this. So I think, if you get on a cruise ship these days, and you know you're not vaccinated, that's your decision. If you want to take that chance, that's fine. I'm presuming the CDC thinks this is like a goldfish bowl, where everybody is a captive audience on the ship. But I think people are smart enough to realize that..."

Now this new monoclonal is supposed to be effective. I think that the FDA is a little split on the data. Some of the committee members did not think it was that efficacious.

Here to discuss is retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis. Colonel, good to see you. First of all, this is good news. I mean, we were able to somehow break through to the hackers' source of income, if you will, and retrieve some of it. There hasn't been any sign of any arrests, though.

So, this is a very serious cyber national security issue. And it just doesn't impact our economy, which is robbing us blind, but it impacts our national security in a broader way as well."

Well, when the president announced, and he wouldn't answer the question of whether he advised Colonial to pay the ransom, a lot of people were critical saying, gee, they shouldn't have paid, because you don't pay for - - pay ransom to a terrorist. And this is a similar situation. But could there have been -- or maybe I'm giving them too much credit -- some knowledge that paying the ransom, and then finding a backdoor in to retrieving it back might have been the plan from the beginning?"

Now, I wouldn't put it past certain governments, some of the rogue governments, the North Koreas, even the Irans of the world, to use proxies to cause this to happen. I'm more concerned, Dave, about not just the economic impact, but the national impact in terms of taking down our very infrastructure.
