      "sentences": "Good evening, guys. Bret, Martha, 24 hours ago, we were standing in this very studio and we told the audience   that this was an election unlike any other because of the massive amount of mail-in ballots in. The initial impression may not be the final conclusion,  remember that the twists and the turns as we go.  We might be in for a few more tonight. Let's see, OK. So, here is what is on the board at the moment. Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and Nevada. I can tell you after talking to the Trump campaign tonight, a lot   of people want to know why can't you call Georgia?  You got a four percent of the vote outstanding, the president has about 1.2 advantage percentage point here. A lot of the vote here in Atlanta is in,  that's Fulton County. A lot of the vote here in the cabinet, it appeared to  be in as well and that's really the Democratic heartbeat of the state of Georgia.  The Trump campaign believes it's closer than they would like however they feel they're going to win. They also believe they are \"confident\" about   keeping North Carolina. Again, a race at the moment that's just about a  point plus out of reach. Nevada, what's happening out there? (INAUDIBLE) the Pennsylvania that will --   Let's go to Nevada and see what's happening here. What we're hearing from the Trump -- you got about 8,000 advantage for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. So, why can't you call the state? They started counting again late today   that was a little quicker than we thought. We went to bed earlier this  morning. We thought that wasn't going to happen on Thursday. The Trump campaign is saying they can start making up some of these  ballots. This is Las Vegas down where Clark County. Reno was up here. There's a big rally here in Douglas County just about a week ago.  And you can see the votes here that are coming in. You're about 80 percent  of the ballots that have come in from Douglas County. Same down here in  Mineral County about -- well, about 80 percent of. So, the -- clearly there's more numbers that come in here. Just pop on down  here, it's the same situation. If you look at, it's 80-85 percent, so there's more votes coming in. And that's where -- they believe they can make up ground. This however is that -- this is the coin of the realm, this is Clark  County, this is Las Vegas, this is a lot of ways where you determine  winners and losers and the state of Nevada. Joe Biden at 53 percent, Donald Trump 45. How was that four years ago? Just on a percentage basis. Well, Hillary Clinton 55, almost 56. On a percentage  basis, Donald Trump is doing better in Clark County as of tonight. Here's the catch though, this is up here, this is Reno, he was down here, Washoe County here. This was Hillary Clinton's tab from four years ago and now we see where we are tonight.   On a percentage basis anyway, Joe Biden is doing better than Donald Trump, so that gives us the hesitation in Nevada. They're counting them as we speak and as we go through the night tonight, we'll see whether or not we can make a call on Nevada or whether were cast into another sphere in this  election in 2020 guys, back to you.",

We're taking the time to make sure that in this new system that went into place the end of last year that all the votes are being counted. Again, the vote is central to our democracy. It's how we all choose the people to be our public servants. This is the hiring process, the election. We have to have fair elections, and those elections have to be free of external influences. We need to have confidence that people are choosing their leaders and that the leaders are not choosing the people who vote for them. We need to make sure that the voters are choosing the leaders, not the other way around. Elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and our commonwealth and our country thrive when people freely exercise this franchise. And that's why it's essential that every eligible vote -- every eligible vote is counted in this election and in every election. We've seen efforts across the country to undermine this election and to block -- to block the counting of votes. This afternoon, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit to stop the counting of ballots in Pennsylvania. That is simply wrong. It goes against the most basic principles of our democracy. It takes away the right of every American citizen to cast their vote and to choose our leaders. Our election officials at the state and local level should be free to do their jobs without fear, without intimidation, without attacks. These attempts to subvert the democratic process are simply disgraceful. We're going to fight every single attempt to disenfranchise voters. We will continue to administer free and fair elections in Pennsylvania. Let me be clear, in Pennsylvania, every vote is going to count. I'm going to fight like hell to protect the vote of every Pennsylvanian. I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that every vote counts because in Pennsylvania, every voice matters, every vote matters. Thank you.

And so, just a couple of days ago, November 2nd, was the 100th anniversary of the first election that those suffragists got to vote in and how -- and I think when Governor Wolf was talking about how much we cherish and will fight for every voter's right to vote, I think about the suffragists, and it's really been an inspiration all year long to be in this position and to be working to make sure that every single voter of all backgrounds. And I should say, you know, we had -- 100 years ago, it was 19th Amendment, and then, of course, there were decades longer that voters of color were still denied the right to vote, and it took, you know, civil rights activists the -- you know, incredible struggles and tragedies, and triumphs that led to President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And I just -- I take all of this with me every day in this job to make sure that we ensure that every single qualified and eligible voter has the opportunity to vote.

Where we are right now, where we may be going here with the challenges that the Trump campaign is bringing forward? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  First of all, it looks pretty tough for the Trump campaign right now. He needs to win some states. Georgia and North Carolina are not in the bag yet. He needs to win both of those, then he needs to win Pennsylvania, then he still need something else. They think they have a good chance in Arizona, perhaps in Nevada. They need one of those. So that's an uphill fight right there. As far as these challenges are concerned, the Trump campaign has every right to demand what they call meaningful access to the process of vote counting. That is really something they should have. They have every right to file for a recount. But in the next few days, at the same time, they are going to need to produce some examples of irregularities, of problems in the counting, of significant issues in this vote count that could possibly affect the election. They are going to need to produce those maybe in a court document or maybe just in a news conference, but to give us some examples of what they see going on.",

I think every vote should be counted. We should even try to recover votes that have been lost or fraud or intentional negligence. But if you are the Biden campaign, you have to feel good. So let's assume he wins, and I want all of them to be counted, and we'll see what happens. The great thing about last night was that the country spoke in a loud, loud way. There was a lot of noise in the campaign, some of it contentious, some of it really harmonious, most of it not harmonious. But the American people spoke and gave the Democrats fewer seats in the majority of the House, gave Republicans maybe on less seat in the Senate in their majority. And it looks like they have replaced their president. And you're replaced the president with a guy whose strength, his greatest strength in politics has always been working across the aisle. If we're going to accomplish much in the nation in the next few years with a divided Congress, a narrowly divided Congress, and a different person in the White House, a different party, this might be the set up that the country needs in order to unleash perhaps an era of compromise and problem- solving.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  Right, the Biden campaign wants stats to be called in their favor so they can start declaring that they have won the Electoral College vote, which will be in December. The Trump campaign, for its part, feels very confident that it has won Pennsylvania, and they also feel confident about Arizona. And they have a rational case for why that may be, and we will see as those votes are counted. The reason why it's important to actually have those votes be counted is because, prior to yesterday, we were told that Biden would win in a blowout, that Democrats had an extremely strong case for taking over control of the Senate, that Democrats would gain and strengthen their majority in the House. And when votes were counted, what we saw was that Florida went overwhelmingly for President Trump, contrary to what we were told, that not only did the senators in Maine and Iowa and North Carolina not lose their seats, but that the Republicans kept their majority in the Senate. Susan Collins did not lose by 12 points, but in fact is winning by eight point. And that Republicans are actually gaining seats in the House, including 11 new women elected to Congress. We are learning that in states not just in Florida, but Texas and other states, that Donald Trump seriously increased the Republican share of the minority vote. Donald Trump through this enthusiastic campaign he ran and reaching out to minority voters is on track to get the largest percentage of minority votes of any Republican in 60 years. And so what we were told by the media and by Democratic activists versus the reality of what is happening in the field is different. And so I think people need to wait and just see how these votes play out before rushing to any judgment.",

      "utterance": "Good evening, guys. Bret, Martha, 24 hours ago, we were standing in this very studio and we told the audience that this was an election unlike any other because of the massive amount of mail-in ballots in. The initial impression may not be the final conclusion, remember that the twists and the turns as we go. We might be in for a few more tonight. Let's see, OK. So, here is what is on the board at the moment. Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia and Nevada. I can tell you after talking to the Trump campaign tonight, a lot of people want to know why can't you call Georgia? You got a four percent of the vote outstanding, the president has about 1.2 advantage percentage point here. A lot of the vote here in Atlanta is in, that's Fulton County. A lot of the vote here in the cabinet, it appeared to be in as well and that's really the Democratic heartbeat of the state of Georgia. The Trump campaign believes it's closer than they would like however they feel they're going to win. They also believe they are \"confident\" about keeping North Carolina. Again, a race at the moment that's just about a point plus out of reach. Nevada, what's happening out there? (INAUDIBLE) the Pennsylvania that will -- Let's go to Nevada and see what's happening here. What we're hearing from the Trump -- you got about 8,000 advantage for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. So, why can't you call the state? They started counting again late today that was a little quicker than we thought. We went to bed earlier this morning. We thought that wasn't going to happen on Thursday. The Trump campaign is saying they can start making up some of these ballots. This is Las Vegas down where Clark County. Reno was up here. There's a big rally here in Douglas County just about a week ago. And you can see the votes here that are coming in. You're about 80 percent of the ballots that have come in from Douglas County. Same down here in Mineral County about -- well, about 80 percent of. So, the -- clearly there's more numbers that come in here. Just pop on down here, it's the same situation. If you look at, it's 80-85 percent, so there's more votes coming in. And that's where -- they believe they can make up ground. This however is that -- this is the coin of the realm, this is Clark County, this is Las Vegas, this is a lot of ways where you determine winners and losers and the state of Nevada. Joe Biden at 53 percent, Donald Trump 45. How was that four years ago? Just on a percentage basis. Well, Hillary Clinton 55, almost 56. On a percentage basis, Donald Trump is doing better in Clark County as of tonight. Here's the catch though, this is up here, this is Reno, he was down here, Washoe County here. This was Hillary Clinton's tab from four years ago and now we see where we are tonight. On a percentage basis anyway, Joe Biden is doing better than Donald Trump, so that gives us the hesitation in Nevada. They're counting them as we speak and as we go through the night tonight, we'll see whether or not we can make a call on Nevada or whether were cast into another sphere in this election in 2020 guys, back to you."

They moved it back three days and allow the receipt of ballots beyond what the state legislature had set. We're also asking for meaningful access in Pennsylvania so that our poll watchers can see what is actually happening. We don't know why these Democrat operatives in these election locations are blocking us from watching that. And again, when we go back to Arizona, Pennsylvania follows Arizona.

You had people who had voted in the wrong precinct and had the poll workers and a giant stack of ballots correcting that, filling in the correct precinct number, and then, casting those votes on behalf of the voters. That's against the law. You can't do things like that. You have people boarding up the windows of polling locations so that our poll watchers can't get in. Republican poll watchers being kicked out. You have cases where ballots were damaged and they had people coming in to actually hand transcribe the filled-out ballots onto blank ballots on behalf of voters who had already gone away and were outside of the polling location and gone about their day.

All we want to do is to ensure that these elections are free and fair. The president wants every eligible voter to be able to vote, vote once, and have that vote counted.

It's not surprising, as I've said before, that this election, the returns are taken a little longer than we're used to, but that's actually a good sign. Part of the reason for that is because so many more people have voted. And it does met -- mean that, that votes in Pennsylvania are actually being counted. We're taking the time to make sure that in this new system that went into place the end of last year that all the votes are being counted. Again, the vote is central to our democracy. It's how we all choose the people to be our public servants. This is the hiring process, the election. We have to have fair elections, and those elections have to be free of external influences. We need to have confidence that people are choosing their leaders and that the leaders are not choosing the people who vote for them. We need to make sure that the voters are choosing the leaders, not the other way around. Elections are the bedrock of our democracy, and our commonwealth and our country thrive when people freely exercise this franchise. And that's why it's essential that every eligible vote -- every eligible vote is counted in this election and in every election. We've seen efforts across the country to undermine this election and to block -- to block the counting of votes. This afternoon, the Trump campaign filed a lawsuit to stop the counting of ballots in Pennsylvania. That is simply wrong. It goes against the most basic principles of our democracy. It takes away the right of every American citizen to cast their vote and to choose our leaders. Our election officials at the state and local level should be free to do their jobs without fear, without intimidation, without attacks. These attempts to subvert the democratic process are simply disgraceful. We're going to fight every single attempt to disenfranchise voters. We will continue to administer free and fair elections in Pennsylvania. Let me be clear, in Pennsylvania, every vote is going to count. I'm going to fight like hell to protect the vote of every Pennsylvanian. I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure that every vote counts because in Pennsylvania, every voice matters, every vote matters. Thank you. Now, I'm going to turn it over to secretary of state who's done a phenomenal job of making this election, I think as smooth as any election I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot of elections in Pennsylvania. Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar."

Our amazing county election directors and personnel across the commonwealth once again just put in incredible hours and time and energy and patience and attention to detail to make sure that they could proceed with counting hundreds and hundreds of thousands of ballots. They've made excellent progress, they're still working. Department of State are still working all back at our operations center. I'm going to be going back there after this and we will be continuing to work into the night, all of us to support the counties to get this done. So, I expect you know hundreds of thousands more probably to be counted still tonight. So, you could keep watch on the election night. Returns web site, and you know, at this point, I think we're actually probably a little bit ahead of where I thought we would be, which is great. So, stay tuned. But still thinking, you know, we're talking about a matter of days before the overwhelming majority of ballots are counted in. You know, I was thinking the other day, just a couple of days ago was the 100th anniversary -- you know, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment this year. And so, just a couple of days ago, November 2nd, was the 100th anniversary of the first election that those suffragists got to vote in and how -- and I think when Governor Wolf was talking about how much we cherish and will fight for every voter's right to vote, I think about the suffragists, and it's really been an inspiration all year long to be in this position and to be working to make sure that every single voter of all backgrounds. And I should say, you know, we had -- 100 years ago, it was 19th Amendment, and then, of course, there were decades longer that voters of color were still denied the right to vote, and it took, you know, civil rights activists the -- you know, incredible struggles and tragedies, and triumphs that led to President Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And I just -- I take all of this with me every day in this job to make sure that we ensure that every single qualified and eligible voter has the opportunity to vote. And I'm so thankful to work for Governor Wolf, who is incredibly dedicated to that mission as well. So, we will continue to fight for every Pennsylvanian for their vote to be counted. And thank you all for being here and we're happy to take questions."

The key difference is that Joe is asking for every vote to be counted. He's not seeking to stop any of these counts.

You know, digging into what's going on there a little bit, there's a dispute going on between the state legislature in Pennsylvania, and the secretary of state, and the people who are running that vote. They never liked this whole construct of being able to have these ballots come in after November 3rd and to continue to count them. So, they're having sort of interesting warfare in Pennsylvania over how this should be conducted. So, it's not that they -- that the campaigns don't want them to be counted, is that they want the opportunity for that to play out. And then after they have, you know, you also heard they want to have the observation rights that, that would all be able to go forward. It's not that they want it to stop forever, it's just that they want to pause it, and let that play out. Do you believe that it is fair and right for both sides to be able to observe the vote?

There's paper ballots and they're 25 feet away from them. So, do you agree that they should have the opportunity to get in there and to watch?

Many of us think that this ongoing pandemic is a significant public health problem, and it is largely the result of President Trump's bundled mishandling of the pandemic. There are many others who think the number one issue is reopening and reviving the economy, and they don't ascribe any blame to the president for the pandemic, and its impact on the economy. Joe Biden, earlier today, gave a speech about being a president for all Americans, for fighting hard for those who voted for him and who voted against him, for trying to bring our country together, to deal with both the pandemic and the recession, and to try and heal some of the divisions in our country. I do think that the results of these elections, presidential and congressional, point to a very sharply divided country, and that's why I've always supported Joe Biden, someone who sees our divisions and tries to heal them, rather than our president, who I think tries to sharpen them."

The president needs to make up the deficit of roughly 100,000 votes. It primarily from Maricopa County. Maricopa County is a county where Biden is doing well. The president needs to get basically 60 percent of that outstanding vote in order to overtake or tie Joe Biden. We don't believe he is going to get more than 45, 46 percent of that vote. What you have to appreciate is that voters in Maricopa County tended to be more Biden voters than Trump voters. Voters who voted by mail, and the bulk of this vote is the mail-in vote, tended to be even stronger for Biden than the Election Day in-person vote. I do not ascribe any significance to his point that they mailed it on Election Day, therefore they are Election Day voters."

And we know in places like North Carolina, the mail-in vote was strongly for Biden, a much stronger than you generally see in terms of the difference between mail-in and in-person vote. And so there is a possibility, a sufficient possibility to prevent a call that actually Vice President Biden might catch up some to the president. North Carolina is probably the president's best chance of winning a state that's outstanding."

Green Bay early votes also favored Biden. By sunrise, the president's 100,000 vote lead had dwindled to a 20,000 vote deficit to Joe Biden. Late in the afternoon, Little Willow, Wisconsin, became the final township to post their results.

But the fact is that he is making the valid objections to the process, but they really need to tamp down this rhetoric. We don't evidence of widespread fraud in Pennsylvania. We do have irregularities in various states. We do have laws that were changed shortly before the election. Pennsylvania has a serious issue in terms of those laws being changed shortly before the election that went to the Supreme Court, and Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the liberal justices in a tied vote. And it sort of kick that can down the road. That can may come rattling back to the Supreme Court as these legislators say that we want a ruling on the merits. We wrote the law one way, and then suddenly it was changed by judicial fiat."

      "utterance": "Let's bring in our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr. Byron, let's start with you. Where we are right now, where we may be going here with the challenges that the Trump campaign is bringing forward? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  First of all, it looks pretty tough for the Trump campaign right now. He needs to win some states. Georgia and North Carolina are not in the bag yet. He needs to win both of those, then he needs to win Pennsylvania, then he still need something else. They think they have a good chance in Arizona, perhaps in Nevada. They need one of those. So that's an uphill fight right there. As far as these challenges are concerned, the Trump campaign has every right to demand what they call meaningful access to the process of vote counting. That is really something they should have. They have every right to file for a recount. But in the next few days, at the same time, they are going to need to produce some examples of irregularities, of problems in the counting, of significant issues in this vote count that could possibly affect the election. They are going to need to produce those maybe in a court document or maybe just in a news conference, but to give us some examples of what they see going on."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, great point. Harold Ford Jr., Michigan and Wisconsin in Joe Biden's column this afternoon. Your thoughts on how it is shaping up on the Democrats' side?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAROLD FORD JR. (D) FORMER TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "First, thanks for having me on. It puts him at 264 electoral votes. Obviously, Nevada, Pennsylvania, I agree with Byron's reaction to whether or not we should have counting. I think every vote should be counted. We should even try to recover votes that have been lost or fraud or intentional negligence. But if you are the Biden campaign, you have to feel good. So let's assume he wins, and I want all of them to be counted, and we'll see what happens. The great thing about last night was that the country spoke in a loud, loud way. There was a lot of noise in the campaign, some of it contentious, some of it really harmonious, most of it not harmonious. But the American people spoke and gave the Democrats fewer seats in the majority of the House, gave Republicans maybe on less seat in the Senate in their majority. And it looks like they have replaced their president. And you're replaced the president with a guy whose strength, his greatest strength in politics has always been working across the aisle. If we're going to accomplish much in the nation in the next few years with a divided Congress, a narrowly divided Congress, and a different person in the White House, a different party, this might be the set up that the country needs in order to unleash perhaps an era of compromise and problem- solving. So I'm relieved and I'm encouraged tonight as I listen and watch these numbers unfold."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Mollie, your thoughts? The president is obviously not stopping. He is not fighting - he's giving up as of yet. And Joe Biden has not gotten 270 as of yet. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  Right, the Biden campaign wants stats to be called in their favor so they can start declaring that they have won the Electoral College vote, which will be in December. The Trump campaign, for its part, feels very confident that it has won Pennsylvania, and they also feel confident about Arizona. And they have a rational case for why that may be, and we will see as those votes are counted. The reason why it's important to actually have those votes be counted is because, prior to yesterday, we were told that Biden would win in a blowout, that Democrats had an extremely strong case for taking over control of the Senate, that Democrats would gain and strengthen their majority in the House. And when votes were counted, what we saw was that Florida went overwhelmingly for President Trump, contrary to what we were told, that not only did the senators in Maine and Iowa and North Carolina not lose their seats, but that the Republicans kept their majority in the Senate. Susan Collins did not lose by 12 points, but in fact is winning by eight point. And that Republicans are actually gaining seats in the House, including 11 new women elected to Congress. We are learning that in states not just in Florida, but Texas and other states, that Donald Trump seriously increased the Republican share of the minority vote. Donald Trump through this enthusiastic campaign he ran and reaching out to minority voters is on track to get the largest percentage of minority votes of any Republican in 60 years. And so what we were told by the media and by Democratic activists versus the reality of what is happening in the field is different. And so I think people need to wait and just see how these votes play out before rushing to any judgment."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And just one quick thing, and people at home should know, and I just saw it on social media, that when a network or a news association calls a state, that does not mean any of the counting stops in any place. And the real vote is what determines the real election in that state."
