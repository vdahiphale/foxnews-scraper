COVID mandates are finally going away and Democrats say you should be thanking Joe Biden for getting your freedom back. If it sounds like a joke, sadly it's not. Despite the fact that the White House and CDC are not budging an inch from their mask mandates, liberals are demanding that you heap praise on the president.",

Next time, you know, you do something that makes your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your spouse angry, just say, hey, babe I was following the science. You'll see how far that gets you. It doesn't get you anywhere. What does that even mean? If the Democrats are doing what they are doing, are they following the science? And which science? The same science that started the pandemic? The mad scientist that cooked this thing up in the lab? A million Americans are dead. It's like the highest death toll, crushed families and small businesses and they're like, all right, here peasant, take your freedom back and here's a side of inflation. I don't like what's going on with the masks. What usually happens when you make someone put something on their body or on their face, it's very personal to do that. And you see that in the Army. They make you shave your head or gangs, they make you wear a collar or get a tattoo. And it's kind of like a soft kind of form of submission. Once you get some to do that to their body, it makes you able to control them a lot easier. So once they've gotten that down, Fauci even said that masks don't do anything. Its kind about getting the country in this -- in the zone where we were all on the same team to fight this thing together. And by the way, has anybody asked Fauci about the Johns Hopkins Study? I don't think anybody has asked him about that. Someone needs to -- maybe our very own stupid son of a bitch can ask him that next time.",

I think the White House trying to take credit and the Democrats, I understand why they are trying to do it, but I do find it a little bit hard to swallow. And they probably would have gone a lot farther if they would have said what a collective action, look at all that we did together. Thank you for wearing the mask. Thank you for getting vaccines. Thank you to the scientists who figured out the pills, the treatments, the monoclonal antibodies, all of those things. And let's move forward. I think that you're gearing up to see something probably before the Super Bowl weekend that's -- so that maybe Friday or Saturday from the CDC that says okay, actually, masks can be optional and you'll see if they'll try to do something so that the president when he does his interview with Lester Holy of NBC which is a traditional thing --",

If these prohibitions, the vaccine mandate and the mask mandate go away, it will be interesting to see what happens.

Next time, you know, you do something that makes your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your spouse angry, just say, hey, babe I was following the science. You'll see how far that gets you. It doesn't get you anywhere. What does that even mean? If the Democrats are doing what they are doing, are they following the science? And which science? The same science that started the pandemic? The mad scientist that cooked this thing up in the lab? A million Americans are dead. It's like the highest death toll, crushed families and small businesses and they're like, all right, here peasant, take your freedom back and here's a side of inflation. I don't like what's going on with the masks. What usually happens when you make someone put something on their body or on their face, it's very personal to do that. And you see that in the Army. They make you shave your head or gangs, they make you wear a collar or get a tattoo. And it's kind of like a soft kind of form of submission. Once you get some to do that to their body, it makes you able to control them a lot easier. So once they've gotten that down, Fauci even said that masks don't do anything. Its kind about getting the country in this -- in the zone where we were all on the same team to fight this thing together. And by the way, has anybody asked Fauci about the Johns Hopkins Study? I don't think anybody has asked him about that. Someone needs to -- maybe our very own stupid son of a bitch can ask him that next time."

I think the White House trying to take credit and the Democrats, I understand why they are trying to do it, but I do find it a little bit hard to swallow. And they probably would have gone a lot farther if they would have said what a collective action, look at all that we did together. Thank you for wearing the mask. Thank you for getting vaccines. Thank you to the scientists who figured out the pills, the treatments, the monoclonal antibodies, all of those things. And let's move forward. I think that you're gearing up to see something probably before the Super Bowl weekend that's -- so that maybe Friday or Saturday from the CDC that says okay, actually, masks can be optional and you'll see if they'll try to do something so that the president when he does his interview with Lester Holy of NBC which is a traditional thing --"

They were doing the best they could given the information they had. I think the demonizing of one side or the other is really pathetic. It will end and the test will be this. The people who are most against masks are the people who are against vaccination also. If these prohibitions, the vaccine mandate and the mask mandate go away, it will be interesting to see what happens. If the people who've been against masks and vaccines all along don't get sicker at an accelerated rate and then they don't die at an accelerated rate then they were right all along.

Trump had the added disadvantage of Joe and Kam trashing the vaccine which obviously led to tens of thousands of deaths. See I'm doing my best impression of a liberal when Trump was president. They have blood on their hands. I haven't said that in a few weeks. So that's what you would say if they're -- after they take the victory lap. I have an analogy. If-- where is it?

This is in Canberra, the Australian capital territory. These are amazing marsupials. They're native to Australia, much like every weird animal. Australia is just a country of weird animals.
