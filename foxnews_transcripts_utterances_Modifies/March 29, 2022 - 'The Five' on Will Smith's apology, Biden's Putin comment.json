And I came away really encouraged because the Bible does not sanitize their stories. There are some with real struggle, real destruction, and pain, and struggle. And I thought, listen, the last couple of years, everybody's gone through some measure of that some greater than others, but to see how God was working in each of those situations, that he was shepherding and guiding and not unaware of the suffering was really encouraging to me. So, I got to know all of these women better almost -- I'm feeling like I know them, and I hope readers will feel that way too.

They literally in the middle of the night grabbed what they had and took off because a madman was after them. And I was struck by that and reminded of that in watching these incredibly brave, courageous Ukrainian families, fathers staying to fight, mothers grabbing whatever they could packing up their children trying to get to safety, many of them flooding across borders with just the clothes and the toys that they could grab on the way out the door. And I love too, on the other side of that, that these Polish mothers in many train stations left empty baby carriages with clothes and supplies in them, just reminding us of the humanity that can come when we are in such dark suffering places. And the courage of these women, just like Mary was on the run with baby Jesus, and God knew every one of her struggles and twists and turns, I'm convinced that he is ever-present in our lives today.

I've been struck by hearing from missionaries and different NGOs and people that are working in that region to help on both sides of the border. And we've gotten videos and texts from missionaries there showing people gathered in subways and in basements singing hymns together, trying to encourage each other in their faith, and finding great comfort and strength in that.

Her job instead of blaming the police and saying the city of Chicago is traumatized because of the police, she should know from her own statistics that when she stopped defunding the police and decided to somewhat up the budget from not to where it was, but a little bit from where she defunded it, crime started to go down a teeny bit. She understands that police on the streets are what stops crime. And so she has a right to have her own, you know, security detail. I had a security detail when I was a D.A.

Have Ricky Gervais hosted after six pints. Let's -- this is the only way it's going to save the Oscars.

He took down Jada Pinkett Smith when he hosted the Oscars five years ago quite personally and quite nasally. And that would have been in I'm sure the mind of what was going on. But you know, I'm hearing now, we've got to take away his Oscar. Really? Really? Let's remind ourselves, you have standing ovations. The Oscars crowd gave Roman Polanski a standing ovation, led by Meryl Streep after he was convicted of being a pedophile. He then went on the run. He remains on the run. And he's still got his Oscar. Harvey Weinstein in his cell has got his Oscars, right? The idea we're going to take away Will Smith's Best Actor Oscar for a brilliant performance and a great movie -- and I feel sorry for the Williams sisters, actually, because their story has been overtaken.

And I came away really encouraged because the Bible does not sanitize their stories. There are some with real struggle, real destruction, and pain, and struggle. And I thought, listen, the last couple of years, everybody's gone through some measure of that some greater than others, but to see how God was working in each of those situations, that he was shepherding and guiding and not unaware of the suffering was really encouraging to me.

They literally in the middle of the night grabbed what they had and took off because a madman was after them. And I was struck by that and reminded of that in watching these incredibly brave, courageous Ukrainian families, fathers staying to fight, mothers grabbing whatever they could packing up their children trying to get to safety, many of them flooding across borders with just the clothes and the toys that they could grab on the way out the door. And I love too, on the other side of that, that these Polish mothers in many train stations left empty baby carriages with clothes and supplies in them, just reminding us of the humanity that can come when we are in such dark suffering places. And the courage of these women, just like Mary was on the run with baby Jesus, and God knew every one of her struggles and twists and turns, I'm convinced that he is ever-present in our lives today. And these Ukrainian women are just so inspiring, watching them do what they have to do and being so brave in the process."

I've been struck by hearing from missionaries and different NGOs and people that are working in that region to help on both sides of the border. And we've gotten videos and texts from missionaries there showing people gathered in subways and in basements singing hymns together, trying to encourage each other in their faith, and finding great comfort and strength in that.

She was the first of 25 WACS to land in the Philippines. She was on the Intrepid at Leyte Gulf with MacArthur, excuse me, and was awarded the Philippine Liberation Medal. She just turned 100 a couple of weeks ago. She has three children, eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren. Congratulations, Justine. What a life."
