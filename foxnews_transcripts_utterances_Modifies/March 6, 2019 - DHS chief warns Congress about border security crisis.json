You look back at the months and where that stands, the southwest border family unit apprehensions, 2019 so far, 136,000. There is 2018 total for the year -- 107,000. It is obviously just March. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review.\" Charlie, obviously these stats are pretty telling. \"The New York Times\" ran a frontpage piece saying that this in fact is essentially a crisis in its headline.  CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, and the numbers are particularly dizzying because there are just so many ways of measuring it. The one thing that I think everyone can agree upon is that we do not have operational control of the border. The cartels are so in charge at the border, the human smuggling cartels are the same people that smuggle drugs across the border. And they are our stories that we heard over the last couple of days of where the cartels will actually send groups of people that they are smuggling across the border in order to divert attention away from other areas of the border so that they can send the drugs, the more valuable drugs, across in other places and get the drug safely into the country.   It is pretty terrifying. And the idea that we are sitting here in Washington and arguing about whether this is a crisis or whether this is an emergency is, I think, pretty mindboggling to regular Americans who are watching this. And they don't particularly -- aren't necessarily opposed to illegal immigration, but they think that, gee, this is a real problem.",

I kind of disagree with both of my colleagues here, though, I want to say in that I think part of the problem is why we are arguing about a crisis, and as you pointed out, \"The New York Times\" pointed out there is a crisis at the border, but it's a humanitarian crisis. It's a huge humanitarian crisis because of the nature of the kind of people who are trying to come across the border has changed over the last 10 years to be these families instead of single, able-bodied Mexican men looking for work.  And yes, I agree there are a lot of anecdotes that are scary about drugs, but that's the problem is that the Trump administration's case about why it is a crisis is sort of factually challenged. He wants to say it's basically an invasion of drug dealing henchmen straight out of Chuck Norris movie, when in reality it is a bunch of babies and kids and whatnot, and some cartels taking advantage of the chaos.",

      "utterance": "The Homeland Security Secretary up on Capitol Hill today with a lot of stats. Total southwest border apprehensions, if you look at 2019, February, 76,103. You look back at the months and where that stands, the southwest border family unit apprehensions, 2019 so far, 136,000. There is 2018 total for the year -- 107,000. It is obviously just March. Let's bring in our panel, Charles Hurt, opinion editor for \"The Washington Times,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review.\" Charlie, obviously these stats are pretty telling. \"The New York Times\" ran a frontpage piece saying that this in fact is essentially a crisis in its headline. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": Yes, and the numbers are particularly dizzying because there are just so many ways of measuring it. The one thing that I think everyone can agree upon is that we do not have operational control of the border. The cartels are so in charge at the border, the human smuggling cartels are the same people that smuggle drugs across the border. And they are our stories that we heard over the last couple of days of where the cartels will actually send groups of people that they are smuggling across the border in order to divert attention away from other areas of the border so that they can send the drugs, the more valuable drugs, across in other places and get the drug safely into the country. It is pretty terrifying. And the idea that we are sitting here in Washington and arguing about whether this is a crisis or whether this is an emergency is, I think, pretty mindboggling to regular Americans who are watching this. And they don't particularly -- aren't necessarily opposed to illegal immigration, but they think that, gee, this is a real problem."

      "utterance": "That is a separate argument, to say whether it's not a crisis or not. The border, crossings at border have spiked. Apprehensions of drugs have spiked. The question is, what is the appropriate remedy? Congress had a big debate and they passed a funding bill that included a lot of things, more detention beds, more this and more that. But they didn't give the president one thing that he really wanted, which is money for a wall. And now he has declared a national emergency so that he can spend unobligated Pentagon funds on a wall. That is what we are arguing about."

JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": I don't think so. These numbers don't change anyone's minds on Capitol Hill, I don't think. I kind of disagree with both of my colleagues here, though, I want to say in that I think part of the problem is why we are arguing about a crisis, and as you pointed out, \"The New York Times\" pointed out there is a crisis at the border, but it's a humanitarian crisis. It's a huge humanitarian crisis because of the nature of the kind of people who are trying to come across the border has changed over the last 10 years to be these families instead of single, able-bodied Mexican men looking for work. And yes, I agree there are a lot of anecdotes that are scary about drugs, but that's the problem is that the Trump administration's case about why it is a crisis is sort of factually challenged. He wants to say it's basically an invasion of drug dealing henchmen straight out of Chuck Norris movie, when in reality it is a bunch of babies and kids and whatnot, and some cartels taking advantage of the chaos."

Anti-Semitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and it's inconceivable they will not act to condemn it!\" Well, \"the Washington Post\" reporter, many other people on Twitter took issue with that tweet, saying \"I try not to quote tweet the tweets so much anymore, but honestly it was literally just 19 months ago that marchers in Charlottesville chanted \"Jews will not replace us,\" and then the president responded by saying there were very fine people on both sides.\" So that is both sides on the Twitter-verse.

And they also are driven absolutely bonkers when they feel that the president does not get the same kind of criticism that they do. But the point is this criticism is internal. It is one thing to criticize the Netanyahu government or to say the policies of Israel are bad. But it's another thing to say that people who support Israel have an allegiance to a foreign government, which is an age-old anti-Semitic trope."

The Democrats now are bending over backwards because they have to include anti-Islamophobic language. And you saw Chuck Schumer talking about I didn't like the language about Muslims either. They are doing the exact same thing they called racist when people did it about Black Lives Matter. And it just shows you that the Democratic Party, this is canary in the coalmine for the Democratic Party. This is going to be a problem of the Corbyn-ization of the Democrats going forward for a while, and they better figure out how to deal with it now."
