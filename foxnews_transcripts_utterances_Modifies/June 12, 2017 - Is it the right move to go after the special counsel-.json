The world is going to hell in a hand basket with North Korea, with the Russians, with Qatar, with the Persian Gulf.

      "utterance": "That is a big shift. Three weeks ago, the same person said \"Robert Mueller, superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity. Media should now calm down.\" I am guessing that that turn comes from Comey's testimony about producing the leak that led to, he said he wanted to form a special counsel."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "First of all, people keep saying that Mueller is a man beyond reproach and that he will do a very good job. It is also true that he's very good friends with Comey who now appears like he might be a target of a proper investigation, and that that friendship and that history that Mueller and Comey have might cause problems in terms of actually getting to the bottom of what includes a coordinated leak campaign by intelligence officials. And so it might be too much to ask Mueller to actually dig into his friend. And so I don't how they're going to resolve that. But something needs to be done so people can have confidence in this investigation and that doesn't just run roughshod."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, but is it the right move to go after the guy who was the special counsel? Even if there is a connection, is that the right move strategically? Usually in prosecutions that's not really what the lawyers advise the other side to do is to go after the investigator."

    {
      "speaker": "PALMER",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think this is going to be tough for them, right, because how are they going to remove Mueller, somebody who has been widely praised by senators on both sides of the aisle. He's going to be the guy who is going to take this out of the political fight and actually find out what has happened here. So I think the real question is, there is nobody who's going to be able to say, oh, he's not going to be able to do it unless he himself wants to recuse himself, I think."

      "utterance": "I want to play one more sound bite. And this was largely overlooked from the weekend. This is Senator Dianne Feinstein being asked a question about what also came out in the Comey hearings, and that is about the former attorney general Loretta Lynch and what she told him about the Clinton email investigation. This is Feinstein's reaction to that."

      "speaker": "SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "I would have a queasy feeling, too, though, to be candid here. I think we need to know more about that, and there's only one way to know about it, and that's to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "utterance": "I thought that was a refreshing moment where somebody, and I am surprised it was her, stepped out of the role of partisan and said there could be something here against my people and let's investigate it. I think we are getting lost in a hall of mirrors investigation, counter investigation on both sides. The world is going to hell in a hand basket with North Korea, with the Russians, with Qatar, with the Persian Gulf. I mean, we are sitting on a powder keg, and we are utterly absorbed and obsessed with what I think are reflections of reflections of reflections. Yes, it's an interesting question about Loretta Lynch. That was a long time ago. The only reason it's being raised is because in the context here you want to be fair and balanced, to coin a phrase. But I think it's not going to produce anything of substance in the end. At least we have not seen any evidence of that. And I would let -- I give a general amnesty. Ask the pope to do it, and let's get on with the business of the country."
