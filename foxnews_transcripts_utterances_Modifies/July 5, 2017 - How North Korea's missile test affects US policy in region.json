The North Korean regime openly states that its missiles are intended to deliver nuclear weapons to strike cities in the United States, South Korea, and Japan. And now it has greater capacity to do so.  The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies. One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must. But we prefer not to have to go in that direction.  We will not forget and we will not delay.",

Nikki Haley also put military options on the table as well. We know that H.R. McMaster has had President Trump asked for a military plan.
