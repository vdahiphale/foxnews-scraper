They had there people in the meeting. Manafort, Kushner and Trump, Jr. And none of them happen to remember this until they were presented by the information by the press? But now that we have this information. I think it also shows that it was two days after President Trump had secured the nomination.

She didn't have it and pivot it to the Russian human rights adoption deal and they were like, all right, later, I'll see. And the whole thing was set-up by this Democratic firm that was connected to the fake Trump-Russian dossier. So, that could be a set up. We don't even know that. Also Jared and Paul Manafort, the campaign manager at the time did volunteer this contact. When they were asked about it by investigators, it didn't come out randomly, it was volunteered. And I will tell you some other things, you know what else is a little more sketchy than I think in this?"

They call her now. Because she said she never met with the Russian ambassador. It turns out she had dinner at his house, called him on the phone and donated to his charity. So, I think we need to pump the brakes a little bit on the story. And if it gets too hot, I would reopen the Hillary Clinton email investigation and I would do it tomorrow."

I think if Don Jr. had been upfront about it and said, I had this meeting when he was first asked about it, he said no, no. No such meeting. You had nobody. It wasn't until people who are in the White House which is an interesting part of the story. This story comes from people in the White House who saw some of these disclosure forms and then said to reporters, hey, guess what, Don Jr. was involved. So, you guys think, wait, this is coming from inside the Trump White House? That's weird. But the second part is, that you have people like Paul Manafort. Paul Manafort as the campaign chairman, taking time to go into this meeting. And what Richard Payner (ph), the lawyer for the Bush folks said, hey, you don't get your opposition research from spies. That's nuts. That's clearly un-American. Bill Clinton's White House lawyer also say there's nothing here."

He is 34 years old and he's one of the only active-duty troops to be charged with ties to a terror group in recent memory. According to Kang's army service record, he served in Iraq, Afghanistan and Korea as an air traffic control operator with the 25th combat aviation brigade in the 25th Infantry Division. FBI special agent in charge Paul Delacort issued the following statement tonight. \"Kang has been under investigation by the U.S. Army and the FBI for over a year. FBI assets and army investigative resources were continuously deployed to ensure the public safety during the course of this investigation and Kang's eventual arrest. A criminal complaint is being filed today in the district court of Hawaii, alleging that Kang swore allegiance to ISIS attempted to provide military documents to ISIS and attempted to provide training to the terrorist organization. The FBI believes that Kang was a lone actor -- Dana."

Which is very attractive if you're looking for salvation. It makes things easier for a shamed man. And I think this is why the ideology was so attractive and pernicious. Christianity -- most religions -- time redemption to peaceful means. To becoming a better person. We are dealing with a doctrine that redemption is tied to martyrdom. So, to get to heaven, you got to take out a lot of people. And that's what's creating a murderous death cult and why it was so important that when you find somebody like this -- they are a time bomb. You got to pull them off."

Like you said, air traffic control, that's dangerous. I can't imagine what he could have possibly done or allowed to have happen on our soil. And I just also Kimberly would like to applaud the S.W.A.T. team, the U.S. army and the FBI investigators for making sure this didn't become a Fort Hood situation. Also, I want to say, a lot of times and I am guilty of this too. I say, you know, the FBI did this, the FBI did that, and you kind of disparage them when it comes to the Hillary thing or the Comey thing. But, you know, the rank and file are out there every day trying to protect innocent civilians from radical Islam. I also want to say another thing.

But what I'm really fascinated by again is he is active duty, it's the first time this is happened. So, we've had reality winner before if you remember.

We had a few people who may be like peacock around a little bit but it was never really like this. I would probably ignore him. I think that might be the best way to deal with him.

Everything was a softball question. But this is really about his peers and impressing your peers, you know, speaking truth to power is only brave when there is a risk. If you risk the support of your peers, that's pretty cool. That means like speaking truth to power to Obama when everybody there loved Obama.

There's no excuse to not get this put through. Communicate. Explain it well to the American people. Explain it well at home.

Secretary Mattis agreed. He spent 45 minutes with them. They covered all sorts of topics from what students should be learning in high school, criticism of the Obama administration, America's role in rebuilding Arab countries and Mattis told Fisher that he agreed to the interview because like Fisher, he grew up in Washington State and was interested in passing along what he learned to the young people, didn't repeat the mistake of those before him.
