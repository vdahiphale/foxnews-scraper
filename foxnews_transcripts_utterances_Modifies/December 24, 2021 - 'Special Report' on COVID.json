Again, they always have more money, Bret. They burn it in the streets, it seems like. We just have enough to make sure that we can support great candidates, which we have a record number of candidates already filed for office as Republicans, even in a redistricting year, and get out that winning message, which is all about the economy, rising costs.

She barely got by. In fact, in both races that she has won, she won with less than 50 percent of the vote. This is a pick-up seat for us. Plus, the incumbent, we don't play in primaries. We trust the voters to decide who the best voice for them is. But when it comes to winning this seat next fall, look, it is ripe for the Republicans to pick up, not just because it is a Republican seat, but because the incumbent, she currently is under investigation for about half-a-million dollars in trades that she did not disclose.

I think she lost by two points to the incumbent Vicente Gonzalez. And rather than run in his seat again, Texas 15, which, by the way, this seat where McAllen, Texas is located. McAllen Texas, you might recall, Bret, within the past few months elected a Republican mayor for the first time in something like 80 years. Rather than run for reelection in the seat, Vicente Gonzalez decided to move next door to Texas 34 in a seat that he thinks is more favorable.

We are almost $50 million ahead of where we were at this same point just two years ago. We are running almost at parity, which is unheard of, with the Democrats. Again, they always have more money, Bret. They burn it in the streets, it seems like. We just have enough to make sure that we can support great candidates, which we have a record number of candidates already filed for office as Republicans, even in a redistricting year, and get out that winning message, which is all about the economy, rising costs. It's about the crimewave that's taken over in this country, and it's about the, frankly, the mess at the border."

      "speaker": "EMMER",
      "utterance": "Well, it tells me that they see what's coming, especially it's not just the number 23. Keep in mind, when Republicans took back the majority 10 years ago, you had a serious number of Democrat retirements like you do this time. But there are more this time than there were at this time 10 years ago. Plus, it's chairmen, I think we have got three full committee chairs and one very powerful subcommittee chair from the appropriations committee. Those typically don't happen unless they don't see themselves being in the majority. And I suspect that's why they're all announcing they are leaving."

This is Representative Cindy Axne, the incumbent Democrat. There are three potential Republicans, the Iowa state senator Zach Nunn, former Iowa state rep Mary Ann Hanusa, and Nicole Hasso. You think this is a pick-up."

      "speaker": "EMMER",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is one of our targeted races, Bret. It has been. Donald Trump won this seat both in 2016 and 2020. The current incumbent, Cindy Axne, does not match the district. She barely got by. In fact, in both races that she has won, she won with less than 50 percent of the vote. This is a pick-up seat for us. Plus, the incumbent, we don't play in primaries. We trust the voters to decide who the best voice for them is. But when it comes to winning this seat next fall, look, it is ripe for the Republicans to pick up, not just because it is a Republican seat, but because the incumbent, she currently is under investigation for about half-a-million dollars in trades that she did not disclose. That just doesn't bode well."

      "speaker": "EMMER",
      "utterance": "That's right. It is rematch from before. The problem with Tom Malinowski is he was trading in about $1 million worth of tech and medical stocks that were COVID related during the pandemic, Bret, that he failed to disclose. This is a rematch that Tom Kean Jr. came within one point of winning back in the fall of 2020. He will win it this time."

      "utterance": "He switched seats to run because this is almost like the incumbent announcing a retirement. Texas 15 is the seat that Monica De La Cruz with, I think, about $400,000 and nobody paying attention to her almost won the last cycle. I think she lost by two points to the incumbent Vicente Gonzalez. And rather than run in his seat again, Texas 15, which, by the way, this seat where McAllen, Texas is located. McAllen Texas, you might recall, Bret, within the past few months elected a Republican mayor for the first time in something like 80 years. Rather than run for reelection in the seat, Vicente Gonzalez decided to move next door to Texas 34 in a seat that he thinks is more favorable. And yet he might even be susceptible to defeat in that seat. But Monica De La Cruz is running again in Texas 15. She is a great candidate, and I expect that she is going to win that race."
