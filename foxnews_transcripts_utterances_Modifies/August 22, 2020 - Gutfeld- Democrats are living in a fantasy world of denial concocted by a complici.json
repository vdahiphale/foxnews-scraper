They think minorities want less law and order and fewer cops? That's wrong. So no wonder they hid the havoc.

Finally, they blame COVID on Trump even as obvious data refutes it. Blue states have roughly twice the number of deaths with fewer cases than red states. New York's Democrat Governor allowed thousands of in rest homes to become infected and die over an insidious mistake. Meanwhile, what did Trump do? Well, he shut down travel fast while facing down resistant Democrats. He got a zillion ventilators for a petulant Cuomo, who ended up with a stockpile.  He sent a hospital ship to a city port in an instant, which was then ignored by the Governor because he'd rather not do anything lifesaving that makes Trump look good. He flowed cash to millions to get them through this pandemic and he set the table for America to endure this disease by delivering the best economic numbers in recent history. But none of this matters because reality doesn't matter. We live in a fantasy world of denial concocted by a complicit media that allows beatings by rioting Democrat extremists to continue, shootings to rise and mobs to spread beyond cities to suburbs.  It's going to get worse until the Dems decide it gets better. Meaning Joe wins. It's an extortion plot against you and me.

After conflating criminality with minorities they now falsely believe to fight crime is just like fighting minorities when it's actually the reverse. The Dems are true racists. They think minorities want less law and order and fewer cops? That's wrong. So no wonder they hid the havoc.

Finally, they blame COVID on Trump even as obvious data refutes it. Blue states have roughly twice the number of deaths with fewer cases than red states. New York's Democrat Governor allowed thousands of in rest homes to become infected and die over an insidious mistake. Meanwhile, what did Trump do? Well, he shut down travel fast while facing down resistant Democrats. He got a zillion ventilators for a petulant Cuomo, who ended up with a stockpile. He sent a hospital ship to a city port in an instant, which was then ignored by the Governor because he'd rather not do anything lifesaving that makes Trump look good. He flowed cash to millions to get them through this pandemic and he set the table for America to endure this disease by delivering the best economic numbers in recent history. But none of this matters because reality doesn't matter. We live in a fantasy world of denial concocted by a complicit media that allows beatings by rioting Democrat extremists to continue, shootings to rise and mobs to spread beyond cities to suburbs. It's going to get worse until the Dems decide it gets better. Meaning Joe wins. It's an extortion plot against you and me.

The Democrats had to take that and run with it. Their job was to say, look, forget about the President's personality, this is what we're going to do for you and they never did it. They continued on his personality, which is totally fixed. You can't change people's minds about it. And you know, watching the Obamas and the way the people breathlessly talking about the Obamas. I don't think I'm alone, I'm in the minority, but I was never impressed with Obama as a speech maker. I think he's boring. He is boring now. He was boring when he was President. He reminds me of -- there's always comedian like this. You know, a successful comedian who's on stage and the crowd kind of likes him. They're kind of laughing at him. He's very comfortable on stage, has a nice smile. No act. Nothing you remember about them, and there's nothing anyone -- no one can tell you. They talk about Obama.

More than 23 million people around the world are infected with the virus. That's according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In the U.S., more than 176,000 people have died and about 5.6 million are battling the virus. U.S. leads the world in total number of cases and deaths. Brazil is second and India third. And Minnesota is now the third state linking an outbreak of coronavirus cases to the Sturgis motorcycle rally that's in South Dakota. At least 15 cases are tied to that massive rally held earlier this month. Cases have been reported in South Dakota and Nebraska. Residents of North Dakota who attended the event are being told to look out for symptoms."

I get that we have very important ones that they don't have like completely free speech; however, from the whole bondage clubs a few weeks ago where they're like, oh good, just wear a mask. And now with the brothels, they're saying, okay, we can open, but you can't bang for money just yet, right? People are actually protesting this too, by the way. They're very upset. They're like, what? We're not going to take that and I love it. Adults should be able to decide what to do with their own adult bodies.

So I think it would be fun to have 100 percent wholesome interaction at a brothel. I think it would be a heck of a lot of fun. But some of these other things, I mean, I wish they'd had the bike ride because what a spectacle that would be to see all these naked people on bikes with masks on because you know, they would be wearing the mask.

And now he's not going because they can't have sex, which is -- he is going to be breaking his promises. You know what I am saying? There's a lot of people who use that excuse.

So the family unit is breaking down, and then when the machine breaks down, nobody works out anymore. So therefore, nobody is excited to go on a naked bike ride, because dad turns out was actually brotheling at a brothel, instead of talking, which led to no family meal, and then no group exercise.

You've got to go all naked or don't go. It's a great bike ride. Just make sure you're behind somebody good.

The only time you get amped up is when the show is over and you go out of your way to -- let's see what he did. First, he came up with the idea. It was so brilliant he then told it to one of his friends and then one of his friends who didn't really care that he was being stupid, then he said yes, bro, this is good idea. Then he Googled Chewbacca. He printed it off. He then put her phone number. Probably messed up three or four times by misspelling Chewbacca, then he puts these papers up and then now yes, she's really going to know how hurt I am that I went to all this time and energy to do this to her. And then what ends up happening? She ends up dating one of the guys with the Chewbacca sounding voices. Nice job, bro. Nice job. You did it man. You showed her and you made her famous. Right on, man. Proud of yourself. I know right now you're sitting somewhere alone on your mom's couch going, got her. Got him, coach. Like a -- moron."

I bet you sent some death threats my way in 2015. But the bad news for this guy, of course, he got dumped. The good news is, he may never get dumped again. The bad news is, that's because he will probably never have another girlfriend because a guy who does stuff like this, he's going to be the guy, first five minutes of the date, he is like six whiskeys and, \"Guess what I did.

The museum went on to explain that Anthony was very proud of her rebellion, and that pardoning her would only validate her conviction. But do you buy that?

If I have a $400.00 bet, I will go get $400.00 of Susan B. Anthony's and a nice satchel, and I will fill it up and throw it out said winner. And say, there is your money. Dig that out. So I've always associated Susan B. with being kind of like in a bad mood kind of in the picture that you keep showing us, it kind of shows the same. So I think in the spirit of her, I think that's probably why they refuse. See what I mean? She just looks mad. Just no smile, no smirk."
