We have Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Gregg Jarrett, the great one, Mark Levin, a rare appearance, Tomi Lahren hits the street, it's pretty unbelievable. Also, exclusively, James O'Keefe with his latest shocking undercover footage that shows beyond serious privacy at Twitter. He will join us tonight. You don't want to miss an of that. And I will say, tonight's video of the day is probably the funniest one you've ever seen. It's all coming up.  But we start with sad, breaking news, a very disturbing report out of California. They're calling it a house of horrors. Multiple children found starving, chained to beds, in a home in southern California.  With the latest on this horrific developing story, our own Trace Gallagher.  This is beyond heartbreaking. You can't even imagine this happens.",

Police say they got a 911 call early Sunday morning from a girl who said she had escaped from her home and that her 12 brothers and sisters were being held captive inside.  When authorities first saw the girl they say because of her emaciated appearance, she looked to be around 10 years old, but she's actually 17. What they found inside the home was even more disturbing. Several children were, quote, shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings. Police assumed all 12 found inside were kids, but seven of them turned out to be adults, ranging in age from 18 to 29. The youngest victim, only two years old.  According to police the parents, David and Louise Turpin couldn't give a logical explanation as to why the children were in this condition. The Turpins were charged with torture and child endangerment, bail set at $9 million each. David Turpin's parents told the local news station they are, quote, surprised and shocked at the news. Of course Sean, a lot more information yet to come of the story in Perris, California.",

Also new tonight, Democrats, in total freak-out mode and they're actually trying to blame President Trump for Hawaii's missile warning false alarm debacle over the weekend. He had nothing to do request it.  Here's what happened, during a shift change Saturday, at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, one employee was conducting a routine test on the alert system. The employee then accidentally sent this live alert out to everybody's cell phone: ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.   Now, naturally, it created widespread doomsday panic. Some people running for shelter, drivers who are abandoning their vehicles, others desperately calling family and friends for 38 long minutes until the false alert was corrected. More than one million people in Hawaii thought they were in imminent danger, and that this, in fact, could be the end. Thankfully, it was not. Now, the employee that sent out the false alarm has been reassigned. And I'm sure that person, according to all reports, feels bad. And I know some people want him fired, I do not. I'm glad that employee did not get fired. Sounds like an accident. Accidents happen. And Hawaii, they're working to try to prevent this kind of egregious error from happening again.  Now, of course, none of those facts in fact matter to the left. And, of course, Democrats. Hawaii congressman, Tulsi Gabbard, literally trying to blame President Trump. If the dog bites, the bee stings and you're feeling sad, it's Trump's fault. Take a look.",

If we allow this one man Gomorrah and his corrupt Republican Congress to continue alienating the world, we are headed for suffering beyond all imagination.   OK, calm down. And Jamie Lee Curtis tweeted: This Hawaii missile scare is on you, Mr. Trump. The real fear that mothers and fathers and children felt is on you. It is on your arrogance, hubris, narcissism, rage, ego, immaturity and your unstable idiocy. Shame on your hate filled self. You did this. OK, he didn't. Now, pretty unbelievable, but predictable, totally unhinged, and more proof of the left in this country, they will blame the president. If you get stung by a bee, you have a hangover, it's Donald Trump's fault. Not yours, not the bees. Even though it's clear he had nothing to do with this.

All of what you just laid out also coming as a growing number of Democrats led by Congresswoman Maxine Waters are announcing tonight that they're going to boycott the president's State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress later this month. Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, you see her there, colorful cowboy hat, who feuded with the president last year, says she'll skip the speech because of what she called, quote, racist and incendiary remarks about Haiti and various African nations.  Wilson declaring, quote, I have no doubt delivering a message of inclusivity and an agenda that benefits all Americans, President Trump's address will be full of innuendo, empty promises, and lies. That coming before the speech is written.  Never mind that the president insists he never said that, tweeting today: Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting. Deals can't get made when there's no trust. Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our military. That from the president. But while Two Republican senators in the room, Tom Cotton and David Perdue, suggested yesterday that Durbin did not accurately convey what the senator said, another GOP senator, you mentioned him, Lindsey Graham, seemed to take a poke at his fellow Republicans saying his recollection has not evolved like the others and suggested that he rebuked the president in person for what he said. Interesting because as the president insisted to reporters over this weekend, he's not a racist, before he had dinner with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, you see him there in Palm Beach, Florida, old tapes surfaced of Lindsey Graham using a similar slam on countries like Mexico while Republican Rand Paul came out to say the president as a businessman before he was in politics helped fund the eye doctors humanitarian trips to Haiti and elsewhere.",

      "sentences": "All right. Tonight, evidence of rampant bias among special counsel Robert Mueller's team now emerging. We have been following this, we have new information tonight. Sara Carter reporting Andrew Weissmann met with the Associated Press and journalists, he did it last April, to talk about the AP's investigation into Paul Manafort. The very next day, the Associated Press published a major story about Paul Manafort -- thank you, Andrew Weissmann -- regarding alleged money laundering.   Now, sources have told Sara Carter that in that meeting, the AP reporters, they promised to share documents and information about Manafort with the Department of Justice. By the way, a lot more on media collusion that we will be having in coming days. The AP, of course, denying that part of the story.  Here's what should be concerning to every American tonight. During the meeting with reporters, Andrew Weissmann, the number one guy appointed by Robert Mueller, the head of the Justice Department's fraud division -- and he then later, not long after, joined Mueller's investigation to look into Paul Manafort, the next month. And according to Sara Carter's reporting, Weissmann told his superiors about the meeting with the AP, and during that time, he wasn't working on the Manafort case and did not have access to documents related to it. Here's the thing: Weissmann was discussing Paul Manafort with those reporters and then joined Mueller's team where he's leading the case against Manafort. Now, he was prejudging the case -- prejudiced. There's a massive conflict of interest. We obviously see what's going on here.  And then, there's Weissmann's disturbing history on top of it. Why would Robert Mueller ever appoint this guy that led the obstruction of justice case against Arthur Andersen Accounting and the Enron scandal? Back in the 2000s, tens of thousands of people lost their jobs. They're out of business. Thank you, Weissmann. The Supreme Court overturned a ruling 9-0 in the case. Weissmann's job was a mess. And people also -- and, by the way, exculpatory evidence in one case that he withheld. And also responsible for putting four Merrill Lynch executives behind bars. You might not care about Merrill Lynch guys, but guess what, they were innocent, their convictions overturned this time by the fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. You would care if it was your family.  Did Robert Mueller, did he ever bother to check Weissmann's history? No, because he already knew it, they're best friends. And Mueller also didn't seem to mind that members of his investigation donated 50 grand to Obama, Clinton and the DNC, not one penny given to Donald Trump.  This is political bias. This proves the investigation has been and continues to be a total partisan sham and witch hunt, and an embarrassment, if you believe in the rule of law. It is so important tonight, and why I am saying, Andrew Weissmann not only needs to be fired but fully investigated. And Robert Mueller has a lot of explaining to do about his team of Democratic witch hunters. And they certainly need to be disbanded.  It is why the special counsel needs to be shut down once and for all. And, no, the president doesn't need to answer any of their questions because it's so fundamentally corrupt. Congressman Jim Jordan, he is seeing what's going with Mueller's partisan probe. He is one of a handful of lawmakers that is interested in the truth. He's been asking the right questions. Take a look at the side of your screen. Congressman Jordan -- we'll scroll slowly -- a list of 18 imperative, crucial questions that need to be answered. I urge you to take a close look at these. And we'll bring it up later on the show.  Here's a few that stand out. Was the dossier the basis for securing the FISA warrant to spy on a presidential candidate, and on an opposition party and on a president-elect? And why won't the FBI show Congress the FISA application? We know the answer. We just learned last week, sources telling me, that at first, the FISA warrant was denied to spy on members of the Trump campaign, very rare for that to happen. Then, the dossier was used to put it over the top and they got the FISA warrant. We also need to know, did the FBI validate and corroborate that dossier? I'm being told that a Clinton supporter did. How would we trust them? These questions are the same ones we've been asking. Hillary Clinton bought and paid for it. She's going to have one of her sick, corrupt, cartel friends verify it? Here's a key part. None of them have to do with Hillary Clinton's email server, by the way. This is just the 18 questions on one thing. It's only about the Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda dossier.  Let's see, we know for example that the Obama administration politicized, weaponized America's powerful tools of intelligence. Not the rank and file, just a few select at the top. Then there was spying on an opposition party, that would be Donald Trump. And what is being exposed is a massive abuse to the Constitution. We'll have more with Mark Levin on that tonight.  Now, think through this. Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, he is the person that created the fake news dossier, he is now being exposed. In a released congressional testimony, Simpson claimed that the FBI had a human source inside the Trump Organization that helped corroborate aspects of the phony dossier. Well, it turns out Simpson wasn't accurate in his testimony. Oh, lied? Fusion GPS has since attempted to correct the record now by saying there wasn't an FBI mole inside Trump Tower. Was there or wasn't there? Instead, it was former Trump adviser, they say, George Papadopoulos. And that was blown out of the water because Papadopoulos, if you believe this highly suspect New York Times reporting, started the Russian investigation by getting drunk and then running into -- running his mouth to an Australian diplomat about having -- Russia having dirt on Hillary Clinton. Then, the drunk gossip, you have to believe, eventually made it to FBI and they reportedly then used it to start the investigation. Oh, four levels of hearsay. It's, what, at a nightclub? Really? All the FBI needs to do to investigate a political party during a campaign, talk to a drunk guy at a bar? That's why we need answers tonight.  And, finally, we have a major update on the Uranium One scandal that no one else covers. According to reports, federal authorities have now announced an indictment in the Russian bribery scheme connected to the corrupt deal that gave Putin and Russia and those bad actors control of 20 percent of America's uranium supply, which we have short supply of. Former shipping company executive Mark Lambert, he is now being accused of money laundering, foreign bribery, wire fraud for allegedly bribing a Russian energy official in an effort to secure the shipping contracts we have informed you about is so important. And this new information is only a smaller piece of the bigger picture of the corruption here. This indictment is only a preview of coming attractions. Here to react to all of these stories tonight, former deputy assistant to the president, FOX News contributor, Sebastian Gorka, FOX News legal Gregg Jarrett. Let's go to Weissmann -- let's go -- we reported last week, the Justice Department opened up, it's now been going on for months, an investigation into Uranium One. Is this the first of many cards to fall?",

First of all, let me say this, as an American citizen to watch this is repulsive, unconscionable, to watch the mob media do what they're doing. Last week we were told the President is mentally unstable. For months before that we're told he is colluding with Russians. Today we are touting he is a racist, so he is colluding with the Russians, he is mentally unstable, he is a racist. It is so outrageous what happen to that offer, Michel Wolff, three days ago he was the in thing, now he is gone. What happened to the allegations about sexual misconduct that is all gone? Now something new, because a known liar, Dick Durbin, leaves a confidential meeting with the President and other Senators, he is relied on by the media because they want to rely on him, just like they wanted to rely on that author. They want to push this President out. Talk about the 25th amendment. Talk about impeachment. This is the pretorian guard media. The biggest scandal in our lifetime is staring them in the face. You, I and a handful of others seem to care about it. And it is this, the poetization at the highest levels of the FBI and the Justice Department. The holdovers from the prior administration. Not a question of Jim Comey, former FBI Director leaked. The question is how much did he leak. Not a question if he leaked classified information, the question is how much classified information? He was the Director of the FBI. The chief investigator who was hunting down Donald Trump. Sending texts to his girlfriend, because he is cheating on his wife. What I used to work at the Justice Department you did that you're out. You know why? They didn't want you to be black mailed, of all people, the Russians. Now we there's more texts that suggest he is been leaking to the media. Now we know. There's a report. The Trump administration, this is as of six months ago, page 125 leaked stories, one leak a day containing information potentially damaging to the national security. Leaks with the capacity to damage national security scored about seven times as fast as they did under Bush. And the majority of the leaks during the Trump administration, again, this is as of six months ago, 78 concern the Russian probe. Now, talking about the Russia probe we have a special counsel who is pointed to do what, investigate collusion. He is investigating everything, but collusion a special counsel does not exist to investigate financial crimes, whether some guy registered as federal agent or so forth. He is to investigate collusion. Where's your case, Mr. Prosecutor? What's it been, six months, eight months? Give us your collusion case. Now in addition to him, we have this dossier. This isn't a dossier. This is 35 pages of crap that was put together by the fusion GPS. The Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC collaborated, used their money to use a law firm to hire this guy who then hire as British ex-spy who then works with among others the kremlin. That is collusion. They put this thing together and they work it and they give it to the FBI. Now, the highest levels of the FBI are excited to have this. They're even thinking about putting this ex-British spy on their payroll. What do they do with it? I know they used it.",

We have Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Gregg Jarrett, the great one, Mark Levin, a rare appearance, Tomi Lahren hits the street, it's pretty unbelievable. Also, exclusively, James O'Keefe with his latest shocking undercover footage that shows beyond serious privacy at Twitter. He will join us tonight. You don't want to miss an of that. And I will say, tonight's video of the day is probably the funniest one you've ever seen. It's all coming up. But we start with sad, breaking news, a very disturbing report out of California. They're calling it a house of horrors. Multiple children found starving, chained to beds, in a home in southern California. With the latest on this horrific developing story, our own Trace Gallagher.

Police say they got a 911 call early Sunday morning from a girl who said she had escaped from her home and that her 12 brothers and sisters were being held captive inside. When authorities first saw the girl they say because of her emaciated appearance, she looked to be around 10 years old, but she's actually 17. What they found inside the home was even more disturbing. Several children were, quote, shackled to their beds with chains and padlocks in dark and foul-smelling surroundings. Police assumed all 12 found inside were kids, but seven of them turned out to be adults, ranging in age from 18 to 29. The youngest victim, only two years old. According to police the parents, David and Louise Turpin couldn't give a logical explanation as to why the children were in this condition. The Turpins were charged with torture and child endangerment, bail set at $9 million each. David Turpin's parents told the local news station they are, quote, surprised and shocked at the news. Of course Sean, a lot more information yet to come of the story in Perris, California."

Some people running for shelter, drivers who are abandoning their vehicles, others desperately calling family and friends for 38 long minutes until the false alert was corrected. More than one million people in Hawaii thought they were in imminent danger, and that this, in fact, could be the end. Thankfully, it was not. Now, the employee that sent out the false alarm has been reassigned. And I'm sure that person, according to all reports, feels bad. And I know some people want him fired, I do not. I'm glad that employee did not get fired. Sounds like an accident. Accidents happen. And Hawaii, they're working to try to prevent this kind of egregious error from happening again. Now, of course, none of those facts in fact matter to the left. And, of course, Democrats. Hawaii congressman, Tulsi Gabbard, literally trying to blame President Trump.

And this could have been a real threat coming in. And we better take this seriously. We've got to resolve this situation and get rid of this nuclear threat.

Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, you see her there, colorful cowboy hat, who feuded with the president last year, says she'll skip the speech because of what she called, quote, racist and incendiary remarks about Haiti and various African nations. Wilson declaring, quote, I have no doubt delivering a message of inclusivity and an agenda that benefits all Americans, President Trump's address will be full of innuendo, empty promises, and lies.

Interesting because as the president insisted to reporters over this weekend, he's not a racist, before he had dinner with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, you see him there in Palm Beach, Florida, old tapes surfaced of Lindsey Graham using a similar slam on countries like Mexico while Republican Rand Paul came out to say the president as a businessman before he was in politics helped fund the eye doctors humanitarian trips to Haiti and elsewhere."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Tonight, evidence of rampant bias among special counsel Robert Mueller's team now emerging. We have been following this, we have new information tonight. Sara Carter reporting Andrew Weissmann met with the Associated Press and journalists, he did it last April, to talk about the AP's investigation into Paul Manafort. The very next day, the Associated Press published a major story about Paul Manafort -- thank you, Andrew Weissmann -- regarding alleged money laundering. Now, sources have told Sara Carter that in that meeting, the AP reporters, they promised to share documents and information about Manafort with the Department of Justice. By the way, a lot more on media collusion that we will be having in coming days. The AP, of course, denying that part of the story. Here's what should be concerning to every American tonight. During the meeting with reporters, Andrew Weissmann, the number one guy appointed by Robert Mueller, the head of the Justice Department's fraud division -- and he then later, not long after, joined Mueller's investigation to look into Paul Manafort, the next month. And according to Sara Carter's reporting, Weissmann told his superiors about the meeting with the AP, and during that time, he wasn't working on the Manafort case and did not have access to documents related to it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here's the thing",
      "utterance": "Weissmann was discussing Paul Manafort with those reporters and then joined Mueller's team where he's leading the case against Manafort. Now, he was prejudging the case -- prejudiced. There's a massive conflict of interest. We obviously see what's going on here. And then, there's Weissmann's disturbing history on top of it. Why would Robert Mueller ever appoint this guy that led the obstruction of justice case against Arthur Andersen Accounting and the Enron scandal? Back in the 2000s, tens of thousands of people lost their jobs. They're out of business. Thank you, Weissmann. The Supreme Court overturned a ruling 9-0 in the case. Weissmann's job was a mess. And people also -- and, by the way, exculpatory evidence in one case that he withheld. And also responsible for putting four Merrill Lynch executives behind bars. You might not care about Merrill Lynch guys, but guess what, they were innocent, their convictions overturned this time by the fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. You would care if it was your family. Did Robert Mueller, did he ever bother to check Weissmann's history? No, because he already knew it, they're best friends. And Mueller also didn't seem to mind that members of his investigation donated 50 grand to Obama, Clinton and the DNC, not one penny given to Donald Trump. This is political bias. This proves the investigation has been and continues to be a total partisan sham and witch hunt, and an embarrassment, if you believe in the rule of law. It is so important tonight, and why I am saying, Andrew Weissmann not only needs to be fired but fully investigated. And Robert Mueller has a lot of explaining to do about his team of Democratic witch hunters. And they certainly need to be disbanded. It is why the special counsel needs to be shut down once and for all. And, no, the president doesn't need to answer any of their questions because it's so fundamentally corrupt. Congressman Jim Jordan, he is seeing what's going with Mueller's partisan probe. He is one of a handful of lawmakers that is interested in the truth. He's been asking the right questions. Take a look at the side of your screen. Congressman Jordan -- we'll scroll slowly -- a list of 18 imperative, crucial questions that need to be answered. I urge you to take a close look at these. And we'll bring it up later on the show. Here's a few that stand out. Was the dossier the basis for securing the FISA warrant to spy on a presidential candidate, and on an opposition party and on a president-elect? And why won't the FBI show Congress the FISA application? We know the answer. We just learned last week, sources telling me, that at first, the FISA warrant was denied to spy on members of the Trump campaign, very rare for that to happen. Then, the dossier was used to put it over the top and they got the FISA warrant. We also need to know, did the FBI validate and corroborate that dossier? I'm being told that a Clinton supporter did. How would we trust them? These questions are the same ones we've been asking. Hillary Clinton bought and paid for it. She's going to have one of her sick, corrupt, cartel friends verify it? Here's a key part. None of them have to do with Hillary Clinton's email server, by the way. This is just the 18 questions on one thing. It's only about the Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda dossier. Let's see, we know for example that the Obama administration politicized, weaponized America's powerful tools of intelligence. Not the rank and file, just a few select at the top. Then there was spying on an opposition party, that would be Donald Trump. And what is being exposed is a massive abuse to the Constitution. We'll have more with Mark Levin on that tonight. Now, think through this. Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, he is the person that created the fake news dossier, he is now being exposed. In a released congressional testimony, Simpson claimed that the FBI had a human source inside the Trump Organization that helped corroborate aspects of the phony dossier. Well, it turns out Simpson wasn't accurate in his testimony. Oh, lied? Fusion GPS has since attempted to correct the record now by saying there wasn't an FBI mole inside Trump Tower. Was there or wasn't there? Instead, it was former Trump adviser, they say, George Papadopoulos. And that was blown out of the water because Papadopoulos, if you believe this highly suspect New York Times reporting, started the Russian investigation by getting drunk and then running into -- running his mouth to an Australian diplomat about having -- Russia having dirt on Hillary Clinton. Then, the drunk gossip, you have to believe, eventually made it to FBI and they reportedly then used it to start the investigation. Oh, four levels of hearsay. It's, what, at a nightclub? Really? All the FBI needs to do to investigate a political party during a campaign, talk to a drunk guy at a bar? That's why we need answers tonight. And, finally, we have a major update on the Uranium One scandal that no one else covers. According to reports, federal authorities have now announced an indictment in the Russian bribery scheme connected to the corrupt deal that gave Putin and Russia and those bad actors control of 20 percent of America's uranium supply, which we have short supply of. Former shipping company executive Mark Lambert, he is now being accused of money laundering, foreign bribery, wire fraud for allegedly bribing a Russian energy official in an effort to secure the shipping contracts we have informed you about is so important. And this new information is only a smaller piece of the bigger picture of the corruption here. This indictment is only a preview of coming attractions. Here to react to all of these stories tonight, former deputy assistant to the president, FOX News contributor, Sebastian Gorka, FOX News legal Gregg Jarrett. Let's go to Weissmann -- let's go -- we reported last week, the Justice Department opened up, it's now been going on for months, an investigation into Uranium One. Is this the first of many cards to fall?"

First of all, let me say this, as an American citizen to watch this is repulsive, unconscionable, to watch the mob media do what they're doing. Last week we were told the President is mentally unstable. For months before that we're told he is colluding with Russians. Today we are touting he is a racist, so he is colluding with the Russians, he is mentally unstable, he is a racist. It is so outrageous what happen to that offer, Michel Wolff, three days ago he was the in thing, now he is gone. What happened to the allegations about sexual misconduct that is all gone? Now something new, because a known liar, Dick Durbin, leaves a confidential meeting with the President and other Senators, he is relied on by the media because they want to rely on him, just like they wanted to rely on that author. They want to push this President out. Talk about the 25th amendment. Talk about impeachment. This is the pretorian guard media. The biggest scandal in our lifetime is staring them in the face. You, I and a handful of others seem to care about it. And it is this, the poetization at the highest levels of the FBI and the Justice Department. The holdovers from the prior administration. Not a question of Jim Comey, former FBI Director leaked. The question is how much did he leak. Not a question if he leaked classified information, the question is how much classified information? He was the Director of the FBI. The chief investigator who was hunting down Donald Trump. Sending texts to his girlfriend, because he is cheating on his wife. What I used to work at the Justice Department you did that you're out. You know why? They didn't want you to be black mailed, of all people, the Russians. Now we there's more texts that suggest he is been leaking to the media. Now we know. There's a report. The Trump administration, this is as of six months ago, page 125 leaked stories, one leak a day containing information potentially damaging to the national security. Leaks with the capacity to damage national security scored about seven times as fast as they did under Bush. And the majority of the leaks during the Trump administration, again, this is as of six months ago, 78 concern the Russian probe. Now, talking about the Russia probe we have a special counsel who is pointed to do what, investigate collusion. He is investigating everything, but collusion a special counsel does not exist to investigate financial crimes, whether some guy registered as federal agent or so forth. He is to investigate collusion. Where's your case, Mr. Prosecutor? What's it been, six months, eight months? Give us your collusion case. Now in addition to him, we have this dossier. This isn't a dossier. This is 35 pages of crap that was put together by the fusion GPS. The Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC collaborated, used their money to use a law firm to hire this guy who then hire as British ex-spy who then works with among others the kremlin. That is collusion. They put this thing together and they work it and they give it to the FBI. Now, the highest levels of the FBI are excited to have this. They're even thinking about putting this ex-British spy on their payroll. What do they do with it? I know they used it."

I don't know where the hell the FISA Judge is but they should be furious and should be demanding answers to this. As for the media in this country, we have free press. That is fine.
