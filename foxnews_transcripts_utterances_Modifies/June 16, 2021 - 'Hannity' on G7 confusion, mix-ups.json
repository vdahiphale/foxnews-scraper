Tonight, coming up, Jon Stewart separates himself from the left wing mob yet again, first bravely standing up for our brave soldiers and now just nailing it on the origins of COVID-19, causing his friend Stephen Colbert's head to kind of explode. Interesting TV.  Also tonight, far left Clinton hack Terry McAuliffe wants you to believe critical race theory is just the vast right-wing conspiracy. He's still stuck in the `90s.   But first, we are less than one day away from sippy cup meeting with Vladimir Putin. And tonight, ahead of the summit, well, Putin is trashing the U.S., openly laughing at Joe Biden. Vladimir Putin -- he is a hostile actor and Joe is right, he's a murderer. He runs his country like a massive crime syndicate -- kind of like Joe, and Hunter, and Joe's brother, the Biden family syndicate, except a little bit more ruthless.   Anyway, like most organized criminals, Vladimir only responds to strength. He doesn't respond to weakness. And so, obviously, he doesn't respect or fear president sippy cup. Why should he? Now, under Biden, the era of peace through strength is over. American first policies have now been replaced with American dead last policies.  Just last month, Russian hackers, they wrecked literally -- wrecked America's oil and gas supply. Joe inexplicably rewards Putin, lifting sanctions and giving a waiver to Putin for Russia to build a pipeline so they can supply the lifeblood of our Western European allies' energy.   Biden's appeasement strategies not the only thing at play here. During Joe's trip abroad, the entire world seeing firsthand how weak, how frail, how confused, what a cognitive struggling mess Joe really is. One Sky News Australia host actually raising concerns about, quote, Joe Biden's mental capacity, after this video emerged showing Joe aimlessly wandering around a cafe in England -- well, to be rescued by Jill Biden. One \"New York Post\" headline read, quote, bumbling Biden's G7 NATO summit performance only boosts U.S. Euro foes. Another headline reads more evidence Joe Biden is just not well.  True to form, today, Joe got completely confused mid-sentence during a meeting. I don't know what to even tell you that he's trying to say here I'll let you decipher. Take a look.",

They won't give us an answer. I don't know, maybe he drank his warm milky early and took a nap. I don't know, nappy time. Was he loading up on his caffeine so his brain could function at a halfway decent level? We have no idea. Whatever the case may be, I think it's obvious now to the entire world why there's not going to be a joint press conference following tomorrow's summit with Putin. The administration is scared to death Joe will deeply embarrass himself and the country even further and Vladimir will take advantage of Joe's clear cognitive weakness and constant state of confusion.  And, of course, there are also concerns surrounding zero experience Hunter Biden. Yeah, he's the guy that collected millions of dollars from the first lady of Moscow. That's right, the mayor of Moscow's wife and Kazakhstan oligarchs and Ukrainian oligarchs, you know? And the pro-Russian oligarch who owns Burisma Holdings in Ukraine. Again, listen closely, zero experience Hunter made millions of dollars in Ukraine. No relevant experience whatsoever. Today, Joe announced Ukraine is too corrupt to join NATO, but not corrupt enough for Hunter to get paid millions? Take a look.",

Any experience in oil, gas, energy or Ukraine? No. Imagine if a Trump was doing this? And speaking of which Hunter Biden has a new money-making scheme. He just launched a career as an artist, apparently. And despite zero professional experience, no art degree, Hunter is now selling his paintings at a top gallery in New York City, expects to collect up to a half a million dollars for each masterpiece. Maybe we'll call it portraits from a crack addict or something.  And, of course, according to the gallery, the buyers will all remain anonymous. Oh, who's trying to buy favor now? It should make your skin crawl.  This might be the Biden family's most blatant pay-to-play scheme yet. Time will tell. It is seedy. It's disgusting and it's happening right in front of our eyes. But apparently, when you're a Biden, the rules don't apply to you.  You can lie in a gun application. You can sell access to the highest levels of our federal government. You can smoke crack. You can abandon your own child, take away the child's mother's health care. If you're Hunter, you can even say the N-word. And in the case of Joe, you could outright lie on three occasions. I've never talked to Hunter about his foreign business dealings -- but we have pictures of him dining as vice president with his foreign business partners. So, that's right. If you're a Biden, you can pretty much get away with anything. Your doors are not going to be kicked in, pre-morning, pre -- early morning raid, guns drawn. You won't have CNN cameras capturing it all. You're not going to get interrogated for hours on end. You won't be threatened with decades behind bars. The media mob, big tech, they'll always keep you in their Biden protection program. They'll have your back. There'll be no investigations. No negative coverage, nothing.   The so-called journalists and the press is more than happy to stick their heads in the sand, while our country goes straight to hell and shows nothing but weakness to the world, just because they like Joe's Democratic radical New Green Deal socialism. So, tomorrow, expect glowing praise from the media mob. Joe was tough with Vladimir. If he's so tough of Vladimir, why does he stand next to Vladimir in front of the world and say it right to his face and let us watch it? But know this -- no good is coming out of this. Here with more FOX News contributor, media columnist at \"The Hill\", Joe Concha, along with FOX News contributor, former CIA station chief, Dan Hoffman.  Good to see you both. Joe, we'll start with you on the media side. Now, if you're watching this show, okay, you're an informed viewer. You are now fully aware of how bad Kamala Harris's trip is. You know how bad Joe's trip is.  But if you watch any other media, would you see what we've been showing our viewers?",

      "sentences": "Oh, it's a different galaxy, Sean, at this point. And you don't see clips like the one you just played or the analyzed very much. Again, this bears repeating what the president said when he was asked if he thinks that Vladimir Putin is a killer. Quote: I don't think it matters -- it being, of course, the whole Putin is a killer thing -- a whole lot in terms of this next meeting we're going to have. I'm pretty sure if you accuse the sitting president of being a murderer, that's pretty relevant and answers like this show, the real reason why he's not doing a press conference with Putin to your point earlier, because anything resembling remotely a challenging question is met with either awkward or defensive or relatively incoherent responses. As you said, he was hours late for his press conference yesterday. He only calls on reporters chosen by his staff and then he needs to read from notes oftentimes when answering questions. So I've always said, when you're covering Joe Biden, don't base that coverage on his words but his actions. Because words are pretty cheap particularly when you're dealing with career politicians of 50 years. But deeds, they're tangible, right? They're like runs in a baseball game. It's easy to keep score.  And with Joe Biden, here's what that scoreboard looks like as it pertains to Vladimir Putin: he allowed Putin to invade and take over Crimea -- remember that -- without firing a shot. That was during the Obama Biden administration. He allowed Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. That was during the Obama-Biden administration. He just allowed Russia to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. What that does by not -- obviously, he waved major sanctions on that. That makes Russia a major player in Europe in terms of energy, and that's all while attacking American energy by killing new construction of the Keystone pipeline. So with Joe Biden, always, don't listen to the words, even when the words are somewhat incoherent. Watch the actions, and see what happens and that's what I'll be watching tomorrow during the summit with Vladimir Putin.",

Why Vladimir got the waiver from Joe to build his pipeline to supply energy to our allies in Western Europe. Meanwhile, simultaneously, shutting down our pipeline building and construction in America -- putting literally thousands and thousands of energy sector jobs off the market and career jobs and -- with a lot of pay taken away from hardworking Americans. Dan Hoffman, you and I have a great experience. We were in Singapore together. We were in Helsinki together. And you would explain to me based on your years in the intelligence community, that it was a hundred percent certain in your mind, not 99, a hundred percent, that I was being spied on by the Chinese in Singapore and by the Russians in Helsinki. And you said, absolutely. And I said, why are you so certain? Because they study everything about American presidents.  And they know that I had a relationship with Donald Trump. Therefore, I was being targeted. . Now, explain through this -- in this context. What do they know about Joe Biden?

We haven't talked about Havana syndrome that pulse microwave targeting our officials from Cuba to China, and including inside Moscow, as well as reportedly near the White House. It's another issue to raise. I share your concern about the press conference. That's the ideal opportunity to hold Vladimir Putin accountable for his multifarious attacks on our democracy -- from election interference to cyber hacking groups, which homestead on Russian territory. Draw those red lines. If you don't do that, then you don't have any hope for peace and stability.

Everything you see by Biden is unraveling the world. He's losing control of our border. He's lost control of the Mideast.

They want to live in a place that's well-govern with low taxes.

We are not allowing discrimination based on vaccination status.

So, our view is, you know, nondiscrimination, understanding kids should be able to go on, and also understanding people have recovered from COVID and also are immune and they may not have taken the vaccine at that point.

Tonight, coming up, Jon Stewart separates himself from the left wing mob yet again, first bravely standing up for our brave soldiers and now just nailing it on the origins of COVID-19, causing his friend Stephen Colbert's head to kind of explode. Interesting TV. Also tonight, far left Clinton hack Terry McAuliffe wants you to believe critical race theory is just the vast right-wing conspiracy. He's still stuck in the `90s. But first, we are less than one day away from sippy cup meeting with Vladimir Putin. And tonight, ahead of the summit, well, Putin is trashing the U.S., openly laughing at Joe Biden. Vladimir Putin -- he is a hostile actor and Joe is right, he's a murderer. He runs his country like a massive crime syndicate -- kind of like Joe, and Hunter, and Joe's brother, the Biden family syndicate, except a little bit more ruthless. Anyway, like most organized criminals, Vladimir only responds to strength. He doesn't respond to weakness. And so, obviously, he doesn't respect or fear president sippy cup. Why should he? Now, under Biden, the era of peace through strength is over. American first policies have now been replaced with American dead last policies. Just last month, Russian hackers, they wrecked literally -- wrecked America's oil and gas supply. Joe inexplicably rewards Putin, lifting sanctions and giving a waiver to Putin for Russia to build a pipeline so they can supply the lifeblood of our Western European allies' energy. Biden's appeasement strategies not the only thing at play here. During Joe's trip abroad, the entire world seeing firsthand how weak, how frail, how confused, what a cognitive struggling mess Joe really is. One Sky News Australia host actually raising concerns about, quote, Joe Biden's mental capacity, after this video emerged showing Joe aimlessly wandering around a cafe in England -- well, to be rescued by Jill Biden. One \"New York Post\" headline read, quote, bumbling Biden's G7 NATO summit performance only boosts U.S. Euro foes. Another headline reads more evidence Joe Biden is just not well.

They won't give us an answer. I don't know, maybe he drank his warm milky early and took a nap. I don't know, nappy time. Was he loading up on his caffeine so his brain could function at a halfway decent level? We have no idea. Whatever the case may be, I think it's obvious now to the entire world why there's not going to be a joint press conference following tomorrow's summit with Putin. The administration is scared to death Joe will deeply embarrass himself and the country even further and Vladimir will take advantage of Joe's clear cognitive weakness and constant state of confusion. And, of course, there are also concerns surrounding zero experience Hunter Biden. Yeah, he's the guy that collected millions of dollars from the first lady of Moscow. That's right, the mayor of Moscow's wife and Kazakhstan oligarchs and Ukrainian oligarchs, you know? And the pro-Russian oligarch who owns Burisma Holdings in Ukraine.

Any experience in oil, gas, energy or Ukraine? No. Imagine if a Trump was doing this? And speaking of which Hunter Biden has a new money-making scheme. He just launched a career as an artist, apparently. And despite zero professional experience, no art degree, Hunter is now selling his paintings at a top gallery in New York City, expects to collect up to a half a million dollars for each masterpiece. Maybe we'll call it portraits from a crack addict or something. And, of course, according to the gallery, the buyers will all remain anonymous. Oh, who's trying to buy favor now? It should make your skin crawl. This might be the Biden family's most blatant pay-to-play scheme yet. Time will tell. It is seedy. It's disgusting and it's happening right in front of our eyes. But apparently, when you're a Biden, the rules don't apply to you. You can lie in a gun application. You can sell access to the highest levels of our federal government. You can smoke crack. You can abandon your own child, take away the child's mother's health care. If you're Hunter, you can even say the N-word. And in the case of Joe, you could outright lie on three occasions. I've never talked to Hunter about his foreign business dealings -- but we have pictures of him dining as vice president with his foreign business partners. So, that's right. If you're a Biden, you can pretty much get away with anything. Your doors are not going to be kicked in, pre-morning, pre -- early morning raid, guns drawn. You won't have CNN cameras capturing it all. You're not going to get interrogated for hours on end. You won't be threatened with decades behind bars. The media mob, big tech, they'll always keep you in their Biden protection program. They'll have your back. There'll be no investigations. No negative coverage, nothing. The so-called journalists and the press is more than happy to stick their heads in the sand, while our country goes straight to hell and shows nothing but weakness to the world, just because they like Joe's Democratic radical New Green Deal socialism. So, tomorrow, expect glowing praise from the media mob. Joe was tough with Vladimir. If he's so tough of Vladimir, why does he stand next to Vladimir in front of the world and say it right to his face and let us watch it? But know this -- no good is coming out of this. Here with more FOX News contributor, media columnist at \"The Hill\", Joe Concha, along with FOX News contributor, former CIA station chief, Dan Hoffman. Good to see you both. Joe, we'll start with you on the media side. Now, if you're watching this show, okay, you're an informed viewer. You are now fully aware of how bad Kamala Harris's trip is. You know how bad Joe's trip is. But if you watch any other media, would you see what we've been showing our viewers?"

      "utterance": "Oh, it's a different galaxy, Sean, at this point. And you don't see clips like the one you just played or the analyzed very much. Again, this bears repeating what the president said when he was asked if he thinks that Vladimir Putin is a killer. Quote: I don't think it matters -- it being, of course, the whole Putin is a killer thing -- a whole lot in terms of this next meeting we're going to have. I'm pretty sure if you accuse the sitting president of being a murderer, that's pretty relevant and answers like this show, the real reason why he's not doing a press conference with Putin to your point earlier, because anything resembling remotely a challenging question is met with either awkward or defensive or relatively incoherent responses. As you said, he was hours late for his press conference yesterday. He only calls on reporters chosen by his staff and then he needs to read from notes oftentimes when answering questions. So I've always said, when you're covering Joe Biden, don't base that coverage on his words but his actions. Because words are pretty cheap particularly when you're dealing with career politicians of 50 years. But deeds, they're tangible, right? They're like runs in a baseball game. It's easy to keep score."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And with Joe Biden, here's what that scoreboard looks like as it pertains to Vladimir Putin",
      "utterance": "he allowed Putin to invade and take over Crimea -- remember that -- without firing a shot. That was during the Obama Biden administration. He allowed Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. That was during the Obama-Biden administration. He just allowed Russia to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. What that does by not -- obviously, he waved major sanctions on that. That makes Russia a major player in Europe in terms of energy, and that's all while attacking American energy by killing new construction of the Keystone pipeline. So with Joe Biden, always, don't listen to the words, even when the words are somewhat incoherent. Watch the actions, and see what happens and that's what I'll be watching tomorrow during the summit with Vladimir Putin."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

Why Vladimir got the waiver from Joe to build his pipeline to supply energy to our allies in Western Europe. Meanwhile, simultaneously, shutting down our pipeline building and construction in America -- putting literally thousands and thousands of energy sector jobs off the market and career jobs and -- with a lot of pay taken away from hardworking Americans. Dan Hoffman, you and I have a great experience. We were in Singapore together. We were in Helsinki together. And you would explain to me based on your years in the intelligence community, that it was a hundred percent certain in your mind, not 99, a hundred percent, that I was being spied on by the Chinese in Singapore and by the Russians in Helsinki. And you said, absolutely. And I said, why are you so certain? Because they study everything about American presidents. And they know that I had a relationship with Donald Trump. Therefore, I was being targeted. . Now, explain through this -- in this context. What do they know about Joe Biden? Because I don't think they're going to be influenced by the coverage of the media in America of Joe Biden. They study Joe Biden and make their own conclusions.

We haven't talked about Havana syndrome that pulse microwave targeting our officials from Cuba to China, and including inside Moscow, as well as reportedly near the White House. It's another issue to raise. I share your concern about the press conference. That's the ideal opportunity to hold Vladimir Putin accountable for his multifarious attacks on our democracy -- from election interference to cyber hacking groups, which homestead on Russian territory. Draw those red lines. If you don't do that, then you don't have any hope for peace and stability. There's no peace without strength when it comes to Russia, and I think that's a real missed opportunity frankly."

A nuclear treaty they re-entered, we didn't ask for anything. They wanted it desperately and we gave it up. We then -- you talked about Vladimir Putin destroying our energy industry. You should know that vice president or President Biden went first. He destroyed our energy industry by joining the Paris Climate Accords, an enormous gift to Vladimir Putin. So I expect, tomorrow, President Putin will press.

And, Sean, we shouldn't forget -- whether it's Chairman Kim or the ayatollah or Xi Jinping, they're watching this too. When they smell weakness, when they can sniff it, the deterrence model that American successful defense depends upon will walk away and these folks will drive a truck through it. So if you're not prepared to simply stand on a podium and respond to questions from the press that might be asked of you, that might be hard or might be tricky, while your adversary is standing a few feet away from you, that's an enormous sign of weakness."

But Tom Cotton, who's been right about this more than anybody had legislation that we introduced and passed through the Judiciary Committee last year, allowing an American citizen to take the Chinese Communist Party to court in the United States and sue for damages caused by COVID-19.

Now, why did they circle the wagons because if it had been a lab leak, they're implicated because they have a relationship with the lab and I think it throws -- I think it puts everything they did very much at risk, so that February 19th letter by 27 scientists in 2020 saying that if you believe it's a lab leak, you're a nut tells me everything I need to know. I think they knew it was a lab leak and they tried to bury it. It's just like the Russian dossier. Every time they found evidence that the dossier was unreliable, they ignored it. They doubled down because they wanted the outcome. And here's the outcome the scientists wanted. They wanted to shut down the suggestion that came from the lab that they were tied to.

The day that Joe Biden changed the border policies regarding Mexico, doing away the \"Remain in Mexico\" and Mexico refused to help, everybody in the world saw that as a sign of weakness. Donald Trump took money away from Central American countries until they changed their behavior regarding caravans. What has Biden done? He wants to give them $4 billion without any change at all. So the reason Mexico and Central America gave in to Trump is because Trump took on China by imposing tariffs against the Chinese Communist Party for cheating in the world marketplace. Everything you see by Biden is unraveling the world. He's losing control of our border. He's lost control of the Mideast. Iran is coming back and Hamas sent 4,500 rockets into Israel because they believe Joe Biden wouldn't do a damn thing and they turned out to be right."

That if we were just more reasonable, if we worked with them, and we gave them the ability to build the pipeline, and we got back in the new START treaty and we put $4 billion on the table in Central America, everything would be just fine. Donald Trump saw it differently. He saw these people to be tough, and they're going to get away with everything and get away with until somebody stops them. So I hope President Biden will tell Putin that there's another cyber attack on American business interest, we're going to come after your infrastructure. We need to go on the offense. We've lost deterrence when it comes to the Biden administration and we've lost respect. Our allies no longer respect us, and our enemies are not deterred by the president and his administration.

She went to write more sentences several times before ending with, quote, have I made myself clear, finally? What did you see, she wrote 13 times in a row. Apparently she's made herself so clear that in the past six months, Lightfoot has lost more than a dozen staffers. Last month, her less than diplomatic management style was on full display when she sent her aides a picture of a ripped up document, you know, as a way of telling them she'd like to get things in a timely manner.

Attacking law enforcement and saying law enforcement attacks people based on race. Those things are poison. That is not what we should be doing. What we should be doing is solid curriculum based on the actual facts of American history and teaching kids what it means to be an American.

They want to live in a place that's well-govern with low taxes. So, we actually now are collecting more revenue then we can forecast or even keep up with with those lower rates, and it's all about understanding that you're trying to expand your economic base.

And to your credit, by the way, you've been fighting for them to get back online as quickly as possible. A lot of jobs are at stake, a lot of money for Florida's economy is at stake.

We sued the CDC to be able to get them off of this, so that the cruise lines could function in Florida. Of course, they're going to have to do about it consistent Florida law. We are not allowing discrimination based on vaccination status. What the CDC wants to do is effectively ban young kids from cruises, because they're not even eligible to get vaccinated and yet they would count that against the cruise ship. So, our view is, you know, nondiscrimination, understanding kids should be able to go on, and also understanding people have recovered from COVID and also are immune and they may not have taken the vaccine at that point.

Governor DeSantis, by the way, speaking at Ralph Reed's Faith and Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Police Conference on Fox Nation. Up next, Marsha Blackburn had dinner with Kamala Harris. She will tell us what happened, next."

Now, as Vice President Harris is still reeling from her disastrous foreign trip to Central America, earlier this evening, she invited all 24 female senators to her home in Washington. To tell us how it went, Republican senator of great state of Tennessee, Marsha Blackburn. OK. I'm dying to know it all. What happened?"

      "utterance": "Well, Sean, this is the annual Bipartisan Women of the Senate Dinner. And since Vice President Harris was Senator Harris, she invited the women to the vice president's residence. It was a lovely event. She was gracious to house. She invited us all, even though she knows when she was in the Senate, I was the most conservative member of the Senate and she was rated the most liberal. So it wasn't a policy discussion at all. But if she had brought up policies, I would've had loved to say madam vice president, you need to get to the border. You need to talk to the border patrol. The child trafficking that is happening at that border. It's just of such concern. And the Biden policy, this Biden border policy is inept. It is an embarrassment, 180,000 people that crossed -- this is got to be addressed."

Last year, we were not able to do it because of COVID, but this is a tradition of the Senate that the women of the Senate in a bipartisan manner gather for a dinner, and this happens once a year."

And whether it is dealing with HR-1 or the Green New Deal, I am going to stand where I am against all of those. And I think Vice President Harris knows I was a very fierce campaigner for President Trump, for Vice President Pence, and for the Republican ticket. But you know, I'm going to stay in their fighting for our conservative values every chance I get."

My exclusive interview with former President Trump live right here on HANNITY. He will react to Joe sippy cup and his big summit with Vladimir. This is not going to go well. Just a gut feeling I have. And wish it did, I don't want America to look bad on the world stage but I'm not confident. All right, but in the meantime unfortunately that is all the time we have left. We hope you'll set your DVR, never miss an episode. In the meantime, let not your hearts be troubled. Laura Ingraham is next."
