I mean, I'm not a black American but I would get vaccinated a second time if it meant that I could go see Barack Obama speak. We can all do more. And this was a big conversation early on in the pandemic when the vaccine was coming about how the people that we really need to be out there talking about it for the black and brown communities are people that matter to those communities. So, Jay Z and Beyonce and LeBron James and what a big deal it was when NBA players, you know, had one shot and not the second shot and ended up in protocols and it's confusing. I mean, this is a confusing disease and you say it's a terrible sequel, the Delta variant. It's really terrible, though. I mean, when -- I don't -- I'm not calling it the DeSantis strain but there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people who are now hospitalized in Florida, and a lot of them children. And this is what 20 percent of the new cases of Delta are amongst children and that's why it's so important that adults are getting vaccinated, that you do your part and you do that to protect your children who are not approved to have the vaccine yet. So, I'm all for a full court press on the vaccination fronts, but I do agree, if he wants to have a party, he should have it.

It's not like when we saw the Congress impeach the president twice where he's like, still at the White House and it's over because we know it's going to even going to pass. It's no big deal. He actually has to leave. So, I do think that because you saw his team float an idea today, a deal in which he basically would say to the state legislature, I promise not to run for a fourth term if you don't try to impeach me. To me that mean -- I think that he knows one, he's not running for a fourth term anyway. And two, he knows if he gets impeached, it's all over and he knows he's going to get impeached.

And I'm sure that Al Franken is still sitting there going like, I cannot believe that I resigned, right, after what we have seen happened since there. So, I think it was right for her to resign. And I do -- as someone, well, the only member of the Liberal Party at the table, I can tell you that people who have the same politics of me have really shifted away from believing in organizations or supporting organizations to moving to case by case basis. This is what I think about this particular instance. And Greg and I were talking about this before we came out here. When the Governor Cuomo scandals shifted from the nursing homes to Me Too, that's when I said this is not going to end well for him, because I think that people were a lot more comfortable and felt like there was more fodder to go after him on this where it seems -- I mean, these are very real accusations, and Tish James, it did not make her happy, I'm sure, to have to release that report. There were like 11-plus women. So, they knew that this was something that all of society can get behind, right? This is something that we have come up with.

And the idea that they do want to put two-year-olds and children in school and mask for hours on end without any real data to back up that it actually works, by the way, I think is really appalling.

But if you're a D.J. who wants to do a regular Italian wedding in New Jersey where there's going to be restrictions on you and we are not going to allow you to work. And the bottom line is that, this is still America and Americans are not subjects. They are citizens and they certainly are not peasants who are supposed to play by a separate set of rules than the elitist ruling class in Washington or in Hollywood. And that's exactly what this is.

I mean, I'm not a black American but I would get vaccinated a second time if it meant that I could go see Barack Obama speak. We can all do more. And this was a big conversation early on in the pandemic when the vaccine was coming about how the people that we really need to be out there talking about it for the black and brown communities are people that matter to those communities. So, Jay Z and Beyonce and LeBron James and what a big deal it was when NBA players, you know, had one shot and not the second shot and ended up in protocols and it's confusing. I mean, this is a confusing disease and you say it's a terrible sequel, the Delta variant. It's really terrible, though. I mean, when -- I don't -- I'm not calling it the DeSantis strain but there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people who are now hospitalized in Florida, and a lot of them children. And this is what 20 percent of the new cases of Delta are amongst children and that's why it's so important that adults are getting vaccinated, that you do your part and you do that to protect your children who are not approved to have the vaccine yet. So, I'm all for a full court press on the vaccination fronts, but I do agree, if he wants to have a party, he should have it.

And you have the mayor making statements and you have people like Cori Bush who have implemented this leftist ideology in cities across the country at the mayor -- the mayor level, at the prosecution level and criminals are in charge and it doesn't seem like they're doing anything to make sure that this doesn't keep happening. And, you know, Cori Bush keeps arguing she wants more social workers to be involved. Well, call a social worker to deal with a dangerous situation where someone will respond to a traffic stop with lethal force. And there are police officers every day who get up to serve their communities to make a difference. They don't go home. They have families, too.

It turns out actually the feds just arrested right before we came on air a straw gun purchaser. So, somebody bought the gun for the guy, now that guy is in trouble as well.

And yes, guns are part of the problem and someone who sold a gun to someone who had a felony charge beforehand and that person is going to be in trouble as well. It's a problem that majority have guns. They get used in some of these, in these cities come from conservative states with looser laws and then they get buffed across the border and then they get used in Chicago. But I do want to -- I don't want to be like oh silver lining in this because it's a tragedy to lose a life. I'm happy to hear more nuance to these discussions from people in positions of power who are moving away from just straight up, like this is about cops that gunned down unarmed people that we need to celebrate those in law enforcement who do risk their lives every day, and we also need to talk about the victims, the unarmed victims, but the police officers, in the way that they should be.

Meanwhile, and I say this all the time, Lori Lightfoot is depending on what she's calling the national problem of gun violence. That's to paper over the fact that the national problem is crime.

And the only answer is the one that keeps Chris Cuomo in his job. And that is we are watching privilege play out. Someone talked about privilege. This is fame, a political family. These are people born on third race that think they hit a triple and can't imagine now the world is actually going to hold them accountable for something.

Look, a couple things happened that we have to keep in mind. So, his chief of staff resigned today, so not only has he lost the people that Will just mentioned but when she who enabled a lot of this realizes that she better hop off of this train and try to save herself, if she can, because she's also going to be a witness in all of this, so she -- so she left. The other thing I did not realize is that once impeachment starts in the state of New York, he has to step aside as governor, OK. It's not like when we saw the Congress impeach the president twice where he's like, still at the White House and it's over because we know it's going to even going to pass. It's no big deal. He actually has to leave. So, I do think that because you saw his team float an idea today, a deal in which he basically would say to the state legislature, I promise not to run for a fourth term if you don't try to impeach me. To me that mean -- I think that he knows one, he's not running for a fourth term anyway. And two, he knows if he gets impeached, it's all over and he knows he's going to get impeached. So, I think that -- I don't know how he leaves, but he leaves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "So, Jessica, there was another big resignation as well today, the leader of the Time's Up Movement, which is supposed to be about defending women from sexual harassment and sexual assault at work, Roberta Kaplan, she actually was helping Governor Cuomo go after the women who were accusing him of doing all these things and corroborated in this report that we saw come out. So, there's that layer of a too as well as this times Time's Up Hollywood movement that was on the left that was supposed to be standing up for women, and the woman who was running the show was actually helping to smear the reputations the women coming forward."

    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that this is really a continuation of the story that we've been seeing in the aftermath of, you know, the beginning of Time's Up where people realized, actually, these stories are incredibly textured and they're different in cases. Like, do you remember the beginning that suddenly like, Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken are the same person which is like, so unbelievably ludicrous. And I'm sure that Al Franken is still sitting there going like, I cannot believe that I resigned, right, after what we have seen happened since there. So, I think it was right for her to resign. And I do -- as someone, well, the only member of the Liberal Party at the table, I can tell you that people who have the same politics of me have really shifted away from believing in organizations or supporting organizations to moving to case by case basis. This is what I think about this particular instance. And Greg and I were talking about this before we came out here. When the Governor Cuomo scandals shifted from the nursing homes to Me Too, that's when I said this is not going to end well for him, because I think that people were a lot more comfortable and felt like there was more fodder to go after him on this where it seems -- I mean, these are very real accusations, and Tish James, it did not make her happy, I'm sure, to have to release that report. There were like 11-plus women. So, they knew that this was something that all of society can get behind, right? This is something that we have come up with. And you're going to have President Biden who was forced to, and I'm sure he called Cuomo ahead of time and said, I said on Stephanopoulos, if the report is bad that you're going, and that was the standard you wanted us to hold you to. And I've known you for decades, and I loved your dad, but this is the standard that we've set for the party."

That what we're doing right now is obviously started as a simulation to see if we could live on Earth. Yes. So, what we are now talking about a simulation within a simulation. We are sitting here right now, we are part of a test to see if we can actually live on the other Earth. We just don't know that. I know. And I'm not even high."

Both won gold with Kevin Durant leading the men to close win over France and earning his third gold medal. He's now the most decorated basketball Olympian alongside Carmelo Anthony. And veterans Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi pulled out all the stops to earn their fifth gold medals. Bird said this was her last Olympics while Taurasi added, see you in Paris where the 22 -- 2024 games are. Congratulations to both teams. And something cool.

It's a carp and he didn't reel this thing in on a typical rod and reel. He was bow fishing when he shot the 125 pound, five ounce carp. He thought he was shooting a 30 pound grass carp.
