Maybe he could pull it out because he had the momentum. OK. Then he got the endorsement from President Trump. You've got to be honest this was, you know, disappointing because they really hoped to kind of turn this around. When you look at the map, you saw, wow, red, red, red, red, red. But some of the bigger cities and those urban areas, the suburbs, we've seen that happen, right? In New York, et cetera, where you've got a few key places, cities that are more urban that actually pull in the large majority of votes despite the fact that the whole rest of the map was red. So fascinating from that point because we've seen a bit of a trend, you know, in that direction, and we certainly did in the presidential election. And then I thought it was kind of interesting what Trump, kind of, backed away a little bit. Well, you weren't enough like I am, so therefore you didn't get it across the finish line.",

I don't think the last three presidential elections a Republican has won that state. There's a lot of government employees there, a larger Hispanic population, and very wealthy zip codes. Virginia was never Trump country. Donald Trump eked out the primary win over Rubio, and then lost it by 5 points to Hillary Clinton. The new Virginia governor as Greg pointed put the other day is a two-time George W. Bush voter, not a member of the resistance, and a navy veteran. And the Democrats have not won anything in red territory yet. Let's be honest. This was not on enemy territory. This was their home turf. And so, let's pump the brakes on the Dem wave. At the same time, I think in 2008 or '09 when Obama was in the same position, Republicans had won New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Virginia, so let's just slow down. Now there are warning signs, Trumps approval rating in Virginia, 40 percent. That's not very good. Turnout among Democrats was very, very high, and it was an anti-Trump vote. It wasn't a pro- Northam vote. And they did very well as Kimberly said, the Democrats among suburban people, especially, college educated white, especially, college educated women. And the Republicans got trounced in the state legislature races, which mean the grassroots movement is there. There is a concern though and here it is. Remember how Obama did so well when he was on the ticket, but then when he was off the ticket he got trounced? So the warning signs, because of Trump's loyal base, and he's a persona driven movement that when he's not there in a midterm or an off-year election, the people aren't going to turn out and it's going to be an anti-Trump vote instead.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "sentences": "Yeah. I think this is completely natural, the pendulum swing. We saw this under Obama. The opposition is always more galvanized when they are out of power. They have every reason to go out there and vote. And it's more exciting to vote for President Obama that his party, and it was more exciting to vote for Donald Trump that his party. So that's what you see. You need a focal point which was president Obama and Donald Trump. But it's oddly -- it's like a natural set of checks and balances. You elect this guy, Donald Trump, and then you let the other side gained seats by not voting. It's almost unconsciously some kind of evolutionary reflex that we crave the tension between parties. We want to have this guy in, but we don't want to go too far so we almost unconsciously decide not to put anything out there until we have to. So you get this weird kind of balance. But I want to talk about just one more thing. If Ed Gillespie had won, Juan would have said this was a harbinger of bitter, hateful campaign. But now these ugly ads that go after sanctuary cities laws, this is going to be the norm because Ed Gillespie won. Ralph won. That's an ominous sign that bitter, hateful identity, political politics ad, because that ad that we trashed works. The ad that portrayed white people -- white Republicans as racist who killed children, it actually worked. When Tom Perez talks about fear, hatred, and bigotry, he's talking about his own party. This should send a chill up everybody's spine, if you still got a spine, that this is dangerous stuff. The company that did that ad already claimed they're going to double down -- I hate that phrase. But they're going to double down. So the idea that somehow, you know, they did something really, really ugly and it worked.",

Forty percent of voters say it was their number one issue. And they favored Northam, the Democrat, by 55 percent. Wow. Now you factor in what happened in Maine where you had Maine voters go against their governor and say, you know what, we want to expand Medicaid. Oh, my gosh. This is the first time that Obamacare has been expanded by a general referendum, if you will, general vote of the people. And again, it says a lot about what could be the big issues going into '18. And the other thing I would throw in here is that for the Democrat, the reason they're so exuberant, is they can now -- they're going to see a boost in fund-raising, in candidates. Ray Ben Lujan, who runs the house Democratic election caucus -- he's saying, you know what, I'm calling people all night, people are calling me back. That's unbelievable.

Why can't these folks do that? Because they made politics a bigger part of their lives than it should be. They made the political personal. Sadly, once politics trumps everything, it's all because these people lack real friends and healthy relationships with their own families. Instead of fun they fret. Instead of laughing they lament. They're miserable. Look at sports, entertainment, friendship: When politics intrudes, it devours. It replaces joy with anger. Look what happened to the NFL. It used to be fun. The key to life is realizing that life goes on with or without politics. And that person you hate politically might be more like you than you might think. Admitting that is part of growing up, which sadly doesn't always accompany growing old.

Maybe he could pull it out because he had the momentum. OK. Then he got the endorsement from President Trump. You've got to be honest this was, you know, disappointing because they really hoped to kind of turn this around. When you look at the map, you saw, wow, red, red, red, red, red. But some of the bigger cities and those urban areas, the suburbs, we've seen that happen, right? In New York, et cetera, where you've got a few key places, cities that are more urban that actually pull in the large majority of votes despite the fact that the whole rest of the map was red. So fascinating from that point because we've seen a bit of a trend, you know, in that direction, and we certainly did in the presidential election. And then I thought it was kind of interesting what Trump, kind of, backed away a little bit. Well, you weren't enough like I am, so therefore you didn't get it across the finish line."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So, and we'll be going to the screen fest later when they're all yelling and how angry they are about the election. I want to be undercover. So, look at Virginia. I don't think the last three presidential elections a Republican has won that state. There's a lot of government employees there, a larger Hispanic population, and very wealthy zip codes. Virginia was never Trump country. Donald Trump eked out the primary win over Rubio, and then lost it by 5 points to Hillary Clinton. The new Virginia governor as Greg pointed put the other day is a two-time George W. Bush voter, not a member of the resistance, and a navy veteran. And the Democrats have not won anything in red territory yet. Let's be honest. This was not on enemy territory. This was their home turf. And so, let's pump the brakes on the Dem wave. At the same time, I think in 2008 or '09 when Obama was in the same position, Republicans had won New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Virginia, so let's just slow down. Now there are warning signs, Trumps approval rating in Virginia, 40 percent. That's not very good. Turnout among Democrats was very, very high, and it was an anti-Trump vote. It wasn't a pro- Northam vote. And they did very well as Kimberly said, the Democrats among suburban people, especially, college educated white, especially, college educated women. And the Republicans got trounced in the state legislature races, which mean the grassroots movement is there. There is a concern though and here it is. Remember how Obama did so well when he was on the ticket, but then when he was off the ticket he got trounced? So the warning signs, because of Trump's loyal base, and he's a persona driven movement that when he's not there in a midterm or an off-year election, the people aren't going to turn out and it's going to be an anti-Trump vote instead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "But part of that though, Greg, was because Obama pretty much didn't worry about it. He just let the party kind of do it. He was like the party of one. And that's one of the reasons that they had to claw their way back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think this is completely natural, the pendulum swing. We saw this under Obama. The opposition is always more galvanized when they are out of power. They have every reason to go out there and vote. And it's more exciting to vote for President Obama that his party, and it was more exciting to vote for Donald Trump that his party. So that's what you see. You need a focal point which was president Obama and Donald Trump. But it's oddly -- it's like a natural set of checks and balances. You elect this guy, Donald Trump, and then you let the other side gained seats by not voting. It's almost unconsciously some kind of evolutionary reflex that we crave the tension between parties. We want to have this guy in, but we don't want to go too far so we almost unconsciously decide not to put anything out there until we have to. So you get this weird kind of balance. But I want to talk about just one more thing. If Ed Gillespie had won, Juan would have said this was a harbinger of bitter, hateful campaign. But now these ugly ads that go after sanctuary cities laws, this is going to be the norm because Ed Gillespie won. Ralph won. That's an ominous sign that bitter, hateful identity, political politics ad, because that ad that we trashed works. The ad that portrayed white people -- white Republicans as racist who killed children, it actually worked. When Tom Perez talks about fear, hatred, and bigotry, he's talking about his own party. This should send a chill up everybody's spine, if you still got a spine, that this is dangerous stuff. The company that did that ad already claimed they're going to double down -- I hate that phrase. But they're going to double down. So the idea that somehow, you know, they did something really, really ugly and it worked."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Because I think that that is -- that they'll probably will. They'll try to run that play again and again. Juan, I will give you the floor here in a second. I just want to point out that married women had gone for President Trump in Virginia by a point over. Ralph Northam won married women by ten points over Gillespie. But still Gillespie got 120,000 more Republican votes in 2017, than he did in 2014 when he ran for the senate. So it was a high turnout election all across the board, but the Democrats certainly had a lot more votes."

      "utterance": "You remember that. Well, to 10, when the Republicans took over the house from the Democrats. And so what we saw in both cases is very similar what we saw here in Virginia, but nationwide last night. And so, then you look at things like now the generic number in terms of preference, Republicans, Democrats, for the House of Representatives is double digit at the moment for the Democrats. And then factor in what Greg was talking about in terms of Trump's approval rating at the moment, I think, Gallup is about 38 percent. This does not help, especially when you consider historically."

Now, I think the big points that I took away from last night, the big issue was not immigration. Not at all. The big issue, number one issue, health care. Not even close. Forty percent of voters say it was their number one issue. And they favored Northam, the Democrat, by 55 percent. Wow. Now you factor in what happened in Maine where you had Maine voters go against their governor and say, you know what, we want to expand Medicaid. Oh, my gosh. This is the first time that Obamacare has been expanded by a general referendum, if you will, general vote of the people. And again, it says a lot about what could be the big issues going into '18. And the other thing I would throw in here is that for the Democrat, the reason they're so exuberant, is they can now -- they're going to see a boost in fund-raising, in candidates. Ray Ben Lujan, who runs the house Democratic election caucus -- he's saying, you know what, I'm calling people all night, people are calling me back. That's unbelievable. All of a sudden Democrats who have been lagging find that they have some energy. So I think this is good news."

Our Trade with Canada, Mexico, of exports from the United States is up.

And so if, for example, there was a -- Kimberly, correct me if I'm wrong. But let's just say that a pregnant mother, she's driving down the highway. She gets hit by a drunk driver, and it was reckless endangerment and she lives but the baby dies. That would in Texas and in many other states, including Virginia, that child would be counted as a life that passed away. So it varies by state.

Just reading this article here, they don't even use the phrase \"pro-life\" anymore when describing these groups. They call them \"antiabortion groups.\" So it's all disguised in the way you describe these people and the language that's used to characterize people from a certain position, sometimes fairly and sometimes unfairly. But that's what you're saying. I believe some pro-choice women would like to start saving for college while they're pregnant. I don't know why it's being so politicized."

We live in a war between reality and politics. In reality, the human is alive until you abort it. You know that. It's dead. Politically, it's your choice, your right to choose. So you take something that is real and then you turn it into something political. These sides, the real and the political, they run parallel. They never cross, but they can. And every now and then, you will run into a pro- choicer -- you run into this more often than you used to, and I call it the honest pro-choicer. \"I'm pro-choice, even though I know it's murder.\" You see this a lot now. If you watch Louis C.K.'s Netflix comedy, he opens with this. And it is -- it's like people, they're beginning to understand, because science..."

That's -- I mean, both sides have to contend with the ugly realities of their stances. And the -- but the fact is, all this comes down to everybody kind of knows what it is."
