He didn't check that. He lied about that. And we know Adam Schiff lied. His team had contact with the whistleblower. He lied to the American people about it, and he withheld that from the committee.

Also, when the Obama-Biden people installed their handpicked investigators over -- in Ukraine after the revolution, they pressured the Ukrainians to investigate Paul Manafort. And as a matter of fact, the DNC paid one of their contractors $70,000 to work with the Ukrainian embassy to get dirt on Manafort. And who did they link that deep state dirt to? Michael Isikoff.  And that guy was the same guy who was the recipient of the Christopher Steele fake dossier. And that's how it got push into the bloodstream.

This weekend the press published stories about the premier of the film the Joker, linking it to white rage. It was as if they've already had these pieces written beforehand by the same CNN intern. While they hallucinated grim narratives, one played out for real on the streets of New York. A madman murdered 4 homeless men just blocks from the mayor's office. Presumably, the madman haven't seen the Joker. He was young derange transient with 14 priors. This crime was a result of a bureaucracy that washes its hands in both the homeless and the criminal insane, allowing tragedy to follow both. I haven't seen the film, but I know the plot. The Joker suffers from mental illness, but due to budget cuts the government slashes his treatment. That seems a more relevant plot point than race. And it underscores Saturday night mayhem. In America cities, government idea of treatment is the streets. The Saturday night massacre won't leave the news because the homeless aren't the prettiest victims. And the perp isn't the ideal mustache twirling villain. But it's not a movie it's today's world run by those who prefer to punish offensive words rather than prevent demonic deeds. So the most desperate are left to suffer until they turn on themselves. It's no story from D.C. Comics, but the other D.C, a reality born from an abdicating of responsibilities by a hopeless bureaucracy, which is maybe why the mayor and the media prefer the comic book. You know, Dana, there was a new article on the L.A. Times, did actually a good job, reporting that 76 percent of the homeless -- I guess, in L.A. County, 76 percent are afflicted by any -- certain kind of mental illness, and they believe that it's probably under-reported because it was a written survey.",

They're like -- and the reason is because for the past, like, 8 years before Trump, they were like an abstinent priest and now they're in the red light district under Trump and they're humping the lamp posts. They can't get enough. I am so sick of the phrase whistleblower because they're really aren't whistleblowers. As my friend Walter said, Brennan's the whistleblower. They're the whistle answerers. They're all coming -- they're coming to help support this kind -- I would call it like a legal slow rolling coup, because they're aren't really whistleblowers because they're not going against the establishment. The establishment is supporting them. They aren't taking really any risks. They're getting pats on the back. So this idea that somehow these are legitimate whistleblower. No, it's just a lineup of people they have to see which one works. And you know the story is waning and that it's actually getting fun kind of, because now the media is no longer covering impeachment. They're covering Dems continue to apply pressure on impeachment.

      "utterance": "Once again the media accidentally presents a stark contrast between their phony storytelling and real life that's going on around you. This weekend the press published stories about the premier of the film the Joker, linking it to white rage. It was as if they've already had these pieces written beforehand by the same CNN intern. While they hallucinated grim narratives, one played out for real on the streets of New York. A madman murdered 4 homeless men just blocks from the mayor's office. Presumably, the madman haven't seen the Joker. He was young derange transient with 14 priors. This crime was a result of a bureaucracy that washes its hands in both the homeless and the criminal insane, allowing tragedy to follow both. I haven't seen the film, but I know the plot. The Joker suffers from mental illness, but due to budget cuts the government slashes his treatment. That seems a more relevant plot point than race. And it underscores Saturday night mayhem. In America cities, government idea of treatment is the streets. The Saturday night massacre won't leave the news because the homeless aren't the prettiest victims. And the perp isn't the ideal mustache twirling villain. But it's not a movie it's today's world run by those who prefer to punish offensive words rather than prevent demonic deeds. So the most desperate are left to suffer until they turn on themselves. It's no story from D.C. Comics, but the other D.C, a reality born from an abdicating of responsibilities by a hopeless bureaucracy, which is maybe why the mayor and the media prefer the comic book. You know, Dana, there was a new article on the L.A. Times, did actually a good job, reporting that 76 percent of the homeless -- I guess, in L.A. County, 76 percent are afflicted by any -- certain kind of mental illness, and they believe that it's probably under-reported because it was a written survey."

So, I think he's right. I would be glad to see it and I'm glad to see you know - to my mind, those are very vulnerable people. I think that at times they can be threatening, and they can certainly make me feel uncomfortable. I don't want to deal with the feeling like oh, my God, why is this person laying in the street you know, should I give them money, shouldn't I give them money? Is this person as Jesse said going to attack me? But that's me. But I mean for a second, let's get away from me and talk about them. That's a sad way to live your life. What a loss of life, right.

You have had a reduction of the number of beds for the mentally ill in hospitals and other facilities because of Governor Cuomo and his ilk. The New York Post has written about this extensively, but the people in the mental health industry act like talking about the homeless being mentally ill or drug and alcohol addicted is somehow harmful. No, it's harmful to ignore it. It's harmful to keep talking about throwing more money at a problem when money doesn't work. The Thrive New York City initiative by the mayor's wife, $850 million and mental health in this city is worse. And also, homelessness, doubling homeless spending to nearly $3 billion.

Several Chinese businesses reacted by suspending deals with the team. The Rockets and the NBA responded by quickly apologizing. The move though didn't sit well with politicians in the USA. Both parties now blasting the NBA over the situation. Jesse, Daryl Morey, who is the Houston Rockets General Manager put this out, stand with Hong Kong. That's what he said. Immediately, the Chinese consulate in Houston said, they wanted steps taken to eliminate any adverse impact, apparently calling for him to be fired or disciplined.

Why are we all coming down so hard on the NBA? Of course, yes, we should stand with the freedom fighters in Hong Kong. Of course, do these NBA players know that or are they thinking about the Hong Kong freedom rights issues. No, I mean it's a huge market over there for them, for their merchandise, for their broadcasting rights. The Chinese love Houston Rockets because of Yao Ming. He was their biggest player ever internationally on the world stage. They don't want to do anything to jeopardize that. I understand.

You're spot on. The NBA, the champion of social justice here has rolled over and said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, communist government, please let us do business in your country where you have a million Muslim workers (ph) in concentration camps, where you control the speech and the Internet, use artificial intelligence and facial recognition to track your own people.

In this media cycle, would anybody have noticed, no one would have noticed because the next day, their overreaction guaranteed a media response that carries the message much further for and on behalf of Hong Kong. Right. The problem is, I agree with Jesse that you know the NBA is not a democracy. It's a business. But at the same time this is a company that went off on transgender bathrooms because that was the virtue signal that they felt safe with. But this was going to - the bathrooms wasn't going to cost them a dime. But this was so those greedy jerks decided to acquiesce to a dictatorship but feel really good about the bathrooms."
