Unfortunately, for him, it's his disapproval rating. A new CNBC Change Research poll, finds it Biden's overall disapproval rating stands at 56 percent, which is the worst of his presidency so far. Now, Democrats see the same Biden poll numbers that we do, they're all abysmal, and they know that he's going to drag them all down, come November. And having no intention of changing course and returning to the Trump policies that actually worked, they've decided to run on only one thing, January 6th.

Now, the Left has spent the last four years promoting the narrative that America is a rotten racist country. They've torn down our history and defamed all that is good about this nation. And now they want us to believe that they're the defenders of American democracy? I can't believe Ro Khanna was even quoting Thomas Jefferson. Don't they all believe he's a racist? And are any of these people, by the way, predicting - who are out there predicting the end of democracy, are they liquidating their portfolios? Are they staying away from horrible, awful rotten places like Florida or South Dakota? Are they stockpiling weapons to protect themselves? Are they getting passports so they can quickly move to Canada, Europe with the whole thing collapses? Did any of them flee the country after Trump won in 2016? Of course not. They're not afraid of losing democracy. They're afraid of losing power. They're afraid of maybe going to fundraisers without masks. OK.

What happened to all of that? They don't even talk about Russia anymore. Now ever since 1/6 there's a completely different existential threat to American democracy, which is that Trump has visions of putting his descendants in camps. Even though over four years as president he never did any of that. That he's going to overthrow U.S. democracy and institute totalitarianism. The - really what this is about Laura is they know that they have no governing program that's popular, and that can help them win elections. In all of what they're talking about where's there any discussion of the conditions of American workers or inflation or COVID, or anything like that?

One of the only times people did is on January 6th, they had their record viewership. They're so desperate for Trump to come back for January 6 to be talked about, again, it's just this crass effort to try and make themselves relevant. But, you know, I don't think - I mean, I always said I didn't think Americans woke up in the morning and worried about Vladimir Putin, that they were going to vote based on Russia gate. I don't think they wake up in the morning scared of what happened on January 6, I think they have a lot of other things on their mind. And it's a loser. But, the thing is this whole attempt to call January 6 at Insurrection, the Democrats have been in charge of the Justice Department for an entire year now, they've been investigating very aggressively everything in connection with January 6. Do you know how many people have been charged with inciting Insurrection or sedition or treason at or domestic terrorism as a result of anything? Zero? Exactly.

A poll in 2017 said that at least two- thirds of Democrats believe that there was fraud in the 2016 election, he had actually won, that Russia had intervened. So when you have Democrats - and they - after the 2016 election, they planned what they called an Electoral College coup. They were trying to convince faithless Electoral College voters to vote for Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump, even though Trump won that state. So when you have Democrats simultaneously attacking democracy, because they always need to win, and at the same time claiming democracy has been overturned whenever they lose, of course, there's going to be a lot of people who start believing that democracy is in very (inaudible) And I think you're right, it's happening on both sides, because people look at that process and see that it's just not functioning the way it should.",

You could have every kid in the country infected, and even then that's going to only be a blip in terms of the severe illness and death rates that we see. Right? We know by and large, that children don't get sick very much. And when they do, they don't die. The CDC actually on December 31st, just a few days ago, released its own study that showed that in children who are infected and hospitalized, almost half of them have another viral infection. Many of them are in the hospital for another reason other than COVID, and Dr. Fauci recently admitted that. And showed that you can pretty much predict which kids are going to get extremely ill, and that's based on their prior medical history as well as being obese. And so if you have kids who are already very sick, or obese or have other risk factors, they're the ones to focus on. But young, healthy kids, otherwise who don't have other comorbidities, why focus on them so much?

It was a real - it is - remains a real problem. But for some reason that that part of it never gets discussed, it suddenly is now.

There's a very high risk for adverse side effects of heart inflammation for young healthy males under the age of 40. That once you're vaccinated outweighs the risk COVID poses to you at that point.

I will be candid about that. It is just surrealistic when you look what they both said about the candidacy of Barack Obama. Harry Reid said he was light-skinned and he could turn off and on his negro dialect. It was almost exactly what Joe Biden said when he disparaged Obama as clean and articulate, the first person who was an African American serious candidate. And finally, they viewed their senatorial careers as family franchises. If you wanted to have a federal or state contract, or you wanted to get in on one in Nevada, you had to do business with the Reid family, the three boys and the son-in-law, and the same was true of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden's brother.

Jo Rose was arrested after she tried to get served at an Appleby's without a vax card. She joins us now.

Now, Democrats see the same Biden poll numbers that we do, they're all abysmal, and they know that he's going to drag them all down, come November. And having no intention of changing course and returning to the Trump policies that actually worked, they've decided to run on only one thing, January 6th.

The end result of this drumbeat is predictable. The new NPR Ipsos Poll finds that 64 percent of Americans believe our democracy is in crisis, and at risk of failing. Now, the Left has spent the last four years promoting the narrative that America is a rotten racist country. They've torn down our history and defamed all that is good about this nation. And now they want us to believe that they're the defenders of American democracy? I can't believe Ro Khanna was even quoting Thomas Jefferson. Don't they all believe he's a racist? And are any of these people, by the way, predicting - who are out there predicting the end of democracy, are they liquidating their portfolios? Are they staying away from horrible, awful rotten places like Florida or South Dakota? Are they stockpiling weapons to protect themselves? Are they getting passports so they can quickly move to Canada, Europe with the whole thing collapses? Did any of them flee the country after Trump won in 2016? Of course not. They're not afraid of losing democracy. They're afraid of losing power. They're afraid of maybe going to fundraisers without masks. OK.

What happened to all of that? They don't even talk about Russia anymore. Now ever since 1/6 there's a completely different existential threat to American democracy, which is that Trump has visions of putting his descendants in camps. Even though over four years as president he never did any of that. That he's going to overthrow U.S. democracy and institute totalitarianism. The - really what this is about Laura is they know that they have no governing program that's popular, and that can help them win elections. In all of what they're talking about where's there any discussion of the conditions of American workers or inflation or COVID, or anything like that?

He goes to work at CNN every single day, that's the prism through which he evaluates the world. But remember also, Laura, that nobody watches CNN. One of the only times people did is on January 6th, they had their record viewership. They're so desperate for Trump to come back for January 6 to be talked about, again, it's just this crass effort to try and make themselves relevant. But, you know, I don't think - I mean, I always said I didn't think Americans woke up in the morning and worried about Vladimir Putin, that they were going to vote based on Russia gate. I don't think they wake up in the morning scared of what happened on January 6, I think they have a lot of other things on their mind. And it's a loser. But, the thing is this whole attempt to call January 6 at Insurrection, the Democrats have been in charge of the Justice Department for an entire year now, they've been investigating very aggressively everything in connection with January 6. Do you know how many people have been charged with inciting Insurrection or sedition or treason at or domestic terrorism as a result of anything? Zero? Exactly. Just like Robert Mueller never indicted anybody for criminally conspiring with Russia. They live in this fantasy world, that never corresponds to the reality.

In 2016, they said the same thing about Donald Trump's victory. They said he was an illegitimate President. Hillary Clinton called him mad. A poll in 2017 said that at least two- thirds of Democrats believe that there was fraud in the 2016 election, he had actually won, that Russia had intervened. So when you have Democrats - and they - after the 2016 election, they planned what they called an Electoral College coup. They were trying to convince faithless Electoral College voters to vote for Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump, even though Trump won that state. So when you have Democrats simultaneously attacking democracy, because they always need to win, and at the same time claiming democracy has been overturned whenever they lose, of course, there's going to be a lot of people who start believing that democracy is in very (inaudible) And I think you're right, it's happening on both sides, because people look at that process and see that it's just not functioning the way it should."

And that's what's going to make this blizzard of cases occurring across the United States now, only some of which are actually being counted, because people are doing so many at home tests and finding that whole families are positive. And so what? You know they have mild symptoms by and large. And that's the way this is going to go. Delta, as the CDC said today, Delta is now down below 5 percent of cases.

You could have every kid in the country infected, and even then that's going to only be a blip in terms of the severe illness and death rates that we see. Right? We know by and large, that children don't get sick very much. And when they do, they don't die. The CDC actually on December 31st, just a few days ago, released its own study that showed that in children who are infected and hospitalized, almost half of them have another viral infection. Many of them are in the hospital for another reason other than COVID, and Dr. Fauci recently admitted that. And showed that you can pretty much predict which kids are going to get extremely ill, and that's based on their prior medical history as well as being obese. And so if you have kids who are already very sick, or obese or have other risk factors, they're the ones to focus on. But young, healthy kids, otherwise who don't have other comorbidities, why focus on them so much? Again, if they focus those - their efforts on the people in our population, and I don't mean children who are at risk, we would be in a different place right now. But they're not they're putting too much effort on children."

It was a real - it is - remains a real problem. But for some reason that that part of it never gets discussed, it suddenly is now. By the way, the CDC just released new guidance for testing that I think is only going to confuse a lot of people more. \"As noted in the labeling for authorized over-the-counter antigen test, negative results should be treated as presumptive negative results. They do not rule out a COVID-19 infection.\" Dr. Risch so negative doesn't mean negative anymore."

And so people have to be treated if they're high risk, and otherwise, they do well, there's a lot of over the counter stuff that we know that helps today. So the cases really don't count anymore.

So why are their COVID policies completely insane? Now, take Georgetown University where fully vaxxed students are randomly tested for COVID every week. Positive students are forced to quarantine in a room on campus for 10 days where food is dropped off once a day. Princeton University doesn't allow fully vaxxed students to leave the county unless they're on a sports team. And all students are tested there twice a week. And then there's George Mason University where my next guest is a law student. Joining me now is Robert Fellner. Now, Robert, your school is not only mandating masks, it's requiring that all students now get boosted in order to be considered fully vaxxed. Now how long did they give you all to comply?"

And then on New Year's Eve, at 7:00 pm, we were told that everyone needs to receive a third shot of the vaccine - the booster within 45 days. And this goes against everything that I learned at George Mason about the importance of free consent, free voluntary choice and informed consent because what they're doing here is they're preventing students from being able to make a free choice. Because if someone wants to say, no, I don't need the third shot, I've recovered from COVID, I've had two shots, I'm already protected. There's a very high risk for adverse side effects of heart inflammation for young healthy males under the age of 40. That once you're vaccinated outweighs the risk COVID poses to you at that point. They say no, they have to sacrifice 10s of 1000s of dollars in lost scholarship, getting kicked out of school or dropping out and trying to start over again somewhere else next year. It's, to me it's just incredibly unethical."

And they don't want to be the guy or gal who gets up and says no, not doing this. Is there a lot of fear in George Mason about that point?"

And to me, that's what makes this third vaccine mandate so indefensible, because, again, a bunch of classmates are very, very healthy, young males in their 20s who both recovered from COVID and got two shots within the past 10 months. And it's clear that it's a net harm to force them to get a third. And you're right, they understandably don't want to get the negative attention. They just want to put their heads down and go along. So to see the administration exploit that power imbalance and leverage that against these students who were denied free choice, to me, is just indefensible. So two days ago I started a petition on Change.org for George Mason to repeal this mandate. We've already had over 100 signatures from students, alumni, and professors. So that made me see right away that there is a lot of people out there who feel the same way. But, like you said --"

I want to read for you an interview he gave during the 2012 campaign about Mitt Romney and Romney's taxes. \"His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,\" Reid said in in reference to George Romney's decision to turn over 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president.

I guess if Al Capone died, we would be confined to talking about the fact he made really good spaghetti and meatballs, could say nothing about what this man's life was defined by. The same with Harry Reid. He has been a divisive and poisonous force in American politics. American politics is designed to be an argument, well, if not between friends, then at least among people who are not sworn enemies. And I think if we look back to American politics, we see Reagan didn't treat his opponents as enemies, neither did Carter, neither, did, by the way, Bill Clinton. So what changed, and who changed it? Well, there are certain key figures and Harry Reid is one of them, where they begin to treat the political adversaries as enemies, as people to be destroyed. And they look for ways to game the system, bringing an almost like a Las Vegas gangster style to politics. And we are living with the ugly fruits of that today. In fact, it's hardening our hearts, those of us that want to actually have arguments can't have them because we are in the mode of constant demonization and recriminations."

They were roughly the same age, 79 and 82. They spent decades in the Senate. They represented the supposed old centrist Democrats that were tough on crime, for the Iraq war, against abortion. They cultivated an image of good old Joe from Scranton and Harry was from Searchlight, Nevada, common made people. But they were actually very mean-spirited is the way you pointed out with Mitt Romney, and Joe Biden saying, dogface pony soldier, fat, junky. They both had a problem with race. I will be candid about that. It is just surrealistic when you look what they both said about the candidacy of Barack Obama. Harry Reid said he was light-skinned and he could turn off and on his negro dialect. It was almost exactly what Joe Biden said when he disparaged Obama as clean and articulate, the first person who was an African American serious candidate. And finally, they viewed their senatorial careers as family franchises. If you wanted to have a federal or state contract, or you wanted to get in on one in Nevada, you had to do business with the Reid family, the three boys and the son-in-law, and the same was true of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden's brother. And they viewed their senatorial careers as ways of making the family rich. In the end, you can see why thy squad and the hard lift took over the Democratic Party, because that old guard that Biden and Reid represented were opportunistic. They didn't have firm principles."

The death of Rosanne Boyland is now being called into question. Was she the second Trump supporter that was killed by the authorities? Now, I think as all this empirical, irrefutable, on video evidence is coming out, there is a kind of necessity on the part of the left to conduct a big public dance which distracts attention from the facts and tries to sort of reinforce the original narrative.

And If you took the vaccine then you should be safe and protected, or does the vaccine not actually work? I don't understand at all. And then I did message him again, and I texted him that he is not only the mayor of the vaccinated, he has the right to respond to myself and to other people. We have lost our jobs.
