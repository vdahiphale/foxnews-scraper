We have a lot of ground to cover for you. The American voter, you have a lot to consider, so much on the line. The largest caravan in a decade approaches our southern border. The president's response and mine are ahead.  Plus, the new tactics of the left might not be so new (inaudible) 1968? Well, former speaker Newt Gingrich on the parallels between that faithful year for the Democratic Party and what is happening today.  And we will have a new series for you tonight, \"Hidden Scandals,\" how the media's coverage of certain Democratic candidates really amounts to a cover-up.  And tonight, our analysis of a Texas senatorial candidate, of course, Beto O'Rourke, you want to stick around for that. Victor Davis Hanson is also here. But first, the midterm border rush and possible electoral crush. That is the focus of tonight's Angle. As our cable competitors are devoting hours of coverage today to the president's tweets about Stormy Daniels, voters I think are just tuning im out. Why? Because the voters are smarter than the media thinks they are, as usual. Americans outside the leftist activist bubble are focused on issues that actually affect their daily lives -- pocketbook issues.  Like the stock market jumped 500 points today. Tech stocks way up -- that's good for your 401(k). And the Labor Department reported that there are 7 million job openings currently in the United States. And our industrial output is surging, all fantastic news. But Americans also see some trouble on the horizon as well. Lawlessness at the border that no advance society should tolerate. Now, we have another mass of people, as many as 4,000 I am told, another so-called migrant caravan making its way from Honduras to the United States. And President Trump has had just about enough.",

In fact even on the issue of legal immigration, and a lot of people don't know this, the country is not clamoring for big increases. Check this out. Only 28 percent of Americans want immigration levels increased. Twenty-nine percent of Americans want them decreased. Now (inaudible) as you see want them just to remain the same.   Of course most politicians continue to just ignore the wishes of the people, so what they do is they continue to expand things like distant relative chain migration. They refuse to allocate money to the building of the entire wall of the southern border. And they refuse to pass legislation to allow for immediate border turn backs of anyone crossing the border illegally. And of course, Democrats are just against all tightening of the current ridiculous rules for asylum. Donald Trump won the presidency in large part because he wouldn't accept the status quo on immigration. And as usual, he was five steps ahead of most every Republican congressman on the issue. In July, Gallup found that Americans identified immigration as the top issue for them going into the midterms. Last month it was the second most important issue tied with just general economic problems. Democrats thought, I think, that a focus on the difficult issue of child separation, a practice that the administration has now ended, that that would turn out voters and get Democrats or Latino voters really excited to get out there.  But I don't think it is working for them. And remember back in 2016, the Latino voter turnout rate did not increase. Despite Trump's push for the wall and a lot of stronger immigration enforcement. And of course Hispanic Americans are themselves disproportionately affected by the impact of illegal immigration, and their neighborhoods and their communities. And ditto for black Americans. The good news is that as the second caravan drama unfolds, it turns out that some establishment Republicans are waking up to the wisdom of Trump.",

By the way, Honduras is on track to receive $65.7 million in foreign aid from the U.S. in the upcoming fiscal year, 2019. But back to the midterms, as frustrated as so many of us are with the Republicans and what they failed to do at the border, well, the cause may be totally lost if the open borders Democrats take the House while the president is focused on important things like abolishing the illegal immigrant gang MS-13, Democrats want to abolish ICE.",

Will the mass migration from other poor countries in Central America be stopped at all? Ever! Will travesty such as birthright citizenship finally be ended? Will we mandate, e-verify to penalize businesses who gain the system to keep American wages low? Of this my friends you can be sure, your views on immigration will have zero impact and zero influence on a House dominated by Democrats who want to replace you, the American voters, with newly amnestied citizens and an ever increasing number of chain migrants. If Republicans choose to unite, however, behind the presidents immigration policy, the way they just did in the Kavanaugh fight, this will stoke voter enthusiasm even further ahead of the all too important midterm elections. And that is \"The Angle.\"   All right, joining us now with reaction here in studio with me Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, and Jose Aristimuno, is a Democratic strategist and former DNC deputy press secretary. All right fellows, just a moment ago the president anticipating \"The Angle\" -- I'm sure -- tweeted about this very issue saying \"We have today informed the countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador that if they allow their citizens or others to journey through their borders and up to the United States with the intention of entering our country illegally, all payments made to them will stop.\"  In other words end. Tom Homan, you are the one with the most experience in this issue. Is the president right here in his approach?",

Now, we know -- I know you want to talk about what we just talked about first so I'll let you hit that because I think this immigration issue is not the most important issue facing the country today in the eyes of the voters, economy and that, one of the top two or three. And Donald Trump has always been ahead of everyone else on this issue and now we have another scene of lawlessness coming up through Mexico and Honduras.",

I think I want to come and claim I need refuge. And 6,000 people show up to your home and say, I really hope you'll take care of me. It is crazy.

On February 19th The New York Times affectionately dubbed Beto the lone star longshot. TIME magazine in May said Beto O'Rourke is on a long, hard road. But they described O'Rourke as handsome and charismatic. This past August, Esquire wrote \"Meet the Man Democrats Hope is the Next Obama.\" Going on to ask, \"Is this the man who could save the world from Trump?\" And finally Vanity Fair went to the place that sends a shiver up any Democrats leg, calling him Kennedy-esque. As it turns out, Beto, whose name is Robert Francis, is more Kennedy-esque than we thought. What those features failed to fully examine is O'Rourke's 1998 DWI, the details of which were much worse than previously reported.  Now, the news, details that were finally revealed in a August 31st \"Houston Chronicle\" piece.

The president's response and mine are ahead. Plus, the new tactics of the left might not be so new (inaudible) 1968? Well, former speaker Newt Gingrich on the parallels between that faithful year for the Democratic Party and what is happening today.

And tonight, our analysis of a Texas senatorial candidate, of course, Beto O'Rourke, you want to stick around for that. Victor Davis Hanson is also here. But first, the midterm border rush and possible electoral crush. That is the focus of tonight's Angle. As our cable competitors are devoting hours of coverage today to the president's tweets about Stormy Daniels, voters I think are just tuning im out. Why? Because the voters are smarter than the media thinks they are, as usual. Americans outside the leftist activist bubble are focused on issues that actually affect their daily lives -- pocketbook issues. Like the stock market jumped 500 points today. Tech stocks way up -- that's good for your 401(k). And the Labor Department reported that there are 7 million job openings currently in the United States. And our industrial output is surging, all fantastic news. But Americans also see some trouble on the horizon as well. Lawlessness at the border that no advance society should tolerate. Now, we have another mass of people, as many as 4,000 I am told, another so-called migrant caravan making its way from Honduras to the United States. And President Trump has had just about enough."

Only 28 percent of Americans want immigration levels increased. Twenty-nine percent of Americans want them decreased. Now (inaudible) as you see want them just to remain the same. Of course most politicians continue to just ignore the wishes of the people, so what they do is they continue to expand things like distant relative chain migration. They refuse to allocate money to the building of the entire wall of the southern border. And they refuse to pass legislation to allow for immediate border turn backs of anyone crossing the border illegally. And of course, Democrats are just against all tightening of the current ridiculous rules for asylum. Donald Trump won the presidency in large part because he wouldn't accept the status quo on immigration. And as usual, he was five steps ahead of most every Republican congressman on the issue. In July, Gallup found that Americans identified immigration as the top issue for them going into the midterms. Last month it was the second most important issue tied with just general economic problems. Democrats thought, I think, that a focus on the difficult issue of child separation, a practice that the administration has now ended, that that would turn out voters and get Democrats or Latino voters really excited to get out there. But I don't think it is working for them. And remember back in 2016, the Latino voter turnout rate did not increase. Despite Trump's push for the wall and a lot of stronger immigration enforcement. And of course Hispanic Americans are themselves disproportionately affected by the impact of illegal immigration, and their neighborhoods and their communities. And ditto for black Americans. The good news is that as the second caravan drama unfolds, it turns out that some establishment Republicans are waking up to the wisdom of Trump."

By the way, Honduras is on track to receive $65.7 million in foreign aid from the U.S. in the upcoming fiscal year, 2019. But back to the midterms, as frustrated as so many of us are with the Republicans and what they failed to do at the border, well, the cause may be totally lost if the open borders Democrats take the House while the president is focused on important things like abolishing the illegal immigrant gang MS-13, Democrats want to abolish ICE."

And that is \"The Angle.\" All right, joining us now with reaction here in studio with me Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, Tom Homan, former acting director of ICE, and Jose Aristimuno, is a Democratic strategist and former DNC deputy press secretary. All right fellows, just a moment ago the president anticipating \"The Angle\" -- I'm sure -- tweeted about this very issue saying \"We have today informed the countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador that if they allow their citizens or others to journey through their borders and up to the United States with the intention of entering our country illegally, all payments made to them will stop.\" In other words end.

So, that's another thing needed to address. But when it comes to this caravan, as I said last night, the president needs to work with Mexico.

But to your point, Laura, these people under international law and on U.S. law have the legality to go to our borders and seek asylum.

They are no longer in fear of persecution in that country. So this isn't about escaping fear and persecution, they can make asylum in Mexico. This is about getting to the United States.

It is finally, I think, reaching the ends of its game where it has become so ridiculous to tell people because they are women or because they are black or because they are Asian or white how they should think and how they should vote. People are rejecting this en masse. Frankly, I think it is why they voted for Donald Trump in 2016, because as crazy as some people might think he was and how unpredictable and how untraditional he ran his campaign, they felt this was the last hope to try and break this down. I think it's starting to break down.

I think that's a lot of stuff we agree on. And Rachel Campos-Duffy, I think, though, President Trump does have to be careful. The women's vote is sensitive. Tonality matters to women. The tone does matter. I don't think the horse-faced thing was smart. I have to say that wasn't my cup of tea."

It was unnecessary.  That said, we need to get away from talking about gender and skin color and who is more oppressed and who is the bigger victim. We need to talk about ideas. And we don't need to go back to 9/11, Laura. What we need to do is go back to what MLK said, which is we need to be about the content of our character and not the color of our skin. That is the America people want back again. And I think that they are voting that way, and they are responding to that because they are tired. They're just exhausted from identity politics."

Victor Davis Hanson is here to explain exactly why that is, plus his reaction to the suggestions that President Trump is somehow to blame of the Saudi journalist being killed. Stay there."

The approaching caravan has put the focus back on immigration, an issue the Democrats have completely ceded to the president as far as I can tell. And the Kavanaugh battle revealed the left's shameless tactics.  And the calls, of course, for incivility from Eric Holder, Cory Booker, Hillary Clinton, they show they care more about promoting anger than solving problems. Kick them when they are down. Joining is now to discuss, Victor Davis Hanson, senior at the Hoover Institution. Victor, it is great to have you with us. What do you make of the recent political calculations we have seen from the Democrats, many of them of course with 2020 ambitions?"

      "utterance": "It is almost like they're wolves I wolves' clothing. I thought that they would at least try to disguise their empathies and politics before the midterm. But your past segment about white this and white this and white supremacy and white women, this is a time after the 2016 lessons that you should be appealing to the white working class if you want to win those states and yet they're not doing that. We saw during the Kavanaugh hearings, why not protect American jurisprudence. We all support due process. But when we get done with that circus it was as if the Democrats wanted to be on the side of the French Revolution. And then when we had all these demonstrations, Antifa and scratching like maenads on the Supreme Court doors, you would think that somebody in the party would speak up against that. But instead if you collate what Cory Booker said or what Eric Holder said or even Hillary Clinton, it was almost as if these people were seen as the paramilitary wing of the Democratic Party. And then the height of silliness, why now would Elizabeth Warren come out when you have this high profile trial, suit by Asian-Americans against Harvard in the same city, and then proclaim that she is one percent, maybe, one percent at best and therefore all along really was a genuine minority.  She should have apologized. And then it is all topped off by this caravan, and what are the Democrats going to do? Are they going to say let them in because they have a right for refugee appeals or something? Anybody knows in their right mind that you can't have a nation when people storm across the southern border by intent and they are empowered by the Mexican government. So all of these issues --"

He knows it's a problem. He wants to fix it. He is very frustrated with Congress, as he should be. But I also want to talk about foreign policy, Victor. That is really your forte in many ways. This Khashoggi murder at the consulate in Turkey, the Saudi consulate, there are actually liberals blaming this on, somehow on the chaotic foreign policy of President Trump. And he addressed these general issues tonight with Trish Regan. Let's watch."

But Turkey and Saudi Arabia are looking at it very strongly.  And it depends whether or not the king or the crown prince knew about it, in my opinion. Number one, what happened, but whether or not they knew about it. If they knew about it, that would be bad."

      "utterance": "Yes. To paraphrase Winston Churchill about the Soviet Union, it's a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a mystery. When you go into an embassy you expect that to be a sanctuary, and we are living in 2018, not the medieval period where you draw and quarter bodies. So that is stunning and shocking. But on the other hand, and also Mr. Khashoggi was a U.S. resident, he went to university in the United States, he wrote op-eds, so there was a lot of drama to this. But on the other hand, a lot of our shock has been that -- we are not shocked by what Saudi Arabia does. That is embedded with our relationship with Saudi Arabia. That said, what we're worried about in geostrategic terms is we've had an alignment now with the Gulf monarchies, the moderate Arab states, Israel, believe it or not, to confront the existential treat of a nuclear Iran and its terrorist appendages like Hezbollah or Hamas or people in Syria. So we don't want to jeopardize that new alignment. And yet we don't want to condone it, and I think Trump is trying to square that circle. It is very difficult to do."

Richard Haas was like, at some point an amoral foreign policy becomes an immoral foreign policy. U.S. foreign policy under Trump has reached such a point -- we won't even bother with that. But the Council on Foreign Relations is not exactly I think speaking for most Americans. Thank you so much, Victor, we really appreciate it. And coming up, we have a new series for you just ahead, hidden scandals revealing with the networks will not tell you about certain candidates.  Our expose in part of Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, next."

      "utterance": "Now to a new segment ahead of the midterms, Hidden Scandals, what the media are not telling you about certain candidates. With the midterm elections just three weeks away the media are picking teams. And one of their favorite players this cycle is Beto O'Rourke, the Democrat darling challenging Senator Ted Cruz for his Senate seat in Texas.  Outlets have published glowing profile after profile, fawning all over the new lone star star leftist before he even won a primary. On February 19th The New York Times affectionately dubbed Beto the lone star longshot. TIME magazine in May said Beto O'Rourke is on a long, hard road. But they described O'Rourke as handsome and charismatic. This past August, Esquire wrote \"Meet the Man Democrats Hope is the Next Obama.\" Going on to ask, \"Is this the man who could save the world from Trump?\" And finally Vanity Fair went to the place that sends a shiver up any Democrats leg, calling him Kennedy-esque. As it turns out, Beto, whose name is Robert Francis, is more Kennedy-esque than we thought. What those features failed to fully examine is O'Rourke's 1998 DWI, the details of which were much worse than previously reported.  Now, the news, details that were finally revealed in a August 31st \"Houston Chronicle\" piece. Beto had this to say when confronted about the incident during a debate."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But Beto's answer here directly contradicts the police report obtained by the \"Houston Chronicle.\" In it a witness reports that O'Rourke was driving drunk at a high rate of speed, then lost control and hit a truck, sending his car careening across the center median into oncoming lanes. The witness, who stopped at the scene, later told police that O'Rourke had tried to drive away from the accident. The media's incessant puff pieces on Beto O'Rourke have scarcely mentioned a 20-year-old DWI, downplaying the incident if they even mentioned it at all. What is more, the press, which prides itself on accountability, has shown little interest in calling out the lie. All right, we'll be right back. Last bite is coming up."
