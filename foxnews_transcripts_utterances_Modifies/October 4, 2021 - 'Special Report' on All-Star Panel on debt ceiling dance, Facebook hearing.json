You explained on the Senate floor that your no votes did not mean you wanted the majority to let the country default, but, rather, that the president's party had to take responsibility for a policy agenda which you opposed. Your view then is our view now.\" With that, let's bring this our panel, FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch.\" Brit, we go through this dance every so often, this debt ceiling increase.

It is about past spending. Raising the debt ceiling is not a cause of overspending. It is a result of it. But having said that, McConnell's point is entirely well taken and what he did in the votes -- in the positions that Biden himself took some time back is evidence of that. This will get done. The reason why Democrats would like very much to get some Republican help on this is because they don't want to have to use the reconciliation process to do it. If they did that, they could do it with 50 votes. They don't want to do that because you can only use reconciliation process more than a few times a year, and they don't want to burn one off for the debt limit. So they would like to preserve it for some of the future spending that they have. And boy, do they have future spending in mind.",

It's unacceptable for activist organizations to instruct their members to jeopardize themselves by engaging in unlawful activities, such as gaining entry to closed university buildings, disrupting learning environments, and filming students in a restroom. It's the duty of elected leaders to avoid fostering an environment which honestly held policy disagreements serve as the basis for vitriol, raising the temperature, and political rhetoric and creating a permission structure for unacceptable behavior.\" Steve? STEVE HAYES, EDITOR, \"THE DISPATCH\": Yes, well, I think Senator Sinema is exactly right about that. I was a little surprised by President Biden sort of shoulder shrug as a result of that. That's inappropriate behavior, as he said, but it doesn't happen to everybody, and it shouldn't happen to everybody. And you would think that the president would use his bully pulpit to make that clear and take down the temperature. The important and I think interesting turn that we saw over the weekend on the negotiations on these other two bills was when had you Ro Khanna, progressive representative from California, on FOX NEWS SUNDAY yesterday with Chris, say, in effect, that the White House isn't lobbying to get progressives on board with this infrastructure bill. He didn't go so far as to say the White House was actively blocking it, but he basically said, yes, they have told us we can hang tight. That's a pretty interesting moment when you have a White House not in support of its own bill, particularly when it goes against promises that have been made by the Speaker of the House and by White House, senior White House officials themselves.",

You will notice, by the way, that what is likely to come out of this is further restrictions on Facebook's content to avoid what's called extreme content. But Facebook is also the same organization that refuses to permit a lot of content that is not extreme, such as the news stories and comments by a president or former president of the United States. So I think Facebook is in a position where they are going to get it coming and going if they're not careful.

This was a place for people to get together. And then you have these documents showing that internally they had come to a different understanding. I think the same is true on misinformation and hate. Facebook has a robust fact checking program. \"The Dispatch\" is part of that fact checking program. We think we are doing good as a parted of that fact checking program.

You explained on the Senate floor that your no votes did not mean you wanted the majority to let the country default, but, rather, that the president's party had to take responsibility for a policy agenda which you opposed. Your view then is our view now.\" With that, let's bring this our panel, FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch.\" Brit, we go through this dance every so often, this debt ceiling increase. What about where we are now?"

      "utterance": "It has to be done. The debt ceiling has to be raised, and it will be raised, and the president is entirely right when he says that this is not about future spending. It is about past spending. Raising the debt ceiling is not a cause of overspending. It is a result of it. But having said that, McConnell's point is entirely well taken and what he did in the votes -- in the positions that Biden himself took some time back is evidence of that. This will get done. The reason why Democrats would like very much to get some Republican help on this is because they don't want to have to use the reconciliation process to do it. If they did that, they could do it with 50 votes. They don't want to do that because you can only use reconciliation process more than a few times a year, and they don't want to burn one off for the debt limit. So they would like to preserve it for some of the future spending that they have. And boy, do they have future spending in mind."

So they are talking amongst themselves about what they could cut or put a short time limit on or stretch out over more years so it could fit into a smaller package. So progressives got something they wanted, which is they managed to link the bipartisan infrastructure bill and big social safety net bill, the big reconciliation bill, and moderates got something they want, which is the big bill is going to become a smaller bill. But the details are really, really hard. And that's where Democrats are at right now, trying to figure out how to shrink that package."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And the president does, Steve. Senator Sinema released a statement saying \"Yesterday's behavior was not legitimate protest. It's unacceptable for activist organizations to instruct their members to jeopardize themselves by engaging in unlawful activities, such as gaining entry to closed university buildings, disrupting learning environments, and filming students in a restroom. It's the duty of elected leaders to avoid fostering an environment which honestly held policy disagreements serve as the basis for vitriol, raising the temperature, and political rhetoric and creating a permission structure for unacceptable behavior.\" Steve? STEVE HAYES, EDITOR, \"THE DISPATCH\": Yes, well, I think Senator Sinema is exactly right about that. I was a little surprised by President Biden sort of shoulder shrug as a result of that. That's inappropriate behavior, as he said, but it doesn't happen to everybody, and it shouldn't happen to everybody. And you would think that the president would use his bully pulpit to make that clear and take down the temperature. The important and I think interesting turn that we saw over the weekend on the negotiations on these other two bills was when had you Ro Khanna, progressive representative from California, on FOX NEWS SUNDAY yesterday with Chris, say, in effect, that the White House isn't lobbying to get progressives on board with this infrastructure bill. He didn't go so far as to say the White House was actively blocking it, but he basically said, yes, they have told us we can hang tight. That's a pretty interesting moment when you have a White House not in support of its own bill, particularly when it goes against promises that have been made by the Speaker of the House and by White House, senior White House officials themselves."

Couldn't get approval to even turn on the electricity."

And the Democrats at one time, many of them had been in favor of a border wall. But it is taboo on the American left which is where this administration's heartbeat seems to be these days. I think it's been a colossal mistake. It has led to the messes that we see down on the border now. It has led to these extraordinary pictures which we have had on the air night after night after night of that situation down there. I think it was the substantive policy blunder, and it will turn out to be a political policy blunder."

And there's still a debate with about whether or not that would have stopped the current influx of immigrants at the border or not. This administration is struggling to get ahold of this situation, but I think it would be hard to believe that they would all of a sudden embrace the wall as a solution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "I think that's right. I think it's about resources and priorities. The administration hasn't made this a top shelf priority from the beginning, I think in part because of the way that they campaigned, as Mara pointed out. That's the challenge. They can say we are telling people not to come, we are telling people not to come. But when look at actions taken collectively, it sure sends a different signal, and we know that the smuggles are using that to bring people north."

Facebook, by the way, says they are back up and running. They were down for about six hours today, as was Instagram and WhatsApp, which a long time. They haven't said why. We are back with the panel. Mara, what about this? She is going to testify tomorrow in the Senate subcommittee about protecting our kids online. There seems to be a lot of momentum going this way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "A lot of momentum towards regulating Facebook, regulating social media in some way. What she said is what people have been saying for a long time, although she backed it up with all these documents, which is that the business model, the algorithm of Facebook is to keep you online as long as possible so they can sell more ads. And keeping -- and the best thing to keep you online is extreme content. And that's pretty much the business model of social media. And that Facebook knew that it was damaging and dangerous but when, as she puts it, whether they came to a choice between the safety of the public and making money, they chose making money. I just think that this feeds into this bipartisan consensus that Facebook has to be regulated."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Yes, I agree with that, Bret. I think Mara is right. Facebook is accused now of doing these things and allowing abusive content to flourish because it wanted to maximize profits. I have no objection to maximizing profits. To the contrary. But when you are as big and powerful and utterly dominant in the space you occupy as Facebook is, you have to be careful how do you that or else you're going to get legislated and you're going to get regulated in a way you may not like. You will notice, by the way, that what is likely to come out of this is further restrictions on Facebook's content to avoid what's called extreme content. But Facebook is also the same organization that refuses to permit a lot of content that is not extreme, such as the news stories and comments by a president or former president of the United States. So I think Facebook is in a position where they are going to get it coming and going if they're not careful. And it's not all clear to me that whatever new regulations emerge from this will be regulations we will all be happy with, either."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right, and restricting some stories, the Hunter Biden story, for example, at the beginning, and others. Steve, taking the other point of view, for the people who say we have these companies that are tremendously successful in the U.S., is it dangerous for us to be going after the goose that lays the golden egg?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "Right. I think that's a pretty strong argument in many contexts, including in this one to a certain extent. The problem Facebook faces right now is both what they were doing as mara and Brit suggests, but also what they were saying they were doing. And if you look back at what Facebook was making public, they were telling a certain story about Facebook as a good place, or Facebook and Instagram as a good place for young people. This was a place for people to get together. And then you have these documents showing that internally they had come to a different understanding. I think the same is true on misinformation and hate. Facebook has a robust fact checking program. \"The Dispatch\" is part of that fact checking program. We think we are doing good as a parted of that fact checking program. But if it is the case that Facebook is preferring or tweaking an algorithm to allow hateful content and misinformation content to go viral at the same time, it's going to overwhelm the efforts of people who are trying to do a good job to correct that."
