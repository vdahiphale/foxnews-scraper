OK, well, they could have just sued and gone to court and had a judge compel testimony, and they wouldn't have to sit back and complain. But now they are complaining anyway. So now they only want witnesses for the prosecution. They don't want the defense to have any witnesses. That's how fair they are being. So Nadler says he's not going to negotiate witnesses at all. So you have a Republican saying, all right, Nadler. We'll give you Bolton. We'll give you Pence. We'll give you whoever you want. Just give us Hunter.  And, you know what? Nadler says that's off the table. So think about how far they are willing to go to protect Hunter Biden. Why does Hunter Biden need so much protection? It's because this whole situation that he's involved in is a complete disaster. They are saying he's not a relevant witness? Well, the Supreme Court has granted wide latitude for defense counsel to call whoever they want.   To set out whatever fact case they can, to set up a strong and robust defense to protect their Constitutional rights. It doesn't matter what Nadler says is relevant or not. It's whether the Supreme Court says it is, and it is. So Hunter Biden is a material witness to the defense. The Ukrainians have said publicly the only reason Hunter was given this plum gig is to protect Burisma from prosecution. And he was successful. So the guy just got kicked out of the Navy for drugs and now he gets some plum position overseas that he has no knowledge of. It's absolutely crazy. It's not an abuse of power to investigate corruption, especially when it involves a corrupt country who colluded against you when millions of dollars were on the line. Could you imagine if Trump Jr. got appointed to some plum gig in a Chinese company? And the Democrats said you know what, let's look into it, and Trump said no, no. I am running for president.

So I think it is possible that after 24 -- 48 hours and you don't have to use the whole 24 hours per side.   That at that point, maybe they will decide that they've heard enough.

This is an actual trial. And it's not a criminal court of law trial that we are used to maybe when we watch TV. But this is an actual trial and it can lead to a conviction in the Senate. And I think it's important to highlight just for viewers, too, because we're beginning tomorrow on what the arguments are the president's team is arguing. They are arguing both procedural and substantive.  They are saying that there was no crime alleged, and that the Constitution in its plain language meaning without everyone extrapolating, just what it says, plain and fair. It needs to be a crime alleged, and also that it has to be a high crime. And it's not -- you have to have both together. And then they are also -- that was by the way successful in prior impeachment testimony. And I know I'm not necessarily saying anything mind-blowing that people don't already know. But I think it's important to package this in a way that viewers understand going into tomorrow, because there is about be a lot of hours of drivel where everyone is captivated by news covering this, because it's important.

You actually have conservative principles being discussed on more -- on a mass communication scale. So now you actually have people talking about all the things that Greg was talking about that you can measure and all those things, whether they work or not. But you actually -- this is no longer just the back pages of National Review. This is now -- everybody's talking about it at dinner, on social media, etcetera. The Democrats have always had culture and liberals have had culture. But they -- now are not able to marry that to politics. So I think that's why there is a split. They can't get a foothold where President Trump was able to bring those worlds together. Yeah, he saw an opportunity.

A GoFundMe page was set up to help support the manager, Tori, and it has raised about $30,000. Well, let's just start with the law, Emily.

OK, well, they could have just sued and gone to court and had a judge compel testimony, and they wouldn't have to sit back and complain. But now they are complaining anyway. So now they only want witnesses for the prosecution. They don't want the defense to have any witnesses. That's how fair they are being. So Nadler says he's not going to negotiate witnesses at all. So you have a Republican saying, all right, Nadler. We'll give you Bolton. We'll give you Pence. We'll give you whoever you want. Just give us Hunter. And, you know what? Nadler says that's off the table. So think about how far they are willing to go to protect Hunter Biden. Why does Hunter Biden need so much protection? It's because this whole situation that he's involved in is a complete disaster. They are saying he's not a relevant witness? Well, the Supreme Court has granted wide latitude for defense counsel to call whoever they want. To set out whatever fact case they can, to set up a strong and robust defense to protect their Constitutional rights. It doesn't matter what Nadler says is relevant or not. It's whether the Supreme Court says it is, and it is. So Hunter Biden is a material witness to the defense. The Ukrainians have said publicly the only reason Hunter was given this plum gig is to protect Burisma from prosecution. And he was successful. So the guy just got kicked out of the Navy for drugs and now he gets some plum position overseas that he has no knowledge of. It's absolutely crazy. It's not an abuse of power to investigate corruption, especially when it involves a corrupt country who colluded against you when millions of dollars were on the line. Could you imagine if Trump Jr. got appointed to some plum gig in a Chinese company? And the Democrats said you know what, let's look into it, and Trump said no, no. I am running for president.

Bolton should be called. He has direct knowledge of the specific crime and charges against the president. Hunter Biden has no such knowledge. Joe Biden has no such knowledge.

The problem is there's no defense against being exploited. So what the Dems -- they're very smart. You can get objective news by creating this spectacle. And everybody has to put the camera on and pre-empt shows like THE FIVE because we got to show it, because it's big news. So when we are pre-empted by something called the news, remember it is only news because they are telling you it is news. The pomp and circumstance, the slow walk, the dramatic pauses, the language, it's all fakery. It's artifice to make you feel like it is news when it's not. So I have a suggestion to the reader, I mean the viewer at home who feels hopeless, all right? You can call your senator and you can tell them to get this crap over with as soon as possible because you want to watch \"The Five.\" I want you to get a pen. Get a pen right now, 202-224-3121. That is the main operator for the Senate and they will connect you to the specific Senate office that is your senator, and you can tell them get this thing over with because you're not going to miss an episode of \"The Five.\" It's just not fair.

Each side gets 24 hours to make their case. And it's only after that that then they will go to the issue of specific witnesses if there were to be any. So I think it is possible that after 24 -- 48 hours and you don't have to use the whole 24 hours per side. That at that point, maybe they will decide that they've heard enough. Is that being too hopeful that this gets over with quickly?"

      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",

Whether they feel that a witness' testimony is required to resolve the articles of impeachment. And I have to take issue with one thing that you said. This isn't an impeachment hearing. This is an actual trial. And it's not a criminal court of law trial that we are used to maybe when we watch TV. But this is an actual trial and it can lead to a conviction in the Senate. And I think it's important to highlight just for viewers, too, because we're beginning tomorrow on what the arguments are the president's team is arguing. They are arguing both procedural and substantive. They are saying that there was no crime alleged, and that the Constitution in its plain language meaning without everyone extrapolating, just what it says, plain and fair. It needs to be a crime alleged, and also that it has to be a high crime. And it's not -- you have to have both together. And then they are also -- that was by the way successful in prior impeachment testimony. And I know I'm not necessarily saying anything mind-blowing that people don't already know. But I think it's important to package this in a way that viewers understand going into tomorrow, because there is about be a lot of hours of drivel where everyone is captivated by news covering this, because it's important. They need to understand what they're talking about. And also, that there will be a defense substantively saying, and regardless, this is not an abuse of Congress and this is not impeachment worthy."

So I have been thinking about this a little bit, although we've talked about it. Maybe it's just finally solidified in my mind. So when President Trump brought pop culture into alignment with politics, now all of a sudden for the first time in quite a long time. You actually have conservative principles being discussed on more -- on a mass communication scale. So now you actually have people talking about all the things that Greg was talking about that you can measure and all those things, whether they work or not. But you actually -- this is no longer just the back pages of National Review. This is now -- everybody's talking about it at dinner, on social media, etcetera. The Democrats have always had culture and liberals have had culture. But they -- now are not able to marry that to politics. So I think that's why there is a split. They can't get a foothold where President Trump was able to bring those worlds together. Yeah, he saw an opportunity. And I don't think somebody who didn't have the presence that he did on -- in the media would've been able to actually do that.

The comment that we have 10 years to save the planet from capitalism, how is that not fear-mongering. How is that not totally un-relatable?

They endorsed a Democrat. Sorry, make that two Democrats. Yes, in case one gets a flat, we have got a spare. That's The Time's definition of breaking with convention, doubling down on the same old, same old. But that's how the media gatekeepers see the world that the only choices available to you come from a wide range of leftists. So do you go left, really left, or really, really left? You never go right because that would be evil. Here, they picked a traditional liberal and a leftist who makes Che Guevara look like Barry Goldwater. But it's really about Bernie.

I think it's a cop-out for them to have chosen to. And given the fact that I think back in the day when you just got one physical paper a day, it was a big deal to find out who they endorse, but now we know how everyone feels. There's no hiding any one of those individual journalists or the editorial board's feelings. We've been -- we're having it rammed down our throats every day all day in all forms of social media and their outlets.

The man claims that the law required the store to honor the price as advertised, but the store manager she refused. The public shaming, however, has backfired. A GoFundMe page was set up to help support the manager, Tori, and it has raised about $30,000. Well, let's just start with the law, Emily.

So clearly, this falls within the exemption. And I think the larger point here is that this guy is a jerk. He is waste of skin. He is not a journalist. He is a troll. He is the worst of humanity and the worst of Twitter. Not just this, after the multiple fatality shooting in Manchester arena with Ariana Grande, he immediately tweeted, I almost died the first time I listened to her music too.

And then when Anthony Bourdain called him out and called him a gaping, steaming A-hole, after he died by suicide, this guy put on Twitter looks like -- look who's the gaping steaming A-hole now and called him selfish for dying by suicide.

I don't think that the media coverage is going to subside just because they're moving to North America, whether they're in Canada or in L.A. because I think it'll just double because the British press will still be following them and the American and Canadian press will be following them too. I think that they could probably go off and do some pretty good work. I think that they'll probably get really into the climate change thing. But other than that, he had done a lot with veterans especially wounded warriors. And I imagine that as they settle in and try to figure out what they want to do, they'll figure it out. There's no public money, but apparently, Prince Charles will take care of things for a year."

Well, first of all, who gets all the sectors and the staffs and who gets the court jester, right, and the potions -- and the potions that they have -- they have potion specialist. Look, there are two reasons why I left -- and I figure this out because I lived in London. One is discomfort. If you don't grow up in England, you're not used to the cold, damp weirdness of it all. Everything is smaller and they think that old is posh. No old is old. So they go, let's go sit under a thatched roof and freeze our butts off because I go stay on a weekend like in a holiday in a thatched roof in the middle of the countryside. The food is terrible. The furniture is old and uncomfortable. You have to throw blankets on because there's always a draft. It's always cold, the toilet smell, there's always -- they have carpets in the bathroom so that soaks up all the stuff. OK, that's one reason, discomfort. The second reason is media. Prince Harry blames the media for leaving. So this is another facet of life, that media ruins. I mean, how many other facets do we need to experience that shows that every time you add media to it, it ruins it. You can't have nice things with the media. They ruined royalty. They ruin everything. I hate you, media."

Trump would have just destroyed the media and stayed longer in the Royal family and made it much more royal and more obnoxious. I think they've quit the Royal family but they get to keep all the money. And for people saying that they don't like what these people did, so many Americans would want to do the same thing."
