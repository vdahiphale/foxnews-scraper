Now, let's be clear, the Former Treasury Secretary wasn't trying to undercut the Biden team. He was trying to save them. He's a loyal Democrat. But the laugh the regime media, the adults in the Biden Administration, they didn't care. They just waved them off. They truly thought that they knew better. So they pursued reckless spending and grandiose plans to remake American capitalism. And now, they're facing in November wipeout.

Because he said, you know, even if the return to Investors isn't, you know, the greatest, we're not going to hurt the planet. So, it's kind of admitting that they're not living up to their fiduciary responsibility to the Investors correct? The shareholders? DAVID SOKOL, TETON CAPITAL CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER: Absolutely, absolutely. In fact, there was an article today in the Wall Street Journal, where CalPERS points out that for years, as they follow these ESG initiatives if you well, they've underperformed all of the other major pension funds in the country. They don't they didn't tell their pensioners that they were investing their money this way. And that and that perhaps it would be a bad idea.

Now several of his family members, as well as associates and businesses were also named in the action. And the allegation was that there were numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation in financial statements. Now, there are many reasons why this charade is an obvious act of political retribution. First, the timing. James is a political hack and dropping this just 48 days before the midterms just reeks. Further, she herself is locked in a closer race, then she's like in deep blue New York. She included the Trump kids which even Bill Barr no fan of Trump these days called a gross overstep. And finally, she campaigned on this."

She turns a blind eye to the daylight broad daylight corruption going on right now with Kathy Hochul, where the taxpayers are apparently subsidizing her reelection campaign. There's a cost of living crisis. Much of this has to do with the inefficiencies of the Attorney General's office and of many industries she oversees.

Because he said, you know, even if the return to Investors isn't, you know, the greatest, we're not going to hurt the planet. So, it's kind of admitting that they're not living up to their fiduciary responsibility to the Investors correct? The shareholders? DAVID SOKOL, TETON CAPITAL CHAIRMAN & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER: Absolutely, absolutely. In fact, there was an article today in the Wall Street Journal, where CalPERS points out that for years, as they follow these ESG initiatives if you well, they've underperformed all of the other major pension funds in the country. They don't they didn't tell their pensioners that they were investing their money this way. And that and that perhaps it would be a bad idea. You know, this whole thing, Laura is part of the breakdown of the institutions that make this country great. You know, this woke is virtue signaling ESG.

That's from an FBI agent coming to us under whistleblower protection giving us that information. So it's all part of this narrative to demonize half the country.

This is all generated from a myth. They believe that policing is systemically racist. They believe that police officers are racially biased towards black people. They are taking these examples of legitimate police uses of force and they're framing them as if police officers are doing things that are inappropriate all across the country every single day. With that lie, they are now coming up with policy that I believe is only going to destroy policing in America, just like they want it to."

      "utterance": "It's shocking that they are so brazenly admitting what they're going to do here, blaming police, not the criminals, et cetera. This is going to get worse, Brandon, because Democrat Mandela Barnes, who is running for Senate in Wisconsin against Ron Johnson, he's a leftist, he said this about police and crime back in 2020. Watch this."

      "utterance": "Laura, tell me you don't know nothing about police without telling me you know nothing about police. That guy has no idea. He has never done a ride along. He's never done anything. The purpose of policing is to be proactive. It's called proactive policing. When you conduct that traffic stop because you're out working, you catch the criminal, you catch the person before they rob a bank. You catch the person the first time they beat up their girlfriend so they don't go and kill her the next time. So it's a thing called proactive policing. If you have enough police on the force, you're supporting them, you're backing them, the morale is high, they dominate in the industry of stopping people from committing crimes. So these people know nothing of what they're talking about but they're pushing legislation, which is a shame, and our country deserves better."
