And now the Department of Homeland Security says Americans might see heightened security in and around public places and events all across the country, including for tonight's \"Monday Night Football\" game. We will get to that in a second.  Here's what we know right now, a source telling FOX that Stephen Paddock may have brought more than 30 weapons, including fully automatic AR-15 assault rifle high-capacity magazines, and that he simply used one right after the other. The gunman's brother quoted as saying that Paddock frequently played high- stakes video poker. We're also learning that his father was a bank robber once on the FBI's most wanted list.  Two hospitals are playing a major role in treating victims, 160 going to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center. Another 104 being treated at University Medical Center's trauma unit.   Meanwhile, at the White House, a moment of silence for the victims of the attack. The president plans to travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with victims and first-responders. That, of course, a day after he plans to be in Puerto Rico. Trace Gallagher in Las Vegas on the things we're learning, or trying to, about the guy who did all this, the shooter -- Trace.",

But this is not the crime of a man who snapped. It was methodically plotted. It was meticulously conducted. You think about this, Neil, and you look at the windows behind me at the Mandalay Bay. He had to choose this room. Right? He chose the room or two rooms, because he knew, with these windows, he could point the weapon down and get the most damage, the most destruction and death. Also, over the past four days, you now have authorities going back, looking at surveillance video, seeing if they can figure out how exactly Stephen Paddock snuck at least 10 weapons inside the Mandalay Bay. That could take days and days to kind of process various video.  They chose the room for a reason, to inflict again the most danger shot down on the crowd from different angles. Experts say clearly an automatic weapon. They're not legal. That takes some doing to get.   There's no link to terrorism. But, remember, Stephen Paddock's dad, as you said, Neil, was a bank robber. He had never had anything more than a traffic ticket. Listen to authorities.",

There's a 45-degree angle. So, we're learning now this might be a two-bedroom suite. But he actually knew, he actually laid this out so he can shoot on platforms out of each window to go down on the crowd. The crowd was about maybe 200 yards in front of him.   We are about 300 yards behind the actual stage. And you see, when the shooting happened, Neil, there was a stampede. People coming out. They lost handbags, they lost shoes. They pushed through fences and gates. They pushed so far to the east, they actually went on to the fences, broke through the fences of McCarran International Airport and got into the airport property just looking for anyplace at all that they could shelter and be safe. This building behind me over here, we can't show you, Neil, but there's a broken window.

He planned this very meticulously, with his field of fire, with the distance that he had between he and his perch and where his field of fire was. He was able to concentrate that fire into a relatively small area that was concentrated with people. When you think of soft target, this is the soft target. Now, the law enforcement did an outstanding job in identifying where he was and in quickly moving in and creating the breach, which when they went to blow the door off the hinges is when the suspect took the coward's way out and killed himself, rather than face these law enforcement officers, who, by the way, lost a brother today.",

You're going to overuse and damage a weapon, so it's not shootable at a certain point. That point will come quickly if you're shooting on automatic fire.  It could have been he was letting weapons cool while he was firing other weapons. There are magazines made now for some assault-style weapons that will have 100 rounds in it. It sounded like he shooting maybe 30-round magazines.  But you can do a heck of a lot of damage. And it's made worse if he was shooting not so much as a sniper would, because, as Randy said, this is just a mass of lead raining down on a group. This isn't individual shots. It's very hard to control a weapon, even a controllable weapon, on fully automatic fire. This is just raining lead down on an innocent population. And each piece of lead, if it doesn't hit a person immediately, it will hit the ground and fragment, and multiple people may be hit by those fragments.

That's one of the things that a lot of people noticed right away, because there were certain parts of this hotel that wouldn't have a straight unobstructed shot down into the crowd. And this room he had since last Thursday clearly did. And it has a lot of people here believing, at least in the investigative side, that that room was planned some time ahead. But we have some exclusive video we're going to show you. I'm going to first show you the video -- or the actual look from this ankle. If you go up, you can see the two windows blown out. From what we now know and are told, it's a two-room bedroom suite. We have some exclusive video. This comes from Dr. Jason Huffman (ph). He's an orthopedic surgeon in Pennsylvania. And Dr. Huffman and I have become friends online. And he sent me some video. He was actually in that exact same suite one year ago for the exact same concert. He didn't realize it. One of his friends called him and said, hey, look at that video again. It's room 32135, 32135 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. And if you see, you can get the idea of how open that view is. You see the video as he walks in. And it's basically a bank of windows that curls around from two different angles, one facing directly east and one facing to the northeast, allowing a shooter in this case to have two distinctly views down on to the people below, the 22,000 people that were below.  You can see that suite, two-room bedroom suite provided that opportunity, unfortunately, for last night's -- or this -- last night's carnage. Back here live, Neil. Also had a chance to talk with some law enforcement who are telling us about what is going on inside. There's still bodies inside there. They said 12 hours they would be there when the Sheriff gave his press conference, I think two press conferences ago now. He has given us a number this morning. So that by my watch would be roughly about 10:00 tonight, if it sticks to that time frame. But there's still bodies inside there. There's still an extensive investigative process going on. One of the military folks that I know that was here still speculating as well that those shots, when you hear those, those don't come generally from a normal clip, meaning that, if that's the case, these guns, how were they obtained and how were those clips obtained? A lot of questions here unanswered, Neil, as this begins to move forward. Of course, a lot of families unfortunately still finding out the horrific news that they lost a loved one, as, again, the bodies of some of the victims are still inside. And I will leave you with this. We met a lot of people, a lot of regular people, Neil, over the course of the last 13, 14, 15 hours who dealt with and saw a lot of things. But not only did the first-responders who were inside here as fans, not here working, ended up saving a lot of lives, but people that had never done anything like that in their life saved a lot of lives.  We met people who took T-shirts and stuffed them into wounds. We met people that did whatever they could, put bodies in cars to drive them away from here. And, unfortunately, some people even carried people that were alive at the time down the street, hoping to get to some emergency personnel, and the person would later pass away, and they would have to leave them there on a table that was being used to sell stuff at this festival. So, it has been quite a time here in Las Vegas. And the healing process is going to begin here, it's going to be long, it's going to be long difficult, Neil. And at the same time, the investigative process continues with so many questions -- back to you in New York.",

And we were just standing there. And we were a little bit closer to the west side of the venue facing the stage, which would be closer to the Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas Boulevard area.  And like everybody, we heard those first few pops. And we're thinking, that is very odd. You kind of look around. Is that fireworks? Is there one of the helicopters that was going around? And then the concert kind of had like a little break in the music somewhat. And then when the next round of the pops started, that's when we looked at the stage and we saw Aldean and all the band members just disperse, scatter, hit the ground, run for cover. And that was all we needed to know. We grabbed each other and we just ran. And we ran. I could tell where the -- where it was coming from, what direction. And I could kind of tell it was elevated. So, that was the first thing that went in my mind, is somebody is coming from Mandalay Bay shooting this direction. So what we did is, we circled back around one of the concession stands, bar area sort of thing too. And we just took cover. And at that time, we were able to kind of look and see and kind of face Mandalay Bay. And about halfway up Mandalay Bay, on the glass stuff, you could see some flashing. Like, looked like cameras flashing or something like that. And so we just stayed down until that round finished. And then, you know, we ran for another cover to exit on the east side of the venue. And we just kept continuing, continuing to run. And we took shelter around a water truck with about 20, 25 other individuals. There was an off-duty police officer that was helping direct people. So, we all huddled up and just stood behind it and let the next -- after the burst of shots ended, then there was another one and another one. It was several hundred rounds that were going off.",

It's almost impossible to defend against, and especially for someone who has never been shot at before and not used to hearing those supersonic or hypersonic cracks going through the air, and thinking there's two gunmen. The position he was in allowed a sound echoing or a sound dispersion that allowed it to sound like two shooters. And people are not necessarily able to comprehend what is going on at that moment.

And now the Department of Homeland Security says Americans might see heightened security in and around public places and events all across the country, including for tonight's \"Monday Night Football\" game. We will get to that in a second. Here's what we know right now, a source telling FOX that Stephen Paddock may have brought more than 30 weapons, including fully automatic AR-15 assault rifle high-capacity magazines, and that he simply used one right after the other. The gunman's brother quoted as saying that Paddock frequently played high- stakes video poker. We're also learning that his father was a bank robber once on the FBI's most wanted list. Two hospitals are playing a major role in treating victims, 160 going to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center. Another 104 being treated at University Medical Center's trauma unit. Meanwhile, at the White House, a moment of silence for the victims of the attack. The president plans to travel to Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with victims and first-responders. That, of course, a day after he plans to be in Puerto Rico. Trace Gallagher in Las Vegas on the things we're learning, or trying to, about the guy who did all this, the shooter -- Trace."

But this is not the crime of a man who snapped. It was methodically plotted. It was meticulously conducted. You think about this, Neil, and you look at the windows behind me at the Mandalay Bay. He had to choose this room. Right? He chose the room or two rooms, because he knew, with these windows, he could point the weapon down and get the most damage, the most destruction and death. Also, over the past four days, you now have authorities going back, looking at surveillance video, seeing if they can figure out how exactly Stephen Paddock snuck at least 10 weapons inside the Mandalay Bay. That could take days and days to kind of process various video. They chose the room for a reason, to inflict again the most danger shot down on the crowd from different angles. Experts say clearly an automatic weapon. They're not legal. That takes some doing to get. There's no link to terrorism. But, remember, Stephen Paddock's dad, as you said, Neil, was a bank robber. He had never had anything more than a traffic ticket. Listen to authorities."

We should note, finally, Neil, that the woman who we have been hearing all day long about, her name is Marilou Danley. She's 62 years old. The reason we're hearing about her is because her debit card was actually found inside the Mandalay Bay. She's either in a relationship with Stephen Paddock or she is his roommate.

So, we're learning now this might be a two-bedroom suite. But he actually knew, he actually laid this out so he can shoot on platforms out of each window to go down on the crowd. The crowd was about maybe 200 yards in front of him. We are about 300 yards behind the actual stage. And you see, when the shooting happened, Neil, there was a stampede. People coming out. They lost handbags, they lost shoes. They pushed through fences and gates. They pushed so far to the east, they actually went on to the fences, broke through the fences of McCarran International Airport and got into the airport property just looking for anyplace at all that they could shelter and be safe. This building behind me over here, we can't show you, Neil, but there's a broken window. People actually busted windows to get inside, because they believed they were safer busting glass to get inside a building than they were out here on the outside with the gunfire in the background -- Neil."

He wasn't even -- he wasn't even brave enough to face law enforcement after killing all of those innocent people.

What changed so dramatically for someone who was presumably living a normal under the-radar life, as has been depicted so far, to someone driven to this sort of madness? Did something change two days ago? Did it change a week ago? Is this a relationship issue? Is it a failing relationship based on finances that are not going to sustain him because of a gambling habit? What are the drivers in his life?

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUTTON",
      "utterance": "Right. Exactly. The estimate is somewhere around 20 minutes. And during that 20 minutes, he literally rained down the fires of hell on these unsuspecting, innocent people who were doing nothing more threatening than watching a concert. He planned this very meticulously, with his field of fire, with the distance that he had between he and his perch and where his field of fire was. He was able to concentrate that fire into a relatively small area that was concentrated with people. When you think of soft target, this is the soft target. Now, the law enforcement did an outstanding job in identifying where he was and in quickly moving in and creating the breach, which when they went to blow the door off the hinges is when the suspect took the coward's way out and killed himself, rather than face these law enforcement officers, who, by the way, lost a brother today."

And so, if they would run one way, he would chase them down another way. What are we to make of all that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOSKO",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, it could be as simple as him letting a weapon cool off, because these weapons will heat up. Think in terms of him shooting a 30-round magazine every 10 seconds. You're going to overuse and damage a weapon, so it's not shootable at a certain point. That point will come quickly if you're shooting on automatic fire. It could have been he was letting weapons cool while he was firing other weapons. There are magazines made now for some assault-style weapons that will have 100 rounds in it. It sounded like he shooting maybe 30-round magazines. But you can do a heck of a lot of damage. And it's made worse if he was shooting not so much as a sniper would, because, as Randy said, this is just a mass of lead raining down on a group. This isn't individual shots. It's very hard to control a weapon, even a controllable weapon, on fully automatic fire. This is just raining lead down on an innocent population. And each piece of lead, if it doesn't hit a person immediately, it will hit the ground and fragment, and multiple people may be hit by those fragments. So it would be my expectation a lot of these people weren't hit directly, but they were hit by fragments."

And when the ammunition was gone on one, he simply picked up the other one. We don't know. This much, we know. A lot of people are dead. A lot of people are injured.

      "utterance": "Yes, Neil. That's one of the things that a lot of people noticed right away, because there were certain parts of this hotel that wouldn't have a straight unobstructed shot down into the crowd. And this room he had since last Thursday clearly did. And it has a lot of people here believing, at least in the investigative side, that that room was planned some time ahead. But we have some exclusive video we're going to show you. I'm going to first show you the video -- or the actual look from this ankle. If you go up, you can see the two windows blown out. From what we now know and are told, it's a two-room bedroom suite. We have some exclusive video. This comes from Dr. Jason Huffman (ph). He's an orthopedic surgeon in Pennsylvania. And Dr. Huffman and I have become friends online. And he sent me some video. He was actually in that exact same suite one year ago for the exact same concert. He didn't realize it. One of his friends called him and said, hey, look at that video again. It's room 32135, 32135 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. And if you see, you can get the idea of how open that view is. You see the video as he walks in. And it's basically a bank of windows that curls around from two different angles, one facing directly east and one facing to the northeast, allowing a shooter in this case to have two distinctly views down on to the people below, the 22,000 people that were below. You can see that suite, two-room bedroom suite provided that opportunity, unfortunately, for last night's -- or this -- last night's carnage. Back here live, Neil. Also had a chance to talk with some law enforcement who are telling us about what is going on inside. There's still bodies inside there. They said 12 hours they would be there when the Sheriff gave his press conference, I think two press conferences ago now. He has given us a number this morning. So that by my watch would be roughly about 10:00 tonight, if it sticks to that time frame. But there's still bodies inside there. There's still an extensive investigative process going on. One of the military folks that I know that was here still speculating as well that those shots, when you hear those, those don't come generally from a normal clip, meaning that, if that's the case, these guns, how were they obtained and how were those clips obtained? A lot of questions here unanswered, Neil, as this begins to move forward. Of course, a lot of families unfortunately still finding out the horrific news that they lost a loved one, as, again, the bodies of some of the victims are still inside. And I will leave you with this. We met a lot of people, a lot of regular people, Neil, over the course of the last 13, 14, 15 hours who dealt with and saw a lot of things. But not only did the first-responders who were inside here as fans, not here working, ended up saving a lot of lives, but people that had never done anything like that in their life saved a lot of lives. We met people who took T-shirts and stuffed them into wounds. We met people that did whatever they could, put bodies in cars to drive them away from here. And, unfortunately, some people even carried people that were alive at the time down the street, hoping to get to some emergency personnel, and the person would later pass away, and they would have to leave them there on a table that was being used to sell stuff at this festival. So, it has been quite a time here in Las Vegas. And the healing process is going to begin here, it's going to be long, it's going to be long difficult, Neil. And at the same time, the investigative process continues with so many questions -- back to you in New York."

      "utterance": "We were, like I said, about 125 feet or so from the main stage. At the time of the concert, it was Aldean for the close-out. So, it was down to a single stage and a very large shoulder-to-shoulder sort of a crowd at the venue. And we were just in one of the open areas that had some of the fake grass and stuff. And we were just standing there. And we were a little bit closer to the west side of the venue facing the stage, which would be closer to the Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas Boulevard area. And like everybody, we heard those first few pops. And we're thinking, that is very odd. You kind of look around. Is that fireworks? Is there one of the helicopters that was going around? And then the concert kind of had like a little break in the music somewhat. And then when the next round of the pops started, that's when we looked at the stage and we saw Aldean and all the band members just disperse, scatter, hit the ground, run for cover. And that was all we needed to know. We grabbed each other and we just ran. And we ran. I could tell where the -- where it was coming from, what direction. And I could kind of tell it was elevated. So, that was the first thing that went in my mind, is somebody is coming from Mandalay Bay shooting this direction. So what we did is, we circled back around one of the concession stands, bar area sort of thing too. And we just took cover. And at that time, we were able to kind of look and see and kind of face Mandalay Bay. And about halfway up Mandalay Bay, on the glass stuff, you could see some flashing. Like, looked like cameras flashing or something like that. And so we just stayed down until that round finished. And then, you know, we ran for another cover to exit on the east side of the venue. And we just kept continuing, continuing to run. And we took shelter around a water truck with about 20, 25 other individuals. There was an off-duty police officer that was helping direct people. So, we all huddled up and just stood behind it and let the next -- after the burst of shots ended, then there was another one and another one. It was several hundred rounds that were going off."

      "utterance": "I would say, in total, it was probably 10 to 12 minutes. It started I think like 10:00, 10:07. I think -- I saw the report. I was trying to -- I had some other friends at the concert. We weren't directly next to them. But I knew that they were there. So, I was trying to also simultaneous call them to find out where they were at. But there was no cell phone signal that was connecting or going out. And so we got stuck at the -- next to that water truck for probably a good five minutes, give or take, at that one location just huddled behind it. And there was, you know, a burst of very quick rapid fire that lasted for, you know, 20 to 30 seconds. then there would be a 10-, 12-second break. Then the bursts would continue again. So, we just stayed. We thought we were protected where we were at. You know, we were huddled up behind it. We went as far east as we could get. That's what our thought was, is to get furthest away from the noise, which would be heading east. So, that's the direction we just ran to."

That was my first thought that was going on, that it was coming from above. And so that's why we went behind the concession stand quite quickly. And then you started seeing more and more people start to kind of fall to areas that would be somewhat, you know, out of the line. And then you saw a lot of the police officers, security guards and stuff that were all taking -- you know, doing the same thing now at that point, too."

So, we -- by the time we left the water truck area, and there was a pretty big pause in the fire at that time, and there was a -- some sort of a gate or fence that enough people had pushed it down. And there was a route that looked like it was going to have a blocked wall, that you could walk the perimeter of the wall and kind of protect yourself. So, we made our way going through a couple back little alleys sort of things to eventually Tropicana. And then we took Tropicana and we just hugged the airport divider wall with the razor wire. We just walked along that or jogged along that for the next mile or so until we got to Maryland Parkway. And that's when we were able to order a Lyft and get home."

I guess, Buck, that's what they're going to get into right now, what might have been the case here with Stephen Paddock and why did he what he did when he did.

So far, we don't know yet about the legality of all the firearms that he has. We're still trying to figure out exactly where he got them, how he got them. But if he went through the legal processes -- or, rather, if he modified legal firearms, so that he could have a more rapid rate of fire, that's not a trip wire that law enforcement would be able to use necessarily to prevent this."

Should it change?"

And seeing the way that people congregate there, and all of the different major venues or the large hotels, as well as the concert venues and other areas as we will get together, it's an impossible security situation when you have an individual like this who takes some precautions to not be detected, who is not somebody who is on law enforcement's radar beforehand, no criminal record. This is why it's a nightmare scenario. It's incredibly hard for law enforcement to be following all of the different possible plots like this, whether terrorists or in this case it seems like somebody who was a deranged lone gunman. It's very difficult to catch them all even when there's mistakes that are being made by the perpetrator would-be along the way. So, here, what are you going to do? You going to try and prevent people from carrying luggage into these hotels? Are you going to install metal detectors everywhere? Neil, I just don't think that we have seen anything so far."

There's a lot people that, Bob, you have heard, hey, maybe we need magnetometers in these places, maybe we need to screen people.

It's obviously a horrific mass shooting with a tremendous amount of casualties.

I know that's not, from a security standpoint, a satisfying answer at all, but sometimes a person is just going to be so dedicated and so heinous and evil, that they get through.

I tried to tease it as such, that some call this relief that it wasn't terror, even though, for those people involved, it certainly was, no matter who the culprit was, and that the cynical view is, we're sadly getting used to this sort of thing, even though something of this magnitude is not the usual thing.

As an $18 trillion economy like we have in the U.S., it won't back down to anyone frankly. And even if you look back -- I think about the terrible attacks on September 11. Yes, the market was closed for a number of days. But you know what is funny, is, the day the market opened on September 17, if actually you bought stocks that day after they had dropped in reaction to the events, you actually made money into the end of the year, because the economy will move forward, things will recover, and consumers will come back again."

And that's unfortunately the world we live in today. You can get in a car, and something bad can happen. You can get on a plane. You can be in your kitchen and slip and fall. The reality is, for those folks, your heart goes out to them. But what we found with the American traveler is, they're very resilient. And I think the demographic that goes to Las Vegas is a very resilient demographic as well. In speaking to some of the folks that send a lot of people to Vegas, right now, they're concentrating on basically responding to what is going on, responding to the customers on the ground. And they're not seeing a string of cancellations or anything like that at this point in time. So, I think you're going to see Vegas, they get right back into business as usual. And I think that you're going to find that places that are truly dangerous, people will stay away from them. And that's just smart. But, for the most part, it's just a one-off, to be frank."

Nick, thank you so much for coming. I was thinking of you and thinking of others who didn't necessarily fashion themselves or even the people who examine them as great marksmen, but it looks like Lee Harvey Oswald was, perched where he was, the Texas School Depository, and others who shot people from high points, like in Texas back in the 1960s.

Less than 24 hours ago, we were all focused on one particular thing, and it started to divide our nation. This is bringing us together, as sad as it is. But we need to start realizing who we are as a people. We're as one. Not one single person did not help anybody else during that entire situation. Let's focus on that. Secondly, you don't have to be a great marksman to achieve what he did. Of course not. He was using a tactic, what we use in the military, called depth-delayed fire. It's almost impossible to defend against, and especially for someone who has never been shot at before and not used to hearing those supersonic or hypersonic cracks going through the air, and thinking there's two gunmen. The position he was in allowed a sound echoing or a sound dispersion that allowed it to sound like two shooters. And people are not necessarily able to comprehend what is going on at that moment. But it was a coward move. It takes no tactic whatsoever. And bless those who lost their lives and the ones who helped save, and especially the SWAT team that breached the door. I know some really, really tough men that I like to look at in my life. And I don't look at myself as one of them, but I know some tough men who not go into that room on a breach with a known machine gunner inside there. So, hats off to those guys.

They made changes at some schools as a result of that shooting. They made changes at with presidents and how they get around and are sheltered in cities and avoiding open motorcades after that shooting. What do you think changes here or can? It doesn't strike me as realistic right now, Nick, to dramatically change what we do, if you have to start using magnetometers in hotels and casinos, if you have to start checking out guests for a longer time entering and leaving these places.

It's something that it's almost impossible to defend against. We live in a day and age right now where terror or anything can - - of that nature can happen anywhere at any time.

And, of course, it was an outdoor festival. And so to keep people and be able to make sure you can check their wristband that they, in fact, had bought a ticket, belonged there, and weren't some crazed individual, of course, we had a metro law enforcement very strong presence out there already."

But, Mayor, do you know or have you learned anything more about Stephen Paddock, and about why he did what he did, how he planned it, plotted it? He had arrived there last Thursday, saved, and organized this for maximum effect just last night. What do we know? Anything?"

And we're an entertainment capital. And we're just the greatest city of just relaxation, have a good time, be entertained, and yet be wise and be careful. And just to know that there are people out there that are so evil-minded. But we haven't got that. And the sheriff did assure us that they're continuing the investigation. They have gone to the killer's home to get all of the materials, to see if there's anything there. But all of our visitors come with bags. And I understand he had two roll bags, which most of us don't like to carry things anything. So he rolled in his bags."

Sarah Huckabee Sanders visibly emotional today as she took the podium in the Briefing Room, her voice cracking as she read off some of the acts of heroism that some folks who were at that concert last night carried out in order to protect other people. The president ordering, as you said, the flags to half-staff here at the White House. Also, earlier this afternoon, in the Rose Garden, he and the first lady, Melania Trump, coming out for a moment of silence. That was at about quarter to 3:00 in the afternoon. The president all during the day talking about condolences for the victims, consoling the victims, the survivors, friends and family of those who died, soothing an anxious nation, and really acting as the leader that a lot of people reached out to him to be. The president will be heading to Las Vegas on Wednesday to meet with the mayor, to meet with some families, to talk with folks there as well. Tomorrow, he's going to Puerto Rico. One of the people he's going to meet with, the mayor of San Juan. The president and the mayor traded some barbs back and forth of criticism over the last few days, Neil, so that will be an interesting meeting -- back to you."

It is a reminder, as I said at the outset, that, as horrific as this was, people will gladly stand on a line of better than five hours' long, Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, liberals. They are concerned about their fellow man and woman. They want to help. They will give blood. They are. That will do it. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.
