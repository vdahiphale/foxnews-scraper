The Democrats thinks the American people are stupid. Think about what happened during the Obama administration, we lost millions of jobs to China. We lost over $200,000 manufacturing jobs. It was a mess in terms of health care premiums, in terms of prescription drug prices. And now the president has come in and through deregulation and tax cuts has reversed a lot of that stuff. So the Democrats now want to introduce radical socialist schemes, they want to destroy private health care, they want to take your health care insurance away and give it to government bureaucrats.

There's a big lie out there that the Trump economy is not working for the middle class, and it's not true because the most wage growth acceleration has come from the bottom 50 percent of workers. It's blue collar wages that are rising faster than white collar wages. So if you think about it, Trump is actually shrinking income inequality more than Barack Obama did. The Democrats thinks the American people are stupid. Think about what happened during the Obama administration, we lost millions of jobs to China. We lost over $200,000 manufacturing jobs. It was a mess in terms of health care premiums, in terms of prescription drug prices. And now the president has come in and through deregulation and tax cuts has reversed a lot of that stuff. So the Democrats now want to introduce radical socialist schemes, they want to destroy private health care, they want to take your health care insurance away and give it to government bureaucrats. They want to give what? Guaranteed income? This stuff is crazy and it's gonna boil down to capitalism versus socialism. And with that framework it's gonna be a lay- up for the president."

They have it half right with the deregulation and the tax cut, and that's really what's driving a lot of these economic growth, you know, GDP is up, higher than the estimates, same with the unemployment numbers. But the progressive Democrats, the Democratic socialists have it all wrong because they want to increase spending. They also want to increase taxes and that will not only snuff this economic growth but it will hamstring generations of Americans and future wage earners, and that is not only politically impractical it's immoral. Like that is the wrong thing to do. So if we actually cut down the size of government, and the president is right about the deregulation, but really cut spending you will see phenomenon economic growth and that means people will have more money in their pockets, they can start businesses, they can hire workers, and they can do much more with their money like not send their kids to college if you don't want to."

The Dems can't run against an economic boom because they'll lose, it would be Dukakis 2.0. So they have to do -- they have to run using fear. And they've got the three fears. They've got environmental fear, social fear, and moral fear. Environmental fear would be climate change, which they've already kicking in. The social fear would racism, racial division, because they know that works for them. And then the moral fear would be that Trump's repugnant. This is all going to be really effective for their base, but it's going to hurt the country in two ways. One, it will create a lot of hysteria, and it will exaggerate racial division where there isn't any. So I think -- that's the only game they've got to play, especially when Hispanic unemployment is now at a record low, historic ever, 4.2 percent.

Info Wars host Alex Jones, and conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos. The company CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying the ban also extends to other platforms including Instagram. So, Emily, what strikes here is -- I think lots of people wonder is this in defiance of your first amendment rights, or is it the case that since Facebook is not the government, a private business, they have the right to stand up and say, hey, you know what, you've incited violence and whatever our standards are you violated them and you're gone."

And I think it's impossible to reconcile how all of a sudden they feel responsible for this content by right-wingers and, you know, one on the left, or whatever, and all of a sudden they're shutting it down when they have refused every step of the way to take responsibility for their platform that live streams gang rapes, and suicides, and terrorist recruitment and show up in court constantly as, oh, no, no, no, we're not responsible for the content and here's why, we have nothing novel. And all of a sudden they care about this? So I was one of the attorneys that has brought a negligence lawsuit against them, or a representative that is drafting questions for the congressional inquiry, I would ask how all of sudden they feel responsible for this content and not their content as a platform as whole."
