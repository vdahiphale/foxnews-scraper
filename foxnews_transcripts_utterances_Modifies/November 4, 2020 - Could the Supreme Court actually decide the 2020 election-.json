You are looking at a map of the United  States and the race to 270 electoral votes to decide who becomes our next  president of the United States.  Right now, Joe Biden, thanks to a pickup with Wisconsin, and now waiting to address the nation, he is within 22 points, 22 electoral votes of being the  next president. Now, that has changed things mightily right now, since declaring Wisconsin  for him. He picks up Michigan, he picks up Nevada, he picks up some   combinations therein, he's there. He's there at that 270. We're going to go into the possibilities, get a read on that. We're also going to be hearing from the former vice president, who is addressing a   crowd in Wilmington, Delaware. Not quite sure exactly what he is going to say. We do know that lawsuits are flying fast and furiously. We do know as well  that the markets, which have been all over the map right now, by day's   ended, had surrendered some of their heady gains, still impressive. We will get into why they surrendered those gains, but still why they're up triple  digits for three days running, even in the middle of all of this conclusion.  Let's first get a read for Jackie DeAngelis, taking a look at where this  race now stands and a couple of possibilities that could clinch it for one or the other.  Hey, Jackie.",

      "sentences": "Hey, good afternoon to you, Neil. Where we stand at this hour, even with Wisconsin being called for Joe  Biden, both candidates still have a path here. But I want to focus for one  second on Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes. You can see here President Trump is leading 52 percent to Biden's 46 percent.   However, there were three million mail-in ballots. One million of those still need to be counted. Look, the tally up here, only 85 percent of  everything has been counted so far. So, Pennsylvania could potentially  shift. The Biden camp is saying a lot of those mail-in ballots will probably favor the vice president, and Trump is still holding steady there. We may even see some legal challenges here. We're still waiting on more   word there.  But I want to go to those what-if scenarios that we were talking about, because so crucial here. Let's consider Alaska done for President Trump. In  the South here, in Georgia and North Carolina, he has a lead. So let's  assume for the moment that he holds on to those two states. What happens with Joe Biden? Well, he got Wisconsin. Let's say he gets  Michigan and, as you mentioned, let's say he gets Nevada. Boom, 270. There's his path right there.   But things could change. Let's take Nevada back, because, Bill Hemmer said,  it is very close to call still. And let's go ahead and say the president does get Pennsylvania. All of a sudden, the game changes, 274. I just want to go back to the Biden scenario for a moment, because it was   so interesting. Yesterday, his campaign put out this notion he doesn't need Ohio, he doesn't eat Pennsylvania, Texas, or Florida, and he still has a path. Indeed, I just showed it to you. '   But what's interesting about his path at this moment, and I suppose the  president's as well, they're both murky. Nobody has it outlined in a clear way just yet, Neil.",

They also want the voting -- vote count stopped in Pennsylvania to allow greater access to the vote counters, so that they can see if the ballots are in fact valid. That's the same sort of lawsuit that they have already  filed in Michigan. The Trump campaign is also predicting that, by Friday, President Trump will be able to claim victory in the Grand Canyon State of Arizona. The Trump campaign insists that there are some 605,000 ballots outstanding, most of those Election Day voters that typically support President Trump. They say that President Trump only needs to get 57.73 percent support among those ballots in order to overturn, because it's been declared now by FOX  News and the Associated Press, overturn the call in Arizona and pick up the win there and Arizona's 11 electoral votes. Now, if the president were to reverse Arizona, pick up Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that would give him 274 electoral votes, without Michigan or Minnesota -- Michigan or Wisconsin. And that would give him the win. So, it's not to say that any of this is going to happen, Neil, but the  Trump campaign very confident this afternoon on this conference call that that scenario will come to pass.

      "sentences": "Kamala and I are here to make a brief statement, and I'm sure we will have more to say later and either tonight or tomorrow. But let me begin by thanking the press for being here and thanking everyone else. My fellow Americans, yesterday once again proved democracy is the heartbeat of this nation, just as it has been the heartbeat of this nation for two centuries. And even in the face of a pandemic, more Americans voted this election than ever before in American history. Over 150 million people cast their votes. I think that's just extraordinary. And if we had any doubts, we shouldn't have any longer, about a government of, by and for the people. It's very much alive, very much alive in America. Here, the people rule. Power can't be taken or asserted. It flows from the people. And it's their will that determines who will be the president of the United States, and their will alone. And now, after a long night of counting, it's clear that we're winning enough states to reach 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. I'm not here to declare that we have won, but I am here to report, when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners. With all the votes counted, we have won Wisconsin by 20,000 votes, virtually the same margin that President Trump won that state four years ago. In Michigan, we lead by over 35,000 votes, and it's growing, a substantially bigger margin than President Trump won Michigan in 2016. Michigan will complete its vote soon, maybe as early as today. And I feel very good about Pennsylvania. Virtually all of the remaining ballots to be counted were cast by mail. And we have been winning 78 percent of the votes by mail in Pennsylvania. We have flipped Arizona and the 2nd District of Nebraska. Of special significance to me is that we won with the majority of the American people. And every indication is that that majority will grow. We have a popular vote lead of nearly three million votes, and every indication is that will grow as well. Indeed, Senator Harris and I are on track to win more votes than any ticket in the history of this country that ever won the presidency and vice presidency, over 70 million votes. I'm very proud of our campaign. Only three presidential campaigns in the past have defeated an incumbent president. When it's finished, God willing, we will be the fourth. This is major achievement. This is a major achievement. And it's been a long and difficult campaign. But it's been a more difficult time for our country, a hard time. We have had hard campaigns before. We have faced hard times before. So, once this election is finalized and behind us, it will be time for us to do what we have always done as Americans, to put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us, to lower the temperature, to see each other again, to listen to one another, to hear each other again and respect and care for one another, to unite, to heal, to come together as a nation. I know this won't be easy. I'm not naive. Neither of us are. I know how deep and hard the opposing views are in our country on so many things. But I also know this as well. To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies. What brings us together as Americans is so much stronger than anything that can tear us apart. So, let me be clear. I, we are campaigning as a Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. The presidency itself is not a partisan institution. It's the one office in this nation that represents everyone. And it demands a duty of care for all Americans. And that is precisely what I will do. I will work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as I will for those who did vote for me. Now every vote must be counted. No one is going to take our democracy away from us, not now, not ever. America has come too far, America's fought too many battles, America's endured too much to ever let that happen. We, the people, will not be silenced. We, the people, will not be bullied. We, the people, will not surrender. My friends, I'm confident we will emerge victorious. But this will not be my victory alone or our victory alone. It will be a victory for the American people, for our democracy, for America. And there will be no blue states and red states when we win, just the United States of America. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.",

I want to begin with you. The controversy today seems to be the Decision Desk's move to call Arizona for Joe Biden. The Trump folks are firmly convinced -- and I talked to former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who's also firmly convinced -- that, when all is said and done, Arizona is and should be in the Trump column.

Our estimates about the outstanding vote in Arizona, I think, are right on top of not only the Trump campaign's, but also most of the independent analysis that we have seen, including The Arizona Republic and some other political sources. Where there's a difference is that the Trump campaign, possibly based on information from their ground game operatives, believes that the late early vote, votes cast on Election Day, et cetera, are going to break 60 percent to 66 percent -- that is possibly 2-1 -- in favor of the president. Our best estimates from the FOX Voter News Analysis suggests that the distribution, most of which is going to come from Maricopa, is going to run more along the lines of the traditional vote, which is about 55 percent Biden, 44 percent for Trump. We saw no indication in the data that people who cast their mail-in ballots late in the game are going to be appreciably different than those who cast their votes throughout this process. In addition to the FOX News Voter Analysis system, we're also looking at data from previous election cycles, including the most recent of which was the 2018 Senate race, where you had McSally and Sinema. And as most people remember, as the later ballots trickled in, Sinema continued to gain ground. Now, we don't -- we're not comparing a midterm election to the presidential, but there was nothing that we saw the lead us to suggest -- to suggest or to base any analysis upon a 2-1 break for these late early voters.",

It's bigger than the margins that Donald Trump won by in 2016. And so, when you look at this, you look at the numbers and you look at the math, as was just described to us, it seems like the path for Donald Trump to go to victory is narrower and narrower and narrower. It's really, really almost impossible, I think, at this point, without something being overturned.

Nevada has let us know that they're not planning on releasing the data, which is essentially going to be processed Election Day mail-in votes -- so it's people who basically voted on Election Day by mail -- their argument in Nevada is that they need a day to do the signature check matches, to make sure that people didn't double-vote, showed up in person, and then voted by mail. So, we will cut them some slack, but they're not planning on releasing those data until tomorrow. So, I don't know that we're going to get clarity. I do think we could hear from North Carolina, where they have sort of stopped processing ballots, and Trump has a fairly significant lead there. Georgia is going to give us another tranche of data, which may give us some clarity there. Our models show Georgia trending towards a very, very close race. And so I think, as we add data there, coming from Atlanta and some of this collar counties, I don't know that we're going to get more clarity. I think we might get less clarity. But you're right.

And that would be a very different feeling than we have today, where there's accusations of voter fraud, where there's accusations and the legal documents are already being filed.

Look, if you look at what former Vice President Joe Biden said about being confident about Pennsylvania, you can understand why when you look at the numbers. The bottom line is, he needs about -- he is winning 73 or 74 percent of the mail-in ballot vote. And there are about 850,000 mail-in ballot votes that still need to be counted. Here in Luzerne County, they have 50 city employees here who are have been counting 57,000 mail-in ballots since yesterday at 7:00 a.m. They stopped at 10:00 p.m., woke up again at 8:00 a.m. today, and have continued to count. They have about less than 10,000 ballots left. And these are city employees who are here during COVID, wearing their masks, working in a small courtroom. And there are observers here, a Republican lawyer, a Democrat lawyer, the press, elected officials, who can see this process as it goes. And, look, it is a process. These folks have to open up two envelopes just to get to the ballot. Then, after that, they have to then scan that ballot. So, it takes a team. And the bottom line is, when you speak to the county manager here, he will tell you, look, if the legislature and the governor had just come to an agreement, and given these counties at least one day, three days, a week, just any kind of time before Election Day, allowed them to actually start counting these ballots, Pennsylvania's results would already be in. But they could not come to a consensus. The Republican-led legislature could not come to a consensus on giving some sort of time to allow that pre-canvassing. And that is why the entire nation is waiting for the results. And it is a laborious process, and these people are risking it. You know, so, this is democracy at work. And it's really something to really see them continuing to count these ballots, working hard. And this is the scene at counties all over Pennsylvania, as that mail-in ballot, by the way, those votes are mean a lot to the former Vice President Joe Biden. Again, about 1.6 million mail-in ballots have been counted, the former vice president winning about 74 percent of the mail-in ballots in this state. And there are still about 850,000 ballots left to count. President Trump's margin right now, he's up about 400,000. And there's not a lot of votes out there in Pennsylvania for the president to be left to count in. So, this is why the Democrats feel very confident about Pennsylvania right now. And it's all because of those collar counties in and around Philadelphia, those mail-in ballots. The margins are pretty big for the vice president.",

The lawsuit actually required that, when these mail-in ballots that you know are highly suspicious anyway -- this form of balloting has always been considered the most prone to fraud. That's according to The New York Times when it didn't apply to candidate, President Trump. Well, we were supposed to be allowed by law to observe the counting of the ballots. Now, observe means to any intelligent person being able to look at it. The way it's interpreted by the Democrat, crooked machine of Philadelphia, is that the observers can be 20 or 30 feet away, never able to see the ballot itself, never able to see if it was properly postmarked, properly addressed, properly signed on the outside, all of the things that often lead to disqualification of ballots, or make it very easy to dump 50,000 totally fraudulent ballots, because they're not observed. This went on for 20 hours. While all of you thought there was some kind of legitimate count going on here in Philadelphia, it was totally illegitimate. So, we went back to court, and we went before a Democrat judge. No need to tell you what the result in Philadelphia is if you are before a Democrat judge, obviously a political hack, who doesn't know the meaning of the word observe. Observe needs to be able to look. Not a single Republican has been able to look at any one of these mail ballots. They could be from Mars, as far as we're concerned, or they could be from the Democratic National Committee. Joe Biden could have voted 50 times, as far as we know, or 5,000 times. The ballots could be from Camden. Philadelphia, unfortunately -- and we say this about my own city -- has a reputation for voter fraud. You have a reputation for dead people voting, and we're going to go look at just how many dead people voted here. I didn't think we'd have to do that. But we will.

I don't know if this is going on in any other place, but it is going on with enough frequency in Wisconsin that we have brought suit, and now we will have to look into three other places. What it says to me is, this is a concerted effort of the crooks that run the Democrat Party. And, you know, these big city machines are crooked.

That brings him now up to 264 electoral votes, within six of 270. And that, you can find, for example, in the state of Nevada, where he leads. There are six electoral votes there. If, if, if he were to win that, and they were to decide that, he would be at 270, and he would well be on his way to becoming the next president of the United States. Conversely, for the president now, that means he would not only need those Nevada electoral votes, the six there, but the 15 out of North Carolina, the 16 out of Georgia, and the 20 out of Pennsylvania. He would, as they say, have to run the table, and then he could indeed get there. It is a leap. The math favors right now Joe Biden. He is within six electoral votes of getting there.

We will be releasing that video shortly, and we appreciate your time. There'll be no questions today. Thank you very much.",

That state, it could be days before we know for sure who won the 20 electoral votes there. The president did last go-round. He has a substantial lead right now, better than 400,000 votes, as I think Eric Trump was pointing out. But Democrats counter, yes, but a lot of the ballots from urban centers, big cities, Philadelphia, for example, have not come in, and they will more than offset that. Now, that's what a lot of the Democrats say. Others say that it's prohibitive math and closer to actually half-a-million votes that Democrats would have to find a way of making up. So, what they're essentially saying, this is where it stops right now, we have won Pennsylvania, let's move on. What happened in the interim, though, is that even if that was to be settled in their favor, because major news organizations, including our own, have declared both Wisconsin and Michigan are now in the Joe Biden column, it is incumbent upon the president to sweep the remaining four states we do not know, including Nevada, with six electoral votes. If, for example, Joe Biden were to get that, with the 264 he has now, he is at 270, and he is the president-elect of the United States. For the president, he would not only have to get Nevada. He would have to get North Carolina and its 15 electoral votes, Georgia and its 16 electoral votes, and, as I said, the aforementioned Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes. He would essentially have to run, that is, the president, the table with the remaining states on the map. So, the numbers are looking prohibitive right now. Let's go to Francesca Chambers, McClatchy White House correspondent. Francesca, first on those developments, with Michigan being declared in the Joe Biden column, along with Wisconsin. Both happened within about an hour- and-a-half of each other. For all we know, Nevada could be next, but, that, we don't know. But the math is beginning to look a little prohibitive.",

You are looking at a map of the United States and the race to 270 electoral votes to decide who becomes our next president of the United States. Right now, Joe Biden, thanks to a pickup with Wisconsin, and now waiting to address the nation, he is within 22 points, 22 electoral votes of being the next president. Now, that has changed things mightily right now, since declaring Wisconsin for him. He picks up Michigan, he picks up Nevada, he picks up some combinations therein, he's there. He's there at that 270. We're going to go into the possibilities, get a read on that. We're also going to be hearing from the former vice president, who is addressing a crowd in Wilmington, Delaware. Not quite sure exactly what he is going to say. We do know that lawsuits are flying fast and furiously. We do know as well that the markets, which have been all over the map right now, by day's ended, had surrendered some of their heady gains, still impressive. We will get into why they surrendered those gains, but still why they're up triple digits for three days running, even in the middle of all of this conclusion.

      "utterance": "Hey, good afternoon to you, Neil. Where we stand at this hour, even with Wisconsin being called for Joe Biden, both candidates still have a path here. But I want to focus for one second on Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes. You can see here President Trump is leading 52 percent to Biden's 46 percent. However, there were three million mail-in ballots. One million of those still need to be counted. Look, the tally up here, only 85 percent of everything has been counted so far. So, Pennsylvania could potentially shift. The Biden camp is saying a lot of those mail-in ballots will probably favor the vice president, and Trump is still holding steady there. We may even see some legal challenges here. We're still waiting on more word there. But I want to go to those what-if scenarios that we were talking about, because so crucial here. Let's consider Alaska done for President Trump. In the South here, in Georgia and North Carolina, he has a lead. So let's assume for the moment that he holds on to those two states. What happens with Joe Biden? Well, he got Wisconsin. Let's say he gets Michigan and, as you mentioned, let's say he gets Nevada. Boom, 270. There's his path right there. But things could change. Let's take Nevada back, because, Bill Hemmer said, it is very close to call still. And let's go ahead and say the president does get Pennsylvania. All of a sudden, the game changes, 274. I just want to go back to the Biden scenario for a moment, because it was so interesting. Yesterday, his campaign put out this notion he doesn't need Ohio, he doesn't eat Pennsylvania, Texas, or Florida, and he still has a path. Indeed, I just showed it to you. ' But what's interesting about his path at this moment, and I suppose the president's as well, they're both murky. Nobody has it outlined in a clear way just yet, Neil."

And they insist that, in the Keystone State, Pennsylvania, the math is there for President Trump to hang on to a victory. In fact, they are boldly predicting that it has already happened. Listen to what Stepien said. BILL STEPIEN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN MANAGER:  We are declaring a victory in Pennsylvania. This is not based on gut or feel. This is based on math. We feel very, very positive that the president and vice president will again deliver a victory in Pennsylvania. In fact, we have a high degree of certainty that the margin won't be close."

Meantime, the lawsuits, as you pointed out at the top, Neil, have been flying fast and furiously, the Trump campaign announcing this afternoon in the last hour that it is going to intervene in a case already before the Supreme Court of the United States, which would invalidate the three-day post-Election Day counting period for mail-in ballots. They also want the voting -- vote count stopped in Pennsylvania to allow greater access to the vote counters, so that they can see if the ballots are in fact valid. That's the same sort of lawsuit that they have already filed in Michigan. The Trump campaign is also predicting that, by Friday, President Trump will be able to claim victory in the Grand Canyon State of Arizona. The Trump campaign insists that there are some 605,000 ballots outstanding, most of those Election Day voters that typically support President Trump. They say that President Trump only needs to get 57.73 percent support among those ballots in order to overturn, because it's been declared now by FOX News and the Associated Press, overturn the call in Arizona and pick up the win there and Arizona's 11 electoral votes. Now, if the president were to reverse Arizona, pick up Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that would give him 274 electoral votes, without Michigan or Minnesota -- Michigan or Wisconsin. And that would give him the win. So, it's not to say that any of this is going to happen, Neil, but the Trump campaign very confident this afternoon on this conference call that that scenario will come to pass.

      "utterance": "Kamala and I are here to make a brief statement, and I'm sure we will have more to say later and either tonight or tomorrow. But let me begin by thanking the press for being here and thanking everyone else. My fellow Americans, yesterday once again proved democracy is the heartbeat of this nation, just as it has been the heartbeat of this nation for two centuries. And even in the face of a pandemic, more Americans voted this election than ever before in American history. Over 150 million people cast their votes. I think that's just extraordinary. And if we had any doubts, we shouldn't have any longer, about a government of, by and for the people. It's very much alive, very much alive in America. Here, the people rule. Power can't be taken or asserted. It flows from the people. And it's their will that determines who will be the president of the United States, and their will alone. And now, after a long night of counting, it's clear that we're winning enough states to reach 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. I'm not here to declare that we have won, but I am here to report, when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners. With all the votes counted, we have won Wisconsin by 20,000 votes, virtually the same margin that President Trump won that state four years ago. In Michigan, we lead by over 35,000 votes, and it's growing, a substantially bigger margin than President Trump won Michigan in 2016. Michigan will complete its vote soon, maybe as early as today. And I feel very good about Pennsylvania. Virtually all of the remaining ballots to be counted were cast by mail. And we have been winning 78 percent of the votes by mail in Pennsylvania. We have flipped Arizona and the 2nd District of Nebraska. Of special significance to me is that we won with the majority of the American people. And every indication is that that majority will grow. We have a popular vote lead of nearly three million votes, and every indication is that will grow as well. Indeed, Senator Harris and I are on track to win more votes than any ticket in the history of this country that ever won the presidency and vice presidency, over 70 million votes. I'm very proud of our campaign. Only three presidential campaigns in the past have defeated an incumbent president. When it's finished, God willing, we will be the fourth. This is major achievement. This is a major achievement. And it's been a long and difficult campaign. But it's been a more difficult time for our country, a hard time. We have had hard campaigns before. We have faced hard times before. So, once this election is finalized and behind us, it will be time for us to do what we have always done as Americans, to put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us, to lower the temperature, to see each other again, to listen to one another, to hear each other again and respect and care for one another, to unite, to heal, to come together as a nation. I know this won't be easy. I'm not naive. Neither of us are. I know how deep and hard the opposing views are in our country on so many things. But I also know this as well. To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies. What brings us together as Americans is so much stronger than anything that can tear us apart. So, let me be clear. I, we are campaigning as a Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. The presidency itself is not a partisan institution. It's the one office in this nation that represents everyone. And it demands a duty of care for all Americans. And that is precisely what I will do. I will work as hard for those who didn't vote for me as I will for those who did vote for me. Now every vote must be counted. No one is going to take our democracy away from us, not now, not ever. America has come too far, America's fought too many battles, America's endured too much to ever let that happen. We, the people, will not be silenced. We, the people, will not be bullied. We, the people, will not surrender. My friends, I'm confident we will emerge victorious. But this will not be my victory alone or our victory alone. It will be a victory for the American people, for our democracy, for America. And there will be no blue states and red states when we win, just the United States of America. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops."

      "utterance": "All right, not a victory statement on the part of Joe Biden yet, confident with the numbers and that the trend is his friend, and leaving it simply at that, with his running mate, Kamala Harris. Please stay tuned the FOX News Channel and this FOX station. I'm Neil Cavuto in New York. So, in the back-and-forth of lawsuits and what could be a dragged-out presidential election, the former vice president made it clear:  I'm not here to file briefs. So, let me briefly tell you I'm here to get ready to become the next president of the United States. Right now, there is a battle, though, brewing over states that have already been called and states where the count goes on. Let's get into that right now with Lee Carter, GOP pollster. We have also got Daron Shaw at the FOX News Decision Desk. They're the maestros behind really reading on what's a time to call a state and what's not. So, Daron, I end it with you. I want to begin with you. The controversy today seems to be the Decision Desk's move to call Arizona for Joe Biden. The Trump folks are firmly convinced -- and I talked to former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who's also firmly convinced -- that, when all is said and done, Arizona is and should be in the Trump column. How did you come to that Arizona decision, because that would change the math if it rolled back, obviously, to Donald Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DARON SHAW, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Sure. I mean, it's a fair question. Our estimates about the outstanding vote in Arizona, I think, are right on top of not only the Trump campaign's, but also most of the independent analysis that we have seen, including The Arizona Republic and some other political sources. Where there's a difference is that the Trump campaign, possibly based on information from their ground game operatives, believes that the late early vote, votes cast on Election Day, et cetera, are going to break 60 percent to 66 percent -- that is possibly 2-1 -- in favor of the president. Our best estimates from the FOX Voter News Analysis suggests that the distribution, most of which is going to come from Maricopa, is going to run more along the lines of the traditional vote, which is about 55 percent Biden, 44 percent for Trump. We saw no indication in the data that people who cast their mail-in ballots late in the game are going to be appreciably different than those who cast their votes throughout this process. In addition to the FOX News Voter Analysis system, we're also looking at data from previous election cycles, including the most recent of which was the 2018 Senate race, where you had McSally and Sinema. And as most people remember, as the later ballots trickled in, Sinema continued to gain ground. Now, we don't -- we're not comparing a midterm election to the presidential, but there was nothing that we saw the lead us to suggest -- to suggest or to base any analysis upon a 2-1 break for these late early voters."

      "utterance": "Lee Carter, looking at that, obviously, if those 11 electoral votes from Arizona were to go back to Donald Trump, we'd be looking at him having 225 electoral votes right now and Joe Biden 237. So, you can understand why it's important to them and understand why they're very, very interested in once again canvassing votes in some of these battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan as well. They're close enough for that. That's very tough to do, though. Rarely do they lead to a turnaround in the vote. Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "It's really tough to do. I mean, these races, while you look at Nevada, that's a really close race. You're looking at 7,000 votes there. When you look at some of these other votes, you're looking at 35,000, 79,000, 76,000 votes. Those are, I mean, not huge spreads, but that's enough. It's bigger than the margins that Donald Trump won by in 2016. And so, when you look at this, you look at the numbers and you look at the math, as was just described to us, it seems like the path for Donald Trump to go to victory is narrower and narrower and narrower. It's really, really almost impossible, I think, at this point, without something being overturned. And I think that's why you're seeing so many legal battles being coming -- being threatened and started, because I think the only way to victory at this point, realistically, is through something that's going to come down from that."

And, right now, it would seem to be for the former vice president. If he were to pick up Michigan's 16 electoral votes -- and he's leading there right now -- and Nevada's six, he's there. Pennsylvania becomes a moot point. All of this drama over some of these other states becomes a moot point. Are you comfortable -- and I have asked this of others as well -- making a call on either one of those states either tonight or tomorrow?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAW",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not comfortable now. I can't remember the last time I was comfortable about an American election. I think there's there's some sense that Michigan might dump another tranche of data, which might give us some clarity there. I think there's a general expectation around the Decision Desk that we may know Michigan by later on this evening. Nevada, I don't think so. Nevada has let us know that they're not planning on releasing the data, which is essentially going to be processed Election Day mail-in votes -- so it's people who basically voted on Election Day by mail -- their argument in Nevada is that they need a day to do the signature check matches, to make sure that people didn't double-vote, showed up in person, and then voted by mail. So, we will cut them some slack, but they're not planning on releasing those data until tomorrow. So, I don't know that we're going to get clarity. I do think we could hear from North Carolina, where they have sort of stopped processing ballots, and Trump has a fairly significant lead there. Georgia is going to give us another tranche of data, which may give us some clarity there. Our models show Georgia trending towards a very, very close race. And so I think, as we add data there, coming from Atlanta and some of this collar counties, I don't know that we're going to get more clarity. I think we might get less clarity. But you're right. President Trump's path is very narrow at this point. But there is a path, I think it's important to keep that in mind."

I think it was probably too soon for him to start making such an announcement, as he did last night, because there is still a path. It is a very narrow path. And last night, at 2:30 in the morning, there was very much still a path."
    },

      "speaker": "And so what he should have done and maybe could have done instead, simply",
      "utterance": " I'm optimistic. I can see the path. I want every vote counted. And we are going to fight to make sure every one of you is heard until the very end. And that would be a very different feeling than we have today, where there's accusations of voter fraud, where there's accusations and the legal documents are already being filed. You would feel differently about it than the way it was -- than it was announced. And so will this work in the end? Maybe. Maybe he will end up being the president again. And that would be -- that would be one thing. But the question is, how are the American people going to feel about it? Are they going to question how he came to power again? Are they going to question the legitimacy of the election, that their votes are going to be counted? There's going to be a lot of pain and a lot of things and a lot of healing that is going to need to happen as a result of it. So it might have been the -- it might lead to victory, but I think that there are some costs along the way."

I think that markets will continue to go to the -- through this channel and expect fiscal stimulus, if it turns out that Biden wins the presidency. If Trump pulls it out, via litigation or the votes that come through, I think we will see more rallying in the market. But the next thing that the markets are focused on is fiscal stimulus.

They're looking at the prospect of a President Biden. We're nowhere near that right now. Just I get the fact that he's countered or some of his big economic plans, spending plans, tax plans maybe, are countered by a still Republican Senate. But, at the very least, in that logjam, it's still possible that some of the president's tax cuts still go, and we have seen with Republican Senates in the past brokering deals with a Democratic president that brought us just that. So who's to say that the split government goes the market's way?"

The markets don't have to worry about that until the first quarter of next year. And we will be expected to have more economic data. We will be expected to have fiscal stimulus. And so I do think, at some point, obviously, Biden will be able to do some things with taxes, some things with regulations, despite the Republican Senate. But it's not going to be as extreme as the blue wave. And so a lot of it's just that the markets so much priced in the blue wave that they're now unwinding that, although I would contend..."

Look, if you look at what former Vice President Joe Biden said about being confident about Pennsylvania, you can understand why when you look at the numbers. The bottom line is, he needs about -- he is winning 73 or 74 percent of the mail-in ballot vote. And there are about 850,000 mail-in ballot votes that still need to be counted. Here in Luzerne County, they have 50 city employees here who are have been counting 57,000 mail-in ballots since yesterday at 7:00 a.m. They stopped at 10:00 p.m., woke up again at 8:00 a.m. today, and have continued to count. They have about less than 10,000 ballots left. And these are city employees who are here during COVID, wearing their masks, working in a small courtroom. And there are observers here, a Republican lawyer, a Democrat lawyer, the press, elected officials, who can see this process as it goes. And, look, it is a process. These folks have to open up two envelopes just to get to the ballot. Then, after that, they have to then scan that ballot. So, it takes a team. And the bottom line is, when you speak to the county manager here, he will tell you, look, if the legislature and the governor had just come to an agreement, and given these counties at least one day, three days, a week, just any kind of time before Election Day, allowed them to actually start counting these ballots, Pennsylvania's results would already be in. But they could not come to a consensus. The Republican-led legislature could not come to a consensus on giving some sort of time to allow that pre-canvassing. And that is why the entire nation is waiting for the results. And it is a laborious process, and these people are risking it. You know, so, this is democracy at work. And it's really something to really see them continuing to count these ballots, working hard. And this is the scene at counties all over Pennsylvania, as that mail-in ballot, by the way, those votes are mean a lot to the former Vice President Joe Biden. Again, about 1.6 million mail-in ballots have been counted, the former vice president winning about 74 percent of the mail-in ballots in this state. And there are still about 850,000 ballots left to count. President Trump's margin right now, he's up about 400,000. And there's not a lot of votes out there in Pennsylvania for the president to be left to count in. So, this is why the Democrats feel very confident about Pennsylvania right now. And it's all because of those collar counties in and around Philadelphia, those mail-in ballots. The margins are pretty big for the vice president."

I want to go to Tom Dupree right now, the former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo with us as well, U.C. Berkeley law professor. John, if I can begin with you on the president's quest to sort of slow, stop this, get the Supreme Court to deal with this. How likely is that?"

And the reason I say that is because there's a case still pending out of Pennsylvania with the U.S. Supreme Court right now that raises the fundamental question:  Can the Pennsylvania state legislature set the deadlines for when votes are due and how they're to be counted, or can courts say they're justifying the right to vote and extend the deadline? Four justices on the Supreme Court have wanted to intervene even before Election Day. And the Supreme Court decided to say, no, let's wait and see what happens. Well, now we can see what happens. And it may be the case that the Supreme Court might take that case right now. The other thing is, Amy Coney Barrett was not on the Supreme Court when the earlier decisions were made. So, she's going to now join the court. And now the Supreme Court will have to face the question, do we want to take a case out of Pennsylvania that deals with these three extra days that state courts added on after Election Day for votes to come in?"

And I'm just wondering whether this is the type of issue that goes into lower courts in the various states, maybe, as it did in 2000, 20 years ago, eventually hitting the Supreme Court in Florida, before it made its way to the federal courts and then to the Supreme Court, but it's not going to be the first default stop.

And by that, I mean potentially flip the election, because, look, you're right, if, at the end of the day, what the Trump campaign is arguing about is 2,000 ballots, and they have got to overcome a margin of 20,000 votes, then it seems unlikely, to your point, that the Supreme Court would say, we want to wade into these political waters. I suspect we're going to get greater clarity in the next 24 to 48 hours as to how important those ballots that have come in, in the three days since the polls have closed are important or whether or not they could make the difference in Pennsylvania, and potentially make the difference in the election as a whole."

And part of what happened there, I think it would be a good idea for Trump to emulate here, which is let the vote count come to a close for, as you said, every legally valid vote under the rules set by the state legislature, and then go to court, if there's an effort to monkey around with how the votes are counted, where they came from, whether it was an extension of the deadline. That's important to give people some kind of confidence that you are going to come to a final vote. And I think that's what happened 20 years ago. I think that's what the Bush campaign did. And then, only then, did they ask the Supreme Court to get involved, when it looked like other actors were going to try to come in and upset that final vote count."

Some states were going to delay counting them on the day of voting. Other states, like Pennsylvania, to a lesser degree, North Carolina, were going to put that next in line. So, it's not as if we didn't have an expectation that day-of voting would favor the president, and then the rollout of these ballots that could change things, as they did in Wisconsin.

They read the newspapers. They follow what's going on. So they're not immune from all the discussion that's going on. But I do think, when push comes to shove, and they have to make this immensely consequential decision about whether or not they're going to jettison ballots that potentially could shift the winner of the election from Biden to Trump, I think, at that point, they're going to tune out a lot of the chatter, a lot of the expectations, and they are going to make the call, based on what the Constitution of the United States requires."

Instead, what you want to do is defend the right of the state legislature to set the rules. The U.S. Constitution gives to the legislatures of a state -- in fact, the Constitution rarely picks out one body like, says the state legislature selects the presidential electors, and they set the time, place and manner for elections. So, what they should do is say, we are only defending the constitutional rule that state legislatures, not state courts, not governors, are the ones who decide how the election should be conducted. And in those states that you mentioned, Neil, those are ones where the state legislature set a date and decided how to count a legal vote.

I mean, these sorts of post-election litigation challenges, it's the legal equivalent of trench warfare. You're scrambling by ballot by ballot, vote by vote, trying to piece together enough votes for your guy or knock out enough votes of the other guy to change the outcome. It's hard work.

And now they won't let -- and we brought one great gentleman here with us today, Jeremy, who's a poll watcher down at the convention center. They won't even let him watch as they count the ballots. They put them behind a fence 40, 50 yards away, where they actually can't see the counting happening. Guys, this is fraud. This is absolute fraud. We've seen it in Philadelphia before. They're trying to make a mockery of the election of this country. My father is up by almost half-a-million votes in this state, with 86 percent reported, and plenty of red counties left to go, plenty of red counties left to go. We're going to win Pennsylvania. But they're trying to cheat us out of it, because they know it's their only path to victory. They know it's the only path to victory. And so we came here today. We met with all our lawyers. We are going to file suit in Pennsylvania. It's a shame that we have to do that. It's the last thing that we wanted to do. It's the last thing my father wanted to do, but this is rampant corruption. And it can't happen. It's simply can't happen. It's not fair. This isn't democracy. And with that, I want to pass it off to the great Rudy Giuliani, who's really leading the legal effort. And you'll be hearing from Rudy quite a bit. Please."

      "utterance": "Thank you very much, Eric. It is very, very sad that we're here in the city that's really the birthplace of our democracy. And this is among one of the most anti- democratic things I've ever seen or encountered. And it's not just here in Philadelphia. This is going on all over the country. We have filed a lawsuit. The lawsuit actually required that, when these mail-in ballots that you know are highly suspicious anyway -- this form of balloting has always been considered the most prone to fraud. That's according to The New York Times when it didn't apply to candidate, President Trump. Well, we were supposed to be allowed by law to observe the counting of the ballots. Now, observe means to any intelligent person being able to look at it. The way it's interpreted by the Democrat, crooked machine of Philadelphia, is that the observers can be 20 or 30 feet away, never able to see the ballot itself, never able to see if it was properly postmarked, properly addressed, properly signed on the outside, all of the things that often lead to disqualification of ballots, or make it very easy to dump 50,000 totally fraudulent ballots, because they're not observed. This went on for 20 hours. While all of you thought there was some kind of legitimate count going on here in Philadelphia, it was totally illegitimate. So, we went back to court, and we went before a Democrat judge. No need to tell you what the result in Philadelphia is if you are before a Democrat judge, obviously a political hack, who doesn't know the meaning of the word observe. Observe needs to be able to look. Not a single Republican has been able to look at any one of these mail ballots. They could be from Mars, as far as we're concerned, or they could be from the Democratic National Committee. Joe Biden could have voted 50 times, as far as we know, or 5,000 times. The ballots could be from Camden. Philadelphia, unfortunately -- and we say this about my own city -- has a reputation for voter fraud. You have a reputation for dead people voting, and we're going to go look at just how many dead people voted here. I didn't think we'd have to do that. But we will. And you have a reputation for people being bused in from Camden voting here. Wouldn't be the first time that happened. But this goes way beyond any of that. And let me also add that this isn't happening just here. We have exactly the same lawsuit in Wisconsin, where exactly the same thing happened, except in Wisconsin, mysteriously, at 4:00 or 3:00 in the morning, about 120,000 ballots appeared. Oh, here comes these ballots. Well, we have no idea if they really are ballots. We have no idea if they're signed, if they're postmarked properly, if it isn't just the same person who submitted 100,000 ballots. And they all got counted. This is the way they intend to win. Now I'm informed by former Congressman Sweeney, who has been..."

      "utterance": "We're considering to monitor Rudy Giuliani. You might have noticed something happened to the electoral vote count for Joe Biden. Our Decision Desk has taken a look at Michigan and concluded Joe Biden has won Michigan and gets the 16 electoral votes from Michigan. That puts him now six electoral votes from the presidency of the United States. Nevada could do it. Those electoral votes are still out there. Would you know there's six electoral votes there? If he were to take that state, he would be at 270, and he would be on his way to the White House. Now back to the legal challenges being mounted as we speak by team Trump."

      "utterance": "You make sure that it's properly postmarked. You make sure that it's properly addressed, and then you pass on it. A number of these are often challenged by the Democrat representative or the Republican representative. We never got a chance to look at a single one of them. The gentlemen here who did this for us says about 100,000 ballots went through that process in the 20-plus hours in which they wasted his time by not allowing him to see a single ballot. Well, that's 120,000 ballots that should just be taken out of the count. So, you want to look at that number, that 120,000 should come out. And this is an area in which Biden is getting 60, 70 percent of the vote. I don't know if this is going on in any other place, but it is going on with enough frequency in Wisconsin that we have brought suit, and now we will have to look into three other places. What it says to me is, this is a concerted effort of the crooks that run the Democrat Party. And, you know, these big city machines are crooked. You know that -- 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 100 years of one-party rule leads to corruption of all kinds. Voter fraud is one of the biggest, because that's how you keep your power. But we're not going to let them get away with it. They're not going to steal this election. This election is decided by the people. These people, the elite, they don't care about the people. The people are the deplorables, the chumps. They're not important. To President Trump, he's the whole reason that he ran for office. And he's the whole reason for which he's carrying on this campaign, so that your vote can mean something, so that your vote doesn't get wiped out by 100,000 fraudulent meaningless paper ballots that no one gets to observe. So, we are going to continue the lawsuit here. We're going to bring a second one. And then we're going to bring a federal lawsuit. And we're going to take a very good look at whether we bring this nationally. We certainly are going to bring it here and in Wisconsin. Quite possibly, we will do a national lawsuit and really expose the corruption of the Democrat Party. But this is beyond anything I have ever seen before. This comes when you think you have so much power and you own the media, that you can do anything you want. Well, sorry, we're going to fight for the people. We're going to vindicate their right. And the ultimate result is, President Trump has won Pennsylvania. I have never heard of a count where you're ahead by 400,000 with 80-plus percent counted, and they haven't called it for you yet. They called California the moment it opened -- the polls closed. How many votes do you have to be ahead to win? For a Republican to win here, how many votes do we have be ahead? Four hundred thousand is not enough with 80-plus percent counted? I think there's only 14 percent of the vote to go. Do you think we're stupid? You think we're fools? You know something? The Democrats do think you're stupid and they do think you're fools. And that's why you get called deplorable and chumps. It's over."

      "utterance": "All right, Rudy Giuliani wrapping things up here. I want to bring your attention again to some startling numbers you're seeing on your screen here. What happened to Joe Biden's electoral vote count? Why is he at 264? Because our Decision Desk and others have awarded the state of Michigan, close as it was, separated by 20,000 votes, though they are, to Joe Biden. That brings him now up to 264 electoral votes, within six of 270. And that, you can find, for example, in the state of Nevada, where he leads. There are six electoral votes there. If, if, if he were to win that, and they were to decide that, he would be at 270, and he would well be on his way to becoming the next president of the United States. Conversely, for the president now, that means he would not only need those Nevada electoral votes, the six there, but the 15 out of North Carolina, the 16 out of Georgia, and the 20 out of Pennsylvania. He would, as they say, have to run the table, and then he could indeed get there. It is a leap. The math favors right now Joe Biden. He is within six electoral votes of getting there. He's not there yet. But he's certainly much closer. Stay tuned now to FOX News Channel and this FOX station. I'm Neil Cavuto in New York. All right, now back to this legal challenge being raised by the Trump team here about the imposition of these restraints that say -- they say, and very, very suspect voter developments in key states, including Pennsylvania.

You can only see, with the binoculars, the ones that are closest to you. So, that's a concession by them, and they're still not letting us see this. So we need to fix this. We need to remedy this now, because we have won Pennsylvania, and we want every vote to be counted in a fair way. Thank you. And I'd like to introduce Corey Lewandowski. COREY LEWANDOWSKI, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  General Bondi and I will be here for the remainder, until you all realize that President Trump has won this state.

This isn't as if you come in and show an identification.

That state, it could be days before we know for sure who won the 20 electoral votes there. The president did last go-round. He has a substantial lead right now, better than 400,000 votes, as I think Eric Trump was pointing out. But Democrats counter, yes, but a lot of the ballots from urban centers, big cities, Philadelphia, for example, have not come in, and they will more than offset that. Now, that's what a lot of the Democrats say. Others say that it's prohibitive math and closer to actually half-a-million votes that Democrats would have to find a way of making up. So, what they're essentially saying, this is where it stops right now, we have won Pennsylvania, let's move on. What happened in the interim, though, is that even if that was to be settled in their favor, because major news organizations, including our own, have declared both Wisconsin and Michigan are now in the Joe Biden column, it is incumbent upon the president to sweep the remaining four states we do not know, including Nevada, with six electoral votes. If, for example, Joe Biden were to get that, with the 264 he has now, he is at 270, and he is the president-elect of the United States. For the president, he would not only have to get Nevada. He would have to get North Carolina and its 15 electoral votes, Georgia and its 16 electoral votes, and, as I said, the aforementioned Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes. He would essentially have to run, that is, the president, the table with the remaining states on the map. So, the numbers are looking prohibitive right now. Let's go to Francesca Chambers, McClatchy White House correspondent. Francesca, first on those developments, with Michigan being declared in the Joe Biden column, along with Wisconsin. Both happened within about an hour- and-a-half of each other. For all we know, Nevada could be next, but, that, we don't know. But the math is beginning to look a little prohibitive."

And, Neil, I was speaking to a source that's been in touch with the campaign about their legal strategy, who essentially summed it up as saying they plan to litigate everything everywhere, everywhere being places where it's contested. And Republicans feel that, even if the president, at this point, cannot win, that this is something that he must do. This is really his last potential pathway here, is to push these litigation challenges."

It now seems to be a little bit more clear, based on the update that we just heard, certainly in Pennsylvania. But, again, Michigan, Wisconsin are also places where they expect to have challenges.
