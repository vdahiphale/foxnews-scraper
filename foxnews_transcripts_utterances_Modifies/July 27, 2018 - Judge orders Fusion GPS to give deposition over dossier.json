Joining me now, Chris Stirewalt, Fox News politics editor. Matt Schlapp, chairman and -- of the American Conservative Union, and Adrienne Elrod, strategic communications director, Clinton 2016 presidential campaign. So Adrienne, let me start with you.

So, I think again, I'll acknowledge fact that there are -- that the numbers look good today, but we'll see what happens next quarter, and I have a feeling that these economic numbers are not going to be looking quite as good."

And if people doubt this question about how fast the economy is growing, and the fact that American CEOs and entrepreneurs feel bullish about the economy, you can just look at the right track, wrong track number. Something that Stirewalt tracks all the time. The fact is the American people are generally in a better mood about their country and about their individual lives, and a big dominant part of that is they feel like they have greater economic opportunity. Their kids might have better jobs, maybe someone got a raise, maybe their stock portfolio in their retirement account is higher. The American people are in a better mood because all of this talk about the Trump agenda has turned into action, and it's actually having a positive impact on their life."

      "speaker": "CHRIS STIREWALT, FOX NEWS DIGITAL POLITICS EDITOR",
      "utterance": "Well it all -- it all depends. There was a fella named William Jefferson Clinton who back in 1994, not some even better numbers than these for the comparative quarter in his presidency. And he took an absolute shellacking in November of that year. A historic one, but conversely, we've had presidents like Obama was who suffered similar fates even though things were growing. But we've also had presidents who thinks we're going well at this point in their first term, and they won. So, you can't tell at this point. But what you do know is this, this is the rallying call for Republicans. This is the high flag on the hill that now if they can get out of their own way, this is a Paul Ryan, this is what other Republicans have been saying for a long time. Go sell the tax cut, this is the first quarter that reflects really the consequences of the tax cut. Go sell this tax cut, go sell economic prosperity and opportunity, forget about the rest of the stuff. Get away from the culture war business, focus on people getting richer, people being more prosperous, and that's what works for the GOP."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, Adrienne, it seems like when -- you know, when you look at these packages, right? You've got personal spending up, you've got businesses spending at a rate, they were spending at 1.8 percent growth now it's at seven percent. Going to looks more like nine percent in the coming quarter. So, the numbers are just very solid in terms of optimism when you look at companies. And you know, you look at the way President Obama handled it after the 2008 debacle in the financial markets. And it was loading on regulation and no tax cuts, right? So, now you've got the exact opposite of that. Just on a purely empirical basis. This is what business is like, this is what investors like, and it doesn't look like there's a reason for that to cool off in the near term. Especially, if as Ian Bremmer said, he sees these trade wars as working out. So, is that a difficult metric for Democrats who are going to argue in November, you'll be better off with us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "It's not a difficult metric, and here's the two reasons why, Martha. Number one, Americans are not seeing real wage growth, right? There may be low unemployment number right now, but they're not seeing growth in their wages. We haven't had a federal minimum wage increase in nine years. People feeling it heat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Then how are they saving so much more? How are they saving so much more if they don't have more disposable income?"

    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "I can -- I can certainly assure you, not every American out there is saving a lot. I think the average is $400 per family is what you will have their savings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But the growth rate in savings is up dramatically. So, I mean, I mean, that we've seen those numbers today. So, you've got people -- they have more disposable income and my guess is that it's probably from the tax cuts overall."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELROD",
      "utterance": "From a very -- from a very -- for me, by the way, from a tax cut that gave more way to corporations than middle-class working families. And middle-class working families does not see a permanent tax cut but corporations did. So, again, lots of flaws with that tax bill. Secondly, look, we just saw Larry Sabato yesterday came out with new numbers, and his prediction in terms of where Democrats are until they take it to House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So, Matt, it does look ugly. When you look at the numbers, and you see -- you know, we've seen three different reads this week on the gap, and it looks anywhere it probably around seven percent is probably the average of the number of increase for Democratic seats in the House. How do you navigate that? How do you try to turn that around for your party?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Look, there was a panic that ensued in the Congress with the Trump effect. And a lot of Republicans who came from more purple seats believe that Trump was going to be destructive for their chances in getting reelected. I've talked to a lot of those members who decided to retire. Not all of them, but a good percentage of them realized that the environment is so much better than they thought it would be. And the fact of this is that if you look at any indicator, things are leveling out for the Republicans. And why do you put Republicans in office, after all, Martha? We all know the reason you put Republicans in office, project strength from a national security standpoint, and get the economy fixed, get it moving. If Republicans cannot get the economy fixed, they're in big trouble. Because that's really the number one reason people turn to them. And the fact that this economy, I don't care what anybody says from Democratic Party. The American people buy every single measure you can look at, believe that things are drastically improving, and it's one of the reasons why the president's numbers are so better. So -- so much better. So, the fact is when Trump is involved, it's nationalized. With Trump as the president, he's going to play a big role in a lot of these races, and for a lot of these races, it's a good thing."

Larry Nassar, the former USA gymnastics doctor sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison for sexually abusing more than a hundred girls, now says he's a victim.

But now there's a judge who wants to know exactly how the whole thing worked on the Clinton side of the equation. The dossier as we know was funded in part by the Clinton campaign, and use sources in Russia who gave information to Christopher Steele, much of which he said was unverifiable. So, on the Trump side, you've got the Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016. And tonight, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, reportedly dropping more bombs. Now, he says that the president knew all along about that meeting, even though, Cohen said the opposite in the past. So here's what the president said about it today. \"I did NOT,\" in caps, \"know of the meeting with my son Don Junior. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories. He even retained Bill and crooked Hillary's lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice.\" Here now Gregg Jarrett, Fox News anchor and author of the new book The Russia Hoax who knows this story inside and out.

I laugh every time. It's absurd, fabricated, anonymous quadruple hearsay. If you tried to present it in a court of law legitimately, the judge would toss you out or toss you in jail. So you know, that use of the dossier if paid for by the Clinton campaign and not properly accounted for could be at a minimum a civil violation of a federal campaign election act, at worse could actually be money laundering."

    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I mean, this dossier was the basis for the investigation of Donald Trump. On the day that Comey cleared Hillary Clinton, secretly his FBI was in a building in London meeting for the first time with the author of the dossier Christopher Steele armed with that totally phony fabricated document. They then watched the investigation, as I argue my book to frame Donald Trump for things he didn't do, for crimes he didn't commit. Collusion is not even a crime in a political campaign. It's nowhere in the criminal codes."

Don Jr. said I didn't father my father with these people coming from Russia. They wanted to talk about the Magnitsky Act which is not a light thing. That's a very serious thing that these people have been pursuing for a long time. So now, Michael Cohen says according to these stories, President Trump knew about it. What if he did?"

The meeting itself, and I devoted chapter to this, it's entitled it's not a crime to meet with a Russian. There is no criminal code violation, it's not a violation of the Federal Campaign Election Act which specifically says foreign nationals may participate in American campaigns.

Mike -- and Donald Trump Jr. said you know, here's my transact -- here's my e-mails that I sent back and forth. These people said that they had dirt on Hillary Clinton, he said oh, if that's true, you know, I'd love hear it. But then when they got there, according to his story all they wanted to talk about was the Magnitsky Act which I think adds up because that is what they want. That's what Vladimir Putin wants lifted. He says, so proud of Donald Trump Jr. for being open honest and transparent to the American people. This nonsense needs to stop. Now he is telling a different story."

But the Russians could actually publish in Pravda the communist party newspaper a story about Hillary Clinton and corruption replete with documents and any American campaign would be allowed legally to use that.

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Donald Trump Jr. thought that he was going to get some dirt and said oh well, if that's you know, if you have something come on over and tell me what you have. And on the Clinton side, they paid Fusion GPS to get Russian sources through Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on -- what's the difference?"

And feeling convinced that I have him back. I don't know what that would feel like. So, I don't know what we would do. We probably would have a service of some kind. I'm making it up as we go along right now. There is so much to think about before that could happen. To make that happen that that's kind of the focus. And let that be what it's going to be if and when it happens."

While we have talked to independent labs who feel like these remains could be identified in 90 to 120 days. And so, if the government is allowing now $10 million to identify these remains we would like the money to go to a lab who can do it much quicker and much less expensive than our government labs. We want to see some results. We want the remains to be identified."

So, John is much better versed on that than I am. I'm interested into, you know, the thing to know about is some of these caskets are going to have full skeletons and they'll have artifacts and they're going to have dental and they're going to have ways that can be identified rather quickly.

      "utterance": "Look, Roseanne has been around for a very long time. Her career has been, really she's been a Bulgarian. This is not a surprise, this is not a new Roseanne. I think there's only been one Roseanne because it's been the same one for a very long time. As a matter of fact, when she argues about what she was saying, something that we have all railed against. The nature of what she called Valerie Jarrett. She also called Susan Rice an ape five years earlier on Twitter. So there is the nature of what she was doing but there was no real backlash then. So then you do have a political framework of this. She argues that she's only under attack now because she supported Trump. Well, in part that's the only thing that's different from the Susan Rice comment to the Valerie Jarrett comment. So you got so many layers to this. All of us, you know, look, if you've been in the media, you've said something that probably offended someone inevitably and you said something you regret, of course. The issue then also becomes do you destroy someone in the process?"

But it's still a mess."

So, you know, she lost a lot in the process. As she mentioned base like, she lost the show, I mean, she lost millions of dollars. So I think it's time to kind of forgive and move on. At that point--"

She was on the View yesterday talking about this. I was looking at the headlines there's been a lot discussed. So, I'm sure it helps with the book sales.

Because why wouldn't you want to do that, right? So let's take a look. This picture he is getting so much, you know what, for this picture. And Kat, they're saying that he has a dad body.

Fox News asked Mueller's office about the picture and they say that he was not aware of Don Junior and had no interaction with him. So you have to wonder. I mean, they could be seated right next to each other. That might be a little bit awkward. Anyway, we'll see if we can find that out it turned out. That is our story for tonight.
