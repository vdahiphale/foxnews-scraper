The voters on the ground in early primary states like where I was in South Carolina last weekend, they are going to make that decision.

But second, they've got to make sure that we have a nominee who can stand on the debate stage next to Donald Trump and take him on as commander-in- chief.   And third, they want someone who can actually build the coalition we need to defeat him because I think Trump is going to be a lot harder to beat than many Democrats think. And that means a coalition that includes everybody in our party, plus independents -- those Obama-Trump voters -- and even some disaffected Republicans. I can build that coalition because I built it in the most difficult circumstances before in the middle of a war. I led troops in combat as a Marine platoon commander over four tours in Iraq where my fundamental job was to bring together this incredibly diverse group of Americans from all over this country, with different religious beliefs, different political beliefs, and get them united behind a common mission to serve America in the middle of a very divisive time -- in the middle of a war that many of us disagreed with.
