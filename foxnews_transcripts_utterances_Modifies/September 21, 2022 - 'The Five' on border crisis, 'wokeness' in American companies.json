Border patrol doesn't have enough agents to process. These folks are completely overwhelmed and this situation is completely deteriorating. It's essentially a free for all. If people can get across the river. They can just walk in. This was a single massive group of about 167 people who crossed almost all of them. Single adults. Hundreds upon hundreds, upon hundreds of these migrants crossing the Rio Grande in broad daylight. The city of El Paso, which is being inundated by illegal crossings right now.",

KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, White HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: DHS put out a report laying out what kind of a migration situation that we're dealing with, which is very new. I mentioned Venezuela. I mentioned Nicaragua. I mentioned Cuba. We have seen an increase of about 121 percent from since last year of what's going on with these countries that are fleeing communism. So that has gone up. And if you look at north -- the north, Central America in the last three months we have seen a decrease about 43 percent. So, we are in a different kind of migration component right now.",

Then they said they're mad at our border Doocy because DeSantis leaked to him. They told him that he was going to do the flights to Martha's Vineyard. I mean, at least DeSantis tells them that he's doing this. Biden just flies them anywhere. Doesn't tell anybody what he's doing. He does it in secret. And then they complained about the lack of nuance. They're saying that he focuses too much on the number of the migrants. And instead of explaining the root causes of the situation. Now I've heard the border Doocy explained the root causes and he says the causes are coming from the White House. They designated all the Trump border policies. They'd stopped building the border wall and they've encouraged them to come over and they're giving them free bus passes and free plane tickets. The bottom line is this.

It should say they're -- there's only credibility behind a criticism. If you're saying you're not telling the whole story. There's a part of the story I like for you guys to uncover, here's some additional information. There's no additional information here. We have a national security crisis at our border. I do wish, that instead of directing anger at reporters, and every president has a reporter or a couple of reporters they don't like because oftentimes they're asking questions that are irritating. And if you would just answer the question, maybe -- maybe the question would indeed go away. But we don't have a policy at our border and we need one. It's a national security threat and we ought to treat it at that. I've said before, I believe we should build a wall. I believe we should invest in that hemisphere. I believe we should have a streamline asylum process to make it where everyone coming here doesn't believe they're going to get in, just because they have a story that is horrifying and gut wrenching. We need to have a transparent, immigration system that spells out for every migrant or immigrant that comes here. How you achieve legal citizenship. Think about the people who waited five, seven, 10, 15 years to get in the country. Did it legally. Watching this it's a front to them. It's front and a front to the country, a front to our values.

So, none of that happened. And then in the last two weeks, Putin had a pretty rough time of it. Because both the Chinese leader and the Indian leader had meetings last week with him where they said, yes, we're not for this. And you need to figure out a way to wind this down. Then he has pressure from inside his own government. The people that are saying like, how could you let this happen? You're embarrassing us on the world stage, you have to do something. So, he might say something like using a tactical nuclear weapon or worse it could be something. The HIMARS which are the -- are the weapons that we're been providing, they're extremely effective. And they can't deal with that, especially if they're trying to buy weapons from North Korea in order to fight back. However, I maintain that Putin's strongest weapon that he will use against the west he's already deploying, which is to shut off energy. And so, the Ukrainians can do very, very well, but because the west continues to hamstring itself in its energy production, they are going to be in a world of hurt this winter. And we, this is a warning for the United States. We have to have a better policy, so we never get into this position.",

We should be producing more here, but the Europeans are going to have to adopt a different energy posture going forward. Two, who's losing? Seven, eight months ago this conversation, there was a lot of consternation in our conversation about what the administration should be doing or not be doing. There were those that thought that the president was moving too slowly. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. It turns out they were far more right than wrong. There 70, 80, 70 to 80,000 Russians have been killed. They cannot call -- they cannot impose a draft to bring more soldiers into this because as Greg so aptly said, people don't want to do this. I think what Dana said is probably the most important thing is we confront this question right here, which is how the -- how India and China are perceiving Putin at this point. They have been allies of his. India has been on the sidelines, which you can construe as being an ally in this -- in this effort. And China, and the China's leader and Russia's leader got together seven months ago and said there was a limitless nature to their relationship. And then China's leader said, no, I'm I need to back that up a little bit. This is not going as we thought. The question now becomes what happens? What is the -- what is the negotiated out to this? I can't imagine Zelenskyy is going to give up any land. He shouldn't. And it's hard to stomach, to Greg's point, how does Putin look at people in the face there in Russian say we did all of this. We lost all of these troops. We were exposed to not have the military people thought we had, but we're going to back up now. We're at the hard point now, and it will take the Blinkens and the others of the world and our diplomacy corps to help figure out how we get out of this.",

And it's a -- it's a corporate policy that's being instituted in some companies, mainly large companies, because they can -- they can shoulder the burden that small companies can't. This policy exists independent of its shareholders and its customers. It actually gets between them, right? It shifts the attention onto social justice and climate issue, again, to your point, putting politics over profits. So, if I were a shareholder, I would be livid. I would sell my stock immediately. I would only invest in companies that do not participate in this. There's another little uglier part going on here. Unilever is like a really, really, really wealthy person who brags about giving to charity, even though it's a tiny percentage, they never give enough to feel it. So, what they're asking and demanding of other companies, they can't do. So, all these -- all these big giant companies, they are virtue signaling. They're saying, look how good we are. We care about social issues, and we care about -- they're only doing it to cover their asses and we know that. That's all this -- that's all the woke corporate policy is, it's to keep the activism out of their front and backyard. This is a virtue signal, just like a super expensive graduate degree is for a wealthy person, a wealthy dumb person who wants to buy a degree so they look super smart. That's all this is. This makes them look compassionate. That's -- it's like a six-figure liberal arts degree that a rich kid gets and then they get their debt canceled and we end up paying. That's what ESG is.

Border patrol doesn't have enough agents to process. These folks are completely overwhelmed and this situation is completely deteriorating. It's essentially a free for all. If people can get across the river. They can just walk in. This was a single massive group of about 167 people who crossed almost all of them. Single adults.

Then they said they're mad at our border Doocy because DeSantis leaked to him. They told him that he was going to do the flights to Martha's Vineyard. I mean, at least DeSantis tells them that he's doing this. Biden just flies them anywhere. Doesn't tell anybody what he's doing. He does it in secret. And then they complained about the lack of nuance. They're saying that he focuses too much on the number of the migrants. And instead of explaining the root causes of the situation. Now I've heard the border Doocy explained the root causes and he says the causes are coming from the White House. They designated all the Trump border policies. They'd stopped building the border wall and they've encouraged them to come over and they're giving them free bus passes and free plane tickets. The bottom line is this.

You only criticize, and Dana has a much more informed perspective on this, but politicians who criticize the press should only be critical. It should say they're -- there's only credibility behind a criticism. If you're saying you're not telling the whole story. There's a part of the story I like for you guys to uncover, here's some additional information. There's no additional information here. We have a national security crisis at our border. I do wish, that instead of directing anger at reporters, and every president has a reporter or a couple of reporters they don't like because oftentimes they're asking questions that are irritating. And if you would just answer the question, maybe -- maybe the question would indeed go away. But we don't have a policy at our border and we need one. It's a national security threat and we ought to treat it at that. I've said before, I believe we should build a wall. I believe we should invest in that hemisphere. I believe we should have a streamline asylum process to make it where everyone coming here doesn't believe they're going to get in, just because they have a story that is horrifying and gut wrenching. We need to have a transparent, immigration system that spells out for every migrant or immigrant that comes here. How you achieve legal citizenship. Think about the people who waited five, seven, 10, 15 years to get in the country. Did it legally. Watching this it's a front to them. It's front and a front to the country, a front to our values. And there's no policy that anyone can articulate. Please, don't -- and don't criticize Bill Melugin. Get us a policy at the border."

But this is a, I think this is a good sign for Ukraine because I don't think millions of Russians are going to be happy that their fathers and their brothers and their sons who were reservists, who may have retired are being called back in to fight in the Ukraine. That's the other thing. I don't think it's comforting to know that your Russian soldiers may not be coming back anytime soon. I mean, you're like, they're not even letting the ones that are there come back unless they're dead. So, this has got to, I mean, to this from a morale perspective, and this is really an information war at this point, it's a war persuasion between two sides.

So, none of that happened. And then in the last two weeks, Putin had a pretty rough time of it. Because both the Chinese leader and the Indian leader had meetings last week with him where they said, yes, we're not for this. And you need to figure out a way to wind this down. Then he has pressure from inside his own government. The people that are saying like, how could you let this happen? You're embarrassing us on the world stage, you have to do something. So, he might say something like using a tactical nuclear weapon or worse it could be something. The HIMARS which are the -- are the weapons that we're been providing, they're extremely effective. And they can't deal with that, especially if they're trying to buy weapons from North Korea in order to fight back. However, I maintain that Putin's strongest weapon that he will use against the west he's already deploying, which is to shut off energy. And so, the Ukrainians can do very, very well, but because the west continues to hamstring itself in its energy production, they are going to be in a world of hurt this winter.

Seven, eight months ago this conversation, there was a lot of consternation in our conversation about what the administration should be doing or not be doing.

There 70, 80, 70 to 80,000 Russians have been killed. They cannot call -- they cannot impose a draft to bring more soldiers into this because as Greg so aptly said, people don't want to do this. I think what Dana said is probably the most important thing is we confront this question right here, which is how the -- how India and China are perceiving Putin at this point. They have been allies of his. India has been on the sidelines, which you can construe as being an ally in this -- in this effort. And China, and the China's leader and Russia's leader got together seven months ago and said there was a limitless nature to their relationship. And then China's leader said, no, I'm I need to back that up a little bit. This is not going as we thought. The question now becomes what happens? What is the -- what is the negotiated out to this? I can't imagine Zelenskyy is going to give up any land. He shouldn't. And it's hard to stomach, to Greg's point, how does Putin look at people in the face there in Russian say we did all of this. We lost all of these troops. We were exposed to not have the military people thought we had, but we're going to back up now. We're at the hard point now, and it will take the Blinkens and the others of the world and our diplomacy corps to help figure out how we get out of this."

It's hard to fight insurgency. Look at the American colonists. Look at the Viet col, look at the Afghans. When you're fighting for your own survival in your own backyard and you do have some weapons, you can put a hurting on these invaders. But if I were Putin, I'd say whatever I wanted to say, you could just lie. What are they going to do? Impeach you? What are you worried about your next election? Come on.

Because, for example, if a company does not take, doesn't allow for reimbursement of travel for an abortion, the employees at that company might declare it a hostile work environment. And then in the ESG guidelines, you can get docked. And that hurts the company. Or you're like Delta Airlines.

And it's a -- it's a corporate policy that's being instituted in some companies, mainly large companies, because they can -- they can shoulder the burden that small companies can't. This policy exists independent of its shareholders and its customers. It actually gets between them, right? It shifts the attention onto social justice and climate issue, again, to your point, putting politics over profits. So, if I were a shareholder, I would be livid. I would sell my stock immediately. I would only invest in companies that do not participate in this. There's another little uglier part going on here. Unilever is like a really, really, really wealthy person who brags about giving to charity, even though it's a tiny percentage, they never give enough to feel it. So, what they're asking and demanding of other companies, they can't do. So, all these -- all these big giant companies, they are virtue signaling. They're saying, look how good we are. We care about social issues, and we care about -- they're only doing it to cover their asses and we know that. That's all this -- that's all the woke corporate policy is, it's to keep the activism out of their front and backyard. This is a virtue signal, just like a super expensive graduate degree is for a wealthy person, a wealthy dumb person who wants to buy a degree so they look super smart. That's all this is. This makes them look compassionate. That's -- it's like a six-figure liberal arts degree that a rich kid gets and then they get their debt canceled and we end up paying. That's what ESG is.
