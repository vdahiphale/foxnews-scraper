I don't think people are trying to discredit Mueller so much as what happened last week is we got a lot of news and information that is discrediting to Mueller and the FBI and the special counsel. It's not just all these people who are expressing extreme partisan bias but it's the way they're talking about it.  You have these texts from the chief investigator talking about an insurance policy and how we couldn't take the risk of a Donald Trump presidency. Today \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that was in fact talking about the Russia operation. So this has been a very bad time for the FBI and for the special counsel.   So instead of dealing with that or covering it, some media outlets aren't even covering it. Instead they put forth this talking point, oh, Donald Trump is going to try and fire Bob Mueller. I don't think that's going to happen because Bob Mueller could not be weaker right now and firing him wouldn't make much sense. But using it as a talking point to deflect from the real thing that's going on which is more information about the problems with their initial investigation, that's why we're talking about it.",

      "utterance": "Not so much at the moment. But yet certainly you talk to anybody, and Jim Mattis has said this before, the national debt is a concern. The one thing I would add, though, on the national security strategy at the end of year Trump has had a pretty good year battling ISIS. And he mentioned this in the speech. And it has gone largely unremarked and unreported that the success that the Trump administration has had against ISIS, rolling them back across the globe, it's been one of his, probably one of the high points of his administration thus far."

This is good for your state and this is good for the country. So I spent a lot of time on the Capitol, and the Hill, talking with, I have great respect for Senator Collins, great respect for Senator Corker. I'm so glad that he came around and gave his vote."

As you see here, John McCain back in Arizona, he won't be here for the vote likely tomorrow night in the Senate Michael Lee announcing support today. Jeff Flake not there yet, but you do the math, Mara, and they're there."

I think they've got the tax bill. And it would be extraordinary if Republicans couldn't pass tax cuts. It's kind of about as deep in their DNA as anything else."

And it fulfills a lot of campaign promises -- cutting taxes, fixing the tax code, doing something about Obamacare, and bringing jobs back to America. So this should not be understated, and I think Republican voters have not been very excited. This gives them something to be excited about."
