We're on top of that, on top of so many other developments, including Sunny Isles Beach in Florida, where they are preparing right now for a hurricane.  We're also on top of the storm over that virus, the coronavirus aid, and just exactly how much Democrats and Republicans will be able to make progress this weekend, word just in now that they do plan to meet -- that is, some of the premier players -- tomorrow morning at the Capitol. We will follow all of that.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  And a good deal of focus right now on a hurricane that is barreling in on Florida right now and may hug the Florida coast and the East Coast as well. It's too soon to say for sure. But we know Phil Keating has been following it closely. Phil joins us now from Florida.  Hey, Phil.",

And hurricane hunters who flew through the storm system earlier say it is getting more organized.   Down in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, they're only expecting tropical storm impact down there, but strong winds and strong rain. However, other counties, like Palm Beach County, are in fact in a hurricane watch. It will be impacting South Florida right around early tomorrow morning. And then Sunday morning early, the eye of the storm should be due east behind us up here on the Space Coast. That's the situation right here in Cocoa Beach. Isaias is forecast to skim the entire Florida Peninsula and mostly remain in the Atlantic all the way until making landfall in North Carolina's Outer Banks next week.   Parts of Florida are now under a hurricane watch, like I mentioned. As of last night at 5:00 a.m., many state coronavirus testing sites broke down and packed up due to the storm threat. Today, a fourth straight record-breaking day for COVID-19 fatalities. Today's new case numbers show 257 deaths and about 9,000 new cases. That makes it the sixth straight day for Florida reporting fewer than 10,000 new cases, which is possible positive news, in that the state may now finally be plateauing. As for the storm, Florida's governor addressed the state from the emergency operations center.",

The beaches in Miami-Dade County today closed to the public. They will remain that way tomorrow as well.

We have gotten no word right now from NASA whether they will bump that back or move to another location, if they can pinpoint a new location that might be in calmer waters.

      "sentences": "Well, I tell you, I can't -- those guys have a much higher and more important job than I do pinpointing where that thing is going to land, especially right when they're in the middle of a hurricane right off the Florida coast.  This is a storm right now, a 75 mile-an-hour storm. That's the threshold for it to be a hurricane vs. a tropical storm. And it's pulling off towards the northwest. We have a very interesting feature in the U.S. And that is, we have a coastline that kind of mimics the transit path of a lot of tropical storms and hurricanes, especially as they move off towards the north.  They generally deflect off towards the north and eventually towards the east because of the rotation of the Earth. We also have a coastline here that can have that exact same coastline where we see those storms take that path, obviously, a lot of times. And you see that when you look at all of our tropical models. Now, it's going to be right offshore. That means we can't say exactly 10 miles one way or another which -- where this goes. And that means very different impacts, especially across the coast of Florida.   You see the center of the cone when you're in tomorrow right off the coast of Palm Beach. If it goes a little bit closer, we will have more impacts in the way very strong wind, maybe a little bit of storm surge, definitely some rough seas. Now, the right side of that storm is always the worst side of the storm, where we see more of the rain, more of that storm surge. And, hopefully, if this verifies, we will see most of that stay offshore.  That said, just offshore is right where we have the area that saw Hurricane Dorian last year in the Bahamas and all of the problems here. Now, go forward into Monday we have got the storm somewhere off the South Carolina coast -- South Carolina coastline, and, into Tuesday, possibly making landfall somewhere around the Outer Banks.  Also very possible, it just hugs it a little bit farther towards the east and stays offshore. Nonetheless, we're going to see some conditions very unfavorable for being in the water and potentially some pretty strong storm surge, and also possibly some damage here. So, because the storm is just tracking that exact coastline, we're going to watch it really closely. And anybody in the beach needs to be watching. We do have the hurricane watch, as Phil was just saying, in across areas of Florida. The storm takes a little bit of a left turn there or a left path, I should say, and we will have much bigger impacts across Florida. It is too close to call. If you're in Florida, you need to be watching that this weekend.   If you're in South Carolina, North Carolina. Monday, into Tuesday, we will be having the storm on your shore -- Neil.",

So, in some ways, things are good along those lines. But if we do have to open up shelters, we have made a lot of arrangements to try to accommodate social distancing. We have brought -- we will have people wear masks. We will do some screening. We will have hand sanitizing stations throughout the shelters. We have done other arrangements to minimize congestion -- or congregation, I should say, within the shelters.

There's not a lot of optimism on either side, though, that they will be able to do it. Mark Meadows saying earlier today that he had Mnuchin yesterday floated four proposals to Pelosi and Schumer, including a one-week extension of the current $600 enhancement for unemployment insurance, and all of those were rejected.  As for the president, he touched down in Tampa, Florida, just a short time ago. He's got a number of events there. He has got a fund-raiser with sheriffs, and then he's got a fund-raiser with other supporters in the evening. That will be a dinner fund-raiser. And then he's got a roundtable on coronavirus response and storm preparedness. Hurricane Isaias is not expected to make a direct hit on Florida, though it could plow into the Carolinas on Tuesday.

And here's what I know. They're going to -- they will demand, even if Microsoft does buy TikTok -- and, by the way, it's unclear if they're going to buy the whole thing. I mean, it's hard to just buy the U.S. portion, because that's only 80 million users, as opposed to the 800 million users that are global. Is it just the U.S. portion? But there's going to have to be -- whatever they buy, U.S. or the whole thing, it's going to have to be -- it's going to have to be like a clean break from the Chinese. We should point out that, if you buy -- the whole thing is valued -- and this is loosely, just talking to bankers -- at something like $120 billion. We should point out, if I just looked on Microsoft's balance sheet, they do have about $130 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities, which they can convert into cash, to make this purchase. So, it's -- they could do it. They got the cash on the balance sheet. The real question is, for Microsoft, does ByteDance want to sell at all? Do they want to sell just the U.S.? It seems that they just want to sell the U.S. If they just want to sell the U.S., is that enough for Microsoft to play in this space? Because ByteDance is still going to have 720 million users. Facebook is getting into the game. They want to go global as well. Does Microsoft want to invest in this business to go global as well? So there's a lot of questions to be answered, including the national security question. I am telling you, the Trump administration -- if you listen to President Trump earlier today, he kind of talked around it. He says, we're talking about a number of options. This is like one of the options they're talking about. This is going to have to pass serious muster with the Trump administration.",

We only saw it in the Sunbelt, meaning that it was not from the protests. Now, some might have been.

And it seems, as I was raising with the doctor, Karl, that every time we do resume that sort of stuff, there are predictable spikes. I guess we have got to decide what's acceptable in the spike department. But how do you think the president's faring through this?",

And from a rhetorical standpoint, I wish that had been there two months ago and three months ago. I did think, at the hearing today, it was very interesting. One of the Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee on COVID was pressing Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, on what more should we be doing now? And it was very interesting, because they said we're doing everything we should be doing now. These are not easy situations. There's no simple formula. But we're doing everything. Everything that should be done is being done now, both of them. I mean, that's a strong defense of the administration's perspective. So, this is a difficult time for the president, but he's got to continue to say, here's what I have done, here's what I'm doing, here's what -- the challenges I have faced in all of this. And -- but he's also got to, at the appropriate time, not every day, but at appropriate time, say, and here's the contrast with my opponent. And he's got two lines of attack on Biden. One is to say, here are the bad things they did. They got rid of the pandemic office. They left us the covered bare of PPE in the National Strategic Stockpile. Their own director of the H1N1 response said they bungled it and it was good that they that it wasn't a more dangerous disease and wasn't more widespread, because they bungled the response to it and Ron Klain. So there's that line of attack. And then, second of all, there's a line of attack that was made available to him by Biden himself. Last week, he was asked by Joy Reid on her new MSNBC program, inaugural guest. He trashes the president. She says, well, if you get elected, it may still be going on. So what would you do differently? He lists six things, every one of which is being done by the administration already, everything from using the Defense Production Act, to appointing a commissioner to be in charge of production and distribution of vaccines. All six items that he talked about were already being done. So he doesn't have a clue as to what additional he would do that isn't be done today.",

And hurricane hunters who flew through the storm system earlier say it is getting more organized. Down in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, they're only expecting tropical storm impact down there, but strong winds and strong rain. However, other counties, like Palm Beach County, are in fact in a hurricane watch. It will be impacting South Florida right around early tomorrow morning. And then Sunday morning early, the eye of the storm should be due east behind us up here on the Space Coast. That's the situation right here in Cocoa Beach. Isaias is forecast to skim the entire Florida Peninsula and mostly remain in the Atlantic all the way until making landfall in North Carolina's Outer Banks next week. Parts of Florida are now under a hurricane watch, like I mentioned. As of last night at 5:00 a.m., many state coronavirus testing sites broke down and packed up due to the storm threat. Today, a fourth straight record-breaking day for COVID-19 fatalities. Today's new case numbers show 257 deaths and about 9,000 new cases. That makes it the sixth straight day for Florida reporting fewer than 10,000 new cases, which is possible positive news, in that the state may now finally be plateauing.

The beaches in Miami-Dade County today closed to the public. They will remain that way tomorrow as well.

We have gotten no word right now from NASA whether they will bump that back or move to another location, if they can pinpoint a new location that might be in calmer waters. Rick Reichmuth might know.

      "utterance": "Well, I tell you, I can't -- those guys have a much higher and more important job than I do pinpointing where that thing is going to land, especially right when they're in the middle of a hurricane right off the Florida coast. This is a storm right now, a 75 mile-an-hour storm. That's the threshold for it to be a hurricane vs. a tropical storm. And it's pulling off towards the northwest. We have a very interesting feature in the U.S. And that is, we have a coastline that kind of mimics the transit path of a lot of tropical storms and hurricanes, especially as they move off towards the north. They generally deflect off towards the north and eventually towards the east because of the rotation of the Earth. We also have a coastline here that can have that exact same coastline where we see those storms take that path, obviously, a lot of times. And you see that when you look at all of our tropical models. Now, it's going to be right offshore. That means we can't say exactly 10 miles one way or another which -- where this goes. And that means very different impacts, especially across the coast of Florida. You see the center of the cone when you're in tomorrow right off the coast of Palm Beach. If it goes a little bit closer, we will have more impacts in the way very strong wind, maybe a little bit of storm surge, definitely some rough seas. Now, the right side of that storm is always the worst side of the storm, where we see more of the rain, more of that storm surge. And, hopefully, if this verifies, we will see most of that stay offshore. That said, just offshore is right where we have the area that saw Hurricane Dorian last year in the Bahamas and all of the problems here. Now, go forward into Monday we have got the storm somewhere off the South Carolina coast -- South Carolina coastline, and, into Tuesday, possibly making landfall somewhere around the Outer Banks. Also very possible, it just hugs it a little bit farther towards the east and stays offshore. Nonetheless, we're going to see some conditions very unfavorable for being in the water and potentially some pretty strong storm surge, and also possibly some damage here. So, because the storm is just tracking that exact coastline, we're going to watch it really closely. And anybody in the beach needs to be watching. We do have the hurricane watch, as Phil was just saying, in across areas of Florida. The storm takes a little bit of a left turn there or a left path, I should say, and we will have much bigger impacts across Florida. It is too close to call. If you're in Florida, you need to be watching that this weekend. If you're in South Carolina, North Carolina. Monday, into Tuesday, we will be having the storm on your shore -- Neil."

So, in some ways, things are good along those lines. But if we do have to open up shelters, we have made a lot of arrangements to try to accommodate social distancing. We have brought -- we will have people wear masks. We will do some screening. We will have hand sanitizing stations throughout the shelters. We have done other arrangements to minimize congestion -- or congregation, I should say, within the shelters.

As for the president, he touched down in Tampa, Florida, just a short time ago. He's got a number of events there. He has got a fund-raiser with sheriffs, and then he's got a fund-raiser with other supporters in the evening. That will be a dinner fund-raiser. And then he's got a roundtable on coronavirus response and storm preparedness. Hurricane Isaias is not expected to make a direct hit on Florida, though it could plow into the Carolinas on Tuesday.

And that's why we're trying to -- trying to do this bill in a targeted way, and why we have really had trouble negotiating with Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats, is because they seem stuck on their $3 trillion bill. And we have got to use the funds that we appropriated under the CARES Act, and then, in a targeted way, address the additional needs. So, I'm willing to work on it. I am working on it. But they have got to start negotiating with us."

I'm told that some of your colleagues are kicking around the idea of a reduced benefit, maybe by $100, $200, and then, 30 days, look at that again. I believe that was a Mitt Romney plan. There are others that say, just automatically lower it, but don't end it. Where are you?"

And that's the challenge we have right now. And so Democrats want to continue the $600 a month and a whole lot of other things. We're willing to negotiate. We have put a bill on the floor that would be $200 a month, and then go to approximately two-thirds or 70 percent of the replacement wage, again, trying to make sure we help people, but don't create a disincentive for work. And we just can't seem to get Democrats to engage with us on something like that, that, again, would meet the need, but do it in a way where we get people back to work and get the economy going."

We included funding to help with back to school, testing.

We are monitoring that. We are also monitoring what he might have to say about these ongoing stimulus talks regarding the virus.

It's unclear if this thing is going to happen. It is interesting that they approached Microsoft. If you notice, Microsoft was one of the companies that was new noticeably absent from the tech hearings this week."

And, as you know, every Chinese company -- TikTok may be located in the U.S. or has a U.S. subsidiary, but it answers to a Chinese parent. Every Chinese company is essentially owned and operated by the Chinese government. And, again, bipartisan support for clipping its wings, because there's people on both sides of the aisle that believe the Chinese government is using this data essentially for surveillance purposes."

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And I will tell you that the Trump administration is keenly aware of these talks. It's -- I wouldn't say they're in the room, but they have been briefed. And here's what I know. They're going to -- they will demand, even if Microsoft does buy TikTok -- and, by the way, it's unclear if they're going to buy the whole thing. I mean, it's hard to just buy the U.S. portion, because that's only 80 million users, as opposed to the 800 million users that are global. Is it just the U.S. portion? But there's going to have to be -- whatever they buy, U.S. or the whole thing, it's going to have to be -- it's going to have to be like a clean break from the Chinese. We should point out that, if you buy -- the whole thing is valued -- and this is loosely, just talking to bankers -- at something like $120 billion. We should point out, if I just looked on Microsoft's balance sheet, they do have about $130 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities, which they can convert into cash, to make this purchase. So, it's -- they could do it. They got the cash on the balance sheet. The real question is, for Microsoft, does ByteDance want to sell at all? Do they want to sell just the U.S.? It seems that they just want to sell the U.S. If they just want to sell the U.S., is that enough for Microsoft to play in this space? Because ByteDance is still going to have 720 million users. Facebook is getting into the game. They want to go global as well. Does Microsoft want to invest in this business to go global as well? So there's a lot of questions to be answered, including the national security question. I am telling you, the Trump administration -- if you listen to President Trump earlier today, he kind of talked around it. He says, we're talking about a number of options. This is like one of the options they're talking about. This is going to have to pass serious muster with the Trump administration."

I think what the congressman was getting at here, that is, Congressman Jordan, talking about the disproportionate interest in rallies and whether people are packed together, or beaches and whether they're packed together, but not much about protests and whether they're packed together. And, of course, Dr. Fauci was trying not to distinguish. A crowd is a crowd is a crowd. But it did bring up a valid point that has come up many, many times, whether we kind of pick and choose the crowds that we deem to be dangerous. Anyway, Mike Emanuel followed all of that drama on Capitol Hill. I get a sense, when every time I see Dr. Fauci, that he runs into more of a buzz saw of criticism from Republicans than Democrats.

I want to go to Dr. Marty Makary on all of this, Johns Hopkins University professor of public health and physician, \"The Price That We Pay,\" the author, bestseller, so much more. Doctor, I saw this exchange back and forth, and I guess, stepping back from the heated politics of it, maybe, a crowd is a crowd is a crowd. And I'm wondering now if the crowds that people are worrying about, about returning to school, returning to work, whether those are justified concerns right now that all this could spark again.

I think right now the issue is that which crowd is an OK crowd to be in? Is it church? Is it bars? Is it schools? Is it protests? And I think that's -- it's not very productive for us to talk about selectively anointing crowds that are OK. We know that indoor is worse than outdoor -- worse than outdoors. We know that masks are better than not wearing masks. And when you look back at the protests, even though Dr. Fauci didn't really answer the question, we saw protests nationally, but we didn't see the spike afterwards nationally. We only saw it in the Sunbelt, meaning that it was not from the protests. Now, some might have been. In Minnesota, there might have been a slight increase from the protests, but it was a national protest, and we saw steady declines in the North in the two-and-a-half -- in the month-and-a- half following the protests."

We have seen it with the return of baseball, with these Marlins players that were affected and tested positively for the virus. We saw it on the Saint Louis Cardinals, where are a number of staff members were as well -- that, as soon as you resume something, this seems to come hand in hand with it. What do we do?"

    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, we need to think about any time there's congregate settings. For example, the schools, the schools may not be the dangerous place for the kids. It may be the bus ride to the school. And we need to really think about the high-risk individuals that show up. Vulnerable populations don't just live in nursing homes. They drive buses, and they teach sometimes, and those are the folks we need to shelter. So there's a lot of factors to consider. I think right now we need to be thinking about the transmissibility, the uptick that we're seeing in the Midwest. Globally, right now, we're seeing a concerning uptick that may be a function of some recent reopenings, but it may be a snowflake before the blizzard, with a potential second wave. Japan, Israel, Hong Kong, South Korea all seeing record numbers of cases reported in the last few days. So, that's concerning. We're watching this global potential for a second wave."

Karl Rove says that both issues could dominate the campaign and the 90- some-odd days we have until the big election. Karl, always good to have you. I mean, ultimately ,the president, I would assume, is going to be judged on how this coronavirus thing is going. In the fall, we will have a lot of kids returning to school, those who will be in-person for classes, and a lot of people are returning to work. And it seems, as I was raising with the doctor, Karl, that every time we do resume that sort of stuff, there are predictable spikes. I guess we have got to decide what's acceptable in the spike department. But how do you think the president's faring through this?"

And from a rhetorical standpoint, I wish that had been there two months ago and three months ago. I did think, at the hearing today, it was very interesting. One of the Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee on COVID was pressing Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, on what more should we be doing now? And it was very interesting, because they said we're doing everything we should be doing now. These are not easy situations. There's no simple formula. But we're doing everything. Everything that should be done is being done now, both of them. I mean, that's a strong defense of the administration's perspective. So, this is a difficult time for the president, but he's got to continue to say, here's what I have done, here's what I'm doing, here's what -- the challenges I have faced in all of this. And -- but he's also got to, at the appropriate time, not every day, but at appropriate time, say, and here's the contrast with my opponent. And he's got two lines of attack on Biden. One is to say, here are the bad things they did. They got rid of the pandemic office. They left us the covered bare of PPE in the National Strategic Stockpile. Their own director of the H1N1 response said they bungled it and it was good that they that it wasn't a more dangerous disease and wasn't more widespread, because they bungled the response to it and Ron Klain. So there's that line of attack. And then, second of all, there's a line of attack that was made available to him by Biden himself. Last week, he was asked by Joy Reid on her new MSNBC program, inaugural guest. He trashes the president. She says, well, if you get elected, it may still be going on. So what would you do differently? He lists six things, every one of which is being done by the administration already, everything from using the Defense Production Act, to appointing a commissioner to be in charge of production and distribution of vaccines. All six items that he talked about were already being done. So he doesn't have a clue as to what additional he would do that isn't be done today."

But the president wants to make sure it stays that way, and that if any federal buildings or structures are compromised, those agents or soldiers or Guardsmen, whatever you want to call them, will be brought in to calm the storm. Now, the mayor of that city, the governor of that state not big fans of those moves, but we understand they have a quasi-agreement to handle this.

Congress has enacted law that says the Department of Homeland Security is supposed to protect federal installations. So he's completely in the right in that regard."

We have an election that's going to be -- that's already very contentious, and that's coming up in less than 100 days.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, just released from the hospital, she is doing well. So, we will keep track of that for you, as they will in the next hour. Also want to let you know we are monitoring these ongoing coronavirus stimulus talks. They are planned for tomorrow morning. That's when we will be live with you at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time to get the fallout from that, and whether we're any closer to a deal, a trillion- dollar-plus deal, at that.
