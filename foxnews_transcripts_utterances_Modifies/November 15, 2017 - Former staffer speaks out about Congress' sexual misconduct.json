But the refusal to identify the members accused of misconduct is I think in itself enabling. Aren't they kind of in a sense complicit in the coverup?   I know it sounds harsh. But don't they have an obligation to reveal wrong doing on the part of their colleagues especially against young, vulnerable staffers. Doesn't the leadership have something to say about this? By the way, we all have the right to know. They work for us, and we, the taxpayers are footing the bill for this absurd shush fund. You're not supposed to talk about it. We want to know the details about these settlements.  We want the time, place, and manner of the misconduct and I want the names of the members accused. It is totally unacceptable for Congress to operate under a different set of rules than everybody else, whether it's the type of health care they vote to give themselves or the amount of time off they get or the way they get to use OPM, other people's money, to pay off settlements. The American people want more transparency and accountability in government across the board. I am going to promise you this, I'm going to stay on this issue and others like it. Ours is supposed to be the government of the people, by the people and for the people, not the government of anonymous gropers.  Joining us now with reaction is M. Reese Everson, a former staffer for the Congressional Black Caucus, who accused a congressman of sexual misconduct. Reese, it is great to see you. We just really appreciate your voice here.",

I mean, Donald Trump is looking really good compared to those numbers. And last time I checked, let's face it wasn't Moore who dropped the ball on the ObamaCare repeal, and he didn't take long periods of time off out of session while they had work to do. He didn't fail to support enforcement of immigration laws. Roy Moore didn't support those absurd multilateral trade agreements that hurt the American worker. He didn't cause Ron Johnson to come out against tax reform today. And we know Moore didn't set up a slush fund for congressional miscreants involved with sexual behavior. Now that's immoral. Roy Moore will certainly hurt the GOP image in 2018. He could if he is elected and especially among some female voters. That will hurt. But before the GOP makes him the scapegoat for all that ails the party, the GOP itself needs to do some self-reflection.  What have Republicans done in the past to infuriate and alienate their own base, so much so that they actually pushed Luther Strange out of the equation and decided to go with Roy Moore and now what is the GOP going to do to try to build back its reputation? Here's the good news, no matter what people say about Republicans and the Moore side show at least they don't have someone like this running around.",

The Justice Department confirmed this week that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is considering appointing a special counsel to investigate several matters related to Hillary Clinton. One of those issues is the sale of Uranium One to a Russian-backed company back in 2010. Hillary Clinton's State Department signed off on the deal despite the fact that it gave Russia control of 20 percent of the U.S. uranium capacity. Critics alleged that Hillary OK'd the deal because of some hefty donations to the Clinton Foundation. The \"National Review's\" Andy McCarthy wrote today, \"Uranium One has never primarily been a national security controversy. It's a corruption controversy.\"  Joining us now from Tallahassee, a man who knows more about this, Peter Schweitzer is the president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of the huge bestseller \"Clinton Cash.\" So, Peter, I've noticed this happening over the last 48 hours especially. Number of people, some Republicans, some Democrats, and always the Clintons, of course, there's no there-there. This is just a fantasy cooked up in the minds of some guy who wrote a book called \"Clinton Cash\" and grabbed on to by the conservative media. Pay no attention to the scandal behind the curtain. PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR OF \"CLINTON CASH\": Yes. That's the standard line, Laura. The problem for that narrative is there is plenty of evidence. The Uranium One saga, most people are aware of this 2010 sale of Uranium One to the Russian government that was approved by the Obama administration. But the story really begins in 2005 when Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton helped this Canadian investor, Frank Giustra, who is founder of Uranium One acquire these uranium assets in Kazakhstan, which is a massive producer of uranium. And what we have in clear evidence is the video testimony of the Russian -- sorry, the Kazak minister of (inaudible), which is the Kazak atomic agency, what does he say in this video deposition? After that concession was granted by officials, Frank Giustra sent $30 million to the Clinton Foundation. We have the oral testimony by this official, it has never been disputed and he describes in detail how the deal went down and talks about a Clinton Foundation employee named Tim Philips who pressured him. When Tim Philips was asked about this video, he did not respond. He changed his online resume, removing the reference to his employment to the Clinton Foundation. That's just one piece of evidence. This is not a fantasy cooked up. This is something foreign government officials have talked about.",

Uranium One was a company when the Russians bought it and still is a company that has massive amounts around the world, in Kazakhstan, in Australia. They have them in Africa and the United States. If you were to look at the uranium they have in the United States, the 20 percent, you can say it doesn't amount to a lot. The problem is that's a small sliver of the entire assets that Uranium One represented. By the way, this is very important, Uranium One when it was bought by the Russians in 2010, the money for that deal was publicly announced by Vladimir Putin himself. And that deal was authorized by Vladimir Putin himself. So certainly, Vladimir Putin saw a national security interest from Russia's standpoint in acquiring Uranium One.",

We don't know the exact reason for the uptick, but a new study in \"The Journal of Clinical Psychological Studies\" suggests it might have something to do with the sharp rise of the use of social media. Joining us for reaction from Boston is psychotherapist Karen Ruskin, and in Green Rapids, Michigan, pediatrician Meg Meeker. Dr. Meeker, let's talk to you first.

As a matter of fact today I just talked with a young girl who is struggling with very serious depression. And depression in teenagers is very serious. How can it be related to social media? Depression in a teen is all about the self hating the self, deep down subconsciously teens don't like who they are. So we can see how being on social media, Instagram in particular, teenagers see other kids. They look at the pictures of the other kids, girls in particular, and say I'm not as thin, I'm not as pretty, I'm not as attractive as she is, and so they start to feel worse about who they are. So you know, I really see -- and I actually have had teenagers tell me that being on Instagram makes them feel worse. And so for some of the teenagers that I treat with depression, I -- with their cooperation -- actually put them on a diet from social media to guard them, if you will, from feeling worse than they already do. So for me personally I see a very clear connection between social media and teen depression.",

For example, the phone at night must not be in the room. That's the bottom line. We're still parents and we forget that sometimes. When it comes to kids and social media, the consistence and frequency of looking at social media instead of living your life, that can lead to depression, not being able to escape from the world, the bedlam of the everyday hustle-bustle of socialization. Home used to be a safe haven. It's not anymore because the appendage known as social media, the phone, comes home with you everywhere. So as a parent we must talk about with them about their social media relationship, we must talk with them about health and wellness and suicide and not be afraid to because parents are often afraid to have those hard to talk about talks.

No one running for office wants to be asked uncomfortable questions. Questions like, do you support Roy Moore with these allegations hanging over his head? Do you believe that Roy Moore should even be seated? He's going to hurt the party leaders say. So, let's cut our losses now and put Jeff Sessions back in his old seat. It's going to be a midterm election disaster for the GOP, but the more I think about it, the more I hear all of this.

Check out this congressional approval rating. It's now about 15 percent. Only 29 percent of all Americans have a positive view of the GOP. I mean, Donald Trump is looking really good compared to those numbers. And last time I checked, let's face it wasn't Moore who dropped the ball on the ObamaCare repeal, and he didn't take long periods of time off out of session while they had work to do. He didn't fail to support enforcement of immigration laws. Roy Moore didn't support those absurd multilateral trade agreements that hurt the American worker. He didn't cause Ron Johnson to come out against tax reform today. And we know Moore didn't set up a slush fund for congressional miscreants involved with sexual behavior. Now that's immoral. Roy Moore will certainly hurt the GOP image in 2018. He could if he is elected and especially among some female voters. That will hurt. But before the GOP makes him the scapegoat for all that ails the party, the GOP itself needs to do some self-reflection. What have Republicans done in the past to infuriate and alienate their own base, so much so that they actually pushed Luther Strange out of the equation and decided to go with Roy Moore and now what is the GOP going to do to try to build back its reputation? Here's the good news, no matter what people say about Republicans and the Moore side show at least they don't have someone like this running around."

It's because we only have 52 Republican senators is not enough to pass the Trump agenda. So, what we should be focused is -- there are five Democrats in 2018 running in states that Donald Trump won by double digits.

Do not go away."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. The Justice Department confirmed this week that Attorney General Jeff Sessions is considering appointing a special counsel to investigate several matters related to Hillary Clinton. One of those issues is the sale of Uranium One to a Russian-backed company back in 2010. Hillary Clinton's State Department signed off on the deal despite the fact that it gave Russia control of 20 percent of the U.S. uranium capacity. Critics alleged that Hillary OK'd the deal because of some hefty donations to the Clinton Foundation. The \"National Review's\" Andy McCarthy wrote today, \"Uranium One has never primarily been a national security controversy. It's a corruption controversy.\" Joining us now from Tallahassee, a man who knows more about this, Peter Schweitzer is the president of the Government Accountability Institute and author of the huge bestseller \"Clinton Cash.\" So, Peter, I've noticed this happening over the last 48 hours especially. Number of people, some Republicans, some Democrats, and always the Clintons, of course, there's no there-there. This is just a fantasy cooked up in the minds of some guy who wrote a book called \"Clinton Cash\" and grabbed on to by the conservative media. Pay no attention to the scandal behind the curtain. PETER SCHWEIZER, AUTHOR OF \"CLINTON CASH\": Yes. That's the standard line, Laura. The problem for that narrative is there is plenty of evidence. The Uranium One saga, most people are aware of this 2010 sale of Uranium One to the Russian government that was approved by the Obama administration. But the story really begins in 2005 when Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton helped this Canadian investor, Frank Giustra, who is founder of Uranium One acquire these uranium assets in Kazakhstan, which is a massive producer of uranium. And what we have in clear evidence is the video testimony of the Russian -- sorry, the Kazak minister of (inaudible), which is the Kazak atomic agency, what does he say in this video deposition? After that concession was granted by officials, Frank Giustra sent $30 million to the Clinton Foundation. We have the oral testimony by this official, it has never been disputed and he describes in detail how the deal went down and talks about a Clinton Foundation employee named Tim Philips who pressured him. When Tim Philips was asked about this video, he did not respond. He changed his online resume, removing the reference to his employment to the Clinton Foundation. That's just one piece of evidence. This is not a fantasy cooked up. This is something foreign government officials have talked about."

    {
      "speaker": "CHWEIZER",
      "utterance": "Well, I would respectfully disagree with Andy. I have enormous respect for him. What's happening is a lot of people think Uranium One was totally about the uranium in the United States. The United States is not a big uranium producer. The problem is that's not true. Uranium One was a company when the Russians bought it and still is a company that has massive amounts around the world, in Kazakhstan, in Australia. They have them in Africa and the United States. If you were to look at the uranium they have in the United States, the 20 percent, you can say it doesn't amount to a lot. The problem is that's a small sliver of the entire assets that Uranium One represented. By the way, this is very important, Uranium One when it was bought by the Russians in 2010, the money for that deal was publicly announced by Vladimir Putin himself. And that deal was authorized by Vladimir Putin himself. So certainly, Vladimir Putin saw a national security interest from Russia's standpoint in acquiring Uranium One."

I think there is actually a good argument to be made that you really don't need a special prosecutor, that I think if we believe in the Justice Department if they would actually pursue possible crimes, intimidation of witnesses, bribery, all the things we are hearing about when it comes to the Clintons and this stuff, you can get a great line prosecutor to do this with a great staff. But we have a lot of people, Jim Jordan, they want a special prosecutor, another special prosecutor to investigate this."

We know for a fact the FBI has in its possession another tape, an audiotape that was basically recorded by this FBI informant that's going to be coming forward. I have not heard the tape but I've heard about the tape from people at the FBI, and that audiotape apparently is Russian officials with this uranium company talking about making donations to the Clinton Foundation to gain favorable action. That tape was given to Department of Justice prosecutors, the FBI field office requesting the ability to wiretap and to survey the Clinton Foundation. The Obama Justice Department came back and said no, not enough evidence. My point with an independent counsel, Laura, is, look, this is so political, I think the way to deal with this is precisely in this manner. It's important. It's complex. It goes to the reason people think there is so much corruption in Washington, D.C. and the fact that there is a double standard, some people are held to account and others are not."

And the lawsuits claim that concert organizes, the hotel, and the manufacturers of the bump stock gun accessory all share blame for the incident. But there remain unanswered questions. What was the killer's motive? Why does the police timeline of the incident keep changing? Why were explosives in Paddock's car? And what was on the hard drive now missing from a computer found in Paddock's hotel room? And we're just getting started with the questions. Joining us now for reaction is Mark Fuhrman, a former LAPD detective, and in Las Vegas Randy Sutton, former lieutenant in the Vegas police department. Great to see both of you. Let's start with you, Randy. First of all, I have a curious thought. Is there anything to the fact that the investigation task force designation has changed? It started as in the homicide task force.

They would be the normal investigative team that would do this. They have the experience. They have the know-how. They have the technology. But for some reason allegedly there was an accidental discharge when the advance team, when the initial entry team went into the hotel room. And that is the -- any type of use of force by law enforcement officers is handled by what is called the FIT, the Force Investigative Team. And this is a small unit that handles officer-involved shootings and major uses of force. For some reason, and I've got to tell you it's inexplicable to me and to the members of the homicide detail who are literally up in arms over it, the main thrust of the investigation was taken away from homicide."

The sheriff, the FBI assistant directors, ATF, they do not do these homicide investigations and they weren't at the scene. So I would be up in arms if I was one of these homicide detectives also.

How does a hard drive jump out of a car? He shot himself -- excuse me, in the room. He shot himself in the room but the hard drive disappeared at some point I guess after he shot himself. Who leaked the photos of the crime scene, and why were they leaked? When he fell backward the tripod that he was shooting from, Mark, fell on his shin. That's kind of an odd -- if you are shot, why does -- it just -- some odd stuff. I'm sorry, I'm always putting my sleuth hat on. Maybe I'm just a frustrated former detective.

      "utterance": "Thanks for staying with us. There's a new study out that's warning of the possible deadly consequences for teens using social media. Teen suicide rites had been declining for decades, but new data from the Centers for Disease Control shows that the numbers went up between 2010 and 2015. We don't know the exact reason for the uptick, but a new study in \"The Journal of Clinical Psychological Studies\" suggests it might have something to do with the sharp rise of the use of social media. Joining us for reaction from Boston is psychotherapist Karen Ruskin, and in Green Rapids, Michigan, pediatrician Meg Meeker. Dr. Meeker, let's talk to you first. What have you seen in your clinical practice on this issue? Do you see a connection between social media and these types of pathological or suicidal tendencies?"

      "speaker": "MEG MEEKER, MD, PEDIATRICIAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, first of all, thanks for having me on, Laura. I'm so glad that you brought this up, and I do see a connection between teen depression and social media in my practice. As a matter of fact today I just talked with a young girl who is struggling with very serious depression. And depression in teenagers is very serious. How can it be related to social media? Depression in a teen is all about the self hating the self, deep down subconsciously teens don't like who they are. So we can see how being on social media, Instagram in particular, teenagers see other kids. They look at the pictures of the other kids, girls in particular, and say I'm not as thin, I'm not as pretty, I'm not as attractive as she is, and so they start to feel worse about who they are. So you know, I really see -- and I actually have had teenagers tell me that being on Instagram makes them feel worse. And so for some of the teenagers that I treat with depression, I -- with their cooperation -- actually put them on a diet from social media to guard them, if you will, from feeling worse than they already do. So for me personally I see a very clear connection between social media and teen depression."

      "utterance": "Dr. Ruskin, I have a daughter who is 12. And she said when are you going to get a phone? And I said how does never sound to you? I'm literally going to do everything I can. I borrow friends' phones. But I'm petrified of this. And I guess I'm the boring mother -- I'm petrified of it. And maybe I'm wrong to be petrified of it. But I find what I see among kids, it's not good. It's not good."

      "speaker": "KAREN RUSKIN, PSYCHOTHERAPIST",
      "utterance": "You're not wrong, Laura. And the fact is, as parents -- as a parent, myself, of a teenager, and as a psychotherapist, it's imperative that we create ground rules for social media. For example, the phone at night must not be in the room. That's the bottom line. We're still parents and we forget that sometimes. When it comes to kids and social media, the consistence and frequency of looking at social media instead of living your life, that can lead to depression, not being able to escape from the world, the bedlam of the everyday hustle-bustle of socialization. Home used to be a safe haven. It's not anymore because the appendage known as social media, the phone, comes home with you everywhere. So as a parent we must talk about with them about their social media relationship, we must talk with them about health and wellness and suicide and not be afraid to because parents are often afraid to have those hard to talk about talks. And if you are afraid to talk about it, your kid is going to be afraid to talk about it."

      "speaker": "SEAN PARKER, CO-FOUNDER OF FACEBOOK",
      "utterance": "That thought process was all about how do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible. And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while. It's a social validation feedback loop that it's exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with because you're exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Quick reaction from both of you. Dr. Meeker, Sean Parker, he knows technology. What is your thought?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEEKER",
      "utterance": "He does. And you know it's very dangerous and very addictive. And I want to say something. First of all, never parent out of fear. Parents are so afraid to pull social media out of their kids' lives, to make their kids put the phone in the kitchen plugged in at nighttime, so afraid to tell their kids, look, half an hour of social media a day is all you get. But let me tell you something, your kids are worth fighting for. My kids are adults now and I was very strict with screen time which was TV in those days, and they are so grateful. If you can be strong enough to parent well and say to your kids, look, these are my rules, my phone, no privacy, we need to restrict social media, you will be doing your kid such an enormous favor. So don't be afraid. Do what's right for your kids."

    {
      "speaker": "RUSKIN",
      "utterance": "Human beings by our very nature, we are addictive, we are impulsive, we are reactive. So definitely there is allure in social media. As parents it's all about helping kids to create a healthy balance because social media has its advantages. It's just about having a healthy balance. Extremism in any direction is unhealthy. We must control or controllables."

      "utterance": "If your friends on the left were smiling today, it may be because of a new political poll. Check it out. It has Joe Biden beating President Trump by 11 points in a way too early look at the 2020 election cycle. Already 2020? Democrats, you may want to hit the brakes on old Joe given the most notable trend in coverage lately, the Weinstein-Clinton period we find ourselves in. Biden's past isn't nearly as sordid as Clinton's, of course. But as the former V.P. calls for society to better police sexual harassment, we can't help reminding everyone of Biden's, well, outreach over the years."

How old are you? Sixteen. You've got big dogs around the house. I would say you have a very hard job. My dad used to say you got one job. I have a beautiful sister like you guys.

And as I write in \"Billionaire at the Barricades,\" the man who has been running for president since I was in college just a few years ago, and nothing would cement the Democrat party's dinosaur status quite like a Biden bid. I think is a Latin term for this this -- Tyrannosaurus Amtrak. Remember he always took the Amtrak back and forth. That's it for us tonight.
