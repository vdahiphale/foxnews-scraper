ALBERTO GONZALES, DEAN, BELMONT LAW SCHOOL/FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Well, clearly, the president did not comply with this 30-day notice requirement. And I think members of Congress should be outraged, quite frankly, without a clear explanation from the administration as to the reasons why.  You know, but there is a legitimate question, from my perspective, as to whether or not 30-day notice requirement is constitutional --",

However, I will say this. Claims that perhaps Bergdahl was likely to be killed in the immediate future seemed kind of strange to me, because is he a very valuable commodity for the Taliban. This is someone they would want to maintain to be alive because, as we saw, they received great value for his life, which were these five Taliban leaders.
