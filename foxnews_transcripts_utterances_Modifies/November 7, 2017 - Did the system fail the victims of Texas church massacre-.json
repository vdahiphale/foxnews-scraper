This is the last creature on earth. This is a mistake that rivals fort hood, 26 lives are dead because somebody dropped the ball. This is exactly like the Nada Hassan.

Now if he'd served five years which was the minimum for doing something like this, he would have still been locked up and wouldn't have been able to go on this shooting spree. And the 12 month confinement automatically triggers no handgun or rifle purchases. So why was it a bad conduct discharge instead of a dishonorable discharge? If it was dishonorable, which it was, beating infants and women, that should have, again, triggered a ban on purchasing weapons. And then if you, you know, caught escaping from a mental facility. That's obviously, this guy is a total maniac. So there're already gun control laws and legal remedies in place to prevent this guy from purchasing a weapon. But because of human error and bad judgment, this guy was allowed to go on a rampage. And then for the media to say that this is all about gun control, I mean, it's like shooting first and asking questions later. And if the answer is more gun control, they're asking the wrong questions. There are already gun-control laws in place. So they're so out of touch, especially this woman up there asking the president a question, so out of touch with the American people to ask something like that. It really makes me angry. The media's reaction of the recent tragedies if you just look at it has been so off-base. The Las Vegas shooter. What was the reaction there? Band silencers? What is that have to do with anything? How about the NYC terror attack? They're talking about Islamophobia. And then you remember what happened with the hurricanes, they're talking about Melania's heels and global warming.

I'm actually confused about the idea for talks, because it was just a couple of months ago that he said talks were useless with North Korea. So perhaps this is a bit about being unpredictable or it's just saying something different in South Korea because it helps the South Koreans deal with their neighbors to the north. Maybe that's what China is asking for. Perhaps this is all part of some grand strategy. Maybe he'll explain it more tonight at 9 p.m.  The thing about -- because President Trump has a speech. The thing about Secretary Kerry saying that Trump has given North Korea the reason to have a nuclear weapon reminds me of the phrase that any time you talk about going after radical Islamic terrorism, that the left would scream, but this is what ISIS wants. This is what al Qaeda wants. No, actually, want they want is to destroy western civilization.

Now, wages are flat and a lot of the rural areas in the state have not really seen the jobs that the rest of the state has. GDP growth, 0.6 percent last year. National average was about 1.5 percent, so not very good. Now crime, 484 murders in the state last year. That's, I think, a high of 20 years, hasn't been that bad. Violent crime, rape and robbery, all up over the last five years. And the gun issue, who got an \"F\" from the NRA? Northam. MS-13, there's been a lot of misinformation. Almost 2,000 MS-13 gang members alone in Fairfax County. You mentioned it the other day. There's a bunch of MS-13 gang members on trial for killing teenagers in that state. It's terrible.

But I want to take this whole thing in its entirety. This guy fractured an infant's skull, he escaped from a mental hospital, he beat up a puppy. These are all markers of the kind of person who should not be allowed to have weapons. This guy was caught sneaking firearms into his airbase. He was attempting to carry out death threats against his chain of command. We are told to see something and say something. Nobody did anything. How did this guy get a gun? This is the last creature on earth. This is a mistake that rivals fort hood, 26 lives are dead because somebody dropped the ball. This is exactly like the Nada Hassan. They knew that this was a bad egg and they didn't do anything. They tell us when you see something, say something, but then nobody does anything because nobody wants to get in trouble.

And so then, when there are cries of do something, well, do something would be not necessarily pass new laws but how about just enforce the laws that are on the books. Senator Cornyn today actually had to introduce legislation that said, hey, tell you what, it'd be a great idea if everybody that has information on criminal convictions could upload that to the background check system. How about we do that? I mean, if that doesn't pass by a voice vote tomorrow it's an outrage."

The air force is a great institution, saves countless lives patrolling the skies, but they lost two dozen this week.

Now if he'd served five years which was the minimum for doing something like this, he would have still been locked up and wouldn't have been able to go on this shooting spree. And the 12 month confinement automatically triggers no handgun or rifle purchases. So why was it a bad conduct discharge instead of a dishonorable discharge? If it was dishonorable, which it was, beating infants and women, that should have, again, triggered a ban on purchasing weapons. And then if you, you know, caught escaping from a mental facility. That's obviously, this guy is a total maniac. So there're already gun control laws and legal remedies in place to prevent this guy from purchasing a weapon. But because of human error and bad judgment, this guy was allowed to go on a rampage. And then for the media to say that this is all about gun control, I mean, it's like shooting first and asking questions later. And if the answer is more gun control, they're asking the wrong questions. There are already gun-control laws in place. So they're so out of touch, especially this woman up there asking the president a question, so out of touch with the American people to ask something like that. It really makes me angry. The media's reaction of the recent tragedies if you just look at it has been so off-base. The Las Vegas shooter. What was the reaction there? Band silencers? What is that have to do with anything? How about the NYC terror attack? They're talking about Islamophobia. And then you remember what happened with the hurricanes, they're talking about Melania's heels and global warming.

We house under 50,000 people who are dangerously or mentally ill. That's about -- it's a 95 percent drop when you factor in the doubling of the population of the general population. We don't have a place to put these people long-term because we've made that a toxic decision.

We talked about the solution of hardening soft targets. You hardened soft targets through the training of individuals. In Israel, when there are terror attacks, they advised citizens there to arm their houses because there people with knives that comes to their houses. They train the population to respond to threats. That was a man who didn't have to think. And that's why he responded heroically. That's why -- even though he was terrified, it was ingrained in his skull of what to do."

I'm actually confused about the idea for talks, because it was just a couple of months ago that he said talks were useless with North Korea. So perhaps this is a bit about being unpredictable or it's just saying something different in South Korea because it helps the South Koreans deal with their neighbors to the north. Maybe that's what China is asking for. Perhaps this is all part of some grand strategy. Maybe he'll explain it more tonight at 9 p.m. The thing about -- because President Trump has a speech. The thing about Secretary Kerry saying that Trump has given North Korea the reason to have a nuclear weapon reminds me of the phrase that any time you talk about going after radical Islamic terrorism, that the left would scream, but this is what ISIS wants. This is what al Qaeda wants. No, actually, want they want is to destroy western civilization. And North Korea wants a nuclear weapon because they think it will protect them from a world that they think is out to get them."

Maybe there is some stuff like Dana's saying that happened or transpired, you know, behind the scenes, and he's getting a cooperative push from China or from South Korea. Because can you imagine, actually, Dana, when you were saying this I'm thinking, well, what if he'd made some caustic, you know, comments there to really make it difficult when he's over there trying to reach out and establish good relations, you know -- that would be problematic.

Virginians are very concerned about health care, very concerned about the economy, and the right track-wrong track scenario, worst it's been in two decades. And if you look at healthcare, Obamacare premiums expected to jump 60 percent next year. Now, wages are flat and a lot of the rural areas in the state have not really seen the jobs that the rest of the state has. GDP growth, 0.6 percent last year. National average was about 1.5 percent, so not very good. Now crime, 484 murders in the state last year. That's, I think, a high of 20 years, hasn't been that bad. Violent crime, rape and robbery, all up over the last five years. And the gun issue, who got an \"F\" from the NRA? Northam. MS-13, there's been a lot of misinformation. Almost 2,000 MS-13 gang members alone in Fairfax County. You mentioned it the other day. There's a bunch of MS-13 gang members on trial for killing teenagers in that state. It's terrible. So if Gillespie wins, this will show a few things. One, that you can run as a Republican and not completely embrace Trump and still win. It also will have a Republican in control of the governorship in Virginia during the Trump reelection, which will be very, very important. And it can show that if he does win, this radical identity politics ad that really, I think, caused the loss of Northam, will be under the microscope.

So I think I want to touch on the Democratic Party question, because I think this is going to be very critical when we see the outcome of this race, because I think it's really going to exacerbate some of the existing problems they're having, that they're losing a bit of their grip on, you know, state politics and being able to go in and do the anti- Trump thing and win. So this to me, I think, is a very good sign. Republicans, if they can come together and kind of bridge that divide that we talked about yesterday. And Ed Gillespie, I think he has done a masterful job of learning lessons from the last on. Like he said, don't be outspent three to one. And really taking ownership of this situation, and getting behind him. He's a very good example of kind of a modern-day Republican candidate that can appeal to multiple facets of the party. Now be a closer and win."

But we know it's almost a year, Dana, since Donald Trump beat all the pollsters. So -- and Ed Gillespie came back very close in his race against Mark Warner in the Senate, to make it -- boy, it was that close that Warner was able to hold him off. The big news here is the robo calls from President Trump. Remember, Gillespie did not bring Trump in. He was running a very different campaign. Then he lost to Corey Stewart, who was Trump's campaign manager, in Virginia. And then he started to run more of what Greg refers to as an identity politics campaign. \"I'm defending Confederate statues. What about these NFL players kneeling? What about MS-13,\" like it was the biggest threat to Virginia. I mean, you know, it's unpleasant and so divisive, but on the other hand, if Gillespie wins, this is the playbook going forward for Republicans."

We've become ruder; we've become louder. We don't -- this kind of thing just doesn't happen anymore. And this is, again, the injection of politics into a venue. Politics stresses the differences between people. Football and teamwork, you're supposed to be a team. You even have things in common with the other team. You sometimes have more in common with the other team than your own team. But what politics does is it stresses the division.

The starting price, about $60,000, but the bids, well, they went crazy like it was 1999. And a big surprise, the bidding war sent the price skyrocketing to $700,000, the highest amount paid for one of his guitars. Less than a Jimi Hendrix, less than some of the celebrity auction items but unbelievable. The legendary rocker, Prince, used the guitar in the '80s and '90s. Then he donated it to the L.A. earthquake relief in '94. Wow."
