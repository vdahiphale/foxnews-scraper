Now, Senator Sanders has expanded that to not just the rich -- and, to be fair, even though he himself is rich and a millionaire and part of the 1 percent, he is going to eat his own pudding, as I said, and tax himself. But, in the long run, he said, it would be beneficial for everyone. Step back from all of this and the significance of it.

So what Bernie Sanders is saying is that now we're going to bring those taxes down to the middle class.

And we watched throughout the afternoon as investigators, as the experts looked at this scene and worked to assess the structural integrity of what remains. But at this point yesterday, that massive fire was under way.  Notre Dame's iconic sphere had crashed down through the roof, and it raged for 12 hours.  There were fears that all would be lost. But investigators say the famous edifice, those world-renowned twin towers at the front, have been saved, and the determination now as to whether or not the structure is safe, safe to investigate, safe to seek further answers. But the working theory here is that this was a tragic accident related to renovations of that spire and the surrounding structure. Much of the roof was made of timber, some of it hundreds of years old, and, as witnessed, would burn swiftly. France's wealthy and elite business families, including those involved in the country's elite fashion houses, have promised an outpouring worth millions of dollars. And French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to swiftly rebuild. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator): And I'm telling you today, with strength, we are these people of rebuilders.

How much did you make? How much do you pay in taxes? And then compare it when you file your 2018 taxes.

They had a poll last month -- 71 percent of the American people that they surveyed said the economy was either very good or good for them. So people are feeling it in their own lives. And they're seeing it in their paychecks. We have seen now -- Larry Lindsey, a former colleague of the Council of -- or excuse me -- at the National Economic Council in the Bush White House, had an interesting paper the other day. He pointed out that in the five years leading into 2016, wages were increasing. But the increases for supervisors were running 75 percent -- or excuse me -- 40 percent ahead of what they were for workers. But in the last two years, wages are continuing to grow. In fact, they're accelerating. But now workers are getting wage increases that are 25 percent larger than their supervisors. People are feeling that in their own personal finances. But the Republicans have -- we needed to have the president spend more time talking about the tax cut. And we needed to have ways that we explained to them that the tax -- they could figure out what kind of a tax cut they were going to get, because, again, the withholding tables sort of hide both how much money is being taken out of your paycheck, and they also to some degree hide how much money is being given back to you in your paycheck in the form of lower tax payments.",

Meanwhile, there's still little bits of ash that are floating here in the air. But the streets surrounding the island here where the grand cathedral, where Notre Dame sits, have reopened. And we watched throughout the afternoon as investigators, as the experts looked at this scene and worked to assess the structural integrity of what remains. But at this point yesterday, that massive fire was under way.  Notre Dame's iconic sphere had crashed down through the roof, and it raged for 12 hours. There were fears that all would be lost. But investigators say the famous edifice, those world-renowned twin towers at the front, have been saved, and the determination now as to whether or not the structure is safe, safe to investigate, safe to seek further answers. But the working theory here is that this was a tragic accident related to renovations of that spire and the surrounding structure. Much of the roof was made of timber, some of it hundreds of years old, and, as witnessed, would burn swiftly. France's wealthy and elite business families, including those involved in the country's elite fashion houses, have promised an outpouring worth millions of dollars. And French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to swiftly rebuild."

Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld, of course, the former Libertarian vice presidential candidate, is up for the challenge and willing to take on the president in 2020 for the Republican nomination.

I think the president -- you and I have discussed this. I think he's really not an economic conservative. He hasn't cut spending, vetoed spending at all. I have done that. And if I get to Washington, that's the first thing I would do, would be to cut spending, which permits further tax cuts. I'm not at one with the president on foreign policy. I think he's insulting our allies and really cozying up to dictators, almost as though he wanted more autocratic facets of the regime to be -- to be -- to come to the United States, which is the opposite of what I want. So there's a lot to talk about. I think it might even be good for the president to be put through his paces, as it were, and have to account for, answer for his positions. Too often, I think they amount to one word, hoax for climate change, wall for immigration. Let's flesh that out a little bit. So I think it could be good for the country."

It's been 25 years since you were on the public scene there in that role. Even your critics say you were a very solid governor. You were, I guess, a fiscal conservative, more socially liberal, open to gay marriage, when many in your party were not. So you have some appealing qualities, but, in this environment, where Republicans think it's Donald Trump who has delivered this strong economy, Donald Trump who has delivered this market on the cusp of breaking records across the board again, and that you're Johnny-come-lately.

And I think I indicated to each of them that that would be no skin off my teeth. That would be a broader conversation. It might be harder for the Republican -- for the president to duck debates if there were two or three other candidates in the race. So I have been encouraging the both of those people.

The Intermountain West is hospitable, some of the Southwest, not all the Mountain states, but some. And there would be areas of the Deep South where, obviously, I'm not going to strike a resounding chord there, but other areas where there may be some opportunity. Certainly, I would contest New York strongly. And starting with New York and California and the Northeastern states, the other Northeastern states, that's a good head start. And then the last question to be answered would be, what about the Rust Belt? What about the three states that the Republican -- that the president won at the end, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin?"

Independent Women's Forum's Inez Stepman is here. We have got Democratic strategist David Morey and our own Charlie Gasparino. So, Inez, what is your sense of how she was framing that, complimentary of the congresswoman, but reminding folks that, look, there are some districts where the Democrat is always going to win, and those -- what was left out here is among the 40 who did come in and take over the House, most were moderate?

So Nancy Pelosi definitely has her eye on those districts for 2020. That being said, the fact that she has to reference AOC and the 68 Democrats, not five, 68 Democrats who vote with her 95 percent of the time constantly, the way she does, I think says a lot about where the heart and soul of the Democratic Party is going. And I think that she knows that deep down, but she doesn't want to communicate that exact message to those 31 districts who voted for Donald Trump and 2016 that she has to hold to hold the House."

She knows that she will lose, the Democrats will lose in 2020 if they go far left. That's what happened in 1980 after Reagan went to the Democrats in the U.K. It happened in 1979 to the Labor Party when Thatcher won. AOC is to, me, more of a pace car than a party leader. She won in a left-leaning district with less than 16,000 votes in the primary, 110 in the general, and, in some ways, look at the larger picture in 2018. There were 43 flips from Republican to Democrat. Forty of them were right down the middle, including five in Pennsylvania, where I now am. So I think Speaker Pelosi, real quickly, is managing three audiences, Twitter followers, the national electorate, and the floor votes. And they're different audiences and distinct audiences."

They have direct access to the -- to the candidates themselves. I will tell you this, that they believe that anybody but Bernie Sanders can beat Donald Trump. So, to see Bernie Sanders out there, if you look at like a seven-person race, he's got whatever, 23 percent of the vote, it even shows Bernie Sanders at least now doing well against Trump. They don't think it's going to hold, but at least now he looks like he's doing well. When they see that, there is a freak-out. Now, you don't have to just believe me. Look at The New York Times today. But I'm telling you I have been speaking over the last couple of weeks, when these poll numbers come out, with showing Bernie essentially in the lead in a very crowded field. Larry Fink has said it.

My feeling is, what will come out on Thursday morning will be half blacked out. And the Democrats will say, come on, this is not the Mueller report.  This is the Barr version of the Mueller report.

French President Emmanuel Macron hoping Notre Dame can be rebuilt in five years. But to help pay to rescue the Lady of France, the country's wealthiest families are chipping in. First, the owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault, pledging over $100 million. And then the third richest man in the world and France's wealthiest, Louis Vuitton -- the owner of Louis Vuitton, the founder, Bernard Arnault, doubling that amount, donating over $200 million to restore Notre Dame. L'Oreal's heir and the richest woman the world, Francoise Bettencourt, also contributing over $200 million. And France's famous dynasties citing patriotism and also the country's shared cultural identity as their motivation. French companies like oil giant Total, services firm Capgemini also putting in money as well, and even Apple on this side of the world, the world's most valuable company, Tim Cook tweeting that Apple will be donating to the rebuilding efforts to help restore Notre Dame's precious heritage for future generations. Insurers will most likely pay for the bulk of the repair work, according to analysts, but even the Paris City Hall is offering $50 million in renovations. And nonprofits like the Fondation du Patrimoine and the U.S.- based French Heritage Society are setting up funds. Now, there are also a dozen GoFundMe pages as well to support the restoration efforts -- Neil."

    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "So, well, the good news is, it's a very small percentage of the overall fleets. So that's a great thing. I think what they're doing is they're just being very proactive, meaning like when you have weather coming in, you know how they proactively cancel thousands of flights sometimes, there's a big storm, and then the storm never materializes? I think they're doing the same thing here because they don't have the confidence, in my opinion, that Boeing is going to get the fix in place.  And that's why they're pushing stuff out literally into mid-August at this point in terms of canceling any flights that were going to be using these particular planes. The good news is they have plenty of planes that they can bring in as backups. So you shouldn't be disrupted if you're on one of those routes that these MAX planes typically fly on."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But I guess what I'm asking is, when it is time to fly and they re-confirm or whatever, and you see, oh, my gosh, it's one of these planes, and you're paranoid about it, maybe for good reason, what do you do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURPHY",
      "utterance": "Correct. So you can see what the equipment is supposed to be, but it's never guarantee that it will be that equipment. So the airline reserves the right to switch out planes, go to an Airbus, go to a Boeing 737, 57, whatever, and then you have no recourse because if they change the equipment, you don't get a refund on your ticket. You can't say, oh, I don't want to fly that plane. You either fly it or you lose that money on that ticket, or you pay the change fee, a change to a different flight, plus a difference in fare. So you're kind of out of luck. But you can look ahead at those airlines.  And I believe the biggest one is Southwest has about 34 these planes. So you're not talking about a big number when they have over 700 planes in the air at Southwest and well over 1,000 with American and United in their total fleets."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, they say perception is reality. Then, for Republicans, this perception might be a tough reality, the fact that more Americans simply do not believe they ever got a tax cut from last year. Look at that top line, those who believe that they would get a tax cut vs. those that actually got one. And there's a confusion that the percentage of Americans who believe that they did, that it didn't jibe, and that this doesn't really help Republicans' push to say it was a godsend to almost most taxpayers, which, by the way, it was. Karl Rove with us right now. Karl, a weird disconnect, isn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH",
      "utterance": "Yes. Look, when do you do something like the Republicans did on the tax cut, you need to explain it and stay on it. And, for example, last year, saying, OK, everybody be prepared, withholding tables and the way this tax cap was passed and when it was passed, you may not begin to see it until next year. So right now write down -- when you filed your 2017 taxes, write down how much money you made, and how much your total tax bill was. Probably got a refund, but write down those two figures. How much did you make? How much do you pay in taxes? And then compare it when you file your 2018 taxes. And we know from the tax tables that the vast majority of Americans, particularly outside the Northeast, would have been able to say, well, I made -- I made as much or more, but my tax -- the money I paid in taxes was less."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What's kind of weird, though, is that even though most Americans did enjoy a tax cut and all of that, and that the evil 1 percenters, especially in those high-tax states, didn't get a disproportionate share of that because of that, it's falling on deaf ears. And I'm wondering if that ignores the market run-up, the boom in the economy, the very big surge in jobs we have seen across all key demographic groups. Is it being missed? Or is this a matter of politics, just pound the negative?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, look, this is -- the tax cut is -- we're sort of -- we're losing the messaging battle on it, have been losing it for months, because you need to, as I say, stay on it, explain it and stay on it. But the overall economy, look, the president's job approval today I think is 43 or 44, if you averaged all the recent polls, but his approval on the economy is in the high 50s. And think about CNN. They had a poll last month -- 71 percent of the American people that they surveyed said the economy was either very good or good for them. So people are feeling it in their own lives. And they're seeing it in their paychecks. We have seen now -- Larry Lindsey, a former colleague of the Council of -- or excuse me -- at the National Economic Council in the Bush White House, had an interesting paper the other day. He pointed out that in the five years leading into 2016, wages were increasing. But the increases for supervisors were running 75 percent -- or excuse me -- 40 percent ahead of what they were for workers. But in the last two years, wages are continuing to grow. In fact, they're accelerating. But now workers are getting wage increases that are 25 percent larger than their supervisors. People are feeling that in their own personal finances. But the Republicans have -- we needed to have the president spend more time talking about the tax cut. And we needed to have ways that we explained to them that the tax -- they could figure out what kind of a tax cut they were going to get, because, again, the withholding tables sort of hide both how much money is being taken out of your paycheck, and they also to some degree hide how much money is being given back to you in your paycheck in the form of lower tax payments."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

He thinks that he could start off strongly in New Hampshire, maybe spread that to cobble together some other New England wins, resonate in big states like New York, Michigan. What do you think of that strategy?"

And it's hard to see where he's going to get traction after that. Think about it. Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, those are going to be the first four contests. And then about half of the delegates to the Republican National Convention are going to be chosen in the first month of the primaries next year, March -- February through March 3 of next year. And I just -- it's hard to see how, even if he was able to get lightning in New Hampshire, that he could take it anywhere from there. But he's right.  He's got to demonstrate, and he's going to have to demonstrate early, some strength in New Hampshire."
