According to our analysis, it looks like the worst day for the S&P and the Nasdaq since at least 2008. Fear, anxiety as high as it was during 2008, according to the volatility index, and we hit circuit breakers once again this morning only for the second time since 1997, but the second time this week. And that means that trading was halted for 15 minutes after the stock markets began the trading session today. And the reason, well, there's a lot of fear and anxiety that there won't be a substantive fiscal stimulus package being passed by Congress, meaning no payroll tax holiday. That would free up a trillion dollars in cash. Also, what about the hit to the economy, since we are talking about sporting leagues are postponing their events and also events outright being canceled, also travel limitations as well?   One of the worst performers on the Dow today is a playmaker, Boeing seeing a historic slide of close to 30 percent over the past two sessions. Also, we have travel companies and airlines being hits as well, the likes of Royal Caribbean, Carnival Cruise Lines, and Carnival stopping the itineraries for its Princess cruises for the next two months. Also seeing double-digit declines as well, airline stocks, like the Deltas of the world, the American Airlines, and also United seeing some big hits as well. And there is concern about the impact to the economy. We have seen 13 bear markets over the past 93 years for the S&P 500. That means a drop of 20 percent from recent peaks. And over that time, 11 out of those 13 times, a recession followed.  And some people are pricing that in right now for the U.S. economy -- Charles.",

And she said -- quote -- \"We're ready.\" An aide to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the bill -- quote -- \"won't fly here.\" But McConnell said -- quote -- \"We will look at anything they send us.\"   Now, the Senate has officially left town. The Senate is still in session, but most senators have left. There's not going to be any legislative activity there. But Mitch McConnell has canceled the recess for next week. So the hope here, when you talk to some both Democratic and Republican senators, namely, Roy Blunt from Missouri and Chris Coons from Delaware, they indicate that they hope that the House can get a bill, they ping it over to the Senate, maybe they work on it, retool it in some way, maybe have to pawn it back to the House of Representatives, but get a bill out the door some time next week.  And keep in mind that this will probably be the first of several bills that they have to do. They don't know exactly just how dire this crisis will be with coronavirus. Remember, with the financial crisis in 2008, they did TARP in the fall of 2008, and then it took them until February of 2009 to do the stimulus package, and then Dodd-Frank in the summer of 2010 -- Charles.",

Perhaps one of the most unsettling things people heard about today, Charles, was the news that a passenger who left from this very airport yesterday on a JetBlue flight to West Palm Beach took the flight just as he received a text that he tested positive for coronavirus, meaning he flew anyway.   JetBlue issuing a statement to Fox, which reads, in part: \"In last night's case, our crew members did an incredible job coordinating with health authorities. After health officials allowed customers to disembark, we conducted a thorough sanitizing of the aircraft, according to CDC guidance. We have also sanitized common areas in both airport terminals involved.\"  Health officials of Florida said that passenger was never seen -- he was never observed coughing or sneezing, but that, of course, is cold comfort to those who were sitting around him or on the flight at all -- Charles",

We will update you constantly.  In light of several new developments, obviously, the numbers that we now have seen over the last 24 hours here in New York City, what we're seeing nationally and internationally, the reality of community spread that's been with us over these last few days, and the close working relationship between the city and state, the decisions that we are making together -- and I spoke with Governor Cuomo at length earlier today about a specific set of decisions. And, obviously, you heard his announcements earlier today, which he and I discussed in detail and which I agree with fully.  In light of all those changing realities, it is time now to declare a state of emergency in New York City. And I will explain what that means, the powers that invest in me, what it will allow us to do going forward. I will also emphasize that the declaration of state of emergency authorizes the use of the powers, but we will use them as needed. That doesn't mean everything will happen at once. And we're going to try and be very, very careful to give you accurate information about what the city is doing and why. There's already some very inaccurate information out there, which we will speak to later on. I want to ask all of you in the news media, you're hearing things that are being attributed to the city of New York. Please ask if it's true or not. We will confirm with you instantly. It's very important that the people of the city know what is really coming from their government and what is not. But now, again, it's time to sign this state of emergency declaration.  And continuing on the conversation with the governor, again, I fully support, and we are in total agreement, his decision related to large gatherings.  So, we will be working with the state to enforce that new rule that relates, obviously, to anything where over 500 people would gather, parades, rallies, concerts, sports events, professional conferences, et cetera. And all of our largest venues will now no longer have gatherings until such time in this crisis, as it's acceptable to do so again. And, again, I, unfortunately, suspect that will be a number of months. So, places like Barclays, Madison Square Garden, Radio City obviously will not be operating.  As you heard, for most venues, that will begin the 5:00 Friday. For Broadway, as I understand, it begins 5:00 tonight. Also agree with the decision for gatherings of under 500 people. This essentially refers to nonessential, non-workplace-related dynamics. So we're talking about events, we're talking about restaurants, we're talking about bars. Gathering places under 500 people will be mandated to have occupancy levels at 50 percent or less of their legal occupancy. That will allow for space between people. That will allow for some...",

Our Department of Social Services is activating emergency food contracts, working with nonprofit organizations, community-based organizations, to increase the amount of available food. We will have more details on that in the next day or two. And, again, there's nothing that would be more important in terms of providing support and relief for people than federal action. We all understand, in a national crisis, the federal government can provide a level of relief that state and local governments simply can't. We need the federal government to move immediately with a huge stimulus program and a program of relief for working people, paid sick days, any number of measures that would help people through what could easily be a half-year or more. The House of Representatives has put forward a stimulus plan that is very helpful and a very positive step. We need to see action by the House, Senate and the president as quickly as possible. Want to give updates about our school system. And I will talk about the school in the Bronx in just a moment. But, first overall -- and this is absolutely essential to our strategy and something we are working very, very hard to continue to keep continuity on, and I know the state feels the same way -- we want our schools to remain open, we intend for our schools to remain open. That said, there are nonessential and non-instructional activities that we will alter. They will either be moved online, if they can be, or they will be canceled. Depends on the each activity. So that includes PSAL activities, athletic activities, games and practices, assemblies, parent- teacher conferences, PTA meetings, and school plays and recitals.  And I will stay on the topic of schools, and then double back. This morning we have a potential -- and, please, everyone accurately note this -- we do not have independent confirmation -- we have a potential case of a student at a school contracting this disease. But it is self-confirmed. We do not have a medical provider or a testing agency that has independently verified. That is not in any way doubting what the individuals are saying. It's saying that we have to make a series of decisions, and we need medical confirmation. And we don't have it right now. We hope to have that confirmation in the next hour or two. Two schools -- and the chancellors here obviously will add in the Q&A. Chancellor, I'm going to make sure I describe properly. If there's anything you need to correct me on, feel free. Two schools in the same building, the Laboratory School of Finance and Technology and South Bronx Prep -- this is in the Mott Haven neighborhood in the Bronx. The school is at -- or the two schools are in a building at 360 East 145th Street. Again, this was a decision we made this morning a little after 7:00 a.m., based on decisions -- excuse me -- made based on the information that had just come in. And it was a tough decision, because we didn't have that confirmation, but, out of an abundance of caution, determined that it was the right thing to do to close the school, to work to get that confirmation.  If we were so lucky as to get a negative confirmation, that would be ideal. If we get a positive, it's quite clear the follow-through. In the meantime, the full disinfection and cleanliness regimen is put in place in the school today. The disease detectives from the Department of Health have been deployed to figure out any close contacts, as we said would be the case in any potential temporary school closure. We have checked the school, and we will keep double-checking. But, as of now, there are no children in the school who reach what we call a tier one level of preexisting medical conditions, so children who would be particularly vulnerable. We're double-checking that. But, as of this point, we do not have an indication of any children in the school having those particular preexisting conditions. Want to talk for a moment about two things, the city work force and then the private sector work force. On the city, we now intend to authorize 10 percent of the city work force to work from home. The specific details are being determined. So this is telecommuting. We believe that's a number we can hit in the short-term, but it will take some real work. It's not the norm, obviously, for city employment. There's, as is obvious, a huge number of our employees who cannot telecommute, who we need at their posts. But we believe, in short order, we can have 10 percent telecommute. I am -- want to confirm that number. I believe leave that as 34,000. But I want to check that. And our...",

So, between those two categories, that's about 100,000 city workers will either be in telecommuting or on a staggered schedule, get them as much as possible away from the rush hour. And, again, our message to New York City businesses, as much as humanly possible, please authorize maximum telecommuting and/or staggered schedules for your employees. I want to say it's our impression so far from the information we're getting that the business community is really honoring that. A lot of them are acting on that. The meeting we had here, which was organized with the help of the New York City Partnership, and CEOs and business leaders of some of the most prominent businesses in New York City. Just going around the room and going with each of -- going through with each of them what they are doing, we saw a very, very high level of adherence to the guidance to institute telecommuting. In fact, in the case of some of the companies which had the ability -- obviously, if it's a technology company, for example, more capacity to do that -- we had companies that were literally at 100 percent telecommuting now. Other companies are going to have a much harder time and strike a balance.  A great example, one of the great New York City iconic companies, Macy's, CEO is here. Macy's is in a different situation, where a lot of their workers obviously work in physical locations. But they're working with us to maximize any kind of adjustments they can make. So I want to say, I appreciate the high level of cooperation from the business community. I also want to note that every business is different. Some can do a lot of -- have a lot of flexibility. Others do not. They are all taking this seriously. They're all working with us. We do want to keep reminding any business that's not yet instituted maximum telecommuting and/or staggering work hours that we need them to. But we again are sensitive to the fact that not every business can do that, and that we are simultaneously extremely concerned to keep people employed, keep people from running out of their livelihood, because that has a huge number of other ramifications. So we're trying to strike that balance, but very, very pleased with the cooperation we're getting. And we're going to try and work with these businesses on any help they need as they proceed. Hang on one sec. OK, a couple other matters. There's been concern about the special election scheduled for March 24 for borough president of Queens. We are analyzing those concerns. But I want to be very, very clear, that election will continue as scheduled. We are dealing with an unprecedented challenge, but I think it is a signature of a stable democracy that elections happen when scheduled. So we very much want that election to happen on time, so long as we believe it can happen effectively. However, I want to urge all candidates and campaigns to alter their activity right now. We're reaching out to each campaign specifically, believe that door-to-door canvassing should be stopped immediately. And I want to note -- and knowing a lot about campaigns over the years, campaigns have many, many...",

According to our analysis, it looks like the worst day for the S&P and the Nasdaq since at least 2008. Fear, anxiety as high as it was during 2008, according to the volatility index, and we hit circuit breakers once again this morning only for the second time since 1997, but the second time this week. And that means that trading was halted for 15 minutes after the stock markets began the trading session today. And the reason, well, there's a lot of fear and anxiety that there won't be a substantive fiscal stimulus package being passed by Congress, meaning no payroll tax holiday. That would free up a trillion dollars in cash. Also, what about the hit to the economy, since we are talking about sporting leagues are postponing their events and also events outright being canceled, also travel limitations as well? One of the worst performers on the Dow today is a playmaker, Boeing seeing a historic slide of close to 30 percent over the past two sessions. Also, we have travel companies and airlines being hits as well, the likes of Royal Caribbean, Carnival Cruise Lines, and Carnival stopping the itineraries for its Princess cruises for the next two months. Also seeing double-digit declines as well, airline stocks, like the Deltas of the world, the American Airlines, and also United seeing some big hits as well. And there is concern about the impact to the economy. We have seen 13 bear markets over the past 93 years for the S&P 500. That means a drop of 20 percent from recent peaks. And over that time, 11 out of those 13 times, a recession followed. And some people are pricing that in right now for the U.S. economy -- Charles."

Remember, they were going to vote on a Democratic proposal earlier today.

And she said -- quote -- \"We're ready.\" An aide to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the bill -- quote -- \"won't fly here.\" But McConnell said -- quote -- \"We will look at anything they send us.\" Now, the Senate has officially left town. The Senate is still in session, but most senators have left. There's not going to be any legislative activity there. But Mitch McConnell has canceled the recess for next week. So the hope here, when you talk to some both Democratic and Republican senators, namely, Roy Blunt from Missouri and Chris Coons from Delaware, they indicate that they hope that the House can get a bill, they ping it over to the Senate, maybe they work on it, retool it in some way, maybe have to pawn it back to the House of Representatives, but get a bill out the door some time next week. And keep in mind that this will probably be the first of several bills that they have to do. They don't know exactly just how dire this crisis will be with coronavirus. Remember, with the financial crisis in 2008, they did TARP in the fall of 2008, and then it took them until February of 2009 to do the stimulus package, and then Dodd-Frank in the summer of 2010 -- Charles."

We will update you constantly. In light of several new developments, obviously, the numbers that we now have seen over the last 24 hours here in New York City, what we're seeing nationally and internationally, the reality of community spread that's been with us over these last few days, and the close working relationship between the city and state, the decisions that we are making together -- and I spoke with Governor Cuomo at length earlier today about a specific set of decisions. And, obviously, you heard his announcements earlier today, which he and I discussed in detail and which I agree with fully. In light of all those changing realities, it is time now to declare a state of emergency in New York City. And I will explain what that means, the powers that invest in me, what it will allow us to do going forward. I will also emphasize that the declaration of state of emergency authorizes the use of the powers, but we will use them as needed. That doesn't mean everything will happen at once. And we're going to try and be very, very careful to give you accurate information about what the city is doing and why. There's already some very inaccurate information out there, which we will speak to later on. I want to ask all of you in the news media, you're hearing things that are being attributed to the city of New York. Please ask if it's true or not. We will confirm with you instantly. It's very important that the people of the city know what is really coming from their government and what is not. But now, again, it's time to sign this state of emergency declaration. And continuing on the conversation with the governor, again, I fully support, and we are in total agreement, his decision related to large gatherings. So, we will be working with the state to enforce that new rule that relates, obviously, to anything where over 500 people would gather, parades, rallies, concerts, sports events, professional conferences, et cetera. And all of our largest venues will now no longer have gatherings until such time in this crisis, as it's acceptable to do so again. And, again, I, unfortunately, suspect that will be a number of months. So, places like Barclays, Madison Square Garden, Radio City obviously will not be operating. As you heard, for most venues, that will begin the 5:00 Friday. For Broadway, as I understand, it begins 5:00 tonight. Also agree with the decision for gatherings of under 500 people. This essentially refers to nonessential, non-workplace-related dynamics. So we're talking about events, we're talking about restaurants, we're talking about bars. Gathering places under 500 people will be mandated to have occupancy levels at 50 percent or less of their legal occupancy. That will allow for space between people. That will allow for some..."

Our Department of Social Services is activating emergency food contracts, working with nonprofit organizations, community-based organizations, to increase the amount of available food. We will have more details on that in the next day or two. And, again, there's nothing that would be more important in terms of providing support and relief for people than federal action. We all understand, in a national crisis, the federal government can provide a level of relief that state and local governments simply can't. We need the federal government to move immediately with a huge stimulus program and a program of relief for working people, paid sick days, any number of measures that would help people through what could easily be a half-year or more. The House of Representatives has put forward a stimulus plan that is very helpful and a very positive step. We need to see action by the House, Senate and the president as quickly as possible. Want to give updates about our school system. And I will talk about the school in the Bronx in just a moment. But, first overall -- and this is absolutely essential to our strategy and something we are working very, very hard to continue to keep continuity on, and I know the state feels the same way -- we want our schools to remain open, we intend for our schools to remain open. That said, there are nonessential and non-instructional activities that we will alter. They will either be moved online, if they can be, or they will be canceled. Depends on the each activity. So that includes PSAL activities, athletic activities, games and practices, assemblies, parent- teacher conferences, PTA meetings, and school plays and recitals. And I will stay on the topic of schools, and then double back. This morning we have a potential -- and, please, everyone accurately note this -- we do not have independent confirmation -- we have a potential case of a student at a school contracting this disease. But it is self-confirmed. We do not have a medical provider or a testing agency that has independently verified. That is not in any way doubting what the individuals are saying. It's saying that we have to make a series of decisions, and we need medical confirmation. And we don't have it right now. We hope to have that confirmation in the next hour or two. Two schools -- and the chancellors here obviously will add in the Q&A. Chancellor, I'm going to make sure I describe properly. If there's anything you need to correct me on, feel free. Two schools in the same building, the Laboratory School of Finance and Technology and South Bronx Prep -- this is in the Mott Haven neighborhood in the Bronx. The school is at -- or the two schools are in a building at 360 East 145th Street. Again, this was a decision we made this morning a little after 7:00 a.m., based on decisions -- excuse me -- made based on the information that had just come in. And it was a tough decision, because we didn't have that confirmation, but, out of an abundance of caution, determined that it was the right thing to do to close the school, to work to get that confirmation. If we were so lucky as to get a negative confirmation, that would be ideal. If we get a positive, it's quite clear the follow-through. In the meantime, the full disinfection and cleanliness regimen is put in place in the school today. The disease detectives from the Department of Health have been deployed to figure out any close contacts, as we said would be the case in any potential temporary school closure. We have checked the school, and we will keep double-checking. But, as of now, there are no children in the school who reach what we call a tier one level of preexisting medical conditions, so children who would be particularly vulnerable. We're double-checking that. But, as of this point, we do not have an indication of any children in the school having those particular preexisting conditions. Want to talk for a moment about two things, the city work force and then the private sector work force. On the city, we now intend to authorize 10 percent of the city work force to work from home. The specific details are being determined. So this is telecommuting. We believe that's a number we can hit in the short-term, but it will take some real work. It's not the norm, obviously, for city employment. There's, as is obvious, a huge number of our employees who cannot telecommute, who we need at their posts. But we believe, in short order, we can have 10 percent telecommute. I am -- want to confirm that number. I believe leave that as 34,000. But I want to check that. And our..."

So we, in short order, hope to put 20 percent on staggered work schedules, even as they report to their normal work locations. And I want to -- that -- so that's 20 percent of the remaining 90 percent. I want that number too. Do you know it?"

So, between those two categories, that's about 100,000 city workers will either be in telecommuting or on a staggered schedule, get them as much as possible away from the rush hour. And, again, our message to New York City businesses, as much as humanly possible, please authorize maximum telecommuting and/or staggered schedules for your employees. I want to say it's our impression so far from the information we're getting that the business community is really honoring that. A lot of them are acting on that. The meeting we had here, which was organized with the help of the New York City Partnership, and CEOs and business leaders of some of the most prominent businesses in New York City. Just going around the room and going with each of -- going through with each of them what they are doing, we saw a very, very high level of adherence to the guidance to institute telecommuting. In fact, in the case of some of the companies which had the ability -- obviously, if it's a technology company, for example, more capacity to do that -- we had companies that were literally at 100 percent telecommuting now. Other companies are going to have a much harder time and strike a balance. A great example, one of the great New York City iconic companies, Macy's, CEO is here. Macy's is in a different situation, where a lot of their workers obviously work in physical locations. But they're working with us to maximize any kind of adjustments they can make. So I want to say, I appreciate the high level of cooperation from the business community. I also want to note that every business is different. Some can do a lot of -- have a lot of flexibility. Others do not. They are all taking this seriously. They're all working with us. We do want to keep reminding any business that's not yet instituted maximum telecommuting and/or staggering work hours that we need them to. But we again are sensitive to the fact that not every business can do that, and that we are simultaneously extremely concerned to keep people employed, keep people from running out of their livelihood, because that has a huge number of other ramifications. So we're trying to strike that balance, but very, very pleased with the cooperation we're getting. And we're going to try and work with these businesses on any help they need as they proceed. Hang on one sec. OK, a couple other matters. There's been concern about the special election scheduled for March 24 for borough president of Queens. We are analyzing those concerns. But I want to be very, very clear, that election will continue as scheduled. We are dealing with an unprecedented challenge, but I think it is a signature of a stable democracy that elections happen when scheduled. So we very much want that election to happen on time, so long as we believe it can happen effectively. However, I want to urge all candidates and campaigns to alter their activity right now. We're reaching out to each campaign specifically, believe that door-to-door canvassing should be stopped immediately. And I want to note -- and knowing a lot about campaigns over the years, campaigns have many, many..."

But there was concern coming from Republicans. It was not crafted in a bipartisan way. And so that vote never happened. And, literally, both sides are coming together.

I don't think that this payroll tax credit will do enough to help those, for example, who make less than $25,000 a year. They won't see much of a help coming from that. As you mentioned, those who are Uber drivers, that's where they get their income from, or who are working on the gig economy, freelancers, those individuals won't get assistance from that payroll tax credit.

We have never seen anything like this. And I agree with Pat Williams and everybody else. The right call was made. And when the time is right to get back on the field, I think we're going to know it. There's only a couple of sports which still say they're going to have fans. Like, the PGA Tour will have fans coming into events. Well, the Masters tees off on April 9.

      "utterance": "This is a massive global mobilization, a government mobilization, if you would. It has a humbling experience on elected officials. It has biblical import. We're now talking to residents and to city leaders about social distancing. This is actually a time, Charles, for social media to kind of repudiate and redeem itself, because these are not just the vulnerable that we're protecting. We're protecting fathers and mothers and grandmothers and grandparents. And that means, if you're healthy, keeping yourself at harm's way, and making sure that you're exercising good choices. So, I'm very happy where the county executive in Bergen County is taking action. All of the synagogues have shut down in Bergen County. We're now dealing with other new normal, if you would, the anti-Semitism that's developing because of clusters in that community, the anti-Asian rhetoric that's there. So, when it comes to price-gouging, when it comes to dealing with that kind of insidious hate behavior..."

The rumor in the New York City hospital system -- I'm an EMT myself -- is that there isn't a lot of equipment but for a few weeks, and a lot of the materials that are being made in other countries. This is time for us to not declare ourselves as Democrats and Republicans, to put our partisanship away, and to make every American safe. And it means leading by example and making sure that your neighbor, your family, your co-workers are not overwhelmed or taking this less than serious."

      "utterance": "It is important. We never hear, though. We never hear that 65,000 of these cases have -- people have recovered from this. We just hear the number who've had it over the whole world. And I think part of that is feeding into this period of anxiety and fear."

      "speaker": "RUSKIN",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Anxiety is contagious. It's an anxiety epidemic, an anxiety pandemic, if you will. The anxiety increase is tremendous. It is the most number one common mental disorder in the United States to begin with, and health anxiety exacerbates that. Those who don't typically have anxiety are experiencing it, being triggered by things like social distancing. My goodness, look around you. Sports, something that you normally find is pleasurable, that's being suspended and canceled. Universities are doing online, where you can't have proper learning anymore, normal learning. Shelves are being not stocked for things like toilet paper. Facilities such as for the elderly aren't allowing families to come in to see their family members."

      "utterance": "You can hug loved ones. That's the thing. We're social distancing, even when there isn't actual medical illness. We're worried about what's to come. We are fearing the unknown. And fear of the unknown is what escalates."

Folks, it was another crazy day on Wall Street, the biggest point drop in history, Dow off the most since the financial crisis. It's been a real critical time, of course. And it's going to continue, although we might get some relief, if we can get Washington, D.C., to exude some confidence. This is what we need more than anything else. It's not about fundamentals. It's not a financial crisis. It's a crisis of confidence. \"The Five\" starts right now. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
