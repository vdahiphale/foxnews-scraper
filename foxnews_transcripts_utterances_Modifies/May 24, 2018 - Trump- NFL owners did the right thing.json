It's their ball they can take it and go home. And the players can protest, but they will be penalized if it's done during a game --penalized not jailed. Only the government can jail you. You see the difference? Players are employees at work disobeying a rule. So, where are you in all of this? Where you've always been, scratching your head. You prefer unity over conflict. You don't mind dissent. It's the dissension where there not need be. Mind you, you still love a good debate. It's why you watch \"The Five.\" But a political act within a sporting event is like turning on this very show and finding me and Dana playing badminton for an hour. It's not what you came here for.

It's just the fact that like Harf couldn't get here when she did her one more thing and take a knee every time. After a while, people would change the channel and then the ratings would dip, and the company CEO would say can you stop doing that. And if you said no, you're fired. That's how it works. You wear their jersey, you're in their stadium, you're playing for their team, they can tell what to do or what not to do. I think it's a great idea. And, Trump, he's not saying anything -- he's not going to deport line backers and free safeties. He's saying love it or leave it, you know. He likes this country so much. It's hyperbola. He can't see how anybody wouldn't like this country at all.   But the kneeling thing really hurt because it was misconstrued. They did it at the wrong time. Speak your mind on ESPN, on Fox News, on twitter. On Sunday, play football. It hurt Jemele Hill, she lost her show. It hurt the commissioner. He got hit hard because of his erratic response. It hurt the ratings, networks didn't like it. It hurt the players. Now, some of the players that kneeled are free agents and they're having a hard time getting re-signed. So, it even hurt the Democrats because they sided against 75 percent of the country. So, I think this is a good thing and I'm glad they've resolved it.",

And the president's comments, once again, sort of throw more, you know, gasoline on the fire of what is a very controversial issue. So, I think the NFL could have probably handled this a little better. Now, you have people like the owner of the Jets who comes out and said he will pay the fine if his players get them.

So, I think that's what people have a problem with. What do the players want? What specifically are they addressing? What are the solutions to police brutality and racism? No one knew what those were. So, that's why people were upset because it just looked unpatriotic.",

It's just the fact that like Harf couldn't get here when she did her one more thing and take a knee every time. After a while, people would change the channel and then the ratings would dip, and the company CEO would say can you stop doing that. And if you said no, you're fired. That's how it works. You wear their jersey, you're in their stadium, you're playing for their team, they can tell what to do or what not to do. I think it's a great idea. And, Trump, he's not saying anything -- he's not going to deport line backers and free safeties. He's saying love it or leave it, you know. He likes this country so much. It's hyperbola. He can't see how anybody wouldn't like this country at all. But the kneeling thing really hurt because it was misconstrued. They did it at the wrong time. Speak your mind on ESPN, on Fox News, on twitter. On Sunday, play football. It hurt Jemele Hill, she lost her show. It hurt the commissioner. He got hit hard because of his erratic response. It hurt the ratings, networks didn't like it. It hurt the players. Now, some of the players that kneeled are free agents and they're having a hard time getting re-signed. So, it even hurt the Democrats because they sided against 75 percent of the country. So, I think this is a good thing and I'm glad they've resolved it."

But we're also going to undertake this five community activism steps that players have asked for. It seems like that would have been a better way to move forward. And the president's comments, once again, sort of throw more, you know, gasoline on the fire of what is a very controversial issue. So, I think the NFL could have probably handled this a little better. Now, you have people like the owner of the Jets who comes out and said he will pay the fine if his players get them. He won't pass it along because he wants his players to be able to express themselves."

I think they're going to have to do it at some point. Might as well do it now, get it over with. They had the owners meeting, move on. And I think the other thing is -- now that they've laid out this policy, if it continues to happen, which I can't see how it would, I mean, if they're going to nail them there's going to be a problem unless you're the Jets, but they've laid out the policy.

And, it's fine to be all about activism. But, it's all about symbols with these people. They wear the hat. They walk out of class over guns. You know, they do the black power thing. That's fine. But then when you say, what do you want to do about it? What's the solution? They go, oh, well, we have to do something. And they don't ever really offer any solutions. So, I think that's what people have a problem with. What do the players want? What specifically are they addressing? What are the solutions to police brutality and racism?

And then they're playing coy with the prep work for Singapore, so Trump just took a step back and said let's just work this out. Maybe it will happen. Maybe it won't. It's still just gamesmanship. We still may have this summit down the line. Nobody knows that for sure. But they have done a lot of concessions. You know they've destroyed the missile site. They've stopped ballistic missile testing. They've released hostages. And they cross the DNZ to shake hands with Moon to signal an end to the Korean War. With that said the media is totally out of line when it comes to their criticism here. They're trying to score political points against a Republican president, but they end up trying to make little rocket man look like the winner here. How can when you announce the summit in the beginning, the media say, oh, that's a win for Kim. And then, when you bail out of the summit they say, oh, that's a win for Kim. Which one is it? And they've done this the entire time. Fire and furry helped Kim. We didn't have strong enough sanctions. China was not going to play ball with us. We're alienating our allies.

This could really work out. It's a shame that it's not happening this. But the fact is Trump -- this is what he does. He would negotiate over a bread roll at the dinner table. And this is what happens. China, we're no longer the welcome mat for China. They're ticked off because we disinvited them from attending one of our naval drills. And so, they're mad about that. The last time they were there they spied on us and they stole technology. So, I think, you know, I think this is all -- I'm cautiously optimistic. That's tad disappointed, but I was prepared."

Clearly, everyone wasn't on the same page. They have to go back to the South Koreans and make sure they are OK. They were I think surprised by the announcement today. Yesterday, they were saying it's a 99 percent chance of happening. So, I think that the president was right in keeping the door open to diplomacy today. In his letter was a little hint of threat of nuclear war."

Trump's approval rating is surging in Orange County where four tight races could determine if the Republicans hold the house. And this maybe an example of why.

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

Well, what's going to be interesting is that I know the Democrats are very worried if the race comes down to certain individuals I may have been associated with in the past, Kevin -- and John Cox, that the two will run against each other. And this is something I find to be very interesting is that -- and I've been predicting this, and I have advised on this to say, watch out. Getting too crazy and too far left because Orange County there has really been surging, and the poll numbers that are coming in there are quite considerable and formidable. So, that's something that the Republicans can count on. John Cox has been endorsed by the president, making positive comments, et cetera, about him. So, this is going to be one of the more interesting, you know, races to watch, because you have Gavin Newsom, we have Villaraigosa, you've got John Cox now trying to surge. So, I think it's going to be more fascinating then we're accustomed to in California."

And the sanctuary city policy such like in Orange County, it is not a blue county yet. It's still reddish-orange."

      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Right. Literally, Orange County. Well, and Orange County isn't representative of the larger issues in California. I think that her comments probably play well in other parts of the state. But I think what's interesting is the Democratic Party has really been focused on running candidates that match their districts. And so, while Nancy Pelosi is popular in some districts and raises a lot of money, she's not in others. So we see people, not just Connor Lamb, but there are a lot of Conner Lambs out there running in this cycle. They're raising a lot of money. And they are not parroting what Nancy Pelosi says. So I think that it will be very interesting. I am by no means spiking the football a couple of months before the midterms. I think that some Democrats are overly optimistic. It's going to be very interesting. And in some of these states, like New Jersey, New York, Illinois, even California where the tax bill hasn't been as helpful because of the state and local taxes."

I don't know if that necessarily would happen today, just because the second year things feel a little bit more -- there's a lot of results. People feel a little bit more comfortable.

And the stock market is doing well, and people's 401(k)s are better. When you combine that with the fact that we've been safer as a country, you're more prosperous that's hard to run against. So the Democrats, all they have, like Greg said, identity politics. Because they don't have an identity. I mean, what is the Democratic identity? They slogan they stole from Trump in the midterms.

They had no authority to do so. If you were that concerned that there was an influence of Russians, then you should have knocked on the door and said, \"Beware.\" And instead they decided to try to take things into their own hands.

So I'm going to try and decipher, Marie, your response to that, which I believe reflects all of media. So we all know, everybody -- we all know that there really was no spying whatsoever. There was no spying whatsoever. But if there was, it was good spying. It was like a spy vaccine that protects against the worst spying. But again, there was no spying. But please don't reveal the name of the non-spy, because he's definitely not a spy. And you don't want to blow his cover for not being a spy. So A, no spying, but it's good spying.
