First, you have the president's travel restrictions for about six countries that go into effect in part after the Supreme Court issued stays on the lower courts holds against this law. But the president overshadowed his own administration's accomplishments with a controversial tweet.

It could overshadow what is a night of some big victories for this president in terms of following through on campaign promises to keep America safe. Just moments ago, the House passed two immigration measures that will crack down on sanctuary cities.  Well, less than an hour from now, as you mentioned here at Dallas Airport; Airports all across America, the president's travel ban will get a green light thanks to Monday's Supreme Court decision. There was a 72-hour pause, as you remember, to give people a chance to prepare and avoid the confusion and chaos that we saw in earlier versions of this executive order. Here's how just to be clear, here's who is exempt from the latest travel ban from Iran, Syria, Yemen, Syria, and Sudan. Anybody who has what is called a bonafide relationship with an American or U.S. entity: a parent, spouse, children, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, and siblings.   Those not considered to have a bonafide relationship or grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, fiances, and other extended family members. What's interesting is that, even though the court still has to work out the broader legal questions here in October about the travel ban, Democrats are ripping this temporary win for the president while his national security team is saying this is exactly what we need, the kind of extreme vetting to keep America safe.",

Critics and haters of the press will say, well, this is just what we expected, this is this gross man and all the horrible things they say about him and say every day on MSNBC on the \"Morning Joe\" show.  The defenders of the president, the supporters, a guy will shake our heads and say you didn't need to do that. That wasn't necessary, it wasn't right. And you stepped on your own great successes here. But it will be ephemeral because the lasting effect of the Supreme Court's decision and the putting in place of this ban plus these laws once they are signed will be really consequential. Just a couple comments if I can. On the sanctuary, you could replay the election on the sanctuary city law except it will be a greater effect than even the election. The whole country understands that you cannot harbor these illegal aliens who've committed crimes, serious crimes, and the withholding of funds is perfectly reasonable. And if Democrats and liberals want to have a fight about that, Trump will win hands down, same with \"Kate's Law.\" It's so crazy that these guys can come back and forth into this country and wreak havoc.  The only thing that I differ with, although the court said 9-0, and the fact that the president had the constitutional authority to do this; it isn't that interesting. Because remember, Martha, when the president announced it, people said, no person of goodwill or intelligence could ever, you know, want to do such a thing. Well, nine justices of the Supreme Court said the president has the authority to do that. And it doesn't shock the conscience.   My only difference here is that I don't think it matters so much, put it at the shorthand, what country people come from or what the relationships are. What matters to me is where they stand on the Constitution. What to them is superior? The Constitution, the laws of this country or Sharia Law? And that's the one that matters the most to me: what's in their brain, what's in their heart. And I hope as we get to vetting, that will be the issue that we'll find out about if we can and when we can.",

There was chaos at the nation's airports. People were stuck for days. There was so much backlash. That's what prompted this decision that we saw out of the Ninth Circuit Court. You know, slammed it back. It was a tough moment for this White House. So, now, you look at tonight and we have -- you know, we're watching to see if there are protests at any of these airports, we're not seeing on that front so far. And they put it into place in a way that's going to allow people who already have their visa to come through.

You're going to have to have government subsidies to make insurance affordable. So for example, take the Senate bill. The Senate bill in its current form would say that a low-income person would qualify for insurance, which would have a deductible of about half of their income. That's not affordable insurance. It would say that a low-income 60-year-old would have to pay about six or $7,000 in premiums for insurance, for a deductible that could be a third or a half of their income. That's not affordable insurance. We can debate what's affordable, whether it's 10 percent of income, 15 percent of income, but we can't argue that an insurance product with a deductible of half your income is affordable. So, basically, what this does is it takes a huge amount of money away from insurance for low-income people and redistributes it towards the tax cut for rich people. So, if you want to preserve affordability, you can't shift that kind of money away from the port to the rich.",

And I had an ideological edge of 9-7 as far as number of Republicans on the committee, but two of them were very liberal Republicans, Senator -- from Connecticut, and Senator Stafford from Vermont. And so, I went to Ted Kennedy and I said, look, I can't run this committee without you. I'm going to need your help. And to his credit he leaped out of his chair and said I'm going to help.

Of course, this doesn't help the president, but I do think that he has exposed the media as being biased. And I think that you can look at polling to indicate that. There's a Harvard-Harris poll showing that a majority of Americans believe that there's fake news out there. And I think the media in their disdain for the president have been more focused on covering narratives as opposed to being.",

He is number six all time in rushing yards per game. And in 2004, with the Washington Redskins, Clinton Portis was the highest- paid running back in league history. Over his career, Portis made more than $43 million and squandered every penny. Portis admits he had a weakness for women, cars, and homes. Several homes, including one featured on MTV Cribs. But Clinton Portis says the spending was only part of what led him to financial ruin. He blames his financial advisors for investing his money in shady deals or stealing it outright. Those advisors were eventually barred from the financial industry, but never saw jail time, and for Clinton Portis that wasn't justice. So in 2013, just a few years out of football, Portis found himself sitting in a car outside a D.C. office building with a gun, waiting for one of his former financial advisors to walk out. Portis says he was there to kill, but as Sports Illustrated wrote, quote, Portis never pulled his gun because he couldn't put down his phone. The voice on the other line belonged to a television producer he met while he was auditioning for a reality show. That anonymous producer, trained as a family therapist, talked him out of hurting anyone and into turning his life around. Portis has since filed multiple lawsuits against his former financial advisors, and is again working as a broadcaster for the Washington Redskins. He is also eligible for financial coverage as part of the NFL's concussion settlement, but to get the money he'd have to agree to be tested for neurological problems, which he won't do because he's, quote, scared of the results, Martha.",

First, you have the president's travel restrictions for about six countries that go into effect in part after the Supreme Court issued stays on the lower courts holds against this law. But the president overshadowed his own administration's accomplishments with a controversial tweet. Chief National Correspondent, Ed Henry, sums it all up for us; he is at Dallas International Airport this evening where these are set to take effect outside of Washington, D.C. Ed, good evening to you."

It could overshadow what is a night of some big victories for this president in terms of following through on campaign promises to keep America safe. Just moments ago, the House passed two immigration measures that will crack down on sanctuary cities. Well, less than an hour from now, as you mentioned here at Dallas Airport; Airports all across America, the president's travel ban will get a green light thanks to Monday's Supreme Court decision. There was a 72-hour pause, as you remember, to give people a chance to prepare and avoid the confusion and chaos that we saw in earlier versions of this executive order. Here's how just to be clear, here's who is exempt from the latest travel ban from Iran, Syria, Yemen, Syria, and Sudan. Anybody who has what is called a bonafide relationship with an American or U.S. entity: a parent, spouse, children, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, and siblings. Those not considered to have a bonafide relationship or grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, fiances, and other extended family members. What's interesting is that, even though the court still has to work out the broader legal questions here in October about the travel ban, Democrats are ripping this temporary win for the president while his national security team is saying this is exactly what we need, the kind of extreme vetting to keep America safe."

Bill, good evening to you. As is usually the case with the Trump presidency, there is a mixed bag to talk about here tonight. What stands out for you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL BENNETT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND HOST, BILL BENNETT PODCAST",
      "utterance": "Well, what stands out for me is not the ephemeral. The ephemeral is the tweet, this will pass. Critics and haters of the press will say, well, this is just what we expected, this is this gross man and all the horrible things they say about him and say every day on MSNBC on the \"Morning Joe\" show. The defenders of the president, the supporters, a guy will shake our heads and say you didn't need to do that. That wasn't necessary, it wasn't right. And you stepped on your own great successes here. But it will be ephemeral because the lasting effect of the Supreme Court's decision and the putting in place of this ban plus these laws once they are signed will be really consequential. Just a couple comments if I can. On the sanctuary, you could replay the election on the sanctuary city law except it will be a greater effect than even the election. The whole country understands that you cannot harbor these illegal aliens who've committed crimes, serious crimes, and the withholding of funds is perfectly reasonable. And if Democrats and liberals want to have a fight about that, Trump will win hands down, same with \"Kate's Law.\" It's so crazy that these guys can come back and forth into this country and wreak havoc. The only thing that I differ with, although the court said 9-0, and the fact that the president had the constitutional authority to do this; it isn't that interesting. Because remember, Martha, when the president announced it, people said, no person of goodwill or intelligence could ever, you know, want to do such a thing. Well, nine justices of the Supreme Court said the president has the authority to do that. And it doesn't shock the conscience. My only difference here is that I don't think it matters so much, put it at the shorthand, what country people come from or what the relationships are. What matters to me is where they stand on the Constitution. What to them is superior? The Constitution, the laws of this country or Sharia Law? And that's the one that matters the most to me: what's in their brain, what's in their heart. And I hope as we get to vetting, that will be the issue that we'll find out about if we can and when we can."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, what strikes me is when you look at sort of the learning curve of this presidency. And you go back to the beginning when the initial extreme vetting, travel ban, there was a lot of arguing over the meaning of what the president wanted to do, was put into place that went in on a Friday afternoon. There was chaos at the nation's airports. People were stuck for days. There was so much backlash. That's what prompted this decision that we saw out of the Ninth Circuit Court. You know, slammed it back. It was a tough moment for this White House. So, now, you look at tonight and we have -- you know, we're watching to see if there are protests at any of these airports, we're not seeing on that front so far. And they put it into place in a way that's going to allow people who already have their visa to come through. But it's interesting when the principal is pretty much the same in both places, the execution may prove this time to have this go through with a lot less ranker."

And so are Ginsberg and Briar, and the other justices on the court, especially the Liberals, so the Mayor, and so on. Because they smiled on this and said in effect this is a constitutional authority. I don't think you're going to see these kinds of demonstrations because the Supreme Court, you know, earned that adjective, that modifier, supreme and showed that it understands the Constitution in ways that the lower courts do not. They took their job seriously."

I mean, he is president of the United States.

I have friends who say what they want to do is praise the president, get him to sign things, but learn to sign without his thumbs because they can break his thumbs and he doesn't tweet anymore. This doesn't help. And again, the word all day has been a distraction. It distracts from these accomplishments, major accomplishments. Plus, this huge win vis-a-vis CNN situation, where he's been saying they deliver fake news and boy, were they delivering fake news. But one thing people been saying all day, which is just historically inaccurate that no president has been vulgar before, no president has gone low.

Gentlemen, welcome, it's great to have both of you with us tonight. Avik, I want to start with you. You said that this Senate bill is one of the best pieces of legislation that you have seen in your lifetime. Why, and are they running it with these changes?"

      "speaker": "AVIK ROY, PRESIDENT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH ON EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND EDITOR AT FORBES",

And that's because Republicans talk a lot about entitlement reform, but they have a real chance to do it. And to do it in a way that would actually make health care better for a lot of people. And so, we'll have to see whether they're able to get that deal together and get those 50 votes. And it's a challenge because there are a lot of people in Republican Party on the moderate side who may be kind of uncomfortable repealing ObamaCare. And there maybe people on the right who really aren't comfortable replacing ObamaCare. They'd rather just repeal it and go home, and that ideological and philosophical difference is playing a role in the balancing act that Senate leadership has to work on today."

    },

      "speaker": "ROY",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think it's buyout of insurance companies at all. I think it's about making sure that sick people and poor people can afford health insurance, which is a goal that Republicans, in my view, should embrace. That's the principle behind the report transcending ObamaCare as you cited in the teaser. My foundation is all about market-based approaches to universal coverage. That's what we should be working on. And I think the problem with Rand Paul is he doesn't believe in that. He thinks that it's OK for lots of people to be uninsured and that we don't have the money lying around to do it. We could, if we actually reform the health care system, reform entitlements, there's plenty of money to support covering the sick and the poor without spending more money. We can spend less, cover more people."

    },

      "speaker": "JONATHAN GRUBER, ARCHITECH OF OBAMACARE AND PROFESSOR AT MIT",
      "utterance": "Well, what's wrong with Avik said is that, basically, the market by itself cannot provide universal coverage. You're going to have to have government subsidies to make insurance affordable. So for example, take the Senate bill. The Senate bill in its current form would say that a low-income person would qualify for insurance, which would have a deductible of about half of their income. That's not affordable insurance. It would say that a low-income 60-year-old would have to pay about six or $7,000 in premiums for insurance, for a deductible that could be a third or a half of their income. That's not affordable insurance. We can debate what's affordable, whether it's 10 percent of income, 15 percent of income, but we can't argue that an insurance product with a deductible of half your income is affordable. So, basically, what this does is it takes a huge amount of money away from insurance for low-income people and redistributes it towards the tax cut for rich people. So, if you want to preserve affordability, you can't shift that kind of money away from the port to the rich."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So, the CBO says that Medicaid spinning falls 35 percent over the next 20 years, Avik. So, you have a different way of addressing -- allowing the low earner to be able to have a deductible that they can live with, that gives them coverage that they can actually pay, how?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROY",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, it's important to replace the Medicaid expansion of ObamaCare with tax credits so people can buy private insurance. And I would disagree with the least some of the numbers that Jonathan threw out there in the sense that, I think the premiums will be affordable. But he is right that it's important for the Senate to work on making those deductibles affordable as well. And at the Web site of our think tank freopp.org, we'd put on a proposal to do that, to create a fund, a block grant that states could use to provide health savings account or other mechanisms to help those low-income people for those deductibles."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Why not push it back to the states, Jonathan? I got to go, I need a quick answer here. But why not push block grants back to the states let them manage the money on their own and find some savings in that program by having it closer to home?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRUBER",
      "utterance": "Look, I've no problem with giving states more control. I think that's fine. But the difference is you're mixing up state control with cuts. If you're going to push it back to the states, you have to, with sufficient funding, so they can actually do what Avik said and protect a low-income people. A massive cut is not giving flexibility to the states, it's just the cut."

It was a level of respect and congeniality among colleagues that was hard to find anywhere else. Some of my best friends were Democrats. One moment we would yell at each other on the Senate floor, the next we would be laughing together over a family dinner.\" Joining me now, the Senator from Utah, calling for those big changes over discourse, Senator Orrin Hatch.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HATCH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think when you have too much rough talk, we have too much division, you know, I'll just say that being just 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats, and Trump having won the election has really created an awful lot of discord among both the Republicans and the Democrat. The Democrats have had a rough tough time accepting Trump, and accepting the Republicans. The Republicans, of course, have gotten -- they're not real happy with the Democrats. I think part of that is driven by the fact -- we're not really associating that much. There's so much pressure on us to get home and to travel and to raise money and do all the other things that count. And then also -- there's also the usual very, very discordant issues that come up in the senate, for instance, where we disagree with each other. But that doesn't mean you have to be disagreeable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

I know you've said that people used to sort of -- they go to the same schools, they live in the same neighbors, now there's even distinct neighborhoods where the Republicans live and the Democrats live, and that's just not in Washington, that's across the country. Do you ever see that changing back to the way it was?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HATCH",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think it can. I have to admit that Alain and I decided we were not going to be back here without our family, so we brought all six kids back with us. And because of that, we were able to assimilate into the community to a degree. Of course, I went home many, many times. But one of the big things that happen there's that I came back here to fight Ted Kennedy for instance. He was somebody that people in Utah really despised. And I found that when I became chairman of the labor community in 1981 with the advent of Reagan, Kennedy came over from the judiciary committee and became my ranking member. And I had an ideological edge of 9-7 as far as number of Republicans on the committee, but two of them were very liberal Republicans, Senator -- from Connecticut, and Senator Stafford from Vermont. And so, I went to Ted Kennedy and I said, look, I can't run this committee without you. I'm going to need your help. And to his credit he leaped out of his chair and said I'm going to help. I think he sees the opportunity because he realized it was a good thing for him. It was a good thing for the country. It was a good thing for the senate."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Do think that's something that can happen with health care in this moment? Who's going to leap across the aisle? Who is that Ted Kennedy that you can get together with now and come to a conclusion that will make it this health care program better for Americans because that's the bottom line?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HATCH",
      "utterance": "Well, on the senate finance committee which I chair, there are a lot of really excellent Democrats. Ron Wyden, for instance, is they let him go, he's very capable of working with me, and he's very smart, very good. But there are a number of others on the Democratic side who once let go by the Democratic leadership I think will do a really good job with us. And I think it brings the Republicans along and we seems to get along well. We have a lot of bipartisan legislation on that committee, and I intent to see it continue."

Then how come low I.Q. crazy Mika, he said, along with psycho Joe, come to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift, and I said no. Yuck. So those words drew fast and furious criticisms, with MSNBC firing back in a public statement writing this.

He's ruining the country and criticizing the size of his hands? And look, I think the president has every right to be critical of the media. There's a media research center survey out just recently showing that the media has spent 353 minutes covering the Russia probe without a shred of evidence regarding collusion. Just recently, CNN forced three employees to resign over a fake news story. Another producer was caught on camera saying that it was all B.S. and it was for ratings.

He never accused any of us of bleeding after a post-surgery. I mean, the reality is, this is the president of the United States, and he's going out there and discussing somebody's surgery. An alleged surgery, I should say. There are many bigger issues to discuss. He is a toddler with a phone. My 5-year-old would not behave this way.

I would rather have him focus on something -- energy policy is what he's been talking about this week, and important immigration laws that the house passed. Of course, this doesn't help the president, but I do think that he has exposed the media as being biased. And I think that you can look at polling to indicate that. There's a Harvard-Harris poll showing that a majority of Americans believe that there's fake news out there.

However, the rhetoric that we see every single morning and what this president has dealt with -- nobody is justifying -- nobody's justifying that tweet. Among other things it's just the worst possible taste, right? But the fact of the matter is that the level of vitriol coming at him is really -- I think it's unprecedented."

Also U.N. ambassador, Nikki Halley, fires a warning shot to Iran in a very forceful message. And the iPhone that changed your entire life pretty much, right? It's the anniversary when we come back."

It was the most popular smartphone in the world, and pretty much can't go anywhere without it if you're a regular human being. And this unbelievable story from the NFL tonight, a former football star in the Washington Redskins, was ready to commit murder over his money manager. Trace Gallagher has the details from our West Coast newsroom tonight. High, Trace."

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. During nine seasons in the NFL, Clinton Portis carried the ball more than 2,000 times and ran for just under 10,000 yards. He is number six all time in rushing yards per game. And in 2004, with the Washington Redskins, Clinton Portis was the highest- paid running back in league history. Over his career, Portis made more than $43 million and squandered every penny. Portis admits he had a weakness for women, cars, and homes. Several homes, including one featured on MTV Cribs. But Clinton Portis says the spending was only part of what led him to financial ruin. He blames his financial advisors for investing his money in shady deals or stealing it outright. Those advisors were eventually barred from the financial industry, but never saw jail time, and for Clinton Portis that wasn't justice. So in 2013, just a few years out of football, Portis found himself sitting in a car outside a D.C. office building with a gun, waiting for one of his former financial advisors to walk out. Portis says he was there to kill, but as Sports Illustrated wrote, quote, Portis never pulled his gun because he couldn't put down his phone. The voice on the other line belonged to a television producer he met while he was auditioning for a reality show. That anonymous producer, trained as a family therapist, talked him out of hurting anyone and into turning his life around. Portis has since filed multiple lawsuits against his former financial advisors, and is again working as a broadcaster for the Washington Redskins. He is also eligible for financial coverage as part of the NFL's concussion settlement, but to get the money he'd have to agree to be tested for neurological problems, which he won't do because he's, quote, scared of the results, Martha."

      "utterance": "What a story. Trace, thank you. So here now with more, we're very pleased to have with us tonight, Andrew Brandt, former NFL and NBA player agent, and former vice president of the Green Bay Packers, he's also director for the center of sports law at Villanova Law. Andrew, welcome. Good evening to you. You know this player, and you know what happened. Tell me your thoughts on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDREW BRANDT, FORMER NFL AND NBA PLAYER AGENT",
      "utterance": "This is a cautionary tale. Players become businesses. A lot of people come at them, and they need a know-guy, they somebody to protect them from all of these people coming to them. I used to tell all these players it's not what you make, it's what you keep. And all these people want to get a piece of the action. It seems like Clinton Portis couldn't say no. And it is unfortunate because they have money, but it goes fast, and these careers don't last forever. Players think they're invincible. Players think it's never going to end. They're never going to have an injury. They're never going to lose this kind of lifestyle. So it is important for them to be protected. These careers are short, the money has to last."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, it's shocking that people like this can get a hold of these players. And part of this story, they opened an account in his name and stole $3 million out of it. Now he's wondering how you can do that and not end up in jail, and I'm wondering that, too. How is that any different than breaking into someone's home and stealing millions of dollars out of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRANDT",
      "utterance": "You know these players are in their early 20s, and those that don't have protection, and by protection I mean someone really looking out for their interest as opposed to their own. There's a lot of people hanging around from when they grow up, they're maybe cousins, uncles, aunts, fathers, mothers, wives, girlfriends, wives, and girlfriends, all trying to get a piece of what is coming into them and not realizing players are inclined, their default setting is to say yes. This financial advisor got access to Clinton Portis, maybe just talking to them, maybe getting to know them, introduced by friends, some mutual contact. It led to this tragedy where the money's gone, and obviously it led to this terrible behavior that did not happen, at least. And we just don't know where you can stop this because players need to understand the money can only last so long. They need to be protected. They need to say no. And hopefully, agents, advisors, around them will protect them from people like this."
