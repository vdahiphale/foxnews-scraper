Innocent civilians suffering as Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine enters a new phase. After failing to quickly capture key cities like Kyiv, Putin appears to be shifting focus to inflict as much damage to the country as possible. The city of Mariupol refusing Russia's demand to surrender, even after enduring weeks of devastating air strikes. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy continues his call for peace, but says his country won't give any land to Russia. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): I think that we have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating, a possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war.",

But they do realize that at any moment things could change and they are watching very closely what's happening just outside of this city center, especially to the east and to the south and coastal towns like Mariupol, where hundreds of thousands of people right now are trapped and trying to get out of harm's way after Russia issued that ultimatum for the city to lay down its arms. The mayor didn't ever wait for the deadline and rejected that offer to surrender without hesitation. Officials say after weeks of heavy shelling and constant bombardments they estimate upwards of 2,300 people have died in the city. Residents of this area who survived the attack say battles are taking place on nearly every street.",

Now Russia claims that they only targeted the shopping center because it was housing Ukrainian missiles and rockets, but that claim has not been independently confirmed by anyone.

But to provoke him into a nuclear war. Nobody wants that. I don't know what Putin wants, I don't -- I don't know what Putin really wants but I imagine he doesn't want that. So, I think this trip that Biden is going to take this week is important. I think it's good that he's going. I think that it's time for some more front-seat diplomacy. He sent Kamala Harris. That did not necessarily move the needle. So now he has to go. I think it's better to be sitting in a room face to face with other NATO leaders rather than on Zoom because it's not -- that's not going to cut it. They have so many important decisions to make, and that they have a terrible -- a terrible dilemma in this situation. And Joey can answer this question I have that it's been going through my mind, which is, we're giving the Ukrainians enough to keep -- they are doing pretty well defending themselves. And it could be that Zelenskyy thinks that he can keep the capital city of Kyiv, but outside of Kyiv, if you don't give them enough to win quickly or to back them quickly, then you're just going to lose slowly. And if that happens, then you're going to see the death toll of civilians increase much more.",

Innocent civilians suffering as Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine enters a new phase. After failing to quickly capture key cities like Kyiv, Putin appears to be shifting focus to inflict as much damage to the country as possible. The city of Mariupol refusing Russia's demand to surrender, even after enduring weeks of devastating air strikes. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy continues his call for peace, but says his country won't give any land to Russia."

The mayor didn't ever wait for the deadline and rejected that offer to surrender without hesitation. Officials say after weeks of heavy shelling and constant bombardments they estimate upwards of 2,300 people have died in the city.

We're in the fourth week of this and every day we hear about more and more attacks on civilians, civilian protesters -- civilian protesters being shot and killed. And we hear more and more about literally war crimes happening. When Zelenskyy talks about the beginning of the third world war, is he really -- is he really talking about where we are possibly?"

      "utterance": "Well, actually that phrase has been used since the first day of this invasion by some because one of the things that President Biden is trying to do and then other NATO countries is to figure out how do you provide the Ukrainians enough so that they can defend themselves without, again -- I disagree with how we are describing how Putin is provoked, because he's apparently provoked by everything. But to provoke him into a nuclear war. Nobody wants that. I don't know what Putin wants, I don't -- I don't know what Putin really wants but I imagine he doesn't want that. So, I think this trip that Biden is going to take this week is important. I think it's good that he's going. I think that it's time for some more front-seat diplomacy. He sent Kamala Harris. That did not necessarily move the needle. So now he has to go. I think it's better to be sitting in a room face to face with other NATO leaders rather than on Zoom because it's not -- that's not going to cut it. They have so many important decisions to make, and that they have a terrible -- a terrible dilemma in this situation. And Joey can answer this question I have that it's been going through my mind, which is, we're giving the Ukrainians enough to keep -- they are doing pretty well defending themselves. And it could be that Zelenskyy thinks that he can keep the capital city of Kyiv, but outside of Kyiv, if you don't give them enough to win quickly or to back them quickly, then you're just going to lose slowly. And if that happens, then you're going to see the death toll of civilians increase much more."

You know, it appears that we're at a stalemate right now, that there were -- there was a deadline that was given to Zelenskyy at 10 p.m. our time last night to surrender and he hasn't gotten Mariupol -- Putin, he hasn't gotten Kyiv. He's trying to destroy and crush the spirits of the Ukrainians. But when you're at a stalemate, it's a very dangerous time, is it not? And what does Putin do now?"

If we stay in this fight and don't win decisively, that's what's next. And he may be true. That might be true. I think we try to report on this every single day. You can't report on this one day to the other. We say they haven't gotten Mariupol. Well, they haven't gotten Mariupol, but Mariupol is a wasteland of war."

You know, what was the purpose of this war? What was gained from it? What was gained from these 30,000 deaths? It may be the next 30 years of insurgency but that's just more innocent people dying.

And the only thing that's really clear is the brutality. I mean, both sides say they're winning, you know? How can that be? Both sides are calling each other Nazis. Russia was first when they did that. I don't know how to break that stalemate but we need some kind of creative thinking. And you know, I go back to the only example that I can think of, is that like, you know, when Trump went to North Korea, it was like, let's see what happens, let's shake the box, see what happens, you know, we can promise something but if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. At least it was innovative and it introduced another variable into a situation where we already knew the variables there were not working.

Well, look at her numbers now? And because people don't -- these probes get thrown around but for political reasons.

The first one to talk about bothers me and I wish they were accountability. I expect my politicians to be corrupt. That's part of the American system. I wish I could change that tomorrow. When it comes down to the second scandal, we're talking about Twitter and New York Times discrediting and removing a media source for simply reporting what they found to be the truth. That's the one that we can have some accountability on and it's one we should have accountability on. And we talked about investigating the intelligence people who signed off on this lie.
