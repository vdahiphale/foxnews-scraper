A U.S. drone took out the guy who helped direct wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon, a guy whose efforts led to the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq. He was a bad guy doing really bad things for a really long time. So, is it bad to kill a bad guy?"

      "speaker": "Chuck Schumer",
      "utterance": "No one should be shed any tears for Qassem Soleimani. He was, in fact, responsible for -- he had American blood on his hands. But at the same time, I think the fact, as Ambassador Sherman said, that the consequences of this could be unbelievable."

      "speaker": "Wendy Sherman",
      "utterance": "Qassem Soleimani is a ruthless, ruthless killer. There is no doubt about that. Nobody weeps that he is gone. But that said, the Obama administration, at least to my knowledge, did not go after him and target him because we understood what the consequences were."

Look, Iran already doesn't like us, hasn't liked us for decades. Iran has been not liking us way before Trump was elected president. Hell, it's been not liking us way before the Trump Tower was even built. But taking out a bad guy is bad because Trump."

      "speaker": "President Trump",
      "utterance": "Still a charmer. Self-interest. Okay, Trump ran a campaign on avoiding quagmires, and his supporters had their fill with Iraq, Libya, and Syria. So, this action seems the opposite of self-interest. It's a country's interest, our country. If you ask me, Trump took action to stop a war, not start one."

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "See? [laughter] [applause] I love being right. My first prediction of the year is 100 percent on. So he's sending a clear message that Trump means what he says, that it's never a good idea to stake out your army in another country and plan attacks against the U.S. and think that you're going to get away with it. Not while he's president, at least. But thank God the media is focusing on the stuff that matters. Over at CNN, what was their best headline? \"President Trump dined on ice cream as news of the air strike broke,\" [laughs] as if Trump indulging in a sweetened dairy product makes the strike that much worse. [laughter] Not for me, CNN. It actually makes it that much better. I mean -- wouldn't you want your president to be eating ice cream while he eliminates a mass murderer? I do. That's pretty -- I'd say that's pretty cool. Meanwhile, the experts on all the networks say we are one step closer to war, which raises the question, who exactly is an expert on Iran, Iraq or the Middle East in general? Where is their proof of success beyond feverish appearances on cable news shows? No one has ever gotten that region right, ever. And anyone who sees the killing of a murderous general as worse than sending pallets of money to that generous country can be no expert. He can be a moron. Now, one other expert warned that this wasn't just any old killing. True. This wasn't just some ISIS fighter. It was a top general, a powerful leader of an adversarial government. So hurray. I mean, really, isn't the killing of old generals by drone preferable to sending waves of young men and women to their deaths on a battlefield? So maybe this doesn't mean war at all. War is when the old generals send young people to die. Under Trump, we just kill those old generals -- [applause] with -- with -- and this is my favorite part, as you know, he did it with a flying robot. That's progress. [applause] Let's welcome tonight's guests. He's got a heart of gold and will kill you if you think otherwise, retired Green Beret master sergeant, host of Hollywood Weapons on the Outdoor Channel, Terry Schappert. [applause] Someone call the SWAT team because this guy's a riot. Currently starring in the new season of Crank Yankers on Comedy Central, comedian Jim Florentine. [applause] She's pretty, witty, and from the Motor City, host of Sincerely Kat on Fox Nation, Kat Timpf. [applause] And, you can swim in his footprints, my massive sidekick and host of Nuff Said on Fox Nation, Tyrus. [applause] They're not booing him. They're Tyrusing him."

You know someone who's lost a limb or been catastrophically wounded. And you know a Gold Star family who has been destroyed by this guy. So if you're an American and you can't get behind the death of this dude, two things. One. You suck.

And even as we speak right now, the A-listers are on the ground mopping up ancillary targets, collecting intelligence, and taking the fight to this dude.

See, there's -- can you see that? That's small. There it is. There's President Mike sitting in his cubicle. He's so sad. Sharing it with a vice president, maybe? This is pathetic, fist-bumping his chief of staff while the press secretary's over there trying to eat his lunch? [laughter] So that's Bloomberg's big important idea, cubicles? Boy is it stupid.

They predict Stacey Abrams will be Biden’s running mate if he’s the nominee -- maybe -- or Julian Castro if Elizabeth Warren is the nominee. Boy, that’s boring. They think Quentin Tarantino may finally win a Best Directing Oscar, and he should. And they think that my pain in my foot may be phlebitis.  [laughter] Thanks, Fortune, for including me in your predictions. I, for one, am excited about the twenties. They’ll be just like my actual twenties, but with less drugs and more toupee glue. So, what about our predictions? Is this new decade -- will we stop believing in media hoaxes?
