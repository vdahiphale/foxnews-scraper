You will decide whether or not Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi get their way.  Now, meanwhile, the RNC is appropriately calling the Democratic Party crazy town. Tonight, we will highlight the Democrats and their candidates that are up for election, including Congresswoman Waters, and those that are living up to their nickname. We're going to show you every Senate race that matters. We have identified on the show 75 House races that will determine the balance of power in the House. In other words, you might want to look and see if your district is in play tonight.  And we have a message for former President Obama. He's back in the spotlight, talking about his favorite topic, himself.   Plus, the deep state, house of cards literally now coming crashing down. Tonight, we are on the verge of breaking it wide open. Believe it or not, there are brand new text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. Now we know for a fact what the insurance man was, we have coordination between the DOJ and the FBI, and we have the evidence that they were to leak anti- Trump information to you, the public, in the spring of 2017 to destroy the president. Even Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann himself was allegedly involved in all of these dirty deep state leaks. We now know what that insurance policy was. This is yet another damning wrinkle in our investigation into deep state corruption. And meanwhile, the president looks poised to finally declassify critically previously redacted sections of FISA applications against former Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Oh, by the way, the coordination thing between the DOJ and FBI, it was about Carter Page. He will join us in just a few minutes. All right.

And if the election were held today, look, I'm always going to be honest with you, I am not confident in any way that Republicans hold the House.  And, of course, impeachment is only one part of the radical Democratic plan for America. Nothing on their agenda is to help you. They want to rescind the tax cuts. They think they deserve your money. They want to preserve Obamacare, bring back the individual mandate tax.  By the way, how's that Obamacare working, did you keep your doctor, your plan, paying less? They tried, and they will likely fail to block the Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court. But if there's another appointment, they will try and block it again and probably have more chances of success. We know they want open borders. We know they want to abolish ICE. They will definitely kill off all of the investigations into the deep state, which means the biggest corruption scandal, abuse of power scandal on our history. They will burden this president with what will be never-ending investigations into nothing. It will never stop. This is what is at stake in 57 days. All of the progress we've made as a country, in, what, 19 months, will stop dead in its tracks. It's over.   One congressional candidate actually wants to block funding to our number one ally in the Middle East, Israel, because of their discriminatory treatment of Palestinians. And there's one Democratic district attorney, candidate, wants to decriminalize, get this, trespassing and shoplifting and destruction of property. Jeez, we have no laws at all and so much more.  And don't forget the congressional candidate from Illinois who once compared Trump to Osama bin Laden. He's now claiming that actual Nazis are working in the White House. Which brings us back to Congresswoman Waters. She's bragging about her recent threats towards Trump administration officials. Now, imagine if Republicans are saying this and Obama was the president.

Democrats want to return to the status quo, you can't allow it to happen, or you can and you'll pay the price.  Too much is at stake including pivotal investigations into the deep state. Of course, the deep state never wanted Donald Trump to be president and for good reason. His administration is aggressively exposing what we now know to be a dark, seedy, corrupt underbelly of this country's massive federal bureaucracy. There is a swamp, there is a sewer, night after night, right here on this program, we keep bringing you damning information about how corrupt some of these officials are, some who have been hell-bent on defeating President Trump with lies and taking him down with lies. And tonight, even more breaking news. We thought we had them all, we don't. Brand new, tonight, text messages uncovered between former FBI love birds, Strzok and Page, proves everything we have been telling you for months. Look at this. A letter from Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein saying, quote, a review of these new documents suggests a coordinated effort on the part of the FBI and the Department of Justice to release information to the public domain potentially harmful to President Donald Trump's administration. They actually did it. Specifically, the spring of 2017, high level officials, leaking sensitive information about FISA warrants against one- time Trump campaign associate Carter Page who will join is in a few minutes. Look at this text from Strzok to Page, April 10th, 2017. Quote, I literally just gone to find this phone to tell you, I want to talk to you about media leak strategy with the DOJ before you go. OK, the DOJ and the FBI coordinating likes to the media. It's an ongoing investigation. On April 11th, 2017, the very next day, \"Washington Post\" publishes a story about Carter Page and his FISA application. Now, naturally, this led to multi-day media obsession about so-called Trump- Russia collusion. Let's go to the next day, April 12th, 2017, one day later, Strzok texting his girlfriend, Lisa Page, job well done all while referring to two derogatory articles about Carter Page. John Solomon reporting tonight this could have been an attempt to smear Carter Page. Why? In order to cast a negative light on the president and potentially spur new investigations.  And there's even more. Congressman Meadows points out other newly unearthed documents show that Mueller's pit bull, yes, we've told you about them, Andrew Weissmann, Robert Mueller, your number one guy, and other DOJ officials also leaked similar information to the press. They were coordinating the DOJ and FBI to lie. To lie to you, the American people. Why? To destroy the president. We now have discovered what the insurance policy is. You have all of these Trump-hating deep state actors, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, Andrew McCabe, and I'll add Christopher Steele to the list, they have one thing in common, they all hate President Trump. Remember, this was about a month before Andrew Weissmann's boss, Robert Mueller, started the phony witch hunt and he's still working for Mueller, Weissmann is. Now, this comes as President Trump looks poised to declassify important sections of Carter Page's FISA documents. And we're talking about everything that was shown to the \"Gang of Eight\", specifically the pages 10 through 12, 17 through 34, potentially we're told exculpatory information on Carter Page. Now, all of the associated footnotes, all the so-called 302s, which are the reports that say Bruce Ohr talking about Christopher Steele in the context, terms of what they were talking, this declassification can happen any time. Now, I haven't seen them, but according to my sources the information will be explosive. We'll ask Carter Page about that in a moment considering it's about him. And if he's such a danger, why hasn't he been charged with anything? Joining us now, author of number one New York Times best seller, \"The Russian Hoax: The Elicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, and Fox News investigative reporter and contributor, Sara Carter. Sara, we'll start with the news as we always do, and then we'll get Greg's analysis.  What's first? We have the FBI and DOJ colluding to leak phony Russian lies, to damage the president, the same DOJ that hired Mueller and the same Mueller team, Ohr, Steele, surrounding the information.",

House Republicans are renewing their push for the president to declassify a whole series of key documents after receiving a batch of new text messages from the FBI and the Justice Department that raise new questions about anti-Trump bias. In particular, Republican Mark Meadows firing off a letter to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, about these texts suggesting there was a coordinated effort by FBI and DOJ officials to leak damaging information about the president and some of his advisors to keep the Russia investigation alive. In particular, in April 10th, 2017, text exchange between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, suggest they have what they call a media leak strategy. The following day, \"The Washington Post\" published a story about FISA surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. Then on April 12th, Strzok congratulated his colleague over two negative articles about Carter Page saying that one was worse than the other for the Trump team. Strzok added, quote: well done.  Now, Mark Meadows' letter to Rosenstein, it's interesting it went to him, because remember, he signed off on one of the FISA warrants that continued the surveillance of Carter Page. Republicans want to see the president declassify documents that may shed more light on how the DOJ handled the investigations to both President Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton around the election. House Republicans also want to see the documents that may shed light on why Justice Department official Bruce Ohr kept such close touch with the former British spy, Christopher Steele, who, of course, put together the dossier that laid the ground work for the surveillance of Carter Page -- Sean.",

It is headed straight for the East Coast of the U.S., according to projections, as my friend Joe Bastardi says, this is a pattern hurricane, which means it's likely not going to change course. It's a cat four, it's 140 miles per hour, set to make landfall on Thursday in the Carolinas. Look, we love you. If you live in North Carolina, South Carolina, if you are in Virginia, Wilmington obviously it looks like ground zero right now. This storm is headed for you. Mandatory evacuations are now in place in certain areas. We urge you, please heed those warnings. You know what? We've seen enough damage. As a matter of fact, when hurricane Hugo went to the same area, this particular storm, hurricane Florence, is a slower moving storm. Hugo did so much damage in the Charleston area, the Carolinas, that literally, it decimated entire communities. You've got to take this seriously. We, remember, we can always rebuild homes. I know it's not easy come I know it's inconvenient, I know it's a pain but take your possessions, take your kids, take your animals, and if they tell you to evacuate, please get out. Please. There's the one time in my life I'll tell you to listen to government. And also pay your taxes. Those of you who don't they'll put you in jail. Anyway, please be careful. We are going to follow it here on the Fox News Channel throughout the week. And we are praying for all of you that are in harm's way. All right. We are always fair and balanced.

You will decide whether or not Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi get their way. Now, meanwhile, the RNC is appropriately calling the Democratic Party crazy town. Tonight, we will highlight the Democrats and their candidates that are up for election, including Congresswoman Waters, and those that are living up to their nickname. We're going to show you every Senate race that matters. We have identified on the show 75 House races that will determine the balance of power in the House. In other words, you might want to look and see if your district is in play tonight. And we have a message for former President Obama. He's back in the spotlight, talking about his favorite topic, himself. Plus, the deep state, house of cards literally now coming crashing down. Tonight, we are on the verge of breaking it wide open. Believe it or not, there are brand new text messages between Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. Now we know for a fact what the insurance man was, we have coordination between the DOJ and the FBI, and we have the evidence that they were to leak anti- Trump information to you, the public, in the spring of 2017 to destroy the president. Even Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann himself was allegedly involved in all of these dirty deep state leaks. We now know what that insurance policy was. This is yet another damning wrinkle in our investigation into deep state corruption. And meanwhile, the president looks poised to finally declassify critically previously redacted sections of FISA applications against former Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Oh, by the way, the coordination thing between the DOJ and FBI, it was about Carter Page. He will join us in just a few minutes. All right.

And if the election were held today, look, I'm always going to be honest with you, I am not confident in any way that Republicans hold the House. And, of course, impeachment is only one part of the radical Democratic plan for America. Nothing on their agenda is to help you. They want to rescind the tax cuts. They think they deserve your money. They want to preserve Obamacare, bring back the individual mandate tax. By the way, how's that Obamacare working, did you keep your doctor, your plan, paying less? They tried, and they will likely fail to block the Kavanaugh nomination to the Supreme Court. But if there's another appointment, they will try and block it again and probably have more chances of success. We know they want open borders. We know they want to abolish ICE. They will definitely kill off all of the investigations into the deep state, which means the biggest corruption scandal, abuse of power scandal on our history. They will burden this president with what will be never-ending investigations into nothing. It will never stop. This is what is at stake in 57 days. All of the progress we've made as a country, in, what, 19 months, will stop dead in its tracks. It's over. One congressional candidate actually wants to block funding to our number one ally in the Middle East, Israel, because of their discriminatory treatment of Palestinians. And there's one Democratic district attorney, candidate, wants to decriminalize, get this, trespassing and shoplifting and destruction of property. Jeez, we have no laws at all and so much more. And don't forget the congressional candidate from Illinois who once compared Trump to Osama bin Laden. He's now claiming that actual Nazis are working in the White House. Which brings us back to Congresswoman Waters. She's bragging about her recent threats towards Trump administration officials. Now, imagine if Republicans are saying this and Obama was the president.

None of them will increase your safety. Look at the screen. This is what is at stake. We have nine current tossup states in the Senate. If you are from one of those states, take a good look. We'll put it up every night between now and election night, including by the way, many with vulnerable incumbent Democrats. There's a huge opportunity mere. McCaskill, Missouri. Heitkamp, North Dakota. Nelson, Florida. Manchin, West Virginia. Donnelly, Indiana. And in the House, so many pivotal close races will decide the future of this presidency. See -- follow that, see if that's your district. We will run these every night. And if your House district that you see scrolling on your screen, if that goes blue, guess what?

And when you hear Democrats and their friends on the left, mainstream media calling Republicans, this is going to happen and it's happening, racist, sexist, misogynist, homophobic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, they want dirty air, water, and they want to kill children and throw granny over the cliff. That's what they say every election. Just know this happens every two and four years. Nothing more than the same old playbook, shameful political tactics because they want their power back. This is not about serving you. In their quest for more power, Democrats are now rolling out their savior, here he comes, the anointed one himself, Barack Obama.

And, of course, he took on more debt than every other president before him combined, anemic growth, burdensome regulation, billions of dollars in cash and other currency to the mullahs in Iran, all while they were actively funding terrorism around the world and chanting death to America and death to Israel.

But I want to talk about me. I'll say it again. Fifty-seven days from the most important election, midterm election in our lifetime. It's not easy to win a midterm. Democrats want to return to the status quo, you can't allow it to happen, or you can and you'll pay the price. Too much is at stake including pivotal investigations into the deep state. Of course, the deep state never wanted Donald Trump to be president and for good reason. His administration is aggressively exposing what we now know to be a dark, seedy, corrupt underbelly of this country's massive federal bureaucracy. There is a swamp, there is a sewer, night after night, right here on this program, we keep bringing you damning information about how corrupt some of these officials are, some who have been hell-bent on defeating President Trump with lies and taking him down with lies. And tonight, even more breaking news. We thought we had them all, we don't. Brand new, tonight, text messages uncovered between former FBI love birds, Strzok and Page, proves everything we have been telling you for months. Look at this. A letter from Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, to the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein saying, quote, a review of these new documents suggests a coordinated effort on the part of the FBI and the Department of Justice to release information to the public domain potentially harmful to President Donald Trump's administration. They actually did it. Specifically, the spring of 2017, high level officials, leaking sensitive information about FISA warrants against one- time Trump campaign associate Carter Page who will join is in a few minutes. Look at this text from Strzok to Page, April 10th, 2017. Quote, I literally just gone to find this phone to tell you, I want to talk to you about media leak strategy with the DOJ before you go. OK, the DOJ and the FBI coordinating likes to the media. It's an ongoing investigation. On April 11th, 2017, the very next day, \"Washington Post\" publishes a story about Carter Page and his FISA application. Now, naturally, this led to multi-day media obsession about so-called Trump- Russia collusion. Let's go to the next day, April 12th, 2017, one day later, Strzok texting his girlfriend, Lisa Page, job well done all while referring to two derogatory articles about Carter Page. John Solomon reporting tonight this could have been an attempt to smear Carter Page. Why? In order to cast a negative light on the president and potentially spur new investigations. And there's even more. Congressman Meadows points out other newly unearthed documents show that Mueller's pit bull, yes, we've told you about them, Andrew Weissmann, Robert Mueller, your number one guy, and other DOJ officials also leaked similar information to the press. They were coordinating the DOJ and FBI to lie. To lie to you, the American people. Why? To destroy the president. We now have discovered what the insurance policy is. You have all of these Trump-hating deep state actors, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, Andrew McCabe, and I'll add Christopher Steele to the list, they have one thing in common, they all hate President Trump. Remember, this was about a month before Andrew Weissmann's boss, Robert Mueller, started the phony witch hunt and he's still working for Mueller, Weissmann is. Now, this comes as President Trump looks poised to declassify important sections of Carter Page's FISA documents. And we're talking about everything that was shown to the \"Gang of Eight\", specifically the pages 10 through 12, 17 through 34, potentially we're told exculpatory information on Carter Page. Now, all of the associated footnotes, all the so-called 302s, which are the reports that say Bruce Ohr talking about Christopher Steele in the context, terms of what they were talking, this declassification can happen any time. Now, I haven't seen them, but according to my sources the information will be explosive. We'll ask Carter Page about that in a moment considering it's about him. And if he's such a danger, why hasn't he been charged with anything? Joining us now, author of number one New York Times best seller, \"The Russian Hoax: The Elicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, and Fox News investigative reporter and contributor, Sara Carter. Sara, we'll start with the news as we always do, and then we'll get Greg's analysis. What's first? We have the FBI and DOJ colluding to leak phony Russian lies, to damage the president, the same DOJ that hired Mueller and the same Mueller team, Ohr, Steele, surrounding the information."

I think this is going to be very important, moving forward, and I think this is the main reason why the president needs to declassify the rest of the documents that you just spoke about.

House Republicans are renewing their push for the president to declassify a whole series of key documents after receiving a batch of new text messages from the FBI and the Justice Department that raise new questions about anti-Trump bias. In particular, Republican Mark Meadows firing off a letter to the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, about these texts suggesting there was a coordinated effort by FBI and DOJ officials to leak damaging information about the president and some of his advisors to keep the Russia investigation alive. In particular, in April 10th, 2017, text exchange between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, suggest they have what they call a media leak strategy. The following day, \"The Washington Post\" published a story about FISA surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. Then on April 12th, Strzok congratulated his colleague over two negative articles about Carter Page saying that one was worse than the other for the Trump team. Strzok added, quote: well done. Now, Mark Meadows' letter to Rosenstein, it's interesting it went to him, because remember, he signed off on one of the FISA warrants that continued the surveillance of Carter Page. Republicans want to see the president declassify documents that may shed more light on how the DOJ handled the investigations to both President Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton around the election.

It's not a tactic that I think is a worthy one. But it does happen. So, I think we need to find out, I agree with Professor Dershowitz, that what we need is disclosure, disclosure, disclosure.

The first lady's approval rating is the highest, really, of the president, of everybody else in politics, certainly of anybody on the view. She's well liked for a reason, because she represents what makes this country great. Yes, immigration, people want to come to this country to become Americans. And then honor us with embracing the American ideal. That is what they hate, that is what they're going after, and it is why the president will be re-elected and why this nation -- I welcome it. It exposes the left for what they are."

      "utterance": "We do have a Fox News alert. And you've been hearing about hurricane Florence now miles off the coast. It's headed right to the Carolinas. Now beware. It is headed straight for the East Coast of the U.S., according to projections, as my friend Joe Bastardi says, this is a pattern hurricane, which means it's likely not going to change course. It's a cat four, it's 140 miles per hour, set to make landfall on Thursday in the Carolinas. Look, we love you. If you live in North Carolina, South Carolina, if you are in Virginia, Wilmington obviously it looks like ground zero right now. This storm is headed for you. Mandatory evacuations are now in place in certain areas. We urge you, please heed those warnings. You know what? We've seen enough damage. As a matter of fact, when hurricane Hugo went to the same area, this particular storm, hurricane Florence, is a slower moving storm. Hugo did so much damage in the Charleston area, the Carolinas, that literally, it decimated entire communities. You've got to take this seriously. We, remember, we can always rebuild homes. I know it's not easy come I know it's inconvenient, I know it's a pain but take your possessions, take your kids, take your animals, and if they tell you to evacuate, please get out. Please. There's the one time in my life I'll tell you to listen to government. And also pay your taxes. Those of you who don't they'll put you in jail. Anyway, please be careful. We are going to follow it here on the Fox News Channel throughout the week. And we are praying for all of you that are in harm's way. All right. We are always fair and balanced. We are not the destroy-Trump media. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham is standing by. Big show tonight, Laura. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.
