There were so few people willing to push back. I think it is important to highlight who some of those people were. Some of them are here at this network. Catherine Herridge at Fox News did wonderful reporting on this, Kim Strassel at the Wall Street Journal, Chuck Ross at the Daily Caller, deserves (INAUDIBLE) here, John Solomon (ph).  I believe those of us at The Federalist, we published stuff going on for more than two years. I would put up against anybody for a critical look at the conspiracy theory and how it was promulgated by the media. But it was incredibly difficult and it took a lot of courage. I don't think a lot of people actually ever believe -- I mean, it's kind of shocking how many people believed this crazy theory about Russia collusion, but many more people just lack the courage to speak against it in the face of hysteria.

The special counsel is created by the deputy attorney general who is a Trump appointee, who worked for Jeff Sessions, who is a Trump appointee. The Southern District of New York is a Trump appointee. I would understand these accusations a little bit more if the Democrats were in the world. But we don't.

If people come to view the institutions of law enforcement in the country as being led by partisan hacks who can't be trusted, people like Andrew McCabe who've had the kind of issue that they've had, then that's going to be a negative when it comes to the ability of us to trust these needed institutions going forward.

They've just been busy at work for the past 22 months. And in that 22 months, they've indicted 37 people for over 200 crimes and that's real crimes against the American people.",

      "utterance": "The media had an opportunity after the failures of their coverage of the 2016 campaign and election to really redouble their efforts to do a good job covering a man that they had trouble covering during the primary and during the election. Instead they rolled right into an absolutely deranged conspiracy theory that held the country hostage for more than two years and to come to this end is absolutely devastating. Their credibility was already very bad and now it is at an apocalyptic level event. It is unclear whether they will be able to return from this."

This was an information operation that was secretly funded as we learned a year and a half into it, secretly funded by Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. They weren't skeptical enough of what they were hearing from their sources. They also just leaned right into it. This is a broad failure of both the media and some other people."

I know that none of the three of us, none of you -- none of your 1.2 million viewers unless Bill Barr has taken a moment to watch TV knows what's in this report. We know one thing, it's over. We need to read it. Now, Mollie first is criticizing conspiracy theories then immediately creates new conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton is financing and there is a cabal of people behind everything that has happened. The \"people\" behind what happened is Donald Trump. True conspiracy theories are uranium one, are Seth Rich. There is no one including this network that is innocent on the front of boring into something. I would argue that what has been going on for the last two years is the most important constitutional problem we've had in 20 years, maybe much longer. The problem is, you know, we are not talking about what Russia did to us. Forget about whether Donald Trump (INAUDIBLE) and what we are doing about it. To this day, Donald Trump refuses to acknowledge it happened."

Sara, my question is, at times there was a drumbeat over every development involving White House aides, Jared, Ivanka, Don Jr., Michael Cohen, Roger Stone, will Trump sit down with Mueller, what did he say to Putin, did the media give the collective impression that the president of course was hiding some kind of collusion?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. And then it kind of sets me up, by the way, I want to give credit to Peter Baker of The New York Times for writing in his story about how this is a moment of reckoning for all institutions. He says, \"Have journalists connected too many dots that do not really add up?\" Mollie, what it has been like for you personally, the last two years, you have been taken a very definite view of this investigation which we are starting to hear about, to be up against a sort of media machine that has often pushed back against you and your view and dismissed you as you're just defending Trump and that sort of thing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "It's almost difficult to describe how difficult it was to be sceptic, particularly early on. I am not sure if people remember what it was like in December 2016 or January 2017 when this hysteria really got going and everybody collectively decided that it was totally logical to explain the 2016 election by this crazy conspiracy theory that the Russians and Donald Trump have colluded to steal it. There were so few people willing to push back. I think it is important to highlight who some of those people were. Some of them are here at this network. Catherine Herridge at Fox News did wonderful reporting on this, Kim Strassel at the Wall Street Journal, Chuck Ross at the Daily Caller, deserves (INAUDIBLE) here, John Solomon (ph). I believe those of us at The Federalist, we published stuff going on for more than two years. I would put up against anybody for a critical look at the conspiracy theory and how it was promulgated by the media. But it was incredibly difficult and it took a lot of courage. I don't think a lot of people actually ever believe -- I mean, it's kind of shocking how many people believed this crazy theory about Russia collusion, but many more people just lack the courage to speak against it in the face of hysteria. That is a journalistic problem. You need courage --"

So, as the media collectively have, you have seen this in recent weeks, moved away from the collusion part, it was clear that Mueller was wrapping up, the spotlight had seemed to shift, media spotlight to question of obstruction, why did he fire Comey, did he force out Sessions, did he explore firing Rosenstein, did he explore firing Mueller, which may be important. Obstruction of justice is a serious crime. People go to jail. But it's not the same as colluding with Russians. The Russians clearly were trying to interfere with the election. But what about the shift to this obstruction question?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "That's the big narrative question. Look, the report has been submitted. To an extent, yes, that part of it is somewhat over, but there is a lot of other unanswered questions, right, like obstruction of justice. That's why Democrats want to see everything revealed publicly. That's why they say they want full transparency over this, because those questions still matter. Even if this turns out that there is no collusion with Russia, it doesn't mean that we as media or the American people can walk away from other potentially really bad crimes. So, that's the point. What we are looking at here is the next step."

Sara, front page of The New York Times, I am going to hold this up, the lead story with Mueller's report, interest turns to New York, meaning the federal prosecutors in New York and their investigation. If when we see this report, there are no bombshells or huge bombshells, will news organizations simply move on to, hey, what about this? There are always other investigations, the one in New York or the Democratic investigation in the House. Will they just sort of take a breath and move on to the other?"

The other theory was that that would have been a very bad thing to do, that the Department of Justice did not behave appropriately when taking this information that really was bought and paid for Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee.

The whole way this investigation got going was in part through people leaking selective information to media outlets who didn't ask enough questions about why they were getting this information. We have criminal leaks about people which have not been well investigated, certainly have not been well covered. We have James Comey who took documents that he shouldn't have taken, Andrew McCabe lying to investigators which the inspector general found about, Christopher Steele who the guy who invented the dossier, lying to the FBI, and Glenn Simpson, the guy who managed the project, lying to Congress.

You had Chris Wallace of your own network who sat here only a couple of hours ago saying we have more to see. So I do think there is a balance being covered from both end. In very simple terms, the news covers what's happening. This is what is happening. On the law enforcement front, I think we have a couple of problems here. Until two months ago, the Democratic Party was really just in the desert. We were watching. The special counsel is created by the deputy attorney general who is a Trump appointee, who worked for Jeff Sessions, who is a Trump appointee. The Southern District of New York is a Trump appointee. I would understand these accusations a little bit more if the Democrats were in the world. But we don't. The problem with law enforcement, I think 25-50 years from now, they're all going to suffer for is there are two institutions that are important to American society, law enforcement which is formally part of the government, and media which is not but played an important role. They have both been decimated in terms of credibility. And we're all going to suffer for that."

Clearly we have had a breakdown of trust because of the unevenness in which the FBI is handling one campaign versus another and some political partisans versus others. There is a much effort that needs to be done to hold them accountable. Unfortunately, I think that our media are in no place to do that."

Final question for you, Sara, Joy Reid, MSNBC host, about 16 hours after Attorney General Barr got this report from the Mueller office, says, well, you know, Trump controls the Justice Department. This guy, meaning the A.G., is not recused. It feels like the seeds of a cover-up are here. Barr says he is going to go to the Hill and brief. Whether it is an adequate briefing, we can see.

Joining us now to analyze that coverage Ben Domenech, publisher of the Federalist, and Richard Fowler, radio host and Fox News contributor. Ben, we're almost in this sort of parallel universes. Much of the media has been sort of hammering away, day after day, month after month, which is goes on and on, and made it sound like the president was in severe danger of who knows what, indictment, being runout of Washington from this investigation. Then you have some of the president's defenders, including some here on Fox often echoing his attacks on Bob Mueller on the FBI, on the DOJ. How can it be that the same set of facts led to such wildly desperate conclusions and analysis?"

      "speaker": "BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the media needs to look at itself here and ask whether, to your point earlier regarding Peter Baker's question, did we connect too many dots here? Were we misled in a way that we hyped up this story to an irresponsible degree and led frankly the American people to believe a lot of things that weren't true? As recently as two weeks ago, you had the former head of the CIA John Brennan intimating on air that he thought that there would be a lot more people would be going to jail from the White House, obviously that does not look to be the case. And I think that in this situation we have to understand how much damage this does to the credibility of everyone involved. If people come to view the institutions of law enforcement in the country as being led by partisan hacks who can't be trusted, people like Andrew McCabe who've had the kind of issue that they've had, then that's going to be a negative when it comes to the ability of us to trust these needed institutions going forward. With the media as well, as they have driven and hyped up this thing to really, I think respond to a lot of folks in their audiences who were putting too much faith in this. That they were going to be somehow rescued from this presidency if they were opposed to him by these different forces that were going to stand up for some type of message that would remove the president from office. You know, just this past week there was a report from the Associated Press about the number of Americans who had named their new pets after Bob Mueller in some kind of hope that, you know, he was going to rescue."

But Richard, even if Mueller found no criminal collusion and even if he found no wrongdoing by Donald Trump personally, are conservative commentators justified in portraying his attacks on law enforcement as a necessary part of this debate?

And think it caused law enforcement to question are we truly accountable, are we truly transparent. And at the same time, I think it caused those in the liberal camp to save themselves. There are times when law enforcement is doing the right thing. And what we've seen from this Mueller investigation and from Robert Mueller and his team in itself is a team that has done no leaks, no grandstanding, no crazy press conferences. They've just been busy at work for the past 22 months. And in that 22 months, they've indicted 37 people for over 200 crimes and that's real crimes against the American people."

I mean, to the point where you know, you had the commentary from Elizabeth Warren about whether he was, you know, going to be in jail or not going forward. This is a situation where I think law enforcement is now, to Richard's point, running the risk of becoming so weaponized and viewed as a tool for partisan entities. That going forward, when we actually have investigations like this play out there is going to be real lack of trust. I, personally, I'm very skeptical of those sorts of organizations. I think we have to be even more skeptical of the sources in media who ran over and over again with stories that would then be debunked but then it seemed like they would go back to those same wells over and over again."

Washington Post headlines there's lots of stories like this. \"Trump's legal troubles are far from over even as Mueller probe ends.\" So, it goes to my question about investment.

And this was certainly not a good week to experience the kind of flurry of hatred that gets thrown after you when the president of the United States attacks you. Just to be clear and with no offense to you, Howie. John McCain didn't give a rat's ass what Donald Trump thought of him in life. I don't think that that's changed. And the fact is these two men never got along. There was a lot of animosity, there was a lot of tension between the two of them. But I also think that in this instance the president is actually wrong in what he's saying this is a factual matter. By the time that John McCain handed this dossier over to James Comey the investigation had already been spun up into Carter Page and everything else had been going on already. And he did not hand it to the media, he handed it to James Comey.

    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Just to correct that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Senator McCain did cast the deciding vote against what was then called the skinny attempt the third attempt to repeal Obamacare. So, despite his passing, that's why he said passing, why shouldn't the president be able to point these things out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "I think the president can say whatever he wants. And I think that actually to Meghan's point, if John was around, he would just be laughing it off. You know, he had a very tough skin, I think himself. You know, one of the differences between Senator McCain and the president is I think the president really struggles in any situation where he feels like he didn't get the last word. And I think in this case, Senator McCain kind of had the last word on their relationship and how he viewed the country. Then the way that that funeral played out and who spoke to it. And that's the thing that I think is going to be part of a lasting legacy on his behalf. You know, when the president does do these things, I think that to the point that their colleague Laura Ingraham was making, he steps on his own message and then weaken, which he should be feeling, very vindicated I think by the outcome of this Mueller probe. Instead, this was a week dominated by him crapping all over the legacy of an American that for many of us is an American hero who should be respected."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. But as you know, I mean, John McCain was an absolute war hero. He spent five years in a Vietnam prison camp. But he was not a saint. He had his flaws as anybody would have made. He used to joke about being the last in his class in Annapolis. And so, you know, there was a lot of coverage of his passing and the funeral and I think the president was not happy with that. What do you make of someone like Lindsey Graham, the senator who was McCain's best friend in the Senate, who, at one time, denounced Donald Trump attacks on McCain during the campaign, and now making only very tepid remarks? And that's been true with some other Republicans as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "You know, the senator is someone who has to make decisions based on politics and not just personality. I think he's a very clever man. And I think that he sees the political dynamics in his state. I do wish that he would be a little bit more outspoken about someone for whom. You know, he had a relationship that was almost familial in terms of their past. They had a lot of tension near the end obviously, as I think a lot of people know. Because of the closeness of Senator Graham's relationship with the president and he's declining repeatedly to sort of take stronger issue with some of the things that he did say. But just to the overall question, I think. The overall question here from me is more, you know, is this something that the president is just going to be focused on to the end of his tenure? Is this just the way things are going to go for the rest of our lives?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But is it harder for you? Because, you know, we all get involved in this medium and political arguments. But this is, was in the end more recently for you a member of your family, is it just been hard for you to see this unfold?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "You know, it's hard for me because I know that what is a grieving family and then particularly a grieving widow and grieving children don't deserve this kind of treatment. And that it really comes out of I think a perspective of real resentment on the part of the president. And I think that, you know, when you see the commander-in-chief, someone who, you know, my own family and Senator McCain's children currently serving under him in the armed forces. That's not what you want to feel like when it comes to the way that you view him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "In commenting on President Trump's record, the Mueller investigation, and overseeing the Federalist, do you, is it hard for you to separate your personal feelings about this matter from talking about Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "I don't think so. Because from my perspective, you know, you should evaluate the president base on his policies and on what he does more than anything else. But I do think that in this case I wish that the president would spend more time on those issues and less time settling personal grievances. Whether it's against the family members or people who he dislikes or against those with whom he's had previous beefs. Of course, to your point, the senator's record is his record. And in his final book in fact, he questioned and was self-deprecating about certain aspects of it. Even to the point of writing that he thought that in retrospect, the Iraq war and knowing what we know now --"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Which is a pretty big statement. I mean, when you're looking at legacy items, I wish that -- I wish that we would see that kind of personal assessment on the part of the president as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Ben Domenech, I appreciate you coming in this Sunday and thanks for those personal thoughts. We will be back in just a moment. We'll talk about what's going on Capitol Hill which is anxiously awaiting on the Mueller report and how the politics and coverage there are playing out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "As we continue our coverage of the Mueller report, joining me now, Mike Emanuel, Fox News chief congressional correspondent. And Mike, as Capitol Hill awaits a briefing on the report from Attorney General Barr, probably or possibly today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Should reporters push back on partisan Russian conclusion? I want to give you an example from each side. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal told MSNBC, \"The facts and evidence here are likely to show a lot of criminality.\" Based on what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Right, exactly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Member of the House Republican leadership Steve Scalise. \"The only collusion was between Democrats and many in the media who peddled this lie because they continue to refuse to accept the results of the 2016 election. Hash tag witch hunt.\" So, what is the role of journalists when lawmakers, politicians of either party just make this kind of declarations and none of us have seen the report?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, you know, in this Twitter era there is this rush for instant gratification. You want to be able to say Mueller report is a big nothing burger if you're a Republican."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "And Democrats they want to say well, we're going to take a look at the final print because maybe we can impeach the president. And so --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "By the way, instant gratification I think that applies to people who appear before cameras as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Because we hate saying, you know, we don't really know, folks. You got to wait maybe tomorrow or maybe the next day. Everyone wants to have a take, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Right. So, I think as old school journalists --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "-- you know, print down the fingers, you want to make sure, do your homework. I want to read the report. I don't want to go tell people there is nothing here until I've actually read it and see for myself. And so, I think you have to hold those accountable and say well, how can you say that? You haven't seen the report yet, and that sort of thing. And so, I think we have to be tough on them and we have to be tough on ourselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "We have to be tough on ourselves. I've got of income in my fingers, by the way, over the years. We do, and it's a very polarized audience. For example, a new Fox News poll out today, who do you trust to tell the truth on the Russia investigation. Democrats, 80 percent said Mueller, 2 percent said Trump. The Republicans, 62 percent said Trump, 11 percent said Mueller. So, I think that's one of the reasons that almost no matter what you or I report of our colleagues you get a lot of flak from both sides, all sides."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "No question about that. It was kind of interesting to see over the past couple of weeks you had the Democrats in the House kind of pivot away from Robert Mueller a bit to say, or Jerrold Nadler saying I'm sending out 81 letters saying I need information looking to broaden his investigation. Nancy Pelosi took some pressure on the impeachment front saying not now. And so, you know, basically trying to get some cover I think to some of her moderates where impeachment may not play well in their district."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, it's interesting you brought this up since the Mueller investigation is now over and we'll see what's in the report. But we now know no more indictments, and that's significant. Do you see the press now covering the hell out of the Democratic investigations on the Hill, the investigation in New York as a way of sort of filling the void that will be left by the end of the Mueller probe? And if so, is it possible that the public will lose some interest because Mueller was big enchilada?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Again, we have to read the record. But I think it will be interesting to see if polling afterwards says the American public has had enough. Two years of investigation assuming there's not a bomb shell in the report. The polling suggests that American people want to move forward and allow the president finish out his term and then the 2020 campaign will kick off. And so, you know, but that doesn't mean the Democrats will give up. As you know, the noisiest voices --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "-- in the base quite often drive things. And so, there may be a possibility of overreach if the American public has had enough and allow these voices who are saying keep going."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Of course, other investigations should be covered. I'm just saying it's going to hour after hour after hour of nonstop coverage. Finally, do you think you are going to end up covering a battle over just how much from the report will be released, redactions, execute privilege? Is that the next twist in the partisan warfare here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "I think it's going to be interesting to see whether the White House says we need some executive privilege of some of the underlying documents. Interesting how many Republicans and Democrats have come out and said, yes, we should all see the report."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "By the way, President Trump said he has no problem with it being made public. But of course, the devil is in the details, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Right. Because he hasn't read it yet and his team hasn't read it yet, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Long day had for you, I suspect, especially if Mr. Barr makes his way from DOJ where he has reportedly, he'd be working this morning up to Capitol Hill. Mike Emanuel, thanks very much for standing by."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Howie, always a pleasure. Thank you."
