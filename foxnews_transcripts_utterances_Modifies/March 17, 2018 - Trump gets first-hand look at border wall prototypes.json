And so, this is what the Democrats are what you call half-a-planners, right? Trump is a planner. Democrats are half-a-planners, so a Democrats will say, \"Step one, I wish. Step two, see step one. Step three, raise taxes.\" The only exception here is that Trump -- I mean, Trump says step one, build the wall. Step two, let everybody in that should be in.

SpaceX founder and my Pilates instructor, Elon Musk said recently that humans must colonize Mars to preserve our species in case of a Third World War. That is because \"It is far enough away from earth that it's more likely to survive than a moon base if there is a Third World War. We want to make sure there's enough of a seed of human civilization somewhere else to bring it back.\" His company shipped the Big Falcon rocket. It will undergo test flights next year with the goal of landing on Mars in 2022. The first missions will send cargo, but Musk says the first manned missions promised to be, \"Difficult, dangerous, involve a good chance you will die and full of excitement for those who survive.\" That is exactly how I describe it, each weekend with Bill Hemmer.
