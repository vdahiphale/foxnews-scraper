I don't think that tweeting and the defensiveness and the way the media now has to go and double check every victim, all that stuff is incredibly ugly.

And I'm all in favor of investigation to find out, there has to be oversight, they do oversight about any time an American troop dies. But one of the things that kind of perplexes me is that in terms of the messaging on this as a political matter, Donald Trump actually has a great story to tell about basically breaking the back of ISIS. And one of the complications that come from essentially defeating them as a territorial power is you get this sort of runoff, metastasized elements throughout Africa and the Middle East that are going to require a lot of this kind of thing. And it seems to me it would be in the White House's interest and it would also be true to put it in that larger context and say, look, we're making enormous strides on the campaign promise to defeat ISIS, and at the same time we're going to have a lot of these kinds of issues because they're fleeing all over the place trying to set up places in ungoverned spaces.",
