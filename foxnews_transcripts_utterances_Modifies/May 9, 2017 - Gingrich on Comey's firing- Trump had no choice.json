      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News Alert. President Trump fires the FBI Director James Comey. We will have a full and complete reaction to tonight's big breaking news. It is what the mainstream media will never tell you tonight. Newt Gingrich, Laura Ingraham, Lou Dobbs, Sara Carter, Jay Sekulow. But first, kicking Comey to the curb! This is the first step in President Trump draining the deep state swamp. And that is tonight's and perhaps my most important \"Opening Monologue\" ever.  And welcome back to \"Hannity.\"  All right, we're going to cut through all of the noise, all of the nonsense on this program tonight and tell you exactly what the left and destroy Trump media will not tell you.  James Comey, the former now FBI director, is a national embarrassment. It's that plain, it's that simple. And frankly, he's very lucky that President Trump kept him around this long because of his now unhinged and very erratic behavior. Now, firing James Comey was absolutely the single right thing for this president to do. It's good for the country, and let me tell you why.  Comey has failed you, the American people, on a spectacular level! And at every single turn, the FBI director disrespected the Constitution, he showed he does not care about the equal application of the rule of law being applied equally American. He has now stood by while our 4th Amendment rights have been trampled upon. And worst of all, he has created in this country how a two-tiered justice system, one for Hillary and Bill Clinton, and one for the rest of America. It's become a travesty. Comey tonight should be ashamed of himself. Now, let's start with facts, and Hillary Clinton and the private email server that she used purposely to circumvent what is known as congressional oversight. Here are the facts, plain and simple. Hillary Clinton's server contained top-secret special access programs -- in other words, the highest level of classified information on her computer. She deleted over 30,000 emails on that computer, claiming they were personal. They were about yoga, weddings, grandchildren and emailing Bill Clinton, who never had an email account. This was a lie from the get-go.  And what's so despicable about this is back in July, when Comey made his big announcement on Hillary Clinton and the investigation, he acknowledged all of these facts, which, by the way, is an acknowledgment that crimes were committed!   Take a look.",

Eight of those chains contained information that was top-secret at the time they were sent. Thirty-six of those chains contained secret information at the time, and eight contained confidential information at the time. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional emails were up-classified to make them confidential. None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system. But their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers, not even supported by full- time security staff, like those found at agencies and departments of the United States government or even with a commercial email service like Gmail.",

      "sentences": "What you saw right there was James Comey laying out the legal case against Hillary Clinton, and then, inexcusably, after 13 minutes of a stinging indictment, he let her off the hook! And Comey completely ignored all the laws that Hillary Clinton broke, which you can see on the side of your screen. Nobody in the mainstream media, the destroy Trump media, is telling you this tonight.   Now, if you or I, anybody in this audience, did anything close to what Hillary Clinton did, you would be put in jail. You would be perp walked, fingerprinted, you would be mugshotted and put in jail. But James Comey proved himself to be, in the end, nothing more, sadly, than a political hack. And he didn't deliver equal justice under the law.  Now, was this because Comey thought Hillary was going to win and become the president? I don't know, I won't speculate. But what I do know is that Comey was only three years into his 10-year term. So tonight, we will connect the dots for you. For example, let's talk about the Clinton Foundation and the alleged pay- to-play scheme. Now, the Clintons, they lined their pockets -- millions and millions of dollars -- while Hillary was serving as secretary of state. Now, the evidence of wrongdoing is incontrovertible, overwhelming, yet Comey sat on the sidelines. And Clinton even give up 20 percent of this nation's uranium to Vladimir Putin in this corrupt Uranium One deal. She personally, as secretary of state, had to sign off on that 20 percent going to Putin!  The evidence of wrongdoing is overwhelming. And by the way, James Comey, the destroy Trump media, the radical left, they sat on the sidelines! They ignored the rule of law. And I want to add one thing to this. Twenty percent -- meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation lined their pockets with millions, Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees when he spoke in Moscow?  Let me give you another example. More recently, there's the egregious violation of our 4th Amendment rights with Americans like General Flynn who were incidentally caught up in foreign surveillance, they were unmasked. That intelligence, a felony, leaked to the press by any measure -- the one crime that we know was definitely committed in the case of General Flynn didn't bother Comey one bit. Sally Yates even said yesterday she was never asked about this by Comey. He did nothing to get to the truth, to get answers about who leaked information about General Mike Flynn, a felony under the Espionage Act.  And the incompetent Comey? He did nothing to stop this false lie that has been advanced for so many months that Russia was colluding with then-candidate Trump and then-transition team Trump. He should've, for the sake of this country, out this to rest once and for all.   Now, in his letter firing Comey, the president revealed Comey told him on three separate occasions he's not being investigated. Why didn't the FBI director come forward and tell that to you, the American people? Especially since he was so quick to divulge information exonerating Hillary Clinton, who he laid out the case violated the law? Even James Clapper yesterday said that the Russian collusion talking point was not based on fact at all! It's all predicated on one big lie, on innuendo, on bizarre conspiracies. So you know what? To James Comey, good riddance. He deserves everything he got tonight. He has earned this. Although the media, which loves Hillary, didn't want Trump to win, didn't think Trump would win, they'll never tell you this.  Also, speaking of the mainstream media, they're losing their minds tonight over this. They have gone completely insane. They're not giving you the truth or the facts that we just gave you, and they're trying to turn this into a scandal that it is not because they've been trying to destroy this president, delegitimize him from day one.  Here's some evidence. Remember WikiLeaks, what they revealed? The alt-left propaganda destroy Trump media was proven again and again to have colluded with the Clinton campaign. They were her biggest donor, they were in her corner. They wanted Hillary elected, just like they never vetted -- remember back in the day, we were talking about Reverend Wright, ACORN, Alinsky, Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn? They never told you the truth about Obama. They never told you after eight years how he failed spectacularly. They've been gunning for President Trump since day one. Is it any surprise they're trying to destroy this president tonight? And then of course, there's the Democrats. There's Chucky Schumer, crocodile tears himself, foaming at the mouth earlier tonight over this news. Listen to the feigned outrage of Chuck Schumer, the selective moral outrage of Chuck Schumer after Comey was fired tonight. Watch this.",

JOHN PODESTA, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIR, \"THIS WEEK\"/ABC, NOV. 6, 2016: We're all disturbed, first of all, by the letter, which really broke precedent, was over the advice of the leaders of the leaders in the Justice Department. You know, I'm not challenging Mr. Comey's motivation, but I do think it was unwarranted, it was a mistake. SCHUMER, OCT. 31, 2016: She's got a big burden of proof, so to speak, on him for why he did what seems to be such an appalling act that goes against the tradition of prosecutors at every level of government. It was -- when I heard about it, I found it hard to believe that Comey, who I thought had some degree of integrity, would do this.  REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., NOV. 2, 2016: I think he made a mistake on this, and he clearly has a double standard. In these jobs, if you're not in it for a while, you can't take the heat.

      "sentences": "Well, look, I think the key fact is that the brand-new deputy attorney general, who's a 30-year career professional in the Justice Department, who was President Barack Obama's U.S. attorney for Maryland, who was just two weeks ago endorsed by the Senate 94 to 6 -- this is the person who wrote the letter, which is devastating, and said that it's clear that Comey cannot lead the FBI, that he has made such a significant series of mistakes that has crippled the morale of the FBI. And in that letter, he goes through citing attorney general after attorney general after attorney general all of them saying what Comey has done violates totally the FBI.   So you're President Trump, you have the deputy attorney general, who everybody agrees is a nonpartisan, widely approved career professional, sends a letter to the attorney general and says, If we're going to rebuild the FBI, Comey has to go. The attorney general says, All right, I agree with you. He puts a cover letter on, it shows up on President Trump's desk.  What I would say to the Democrats is, if the president of the United States gets a letter like that from a career professional who you just voted for, how could he do anything else except accept the letter and fire the director of the FBI because you'd be looking at this career professional and deciding that he didn't know what he was talking about. And that's why I think the Democrats and the elite media tonight have this very, very difficult job of trying to convince the rest of us that somehow, magically, this Barack Obama U.S. attorney, 30-year professional somehow was turned by the Trump team and is now an agent of Donald Trump. I don't believe that. I think what he did -- and he has -- people should read the actual letter. He cites attorney general after attorney general from both parties saying that this was exactly wrong and that Comey, in fact, violated the rules of the Justice Department, the principles of the FBI, and is not capable of rebuilding the FBI. Now, I think at that point, President Trump, frankly, had no choice.",

And he goes on to say, \"And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees the director made serious mistakes. It is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspective\" -- which we saw the comments of some of the left from when they didn't like what Comey was doing. And then it goes on to say, the director was wrong to usurp (ph) the attorney general's authority, announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution -- it is not the function of the director to make such an announcement!   At most, a director shouldn't -- it goes on -- completed the investigation, presented its findings to federal prosecutors. Now he defends his decision by asserting that he believed the attorney general at the time was in conflict.  But the FBI director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the attorney general. Wow! That is a powerful indictment against James Comey.",

It's written by a 30-year career professional, President Obama's choice to be the U.S. attorney for Maryland and a man who the U.S. Senate voted 94 to 6 just two weeks ago saying this is a man of great integrity. And when you read the letter -- and of course, it goes on at great length. When you read the letter, you realize that Comey -- who by the way, as you know, in the last two weeks, we've had Hillary Clinton on television saying that Comey was a major reason she lost. And it's kind of weird. You'd think the Democrats would be saying, yes, I always thought what he did was wrong. Now they're saying, Oh, no, no, you shouldn't get rid of him, even though they were all for getting rid of him. Hillary Clinton, I suspect, thinks he should have been gone.  But this also fits another pattern. If Donald Trump walks out in the morning and says the American flag is red, white and blue, a significant number of the elite media will say No, no, it's fuschia. Don't you understand that it's fuschia? Because they're not going to accept Donald Trump saying anything. And in this case, Trump was the executor who of the judgment of the attorney general and the deputy attorney general who decisively said to him, You must fire Comey.  And I think it's important to put in context what Trump is doing here. It's not about the campaign. It's not about Trump's personal view. It's the commander-in-chief, president of the United States, getting a document from his attorney general that says we cannot rebuild the FBI as long as this guy is in charge.",

He's the one that, leading the FBI, failed to move on issues that were so clear. Why was there not an investigation that came to a conclusion other than him acting as the attorney general, which is not his job, regarding the e-mail servers? We go back to that. I go back even further than that, Sean. What about the fake investigation that the FBI engaged in with those IRS cases? I litigated those cases and I had some of our clients participating in those -- that so-called FBI investigation. It was put-up (ph). And this is -- you know, James Comey -- and this is without disrespect to the FBI because the FBI does do great work. But this director of the FBI should have been fired, has been fired, and asked for it himself. I've been saying it for a year. The problem here is he decided he was going to become the judge and jury in these matters, and that was not the role of the FBI director. I can give you the litany of cases that should have been investigated, everything from the unmasking to the disclosures to the leaks to the media to the Clinton e-mail server issue, which we've talked about at length. But at the end of the day, this director of the FBI was not a leader. And what he did was politicize a branch of government, a portion of government that should not be. And look, he serves at the pleasure of the president. Yes, he had a 10-year term. Guess what? That term ended today. And it was his own undoing. He had to go back to the Congress today to clarify again testimony he gave.",

I remember when he came out and said there was a lack of intent -- because they didn't want to prosecute Hillary Clinton because of this lack of intent to prove that she was going to do anything wrong with the classified material. You don't need to prove anything. The fact that she mishandled classified materials through gross negligence is enough to prosecute. And that should have been left up -- even if Loretta Lynch wouldn't have prosecuted her, that should've been left up to her to make that decision and not Director Comey.

For whatever reason, Donald Trump didn't do that. I don't know if at the time he thought, well, that would look bad because there are rumors of these investigations and so forth. But it does I think remind us -- his instinct I bet, I'm just betting, his instinct was to fire Comey. And my instinct is that he didn't follow his instinct. No one had confidence in Comey. The Democrats didn't have confidence in him after he sent the letter to Congress 11 days before the election, only a few days later to say, oh, sorry, there's no problem in the emails sent to Anthony Weiner. He also did the non-indictment indictment of Hillary Clinton with the handling of the classified information, the private server. That was that bizarre press conference he did where he seemed to kind of convict her or charge her only to say, no, we couldn't find the requisite intent that many say isn't really required under that statute. So I think he really damaged his own reputation. He came in as kind of a straight shooter, but by the end no one trusted him. So it was about time that the Justice Department recommended his removal.",

You have a crime that was committed and the FBI director seems woefully uninterested, incurious about finding out what really went on. So again, the left was not happy with him.

During his testimony this week, he also got two key facts wrong which the Justice Department had to come back and correct after the testimony both about the number of emails that were sent to Anthony Weiner's computer and how Huma Abedin actually transmitted them. Most of them are automatically downloaded when she was updating her computer. She didn't send thousands and thousands of emails.

I was a government lawyer when I began my career and I had the honor of serving on the faculty the Department of Justice during when John Ashcroft was the attorney general. Here is what you do. Within the Department of Justice itself, within the FBI itself, you create a unit that looks at all of this new. New agents, new review, and every one of these issues, Sean, that Sara and that Lou have laid out, including that IRS case that I litigated, need to be looked at from the beginning.

He said he was going to drain the swamp. This was the beginning of that drain or certainly a continuation of that drain. But let me just say this, Director Comey, with due respect to the office of the director of the FBI, dropped this on himself. It is going to take a new director to fix this.

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News Alert. President Trump fires the FBI Director James Comey. We will have a full and complete reaction to tonight's big breaking news. It is what the mainstream media will never tell you tonight. Newt Gingrich, Laura Ingraham, Lou Dobbs, Sara Carter, Jay Sekulow. But first, kicking Comey to the curb! This is the first step in President Trump draining the deep state swamp. And that is tonight's and perhaps my most important \"Opening Monologue\" ever. And welcome back to \"Hannity.\" All right, we're going to cut through all of the noise, all of the nonsense on this program tonight and tell you exactly what the left and destroy Trump media will not tell you. James Comey, the former now FBI director, is a national embarrassment. It's that plain, it's that simple. And frankly, he's very lucky that President Trump kept him around this long because of his now unhinged and very erratic behavior. Now, firing James Comey was absolutely the single right thing for this president to do. It's good for the country, and let me tell you why. Comey has failed you, the American people, on a spectacular level! And at every single turn, the FBI director disrespected the Constitution, he showed he does not care about the equal application of the rule of law being applied equally American. He has now stood by while our 4th Amendment rights have been trampled upon. And worst of all, he has created in this country how a two-tiered justice system, one for Hillary and Bill Clinton, and one for the rest of America. It's become a travesty. Comey tonight should be ashamed of himself. Now, let's start with facts, and Hillary Clinton and the private email server that she used purposely to circumvent what is known as congressional oversight. Here are the facts, plain and simple. Hillary Clinton's server contained top-secret special access programs -- in other words, the highest level of classified information on her computer. She deleted over 30,000 emails on that computer, claiming they were personal. They were about yoga, weddings, grandchildren and emailing Bill Clinton, who never had an email account. This was a lie from the get-go. And what's so despicable about this is back in July, when Comey made his big announcement on Hillary Clinton and the investigation, he acknowledged all of these facts, which, by the way, is an acknowledgment that crimes were committed! Take a look."

      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "From the group of 30,000 emails returned to the State Department in 2014, 110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. Eight of those chains contained information that was top-secret at the time they were sent. Thirty-six of those chains contained secret information at the time, and eight contained confidential information at the time. Separate from those, about 2,000 additional emails were up-classified to make them confidential. None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system. But their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers, not even supported by full- time security staff, like those found at agencies and departments of the United States government or even with a commercial email service like Gmail."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "What you saw right there was James Comey laying out the legal case against Hillary Clinton, and then, inexcusably, after 13 minutes of a stinging indictment, he let her off the hook! And Comey completely ignored all the laws that Hillary Clinton broke, which you can see on the side of your screen. Nobody in the mainstream media, the destroy Trump media, is telling you this tonight. Now, if you or I, anybody in this audience, did anything close to what Hillary Clinton did, you would be put in jail. You would be perp walked, fingerprinted, you would be mugshotted and put in jail. But James Comey proved himself to be, in the end, nothing more, sadly, than a political hack. And he didn't deliver equal justice under the law. Now, was this because Comey thought Hillary was going to win and become the president? I don't know, I won't speculate. But what I do know is that Comey was only three years into his 10-year term. So tonight, we will connect the dots for you. For example, let's talk about the Clinton Foundation and the alleged pay- to-play scheme. Now, the Clintons, they lined their pockets -- millions and millions of dollars -- while Hillary was serving as secretary of state. Now, the evidence of wrongdoing is incontrovertible, overwhelming, yet Comey sat on the sidelines. And Clinton even give up 20 percent of this nation's uranium to Vladimir Putin in this corrupt Uranium One deal. She personally, as secretary of state, had to sign off on that 20 percent going to Putin! The evidence of wrongdoing is overwhelming. And by the way, James Comey, the destroy Trump media, the radical left, they sat on the sidelines! They ignored the rule of law. And I want to add one thing to this. Twenty percent -- meanwhile, the Clinton Foundation lined their pockets with millions, Bill Clinton doubled his speaking fees when he spoke in Moscow? Let me give you another example. More recently, there's the egregious violation of our 4th Amendment rights with Americans like General Flynn who were incidentally caught up in foreign surveillance, they were unmasked. That intelligence, a felony, leaked to the press by any measure -- the one crime that we know was definitely committed in the case of General Flynn didn't bother Comey one bit. Sally Yates even said yesterday she was never asked about this by Comey. He did nothing to get to the truth, to get answers about who leaked information about General Mike Flynn, a felony under the Espionage Act. And the incompetent Comey? He did nothing to stop this false lie that has been advanced for so many months that Russia was colluding with then-candidate Trump and then-transition team Trump. He should've, for the sake of this country, out this to rest once and for all. Now, in his letter firing Comey, the president revealed Comey told him on three separate occasions he's not being investigated. Why didn't the FBI director come forward and tell that to you, the American people? Especially since he was so quick to divulge information exonerating Hillary Clinton, who he laid out the case violated the law? Even James Clapper yesterday said that the Russian collusion talking point was not based on fact at all! It's all predicated on one big lie, on innuendo, on bizarre conspiracies. So you know what? To James Comey, good riddance. He deserves everything he got tonight. He has earned this. Although the media, which loves Hillary, didn't want Trump to win, didn't think Trump would win, they'll never tell you this. Also, speaking of the mainstream media, they're losing their minds tonight over this. They have gone completely insane. They're not giving you the truth or the facts that we just gave you, and they're trying to turn this into a scandal that it is not because they've been trying to destroy this president, delegitimize him from day one. Here's some evidence. Remember WikiLeaks, what they revealed? The alt-left propaganda destroy Trump media was proven again and again to have colluded with the Clinton campaign. They were her biggest donor, they were in her corner. They wanted Hillary elected, just like they never vetted -- remember back in the day, we were talking about Reverend Wright, ACORN, Alinsky, Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dohrn? They never told you the truth about Obama. They never told you after eight years how he failed spectacularly. They've been gunning for President Trump since day one. Is it any surprise they're trying to destroy this president tonight? And then of course, there's the Democrats. There's Chucky Schumer, crocodile tears himself, foaming at the mouth earlier tonight over this news. Listen to the feigned outrage of Chuck Schumer, the selective moral outrage of Chuck Schumer after Comey was fired tonight. Watch this."

This investigation must be run as far away as possible from this White House and as far away as possible from anyone that President Trump has appointed. Given the way the president fired Director Comey, any person who he appoints to lead the Russia investigation will be concerned that he or she will meet the same fate as Director Comey if they run afoul of the administration."

Now tonight, they love him. Watch this. JOHN PODESTA, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN CHAIR, \"THIS WEEK\"/ABC, NOV. 6, 2016: We're all disturbed, first of all, by the letter, which really broke precedent, was over the advice of the leaders of the leaders in the Justice Department. You know, I'm not challenging Mr. Comey's motivation, but I do think it was unwarranted, it was a mistake. SCHUMER, OCT. 31, 2016: She's got a big burden of proof, so to speak, on him for why he did what seems to be such an appalling act that goes against the tradition of prosecutors at every level of government. It was -- when I heard about it, I found it hard to believe that Comey, who I thought had some degree of integrity, would do this. REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., NOV. 2, 2016: I think he made a mistake on this, and he clearly has a double standard. In these jobs, if you're not in it for a while, you can't take the heat.

    {
      "speaker": "NEWT GINGRICH, R-FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think the key fact is that the brand-new deputy attorney general, who's a 30-year career professional in the Justice Department, who was President Barack Obama's U.S. attorney for Maryland, who was just two weeks ago endorsed by the Senate 94 to 6 -- this is the person who wrote the letter, which is devastating, and said that it's clear that Comey cannot lead the FBI, that he has made such a significant series of mistakes that has crippled the morale of the FBI. And in that letter, he goes through citing attorney general after attorney general after attorney general all of them saying what Comey has done violates totally the FBI. So you're President Trump, you have the deputy attorney general, who everybody agrees is a nonpartisan, widely approved career professional, sends a letter to the attorney general and says, If we're going to rebuild the FBI, Comey has to go. The attorney general says, All right, I agree with you. He puts a cover letter on, it shows up on President Trump's desk. What I would say to the Democrats is, if the president of the United States gets a letter like that from a career professional who you just voted for, how could he do anything else except accept the letter and fire the director of the FBI because you'd be looking at this career professional and deciding that he didn't know what he was talking about. And that's why I think the Democrats and the elite media tonight have this very, very difficult job of trying to convince the rest of us that somehow, magically, this Barack Obama U.S. attorney, 30-year professional somehow was turned by the Trump team and is now an agent of Donald Trump. I don't believe that. I think what he did -- and he has -- people should read the actual letter. He cites attorney general after attorney general from both parties saying that this was exactly wrong and that Comey, in fact, violated the rules of the Justice Department, the principles of the FBI, and is not capable of rebuilding the FBI. Now, I think at that point, President Trump, frankly, had no choice."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, let me read from this letter because I think this is very important, and it's not a case that the media is focusing in on. \"I cannot defend the director's handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clinton's e-mails.\" He admitted up until he said he's not doing anything that she violated the laws. And he goes on to say, \"And I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees the director made serious mistakes. It is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspective\" -- which we saw the comments of some of the left from when they didn't like what Comey was doing. And then it goes on to say, the director was wrong to usurp (ph) the attorney general's authority, announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution -- it is not the function of the director to make such an announcement! At most, a director shouldn't -- it goes on -- completed the investigation, presented its findings to federal prosecutors. Now he defends his decision by asserting that he believed the attorney general at the time was in conflict. But the FBI director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the attorney general. Wow! That is a powerful indictment against James Comey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "Look, what everybody has to understand is that letter was not written by a Trump campaign person. It's not written particularly by a Trump supporter. It's written by a 30-year career professional, President Obama's choice to be the U.S. attorney for Maryland and a man who the U.S. Senate voted 94 to 6 just two weeks ago saying this is a man of great integrity. And when you read the letter -- and of course, it goes on at great length. When you read the letter, you realize that Comey -- who by the way, as you know, in the last two weeks, we've had Hillary Clinton on television saying that Comey was a major reason she lost. And it's kind of weird. You'd think the Democrats would be saying, yes, I always thought what he did was wrong. Now they're saying, Oh, no, no, you shouldn't get rid of him, even though they were all for getting rid of him. Hillary Clinton, I suspect, thinks he should have been gone. But this also fits another pattern. If Donald Trump walks out in the morning and says the American flag is red, white and blue, a significant number of the elite media will say No, no, it's fuschia. Don't you understand that it's fuschia? Because they're not going to accept Donald Trump saying anything. And in this case, Trump was the executor who of the judgment of the attorney general and the deputy attorney general who decisively said to him, You must fire Comey. And I think it's important to put in context what Trump is doing here. It's not about the campaign. It's not about Trump's personal view. It's the commander-in-chief, president of the United States, getting a document from his attorney general that says we cannot rebuild the FBI as long as this guy is in charge."

Let's look at, for example, the list of potential crimes here -- and honestly, you know, disclosure of classified information -- it happened, Mr. Speaker! That's a fact. You know, records management -- he even said you cannot put on a private server top-secret special access program information, unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents -- fact! It happened! We're talking about a mom and pop shop bathroom where the e-mail server was kept. Concealment, removal, mutilation -- I think that would count for 30,000 e-mails, sir -- statements of entries generally. Is there anything here that we don't know is proven in terms of a violation of law?

And I think if they send to -- if the president nominates somebody who's clearly not a Republican, not a conservative, not a partisan but a dedicated law enforcement person of considerable background, then I think the test for the Democrats is, Are you really going to politicize the Federal Bureau of Investigation, even when the guy you just endorsed and got 94 senators to vote for him and who's a career professional, is the guy helping defend this and helping put it together? I think that's the next big test. Comey's now gone. He will become part of a lot of history books.

And he believes that the director's performance was so inappropriate that the FBI director and the bureau will ever completely recover! That is a stinging indictment. Jamie Gorelick, by the way, attorney general -- deputy attorney general under President Clinton joined with Larry Thompson (ph), deputy attorney general under President Bush, to opine the director had chosen to personally re-strike the balance between transparency and fairness from the department's traditions, and concluded the director violated his obligation to preserve, to protect and defend the traditions of the department of the FBI! One more second. Mike Mukasey -- he said the same thing and that disclosing the recommendation -- said it was out of fashion. Alberto Gonzales -- and if you want to look at somebody I never thought would agree with us, Eric Holder, who served as the deputy attorney general under President Clinton and attorney general under Obama, said that the director's decision was incorrect and that it violated long-standing Justice Department policies and traditions and it ran counter to the guidance that I put in place four years ago laying out the proper way to conduct investigations during an election season! And he concluded the director, quote, \"broke with these fundamental principles and negatively affected public trust in both the Justice Department and the FBI.\" We're talking about a broad spectrum of political views here, but in the arena of law and the Department of Justice and the Justice Department. I'd like you to react to those very prominent, respected figures."

      "utterance": "Well, and of course, all of this is captured in the letter by the deputy attorney general, who makes this unbelievably strong case that there's no defense for how Comey behaved, that it is a very dangerous violation. I mean, you can't have the nation's leading law enforcement agency, with its thousands and thousands of agents, with its capacity to get court-ordered wiretaps, with all the things they can do to gather information -- you can't have the top of that behaving capriciously and deciding whether or not he or she will release things. That's why they serve under the Justice Department. They don't serve equal to or above it. And this is really one of the more extraordinary, maybe the most extraordinary case in the history of the FBI. But again, notice. Even though, as you just did, you can quote Eric Holder, the attorney general under Obama and deputy attorney general under Clinton, you can quote Gorelick, who was the deputy attorney general under Clinton, the fact is the elite media is going to go crazy. They are going to totally distort this, and they're going to refuse to recognize and refuse to acknowledge that this was, in fact, the legitimate decision of the deputy attorney general, who is a career professional and was an Obama appointee as the U.S. attorney. And by the way, The Wall Street Journal has a superb editorial which came out this evening which lays out this case calmly and just says, Look, for the good of the country and for the good of our system of justice, for the good or the Federal Bureau of Investigation as an institution, this was the right decision. The president reacted appropriately to the recommendation of his attorney general and his deputy attorney general. He (ph) could be in a lot more trouble if he got a letter that was that strong and didn't take any action. I think we need to remember that, took -- it took courage on President Trump's part to do this. But it would have been a disaster for the country if he had rejected this letter and not done it."

You know, on all of the issues that we talk about, I believe it is such a travesty of justice that we know Hillary broke laws that would put the rest of us in jail, sir. You know, that's not equal justice under the law. You're not allowed to do what she did with an e-mail server, what she did with the Clinton Foundation, the qui pro quos she signed off as secretary of state, the foundation's taking in millions, 20 percent of our country's uranium goes to Vladimir Putin! And these -- these investigations died. The 4th Amendment protections we have, sir, and General Flynn is surveilled -- OK, incidentally, but then he's unmasked and then the intelligence is leaked to the press. And on top of that, on three separate occasions, the president in his letter tonight says that Comey said he's not under investigation. And he has allowed this to hang out there so that the entire country has been sold a bill of goods and a narrative and a lie and a false conspiracy by a media that from day one has wanted to delegitimize and destroy this president! It is beyond him contributing to a crisis, incompetence and division in this country! Am I right or wrong here?"

And you'll notice yesterday that the former director of national intelligence, Clapper, and the former acting attorney general who was inherited from Obama both said in testimony that there is no evidence that Trump was in any way involved, period. And so, you know, you promptly (ph) have various news media people saying, Well, they may not have found the smoking gun. That's not what they said. They said there's no evidence. So people need to understand the elite media and the hard left are desperate to avoid the reality that Donald Trump won, that Hillary Clinton lost. They are desperate to find a way to undermine and delegitimize President Clinton. (sic) But in this case -- and it's going to be really interesting to watch it play out over three or four or five days, as the average American comes to realize this was the recommendation of President Obama's U.S. attorney from Maryland. This is the recommendation of a career professional. And what the president did is he took the professional advice of somebody who has spent their lifetime serving the country -- not a Republican, not a partisan, not a campaign worker, but a genuine and deeply committed Justice Department employee. I think the country's going to conclude this is one further example of the elite media being dishonest and being frankly hysterical and one more example of us trying to move to restore the rule of law and to restore integrity back to the government."

He's the one that, leading the FBI, failed to move on issues that were so clear. Why was there not an investigation that came to a conclusion other than him acting as the attorney general, which is not his job, regarding the e-mail servers? We go back to that. I go back even further than that, Sean. What about the fake investigation that the FBI engaged in with those IRS cases? I litigated those cases and I had some of our clients participating in those -- that so-called FBI investigation. It was put-up (ph). And this is -- you know, James Comey -- and this is without disrespect to the FBI because the FBI does do great work. But this director of the FBI should have been fired, has been fired, and asked for it himself. I've been saying it for a year. The problem here is he decided he was going to become the judge and jury in these matters, and that was not the role of the FBI director. I can give you the litany of cases that should have been investigated, everything from the unmasking to the disclosures to the leaks to the media to the Clinton e-mail server issue, which we've talked about at length. But at the end of the day, this director of the FBI was not a leader. And what he did was politicize a branch of government, a portion of government that should not be. And look, he serves at the pleasure of the president. Yes, he had a 10-year term. Guess what? That term ended today. And it was his own undoing. He had to go back to the Congress today to clarify again testimony he gave."

That's what needs to be done. And you know Sean, I was thinking about this going back to July. It looks like Director Comey wanted to have his cake and eat it too. He kept playing both sides. And it didn't work him. I remember when he came out and said there was a lack of intent -- because they didn't want to prosecute Hillary Clinton because of this lack of intent to prove that she was going to do anything wrong with the classified material. You don't need to prove anything. The fact that she mishandled classified materials through gross negligence is enough to prosecute. And that should have been left up -- even if Loretta Lynch wouldn't have prosecuted her, that should've been left up to her to make that decision and not Director Comey.

I still believe that when she signed off on giving away 20 percent of America's uranium and millions of dollars are flowing back to the foundation, and that goes to the Clintons. Let's go to that, Sara Carter's investigation into what she had been talking about. The law we know was broken. Surveillance, incidental, unmasking -- wrong, at an unprecedented level. We'll get back to that in a second. And then the leaking of intelligent, felony, violation, Espionage Act.

But it does I think remind us -- his instinct I bet, I'm just betting, his instinct was to fire Comey. And my instinct is that he didn't follow his instinct. No one had confidence in Comey. The Democrats didn't have confidence in him after he sent the letter to Congress 11 days before the election, only a few days later to say, oh, sorry, there's no problem in the emails sent to Anthony Weiner. He also did the non-indictment indictment of Hillary Clinton with the handling of the classified information, the private server. That was that bizarre press conference he did where he seemed to kind of convict her or charge her only to say, no, we couldn't find the requisite intent that many say isn't really required under that statute. So I think he really damaged his own reputation. He came in as kind of a straight shooter, but by the end no one trusted him.

That was just a bizarre press conference. And then of course the example you stated, which is equally bizarre. You have a crime that was committed and the FBI director seems woefully uninterested, incurious about finding out what really went on. So again, the left was not happy with him. The right was not happy with him. And I think most people think his investigation -- if you look at this fairly, the Russian collusion, there was nothing there.

And I guess tonight he is extremely nauseous. During his testimony this week, he also got two key facts wrong which the Justice Department had to come back and correct after the testimony both about the number of emails that were sent to Anthony Weiner's computer and how Huma Abedin actually transmitted them. Most of them are automatically downloaded when she was updating her computer. She didn't send thousands and thousands of emails. So those were two key facts that at this point, with how important this investigation is, and was right before the election -- he gets those two major facts wrong? That is not someone who is on his game. I think that probably entered into Sessions mind as well."

It has to deal with these issues. Even Benghazi, the FBI investigated it. People forget that. And there's no report from the FBI and there has been no action."

      "utterance": "It is an amazing thing. Let me go to Sara first, then we'll go to Jay. It is an amazing thing, all of these horrible things happening. Lou brings up a great point. Using the IRS to intimidate conservative groups, that goes back, started in 2010. The Benghazi lies, spontaneous demonstration where they just happen to have RPGs and mortars in their back pocket and decided to pull them out, a total, complete lie and fabrication. Then it's uranium one. Then it's the server scandal. Then we know so many crimes are committed."

    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean it's true. When you think about this, now they're crying foul that everybody, even included Harry Reid, said the same thing. He should resign, you know, Comey should resign. So, look, we've gone past that. He's out. He's been fired. He's out. Someone new apparently is going to be coming in the next few days. And Sean, Lou, Jay, you guy have brought up some great points. There are some issues that still need to be looked at, that still need to be investigated. I know that there are families with Benghazi who I'm very close to who would love to see this reopened again, at least looked at. There are a lot of cases out there, Fast and Furious. And there's so much more. And so particularly with the unmasking right, and, Sean, like you pointed out with the leaks -- we need to know if someone in the DOJ or if the inspector general found anything yet, or if the DOJ has actually asked the FBI to open an investigation, that the FBI should be able to tell us. So there are a lot of issues right now that I think need to be investigated, and I think you are right about this."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

He's made a lot of mistakes.\" Wow, has NBC changed since he left, just as a side note. Where do we begin? With all that Lou has brought up and all that Sara has brought up, they're such criminality here. There seems to be a crisis as it relates to equal justice under the law in this country now as a result of James Comey. How do you fix that? How do you recover from that and a media that wants to cover it all up, the same people that colluded with Hillary as exposed by WikiLeaks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "The media is the easier side because you just play what Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer said, which the president tweeted out, and then you have Harry Reid who called for his resignation over a year ago. So the media side is easy. But here's what I do within the Department of Justice. I was a government lawyer when I began my career and I had the honor of serving on the faculty the Department of Justice during when John Ashcroft was the attorney general. Here is what you do. Within the Department of Justice itself, within the FBI itself, you create a unit that looks at all of this new. New agents, new review, and every one of these issues, Sean, that Sara and that Lou have laid out, including that IRS case that I litigated, need to be looked at from the beginning. And I think it has to have new eyes. That's number one. Number two, you have got to restore the public integrity of the department itself. And that is going to be coming from the attorney general Jeff Sessions who is both an attorney and a general in that sense. You have got to be able to take command. And then the new FBI director is going to have to establish within the FBI this sense of pride in their work. Look, there are a number of failures here. You talk about some of the ones on the terrorism issues, the Tsarnaev brothers, what happened with Omar Mateen in Orlando where they were on the radar screen, all of that needs to be looked at. Nidal Hasan, all of this has to be looked at. But we don't have the luxury of letting these things happen again in our country. We just don't have it. The president has taken decisive action here. He said he was going to drain the swamp. This was the beginning of that drain or certainly a continuation of that drain. But let me just say this, Director Comey, with due respect to the office of the director of the FBI, dropped this on himself. It is going to take a new director to fix this. It's going to take agents committed, and I think it has to be a team within the FBI and the Department of Justice that takes control."

And why they are not bringing that case forward again, and if they will, even if they will, even if they can find something that can reopen this investigation into Hillary Clinton. But you know what? I'm not going to hold my breath on it. I'm going to hope that maybe somebody will have the courage to do that. But this is how this game is played.

The reality for equal justice under the law that you talked about, if that is what the concern is, then it's looked at, as I said, with a new division within the FBI, and it's looked at fresh.

Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm on my high horse."

New investigation, new prosecutors, they relook all of these cases that we have outlined, start fresh. That is how you get justice in these kind of situations. You know that the previous director do not do that. Now you have to."

      "speaker": "SEKULOW",

A grand jury, if they return an indictment, that is how our system works. Then Hillary Clinton or anybody else would be entitled to defense and defense counsel and the case would be proven in a court of law. And that's how you handle something when there has been a violation. You don't have two sets of rules. You don't have one for them and one for everybody else. You don't have my clients being targeted and threatened by the IRS and the FBI with a, quote, let's make up a, they said piece together a criminal case against one of my clients in the conservative targeting scandal, that is not justice. So that's how you get justice. Empanel a grand jury."
