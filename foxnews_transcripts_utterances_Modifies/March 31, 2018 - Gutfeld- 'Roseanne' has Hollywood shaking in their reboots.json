So, Roseanne is to Trumpee, her sister is a resister, but unlike most crap coming out of Hollywood, the show did not alienate half the country which is maybe why it scored big.   Now, we've all got the family member we would rather not talk to when the discussion turns to politics. Mine is in a cage I built out of raccoon bones. But in Roseanne's house, disagreement doesn't make you an enemy. Now, granted, Roseanne has done some very, very strange things in her past. But maybe she's trying to make up for it by creating a show that tries to pull people together rather than apart.  And coming out as pro-Trump in Hollywood, that is like coming out like out as a fish at a bear sanctuary. But that wasn't the only reboot. Consider CNN who said, oh, stop it, they said enough with foreign-policy and national defense, we want a makeover. We are now the new weather channel - all stormy, all the time. Yes, yes. Much like Roseanne, this reboot hinges on the appeal of one woman. Now, I don't blame CNN; when things are tough, you have got to go with what you know and they know Stormy like the back and front of their hand.  But CNN, at least be honest about it. When your news has gone from hard to semi-hard, that reboot needs a rebrand. Luckily, we got a sneak peek of their new lineup at CNN. It is great.",

On Thursday, the Pentagon confirmed Trump spoke to Defense Secretary James Mattis about using defense funds to do just that. Last week, Trump signed the $1.3 trillion government spending bill into law, which included a paltry 1.6 billion for the wall. Way short of the $25 billion that he wanted. He later suggested on Twitter, the military could spare a few bucks, at least I think that's what he said. He exclaimed, \"Build wall through M.\" All right, maybe M stands for military or maybe it is meatballs. Build the wall out of meatballs.  Not the veal, though, I hate the veal. Meanwhile officials in Orange County, California voted to join a federal lawsuit against the state sanctuary city laws.

Investigators with the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing the cause of the crash. And overseas, a final goodbye for legendary British scientist, Stephen Hawking. Hundreds lined the street of Cambridge to say farewell. Flags were lowered to half-staff in parts of the city to honor Hawking. The funeral service was private.

But in Roseanne's house, disagreement doesn't make you an enemy. Now, granted, Roseanne has done some very, very strange things in her past. But maybe she's trying to make up for it by creating a show that tries to pull people together rather than apart. And coming out as pro-Trump in Hollywood, that is like coming out like out as a fish at a bear sanctuary. But that wasn't the only reboot. Consider CNN who said, oh, stop it, they said enough with foreign-policy and national defense, we want a makeover. We are now the new weather channel - all stormy, all the time. Yes, yes. Much like Roseanne, this reboot hinges on the appeal of one woman. Now, I don't blame CNN; when things are tough, you have got to go with what you know and they know Stormy like the back and front of their hand. But CNN, at least be honest about it. When your news has gone from hard to semi-hard, that reboot needs a rebrand. Luckily, we got a sneak peek of their new lineup at CNN. It is great."

It's about what people are doing now and especially, it's funny, it's not quirky, it's not hip, it's not clever, it's snarky, it's just funny. She's a funny person.

He should check under the couch, it's always good for a few bucks. He's still giving his all to get that damned wall. This week, the Washington Post reported President Trump is pushing for the US Military to build the wall. On Thursday, the Pentagon confirmed Trump spoke to Defense Secretary James Mattis about using defense funds to do just that. Last week, Trump signed the $1.3 trillion government spending bill into law, which included a paltry 1.6 billion for the wall. Way short of the $25 billion that he wanted. He later suggested on Twitter, the military could spare a few bucks, at least I think that's what he said. He exclaimed, \"Build wall through M.\" All right, maybe M stands for military or maybe it is meatballs. Build the wall out of meatballs. Not the veal, though, I hate the veal. Meanwhile officials in Orange County, California voted to join a federal lawsuit against the state sanctuary city laws. The law ban state and local agencies from notifying Feds when immigrants in custody who may be subject to deportation are about to be released. That's crazy.

They didn't want these two groups fighting. So, it sounds like discrimination, but nobody noticed it because the pigment was the same. Then in factories, they separated men and women based on a similar reason, however, going back to insufficiency, but it wasn't about friction it was about fraternizing.
