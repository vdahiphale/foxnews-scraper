And this is The Five. President Trump is ready to rally. His campaign just announcing the president will hold a make America great campaign rally on Monday night in Florida at 7 p.m. The president will also have his first in-person event since his COVID diagnosis tonight. Tomorrow at the White House he will also do something else focusing on law and order. I'm sorry I can't see that.  President Trump saying today he is feeling much better.",

But the truth is that survival rate right now that we have all of these therapeutics and obviously the access to the healthcare the president has, he is capable of getting out and getting back out on the campaign trail.  And the fact is when you're the president of the United States you don't really have the luxury of sitting back and being sick because you have an obligation to get well as soon as possible. And I think that we should all be happy about that.   But in terms of the debates and whether they're going to happen, I think it's a shame that the town hall style debate isn't happening. I think the president would benefit from that from hearing directly from undecided voters so long as they were actually undecided so that the campaign could see what issues they should maybe focus on in the remaining weeks. So, I would hope that maybe they can come to some agreement and reschedule that town hall. I do think the president needs another go-round with Joe Biden when it comes to the issues. And as he said, maybe let Joe Biden speak a little bit more next time. So, he can talk about his own policies.",

And they're actually having to send surrogates to places they didn't think were possibly in play for them. I mean we're talking about internal polling now that is showing that Biden has an advantage in Georgia, for instance.  These are state that no Democrats thought we even had a chance at just a year out from now. So, I think that Joe Biden is being safe and responsible, obviously in terms of COVID and how he's approaching this and going places where key figures like Cindy McCain are that, you know, he can campaign with her. Obviously, she holds a lot of sway in Arizona and places where he does need to win.  Nevada is interesting because he has done worse with the Latino vote than Bernie Sanders did in the primary. Bernie basically had the highest amount of Latino support. So, I don't think they're quaking in their boots at all, but they've definitely playing to win and we know that no matter what size your polling lead is, the only poll that matters is on election day. And I think that he's taking that seriously. Quickly though, on the campaigning front for President Trump. You know, for him to say I feel great, it's not a big deal. That video yesterday to seniors. You're not vulnerable. They think you're vulnerable or you're not vulnerable. Seniors are vulnerable. And all the medical professionals are clear about this.  I wish the president a speedy recovery. I would love to know if he actually doesn't have the virus anymore. They've been so evasive about when he last tested negative or if he has tested negative.

And so, I think that the squad can do whatever they want. I appreciate the fact that AOC is on the climate task force, for instance, then he's bringing in younger members.

And we had an opportunity on the show to say, you know, do you lay this potential homicide on the doorsteps of Bernie Sanders? And every single one of us on this show said no, Bernie is not an accessory to this attempted murder. And I thought, you know, I'm not a reckless bomb-thrower. I was pretty proud of myself. There is a line -- there is a line in this world where we discuss these issues that you really shouldn't cross.

What I'm saying is the media and Democrats have lost the right to complain about any violence because they didn't say a word for three to four months.

You could have Biden win and then they just dismiss Durham, they clearing house and they drop it, and then is that obstruction?",

His campaign just announcing the president will hold a make America great campaign rally on Monday night in Florida at 7 p.m. The president will also have his first in-person event since his COVID diagnosis tonight.

But the truth is that survival rate right now that we have all of these therapeutics and obviously the access to the healthcare the president has, he is capable of getting out and getting back out on the campaign trail. And the fact is when you're the president of the United States you don't really have the luxury of sitting back and being sick because you have an obligation to get well as soon as possible. And I think that we should all be happy about that. But in terms of the debates and whether they're going to happen, I think it's a shame that the town hall style debate isn't happening. I think the president would benefit from that from hearing directly from undecided voters so long as they were actually undecided so that the campaign could see what issues they should maybe focus on in the remaining weeks. So, I would hope that maybe they can come to some agreement and reschedule that town hall. I do think the president needs another go-round with Joe Biden when it comes to the issues. And as he said, maybe let Joe Biden speak a little bit more next time. So, he can talk about his own policies."

And they're actually having to send surrogates to places they didn't think were possibly in play for them. I mean we're talking about internal polling now that is showing that Biden has an advantage in Georgia, for instance. These are state that no Democrats thought we even had a chance at just a year out from now. So, I think that Joe Biden is being safe and responsible, obviously in terms of COVID and how he's approaching this and going places where key figures like Cindy McCain are that, you know, he can campaign with her. Obviously, she holds a lot of sway in Arizona and places where he does need to win. Nevada is interesting because he has done worse with the Latino vote than Bernie Sanders did in the primary. Bernie basically had the highest amount of Latino support. So, I don't think they're quaking in their boots at all, but they've definitely playing to win and we know that no matter what size your polling lead is, the only poll that matters is on election day. And I think that he's taking that seriously. Quickly though, on the campaigning front for President Trump. You know, for him to say I feel great, it's not a big deal. That video yesterday to seniors. You're not vulnerable. They think you're vulnerable or you're not vulnerable. Seniors are vulnerable. And all the medical professionals are clear about this. I wish the president a speedy recovery. I would love to know if he actually doesn't have the virus anymore. They've been so evasive about when he last tested negative or if he has tested negative. The American people deserve to know that especially if he's going to be coming to your town."

All he has to do is hold Arizona, Florida and North Carolina and win one of those Midwestern rust belt states. Joe is on the defensive. Joe is the one who's fighting to rebuild that blue wall. The president is doing much better than the polls are saying. These are suppression polls when they oversample Democrats by 10 points or put a ton of lean Democrats into the independents.

This idea that Gretchen Whitmer would then go out and use a press conference on a very serious issue and turn it political and again try to accuse the president of being a white supremacist, of engaging and emboldening these types of people when they are the opposite I really think it doesn't do anything to boost the narrative that Democrats are constantly telling the rest of us and their virtuous signaling about coming together and being unified and being civil. There is not a single Trump reference in the multipage indictment of any of the people who were arrested. So, the fact that she brought it in shows that she was using this as a political opportunity rather than just thanking people for making sure she was safe."

And only when they were asked about it, they have said yes, we tried to be cooperative with the FBI we're trying to do the right thing. I think that what Gretchen Whitmer could have said I'm grateful for the law enforcement and for the FBI and from the state of Michigan, thank you so much. That's it. Because I don't think it's necessary to antagonize the president but also, I think that he should have said we're glad that you're OK. Because I don't think it's a good idea for any of this to be hyping up the idea that you can get a bunch of attention if you want to try to plot something like this. You will ruin your life. Because the FBI will find you. And you will end up in this situation with these guys. And now they're going to get lawyers, they're going to -- probably there might be jail time, et cetera.

Years ago, when I was a young lad, I joined the show and one of the first major stories we covered was the Bernie bro who shot Steve Scalise. He almost bleeds out and died on the baseball field. We all looked at the research packets that showed this guy was a Bernie volunteer, he was a Maddow fan. He poured over everything Bernie believe and said. And we had an opportunity on the show to say, you know, do you lay this potential homicide on the doorsteps of Bernie Sanders? And every single one of us on this show said no, Bernie is not an accessory to this attempted murder. And I thought, you know, I'm not a reckless bomb-thrower. I was pretty proud of myself. There is a line -- there is a line in this world where we discuss these issues that you really shouldn't cross. And we've seen, you know, the Trump family gets sent Ricin, LAPD officers, you know, almost executed at point-blank rage. And we've been very good on the show to say I'm not blaming Democratic politicians for these types of violent acts. Yet, someone slips in the shower and Trump's to blame. So, I think it's really unfair that what's going on from her. And the Democrats were so upset with federal agents going into Portland to protect property and people, but now federal agents are protecting their lives and they don't -- they don't see the hypocrisy there."

So, the media, the Democrats by ignoring rampant violence that's still going on in Portland today and going on in Wisconsin this week, it was terrible what they were doing to the residents homes, they were throwing objects into people's homes that could have children there, OK, that's horribly pled with BLM to stop the protesters and they didn't. What I'm saying is the media and Democrats have lost the right to complain about any violence because they didn't say a word for three to four months. Every time you hear that study that they cite, 93 percent of the protests were mostly peaceful, seven percent not peaceful, 13 people in this in this band of weirdos out of 340 million is infinitesimal. So, clearly, if you think that 93 percent mostly peaceful is OK, you shouldn't have a problem with this crazy little band of kidnappers since it comes to about one out of 30 -- odds of one in 36 million.

And I think it's because what Secretary Pompeo was alluding to is apparently it seems that in these e-mails, there is classified information that might have sources and methods and you want to make sure everybody is protected and that you don't hurt anybody. That was the sense that I got from Secretary Pompeo. I also think that there might be a lot of people who say, you know, this is so old. Why are we still talking about this?

There are also back and forth when you're investigating these people about documents that their attorneys are refusing to hand over.

And from what I hear of John Durham, he seems like a really stand-up guy who is methodical and takes his time, and he's not just going to put out some shoddy report or indict someone that he can actually put behind bars and make a strong case to. So, I understand maybe Barr not wanting to do something in October because he doesn't want it to look too political. But Donald Trump has a point.
