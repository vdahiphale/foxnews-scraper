      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” How much more can America take from the activist left? Is there a limit to the abuse ordinary people are willing to endure from the social justice mob? How long before normal people start pushing back a little bit? Ever wondered? We'll look closer tonight to answering those questions. A jury in Ohio has ordered left-wing Oberlin College to pay $44 million in damages to a family that the college defamed in a hate hoax. The school also pay the victims legal fees. It was a rare, but totally unequivocal victory for reason and decency against the forces of lunacy and chaos, and we'd like to celebrate it tonight as we head into the weekend.  The story begins back in 2016, when an underage Oberlin student used a fake ID to buy alcohol from a store called Gibson's Food Mart and Grocery. The man behind the counter, Allyn Gibson refused the sale.  The student then tried to steal the bottle so Gibson called the police. When the cops arrived they found the student and two of his accomplices beating Gibson on the ground. Those are the facts of this case. No one has disputed them. The students in fact pled guilty. The case should have ended there.  But because the student who shoplifted from the store is black, Oberlin attempted to manufacture a hate crime out of it. Swarms of entitled young progressives descended on Gibson's Bakery and accused the family of racism. Watch.",

      "sentences": "All of this was slander. None of it was true. But Oberlin's Dean of Students, Meredith Raimondo continued to provoke the mob. She distributed pamphlets defaming the Gibson family calling them racist.   In e-mails that were released during the trial, Raimondo attacked her own colleagues who defended the Gibson's and discussed quote, \"unleashing the students on Gibson's bakery.\" College administrators tried to put the bakery out of business. They canceled its longstanding contracts with the college. It nearly worked by the way. The Gibson's took no salary for two years. They laid off most of their staff. They almost shut down the business. Oberlin then use their suffering for leverage in negotiations. The college offered to reinstate the lucrative contracts if Gibson would drop charges against the shoplifter. The Gibson's refused. Instead, they fought back and in the end they won.   Before the jury awarded the damages, Oberlin's lawyers whined that the $70,000.00 a year school couldn't afford the judgment. That turned out to be yet another ludicrous lie. Tax documents revealed the school has more than a billion dollars in assets. Bill Jacobson is Professor at Cornell Law School. He is the publisher of the Legal Insurrection blog. He covered this case from beginning to end, virtually the only person to do so. And he joins us tonight. Mr. Jacobson, thanks a lot for coming on.",

Because these are people as you've pointed out, who did nothing wrong. They literally were just minding their business that morning, when they called the police on some shoplifters. And because of the crazed social justice, so-called social justice movement on our campuses, they were immediately designated oppressor, in part because of their skin color, in part because they're the owner of a business. And they were put into a pigeon hole of someone who must be racist, who must have engaged in racial profiling.  And nobody seemed to actually care about the facts that these are students who actually did shoplift. And I think that's what's so outrageous about it, that I think you noted it in your opening, that these are just ordinary people. These are not people who are engaged in the political process. They didn't put themselves out into the arena. This is not like the other social media mobs we've heard about where someone sends out a tweet or posts something on Facebook, and all of a sudden there's a mob against them. That's bad enough.  These are literally people who got up probably at three in the morning that morning and did absolutely nothing wrong. But that campus fervor and that campus zeal to express some sort of outrage at the system visited them and I think that's the thing that's so chilling here.",

He is now the President of Pace University, a much bigger institution. So I don't expect anything to happen.  And the important thing here is that I don't think Oberlin College got the message. In their closing statement to the jury as to why they shouldn't get punitive damages, the Oberlin College attorney said, \"We've gotten the message. You sent a message loud and clear.\" I don't think for a second Oberlin College has gotten the message.   Just today, the President sent out an all campus e-mail saying they're going to continue to fight this, and they believe they did nothing wrong. So I think this is really an outrageous circumstance. And I think, let's remember, this is a fifth generation bakery. These are the people who get up at three and four in the morning, when Oberlin students are just getting home. And I think that that's the outrageous thing about this that this can happen to anybody. It's not just a campus phenomenon.",

When you go into St. Louis and I was there this weekend, where there are 19 people shot and killed over the weekend.

There's study after study on the black communities conducted by the Joint Center for Political Economics, a liberal black think tank.  When black Americans rank and file ask, what are the issues most important to you is jobs and security. Base only shows up eight percent in those communities. And those are three separate polls, but these people on television, the candidates pander to the black community and assume that they don't have to speak to the legitimate needs of black America for jobs, for better healthcare, for neighborhoods that not being gentrified.

So every time you operate a drone, whether it's to look around pipeline, or check your ranch and see where the cattle are, all that feed is going back to China.

They put out a memo to stop it two years ago. But the surveillance of the United States is really quite extraordinary.

Is there a limit to the abuse ordinary people are willing to endure from the social justice mob? How long before normal people start pushing back a little bit? Ever wondered? We'll look closer tonight to answering those questions. A jury in Ohio has ordered left-wing Oberlin College to pay $44 million in damages to a family that the college defamed in a hate hoax. The school also pay the victims legal fees. It was a rare, but totally unequivocal victory for reason and decency against the forces of lunacy and chaos, and we'd like to celebrate it tonight as we head into the weekend. The story begins back in 2016, when an underage Oberlin student used a fake ID to buy alcohol from a store called Gibson's Food Mart and Grocery. The man behind the counter, Allyn Gibson refused the sale. The student then tried to steal the bottle so Gibson called the police. When the cops arrived they found the student and two of his accomplices beating Gibson on the ground. Those are the facts of this case. No one has disputed them. The students in fact pled guilty. The case should have ended there. But because the student who shoplifted from the store is black, Oberlin attempted to manufacture a hate crime out of it. Swarms of entitled young progressives descended on Gibson's Bakery and accused the family of racism. Watch."

      "utterance": "All of this was slander. None of it was true. But Oberlin's Dean of Students, Meredith Raimondo continued to provoke the mob. She distributed pamphlets defaming the Gibson family calling them racist. In e-mails that were released during the trial, Raimondo attacked her own colleagues who defended the Gibson's and discussed quote, \"unleashing the students on Gibson's bakery.\" College administrators tried to put the bakery out of business. They canceled its longstanding contracts with the college. It nearly worked by the way. The Gibson's took no salary for two years. They laid off most of their staff. They almost shut down the business. Oberlin then use their suffering for leverage in negotiations. The college offered to reinstate the lucrative contracts if Gibson would drop charges against the shoplifter. The Gibson's refused. Instead, they fought back and in the end they won. Before the jury awarded the damages, Oberlin's lawyers whined that the $70,000.00 a year school couldn't afford the judgment. That turned out to be yet another ludicrous lie. Tax documents revealed the school has more than a billion dollars in assets. Bill Jacobson is Professor at Cornell Law School. He is the publisher of the Legal Insurrection blog. He covered this case from beginning to end, virtually the only person to do so. And he joins us tonight. Mr. Jacobson, thanks a lot for coming on."

    {
      "speaker": "JACOBSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the message of the jury was sending is that all lives matter, frankly, that the lives of this bakery, the lives of people who get up at three in the morning to cook the baked goods that the students eat in the dining halls matter just as much as anybody else, and that truth matters. Because these are people as you've pointed out, who did nothing wrong. They literally were just minding their business that morning, when they called the police on some shoplifters. And because of the crazed social justice, so-called social justice movement on our campuses, they were immediately designated oppressor, in part because of their skin color, in part because they're the owner of a business. And they were put into a pigeon hole of someone who must be racist, who must have engaged in racial profiling. And nobody seemed to actually care about the facts that these are students who actually did shoplift. And I think that's what's so outrageous about it, that I think you noted it in your opening, that these are just ordinary people. These are not people who are engaged in the political process. They didn't put themselves out into the arena. This is not like the other social media mobs we've heard about where someone sends out a tweet or posts something on Facebook, and all of a sudden there's a mob against them. That's bad enough. These are literally people who got up probably at three in the morning that morning and did absolutely nothing wrong. But that campus fervor and that campus zeal to express some sort of outrage at the system visited them and I think that's the thing that's so chilling here."

He is now the President of Pace University, a much bigger institution. So I don't expect anything to happen. And the important thing here is that I don't think Oberlin College got the message. In their closing statement to the jury as to why they shouldn't get punitive damages, the Oberlin College attorney said, \"We've gotten the message. You sent a message loud and clear.\" I don't think for a second Oberlin College has gotten the message. Just today, the President sent out an all campus e-mail saying they're going to continue to fight this, and they believe they did nothing wrong. So I think this is really an outrageous circumstance. And I think, let's remember, this is a fifth generation bakery. These are the people who get up at three and four in the morning, when Oberlin students are just getting home. And I think that that's the outrageous thing about this that this can happen to anybody. It's not just a campus phenomenon."

And so it's undermining blacks -- and also, Tucker, it's really something that's banded around by people with six figure incomes living in gated communities with their children in private schools. When you go into St. Louis and I was there this weekend, where there are 19 people shot and killed over the weekend. They're not talking about reparations as an answer to that challenge all over the country. So I just think that it's virtue signaling for white candidates, and for some white guilty people.

When black Americans rank and file ask, what are the issues most important to you is jobs and security. Base only shows up eight percent in those communities. And those are three separate polls, but these people on television, the candidates pander to the black community and assume that they don't have to speak to the legitimate needs of black America for jobs, for better healthcare, for neighborhoods that not being gentrified. But instead, they can just pander and walk through the Civil Rights door. It is pandering. It is insulting to black America. And as I have said, I have suffered my last rich, angry black and my last guilty white person. That's it."

What Homeland Security is pointing out is that these drones, and there's, by the way, there's up to two million now operating in the United States, 80 percent of which are made in China by basically one company. These drones all have hookups to the Internet, and they go to servers in China. So every time you operate a drone, whether it's to look around pipeline, or check your ranch and see where the cattle are, all that feed is going back to China. And with artificial intelligence, if the Chinese want to, they can assemble a picture of large parts of America, what's happening with airline flights or crops or nuclear power reactors, anything they want. And Homeland Security is warning about this. Part of the problem, Tucker, is this whole thing began with the U.S. government. Our Army bought drones from China. The Army doesn't do that anymore. They put out a memo to stop it two years ago. But the surveillance of the United States is really quite extraordinary. Back when we thought China was going to be a democracy and a free market, just like us, nobody really cared about this sort of thing.

But Huawei, if they get control of our 5G, they've already got a very extensive share of our rural network in Wi-Fi connections, a lot of rural America is put together by one single Chinese company. They also can take that data to China, and analyze it. So this whole problem of the surveillance of people, I think, first began to come to everybody's attention when the Chinese were doing it to their own people, the Muslims out in Xinjiang, two million of them in sort of concentration camps. And this facial recognition feature, then you can analyze anybody anywhere in a city in China, let's say by a camera looking down. You can see that face, get its background, get its social -- what they call a social credit score and combine that with drone pictures, other things that happen elsewhere in the world. So if someone just types in Tucker Carlson in China, a massive amount of information about you can come out and what they do with that maybe they want to send you a Christmas card and be friendly, and maybe they --"

You can trust Jeff Bezos with your children. Relax. Everything is fine. Now count backwards with me from a hundred. You're getting very sleepy. Well, the Department of Defense exists to protect America from foreign threats and does a great job with that. Thank God. But it's also a massive consumer of tax dollars. The biggest really and for that reason, concerns about corruption are always there. There's reason to believe that over the past couple of years, some of the Pentagon have worked to enrich Amazon, already the world's richest company. In 2017, the Pentagon announced a $10 billion Cloud computing contract. According to critics, the contract wasn't actually competitive. It was designed from the very start to be fulfilled by Amazon, and only by Amazon. Several of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis's aides had prior professional ties to Amazon, a key official working on the Pentagon's Cloud computing program was carrying out secret job negotiations with Amazon even as he worked on the Pentagon's program. And we can report exclusively tonight on this program that in March 2017, before the Cloud computing contract was announced, Secretary Mattis had a secret dinner in London with Amazon's top Cloud sales executive, Theresa Carlson.

This is a critical component, Tucker. And it's something that needs to be looked into. And I appreciate you highlighting it for the American people."

      "utterance": "So a detail that bothered me, and I think, correct me if I'm getting this wrong, Secretary Mattis met with this Amazon official, but then the Pentagon tried to keep that that meeting secret as if it were some national security secret? Which of course it's not, why wouldn't they be open about that?"

    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, when you look at a procurement process, they should be open and transparent and competitive. And when you look at keeping -- you know, somebody as high as General Mattis meeting with a potential bidder of a contract of $10 billion and even beyond that, there are some suggestions the Department of Defense Inspector General is looking at this in terms of possible conflict of interest, whether it be with General Mattis or with other individuals. What we want to make sure of is that the American people get the best value for their dollar. And you can't do that if you're designing a contract to go just to one bidder."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Do we trust Amazon to provide this service to keep the Pentagon's data? It's not an American company, it's a publicly held multinational with ties to China. We're comfortable with that?"

    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's not a matter of the company, because we've got obviously national security protocols that we put in place. But Tucker, you know, better than most people that if you're trusting in in Washington, D.C. to get it right, oftentimes, they don't. You mentioned at the top of this hour, you know, what you have is basically a Department of Defense that does a great job of defending our national interest. And yet it is so bloated across the Potomac here, that we've got hundreds of thousands of people that that candidly are not necessarily investing the American taxpayers dollars in the most wise and efficient way."

      "utterance": "Take a look at this. It's video of a mysterious white object hovering over the fabled Area 51 in the State of Nevada. Hikers scaled in nearby mountain in order to capture video of the secretive U.S. Air Force facility. The video also appears to show an enormous new aircraft hangar. Nobody's quite sure what that's for. Former U.S. Senator Harry Reid, who represented the area in Nevada known as Area 51 says he wants Congress to hold hearings at how much exactly the military knows about UFOs. The Pentagon has been studying the subject secretly for decades. Probably no responsible person in the west knows more about the subject than Nick Pope. And we're always happy to have him on the show. He joins us tonight. Nick, thanks a lot for coming on. Any sense of what this object might be hovering over Area 51?"

      "utterance": "No, it's a fascinating piece of footage. But it's -- unfortunately, it's just too indistinct for us to really reach a definitive view on it. I hope that we will be able to get further enhancements and analysis over the next few days and weeks, and maybe it'll give some answers. I mean, of course, UFO aficionados say that maybe it's the real thing. Others will be saying no, it's probably our own secret next generation aircraft or drone."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "One of the explanations for the many sightings by US military aircraft of these unidentified objects is that they are experimental aircraft, either Russian or Chinese, is it possible? I just want to take this off the table, that they're American, that they are some part of the military that is testing aircraft that other parts of the military don't know about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POPE",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And when you deal with highly classified, sensitive compartmentalized programs like this, everyone works in silos, very often in government, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Having said that some of the things going on in our skies at the moment, give me cause for concern. Someone or something is flying these things against our fleet. This is a time of international tension that's going to involve the Navy, whether it's the East China Sea, or the Straits of Hormuz, and we need to find out. Look, if it's American, Russian, Chinese or something else, Congress needs to be taking a grip if this isn't an issue for the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee, I don't know what is."

They've interviewed some of the pilots and radar operators who've been involved in these close encounters. But Harry Reid has obviously now called for more than this. Public hearings, I'd support that, heck, I'd turn up and testify myself. Let's get it out there."

What is going on in the Dominican Republic? Upwards of seven dead American tourists. A really horrible incident of course with Big Papi David Ortiz, a really fantastic baseball player I admire. The F.B.I. is down there. Let's hope they get to the bottom of it. They see what's going on. It's in the Dominican Republic's obviously their best interest to get to the bottom of this as well. So really tough story. That's story number four for the week. Alright, moving on. From the humor file here. Let's lighten this up a little bit. Every Americans favorite Congresswoman and I say that with a wink and a nod, AOC wants a raise. But she has a very interesting explanation for this. We have video of this right? Play the video."

You know, it may not be politically popular to say but honestly, this is why there's so much pressure to turn to lobbying firms and to cash in on member service after people leave. It's not even like a raise. It's a cost of living adjustment."

This is -- we are living in Peak Acosta right now. This is Jim Acosta. He has a book. It's not about \"The New York Times\" failure to cover the Soviet Union in the 50s and 60s and the like. The book is literally about Jim Acosta and his experiences with Donald Trump. And Tucker, I hear you make an appearance in there. He is upset you didn't go summer slam with him on a bus when you saw him. I guess he wanted some kind of physical confrontation, which is just again, totally Peak Acosta.

Post-Trump interview, George Stephanopoulos, everything is a-okay if you get information from the Russians, Tucker, as long as Hillary Clinton paid for it. No worries. New rules, Tucker, if you pay for the information from Russians, it's okay. There you go."
