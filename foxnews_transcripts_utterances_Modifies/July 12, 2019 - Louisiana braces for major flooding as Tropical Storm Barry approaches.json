But, first, you're looking live at New Orleans, where they are bracing for a direct hit from Tropical Storm Barry, which could be a full-fledged hurricane within a matter of hours.  Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"  And we are all over this storm with Casey Stegall in New Orleans, where folks are evacuating, Adam Klotz in the FOX Weather Center on how big a punch Barry will be packing, former FEMA official Tom Panuzio on if this could be another Katrina in the making, and FOX Business' Lauren Simonetti on why it could have gas prices spiking. We begin with Casey in New Orleans, where folks are indeed bracing for Barry -- Casey.",

Although no official curfew has been implemented, emergency officials are asking that all residents be home and off the streets by 8:00 tonight, 9:00 Eastern time, not just for their own safety, but also, we're told, to keep all of the roadways open for police, first-responders, emergency medical vehicles that may need to get through.  Every single one of the city and region's giant floodgates have now been closed and sealed off. Look at this video. We're told the pumps are all in good working shape, as are the levees, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, that despite record water levels along the Mississippi River here, roughly 10 feet higher than normal.   So any extra storm surge or heavy rainfall could prove extremely problematic. Listen.",

      "sentences": "Hey there, Charles.  Barry is going to become a strong storm, already a strong storm. But will it reach hurricane strength? Ultimately, that's not going to matter. Our current forecast says yes. Even if it's just a very strong tropical storm, these are all dependent on wind speeds. The wind speeds aren't going to be the legacy of this story.  The legacy is going to be all about the water. Part of that story is the storm surge. Everything here in this deeper color pink, that is three to six feet of storm surge. That's going to put a lot of communities right along the coast underwater. Even on the lower end, you're looking at two to four feet of storm surge, that on top of the rain. And the rain is going to be an issue, this storm only moving at five miles an hour, likely making landfall early tomorrow morning. We're already beginning to see some of these outer bands of rain move through the region.  The rain is going to intensify here through the overnight hours. No surprise here, large area where we're under flood watches and warnings across portions of Louisiana and then stretching to the north, as the system eventually does slowly drift to the north as you get going on Saturday into Sunday.   All of this again north of the Mississippi River, and that's the real concern. Now, here's just one forecast model. And every time we update this, we do get a little bit of a difference here. But you see a very tight gradient. This deep white color, that's just off to the west of New Orleans, as much as 20 to 25 inches of rain. So very little shift here, and you could see that fall right over New Orleans, or it could shift a little farther off to the west. But our current models indicate maybe closer to nine to 10 inches of rain right over New Orleans. That's going to be enough to cause some problems as that city is below sea level. You're going to have to pump that water out of the city. Again, the water levels have been so high because it's been such a mess throughout the season. This is the Mississippi Watershed, lot of snow back in the winter across the Upper Midwest, a lot of rain in the Heartland. All of that has to eventually run down past New Orleans.  There are a lot of moderate to major flood gauges warnings across these entire rivers, from the Missouri running down to the Mississippi. And I will leave you with this one, Charles. This is what we're expecting right along the river, the French Quarter there. Again, the levees are anywhere from 20 to 25 feet. We're looking at probably a water level of getting up to 19 feet above sea level.  Currently, you're close to 17 feet above sea level. So we're going to be knocking at the door of what those levees can hold. And the forecasts could still shift a little bit. And we will be watching it.",

A lot of articles have been written and a lot of money invested, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, $15 billion.

If you look at 20 inches of rain, if you look at the flooding of the Mississippi River and the Lower Mississippi River, and you look at potentially the storm surge, New Orleans may find itself right back where they were with Katrina. Now, I am very confident that the levees will hold. It's the rain and the water coming over the levees which is the concerning. And, remember, Charles, if you look at the two most historical disasters in terms of cost of the American people, Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Katrina, both at $125 billion, those were primarily rain storms.

The reality is, is, New Orleans is sinking at about an inch to an inch-and- a-half a year. And until we can get better structure, better infrastructure, these problems are going to continue.

Also want to point out, Charles, about half of natural gas production has been impacted. If you are flying this weekend, have a nice weekend trip coming up, 2,789 flights delayed already today, 326 canceled across the country, 97 cancellations for tomorrow already. Those numbers will all go up.  So, if you think you might be affected, please contact your carrier, rebook your travel and act fast, because, while airlines are waiving those change fees, they're only doing so for a short period of time. The big carriers, Delta, United, Southwest Airlines, they're waiving fees. So is Spirit, JetBlue, Frontier, Alaska, as well as American Airlines. As for the impact in dollar terms of all of this, as a potential Cat 1 hurricane, the legacy is going to be the water.

Roughly 3,000 soldiers have been deployed. They also have, we're told, 300 buses standing by in three separate locations should they be necessary and should something happened with the levees, worst-case scenario, to get people out of here quickly. There is this mega-shelter, as they have deemed it, up in Alexandria, Louisiana, which is about 206 miles north-northwest of here, so further away from the coast. And people are -- those shelters are standing by, and the buses are prepared to take folks all the way up there should it become necessary -- Charles."

      "utterance": "Hey there, Charles. Barry is going to become a strong storm, already a strong storm. But will it reach hurricane strength? Ultimately, that's not going to matter. Our current forecast says yes. Even if it's just a very strong tropical storm, these are all dependent on wind speeds. The wind speeds aren't going to be the legacy of this story. The legacy is going to be all about the water. Part of that story is the storm surge. Everything here in this deeper color pink, that is three to six feet of storm surge. That's going to put a lot of communities right along the coast underwater. Even on the lower end, you're looking at two to four feet of storm surge, that on top of the rain. And the rain is going to be an issue, this storm only moving at five miles an hour, likely making landfall early tomorrow morning. We're already beginning to see some of these outer bands of rain move through the region. The rain is going to intensify here through the overnight hours. No surprise here, large area where we're under flood watches and warnings across portions of Louisiana and then stretching to the north, as the system eventually does slowly drift to the north as you get going on Saturday into Sunday. All of this again north of the Mississippi River, and that's the real concern. Now, here's just one forecast model. And every time we update this, we do get a little bit of a difference here. But you see a very tight gradient. This deep white color, that's just off to the west of New Orleans, as much as 20 to 25 inches of rain. So very little shift here, and you could see that fall right over New Orleans, or it could shift a little farther off to the west. But our current models indicate maybe closer to nine to 10 inches of rain right over New Orleans. That's going to be enough to cause some problems as that city is below sea level. You're going to have to pump that water out of the city. Again, the water levels have been so high because it's been such a mess throughout the season. This is the Mississippi Watershed, lot of snow back in the winter across the Upper Midwest, a lot of rain in the Heartland. All of that has to eventually run down past New Orleans. There are a lot of moderate to major flood gauges warnings across these entire rivers, from the Missouri running down to the Mississippi. And I will leave you with this one, Charles. This is what we're expecting right along the river, the French Quarter there. Again, the levees are anywhere from 20 to 25 feet. We're looking at probably a water level of getting up to 19 feet above sea level. Currently, you're close to 17 feet above sea level. So we're going to be knocking at the door of what those levees can hold. And the forecasts could still shift a little bit. And we will be watching it."

The question now is, will they work? With me, former FEMA official Tom Panuzio. Tom, everyone's concerned about this. A lot of articles have been written and a lot of money invested, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, $15 billion. But, recently, I read an article in Scientific America where they just sort of said, hey, all that work may be irrelevant or inadequate in just a couple of years."

If you look at 20 inches of rain, if you look at the flooding of the Mississippi River and the Lower Mississippi River, and you look at potentially the storm surge, New Orleans may find itself right back where they were with Katrina. Now, I am very confident that the levees will hold. It's the rain and the water coming over the levees which is the concerning. And, remember, Charles, if you look at the two most historical disasters in terms of cost of the American people, Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Katrina, both at $125 billion, those were primarily rain storms. So this is -- this is extremely concerning."

If you look at the flooding that happened at Hurricane Katrina, it was primarily down in the Lower Ninth Ward and over at the 17th Street Canal. The only thing you can do is build the proper levees and redistribute the water and an increase the pumping capacity. The reality is, is, New Orleans is sinking at about an inch to an inch-and- a-half a year. And until we can get better structure, better infrastructure, these problems are going to continue. And my thoughts and prayers are with the people down in New Orleans."

That's 1.1 million barrels a day, and that will push up the price of gasoline across the country. It's at $2.77 a gallon now, up 2 cents this week, before the storm. Also want to point out, Charles, about half of natural gas production has been impacted. If you are flying this weekend, have a nice weekend trip coming up, 2,789 flights delayed already today, 326 canceled across the country, 97 cancellations for tomorrow already. Those numbers will all go up. So, if you think you might be affected, please contact your carrier, rebook your travel and act fast, because, while airlines are waiving those change fees, they're only doing so for a short period of time. The big carriers, Delta, United, Southwest Airlines, they're waiving fees. So is Spirit, JetBlue, Frontier, Alaska, as well as American Airlines. As for the impact in dollar terms of all of this, as a potential Cat 1 hurricane, the legacy is going to be the water.

We have been very transparent, and in fact, we have invited congressional delegations every month, multiple times, members and their staffs, in addition to all the other oversight that we have had, to our facilities, so that they could see firsthand the challenges that we have been facing.

Absolutely everyone has access to fresh water. Everybody has access to food, to snacks. We have also surged an unprecedented amount of medical capability, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, at our facilities to check these folks and monitor them closely. We are still making, on average, 80 trips a day to the hospital, when people are deemed by these medical professionals to need hospital care.

We have had that -- heard that story now throughout Trump's presidency, and you would get these little interruptions of growth, and then it erupts again. And I think that's what we're seeing. I think the market is up now, Charles, because investors are looking at the economy, and they see some sunny skies ahead. You had the employment report was so positive. We're starting to see earnings coming in very well. You're seeing the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. And so this is a beautiful picture. We're going to talk to our kids about, hey, there was a time when interest rates were at 2 and 3 percent, and you had 7.5 million more jobs and people to fill them. Nothing to complain about."

So earnings are decelerating. Growth -- growth is decelerating. Inflation is decelerating. So, to that point, they're counting on the Fed really to keep this thing afloat. And while many of the numbers that Stephen cited are very high, some of those are lagging indicators. So we're trying to anticipate this thing. Of course, we have some announcement, right, coming about the balance sheet, but we're still tightening, because we're still rolling off the balance sheet, until otherwise noted. So it's going to be interesting to see if he cuts in July. Does he stopped the balance sheet simultaneously? Do we get a quarter point?

It was trying to help American businesses, so they can expand, they could be profitable, and they could pay higher wages. And the cool thing about this economy right now, there's this big discussion now among Democrats, maybe we should raise the minimum wage. Are they looking at what's happening to wages and the economy? I mean, goodness, you have got Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Target, FedEx, all these major companies are raising their wages on their own, Charles.

Some of the roads already overtopped. There's been a lot of water rescues throughout the day by the fire department here. In one case, there was even an eight-foot-long alligator on a road. A storm chaser used his truck to create a wake to get that alligator back into the marsh. When you ask people here if they're afraid of the storm that's about to come, most say no, especially those who've been through Katrina in 2005, which, for many, was a life-or-death situation. Some people coming down to look at the water here today actually told us they were excited about the first storm of the season."

We have issued sandbags. We have to have taken people out of harm's way. We have closed some roads because of high water. All those people were evacuated. We're hoping that we have everything taken care of. So far, it looks good for us. We're just waiting for the rain. We have a lot of rain coming. And, hopefully, we can handle it with all our pumps. We opened a couple evacuation centers -- one evacuation center. Let me say it that way. And we are expecting a lot of rain. I don't think the wind is going to be the big, big factor. I just don't like the amount of rain we will be getting."

That's not a concern of mine at this point. But the point is getting more rain than our pumps can handle. Our pumps are designed to handle one inch of rain for the first hour, then half-an-inch thereafter. If we get a heavy downpour in one area, where we get five or six inches in an hour, this would be a big problem for our pumping system."

So how will this fight play out? Constitutional law attorney Jenna Ellis Rives, Washington Examiner's Jason Russell, and Democratic strategist Mustafa Tameez joins us. Let me start with you, Jenna. Obviously, very passionate. All eyes were on this -- on the hearing today. But, by the same token, it's interesting, because the so-called manufactured crisis was totally ignored by many people on Capitol Hill just six months ago. JENNA ELLIS RIVES, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: Yes. Well, Charles, I mean, this is something that was just a complete and total media circus. I mean, Ocasio-Cortez is speaking out of both sides of her mouth just to get media play. This is the same person who just wanted herself to be sworn in for dramatic effect, when she even claimed it was a great sound bite, when the chairman said she didn't even have to be. I mean, if Democrats really want to pay attention to the immigration problem in this country, and they really want to address real solutions in the humanitarian crisis that is going on at the border, the human trafficking, the drug trafficking, all of the things that President Trump has so clearly shown, they would actually work with Congress to pass meaningful reform. They wouldn't do this just stunt in the media and divert attention to themselves. That was all that was going on here. And it was -- it was just a ridiculous show for the media. That was all."

The problem is that no one has any kind of reasonable, realistic, sustainable solution that can actually fix this. Despite what some people might think, nobody wants kids in cages. Nobody wants people in cages. But there's no plan to speed up processing or to figure out a better way to handle reforming the asylum system, so that there are better ways to handle people seeking asylum.  So, for the time being, it seems like everyone's just going to yell at each other for the next six months to a year."

I mean, that's something that President Trump has advocated for from the very beginning. But let's also recognize that President Trump has stayed within the margins of the Constitution by saying that Congress needs to be the one that comes up with the legislation.
