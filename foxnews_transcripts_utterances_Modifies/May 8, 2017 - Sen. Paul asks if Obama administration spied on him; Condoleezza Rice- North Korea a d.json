Buchanan and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice will all join us. But first tonight, explosive new details in a massive political scandal that is becoming Watergate on steroids. And That is tonight's \"Opening Monologue,\" that the mainstream media ignores.  Circa News, which has been at the forefront of uncovering the massive surveillance scandal is now reporting new information that Congress should immediately begin investigating. The reports currently show a political scandal unlike anything we have now seen in American history and should deeply concern each and every one of you, the American people because your 4th Amendment right to privacy is now being trampled upon.  And the big question we need an answer to this evening -- did the Obama administration under the guise of national security target the leader of an opposition party -- Trump and his associates, and his transition team during the course of an election and post-election?  Now, during a Senate subcommittee hearing earlier today, the former Obama director of national intelligence, James Clapper -- he admitted he personally was involved in the unmasking of American citizens. Wow! Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Just one? We'll find out. And now we're also learning that unmasking by the Obama administration could have extended to a number of members of Congress. Circa News is reporting that last month, Republican senator Rand Paul, who will join us in a few minutes, sent a letter to the White House formally requesting an investigation after an anonymous source told Senator Paul that he and other members of Congress were, in fact, surveilled and then unmasked by the Obama administration. Circa also has previously reported that lawmakers and their staffers are so frequently caught up in U.S. government surveillance that top congressional leaders are notified about it by U.S. spy agencies as often as once a month! And last week, the office of the director of national intelligence made public new data that shows a dramatic -- a dramatic! -- increase in surveillance and unmasking activity interestingly all during 2016. Now, look at this chart put together by our friends at Circa News. They obtained this information from the ODNI, now, Office of Director of National Intelligence. This chart shows an increase. Look at these numbers. 2016, the number of U.S. names searched in contents of actual intercepts. The second lines shows that searches of U.S. names in intercepted metadata from the NSA jumped nearly 30 percent in 2016 from the previous year. It has tripled from 2013!   And that's not all. The ODNI transparency report shows a huge jump in the number of unmasking requests that were granted by the NSA from 2015 to 2016, get this, from 654 to over 1,900! Now, these statistics raise alarming, very serious concerns and questions that need immediate answers. For example, why was there such a dramatic increase in this type of activity, especially in the middle of an election year of an opposition party? And why, just weeks before he was out of office did President Obama sign that executive order, 12333 -- triple 3 -- that allowed the NSA to more easily share these intercepted communications -- in this case, with 16 other federal agencies? Was it done so that associates of Donald Trump could be targeted by our intelligence community? Was this information shared across 17 agencies so that it could then be selectively leaked to cause as much political damage to the incoming president as possible?  Now, take a look at this headline from FoxNews.com. This is back in April. Reports and unmasking controversy were detailed, had info about everyday lives. Now, according to Congressman Peter King of New York, who was familiar with the documents that were compiled -- he said they apparently read like investigator files, which he described as similar to what you might see in a divorce case.   Now, the NSA is legally allowed to monitor foreign targets, but we have constitutional protections. U.S. citizens do. But in the event that in surveilling foreign targets, an American citizen is caught up in that type of surveillance, well, their identity is supposed to be protected. It's a process. It's called minimization, meaning they're not supposed to be exposed or unmasked. Now, keeping in mind, you know, why were these detailed files being compiled on Trump associates and members of Congress? Now, we know that information about Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was, in fact, leaked to the press.  So this is now enough is enough. It is now time to put cheap partisan politics aside, protect our Constitution, get to the truth. And what we need to know is, what did President Obama, top administration officials Ben Rhodes, James Clapper, John Brennan, Valerie Jarett, Susan Rice know, and when did they know it? We need to know if a sitting administration targeted political opposition and a political opponent during a presidential election year. Joining us from Circa News, John Solomon, Sara Carter. Sara, welcome back. We're glad to have you. All right a four -- wait, 600 percent increase, or what was it, from 2013 to now? What is the justification? Did we have that much of an increase in terrorist activity that FISA and our national security agencies need to up their game that much?",

So if the NSA -- and by the way, I have great respect for our intelligence community. They do an important job. They -- they -- their job is beyond risky. So their job is to make sure they're protecting our country. That would mean they have the right to supreme court, let's say, a Russian ambassador or an Iranian ambassador.  In the process of doing that, if an American is caught up in the conversation that they are surveilling, they have a process. It's called minimization. And they're supposed to minimize what they know about the American as long as that American is not involved in sabotage or some type of nefarious activities against America. They minimize that. But they also have a process -- and Devon Nunes confirmed this -- that they wouldn't identify the name of the American, even if they knew who it was when they wrote up the report. Then they unmasked these people, even though they're innocent Americans that should never have been surveilled in the first place. And we have this dramatic increase in numbers!

There are about eight members of Congress who know more about spying and they get all of the information that most of us are not privy to. I've asked those eight members. These are the gatekeepers. There's something called a Gates notification. If they looked at my personal information -- if they listened to my phone call, they're supposed to have a Gates notification and there's supposed to be someone who knows that this happened. I've never been notified. And so my question is, are they supposed to tell me they're spying on me, or do I have to request it?

Joining us now, the author of an incredible new book, I've been reading it, \"Democracy, Stories from the Long Road to Freedom,\" former secretary of state and NSA director Condoleezza Rice. Madam Secretary, I am honored to always have you. I've always appreciated -- I'm reading your book and I am loving it. It's up on my website and in the bookstores. You actually said this weekend we cannot tolerate what North Korea is doing building ICBM capability now that they have nukes. Japan, China, Seoul, South Korea, if we take out or try and attempt anything militarily, millions potentially could be in jeopardy. CONDOLEEZZA RICE, \"DEMOCRACY\" AUTHOR: It is a very bad situation and it's a dangerous situation because North Korea has made a lot of progress in the last several years on bomb design and on potentially marrying that to long- range missiles that could reach the United States eventually. And I don't know if the president is being told three, five years, but at some place soon. Now, you have to put together a packet of measures to try to stop it. And the first thing is to try to get the Chinese to change their calculations. Sean, the Chinese have always feared the collapse of the regime in North Korea because they worry about refugee flows, long border, instability. So they've been unwilling to do anything really tough with the regime to change the regime's behavior. They are really the only trading partner of consequence for the North Koreans. They are really the only ones that give the North Koreans military equipment. So you have to now say to the Chinese, all right, time to really get tough because it's not a choice between a nuclear North Korea and the collapse of the regime. It is the choice between you do something about the regime or we will.",

The Chinese president goes back, puts 175,000 troops on the borders, sends a shipment of coal from North Korea home, imports American coal instead, and says he's willing to renegotiate trade.",

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity\" on what is a very busy breaking news night tonight. Sara Carter, John Solomon, Senator Rand Paul, Patrick J. Buchanan and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice will all join us. But first tonight, explosive new details in a massive political scandal that is becoming Watergate on steroids. And That is tonight's \"Opening Monologue,\" that the mainstream media ignores. Circa News, which has been at the forefront of uncovering the massive surveillance scandal is now reporting new information that Congress should immediately begin investigating. The reports currently show a political scandal unlike anything we have now seen in American history and should deeply concern each and every one of you, the American people because your 4th Amendment right to privacy is now being trampled upon. And the big question we need an answer to this evening -- did the Obama administration under the guise of national security target the leader of an opposition party -- Trump and his associates, and his transition team during the course of an election and post-election? Now, during a Senate subcommittee hearing earlier today, the former Obama director of national intelligence, James Clapper -- he admitted he personally was involved in the unmasking of American citizens. Wow! Watch this."

      "speaker": "JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DNI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. In one case, I did that I can specifically recall, but I can't discuss it any further than that."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Just one? We'll find out. And now we're also learning that unmasking by the Obama administration could have extended to a number of members of Congress. Circa News is reporting that last month, Republican senator Rand Paul, who will join us in a few minutes, sent a letter to the White House formally requesting an investigation after an anonymous source told Senator Paul that he and other members of Congress were, in fact, surveilled and then unmasked by the Obama administration. Circa also has previously reported that lawmakers and their staffers are so frequently caught up in U.S. government surveillance that top congressional leaders are notified about it by U.S. spy agencies as often as once a month! And last week, the office of the director of national intelligence made public new data that shows a dramatic -- a dramatic! -- increase in surveillance and unmasking activity interestingly all during 2016. Now, look at this chart put together by our friends at Circa News. They obtained this information from the ODNI, now, Office of Director of National Intelligence. This chart shows an increase. Look at these numbers. 2016, the number of U.S. names searched in contents of actual intercepts. The second lines shows that searches of U.S. names in intercepted metadata from the NSA jumped nearly 30 percent in 2016 from the previous year. It has tripled from 2013! And that's not all. The ODNI transparency report shows a huge jump in the number of unmasking requests that were granted by the NSA from 2015 to 2016, get this, from 654 to over 1,900! Now, these statistics raise alarming, very serious concerns and questions that need immediate answers. For example, why was there such a dramatic increase in this type of activity, especially in the middle of an election year of an opposition party? And why, just weeks before he was out of office did President Obama sign that executive order, 12333 -- triple 3 -- that allowed the NSA to more easily share these intercepted communications -- in this case, with 16 other federal agencies? Was it done so that associates of Donald Trump could be targeted by our intelligence community? Was this information shared across 17 agencies so that it could then be selectively leaked to cause as much political damage to the incoming president as possible? Now, take a look at this headline from FoxNews.com. This is back in April. Reports and unmasking controversy were detailed, had info about everyday lives. Now, according to Congressman Peter King of New York, who was familiar with the documents that were compiled -- he said they apparently read like investigator files, which he described as similar to what you might see in a divorce case. Now, the NSA is legally allowed to monitor foreign targets, but we have constitutional protections. U.S. citizens do. But in the event that in surveilling foreign targets, an American citizen is caught up in that type of surveillance, well, their identity is supposed to be protected. It's a process. It's called minimization, meaning they're not supposed to be exposed or unmasked. Now, keeping in mind, you know, why were these detailed files being compiled on Trump associates and members of Congress? Now, we know that information about Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was, in fact, leaked to the press. So this is now enough is enough. It is now time to put cheap partisan politics aside, protect our Constitution, get to the truth. And what we need to know is, what did President Obama, top administration officials Ben Rhodes, James Clapper, John Brennan, Valerie Jarett, Susan Rice know, and when did they know it? We need to know if a sitting administration targeted political opposition and a political opponent during a presidential election year. Joining us from Circa News, John Solomon, Sara Carter. Sara, welcome back. We're glad to have you. All right a four -- wait, 600 percent increase, or what was it, from 2013 to now? What is the justification? Did we have that much of an increase in terrorist activity that FISA and our national security agencies need to up their game that much?"

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, CIRCA NEWS",
      "utterance": "No, not necessarily, Sean. I mean, if you just look at what the story that John put together and the data that he compiled, if you even go back to testimony last week that Director Comey gave, there are 2,000 terror investigations right now he said in the United States. Here you have an enormous amount of data being collected on Americans, almost like a backdoor intercept into e-mails, metadata, as well as actual physical data of those conversations. And I think what John showed -- and John, you correct me if I'm wrong here, but was an over 300 percent increase since 2013 in the collection of data on Americans."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

It tripled. So either the terrorist threat in this country has gone up that significantly, or in an election year, our NSA, our intelligence communities were gathering information on political opponents to use against them and trampling on our 4th Amendment constitutional rights. What is the more likely reason?"

But I will tell you something -- you mentioned in your opening monologue about the number in 2015 of unmaskings. You said it was 654. That's what the Obama administration actually reported. It turns out it was underreported by a factor of more than three. In 2015, there were 2,200 unmaskings that the Obama administration misreported it, and it's only recently that the Trump administration corrected that number. So unmaskings were much higher in 2015 and 2016..."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Exactly. That's exactly right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, Sara, let's go through this very closely. This is so important, and I think Americans need to know. So if the NSA -- and by the way, I have great respect for our intelligence community. They do an important job. They -- they -- their job is beyond risky. So their job is to make sure they're protecting our country. That would mean they have the right to supreme court, let's say, a Russian ambassador or an Iranian ambassador. In the process of doing that, if an American is caught up in the conversation that they are surveilling, they have a process. It's called minimization. And they're supposed to minimize what they know about the American as long as that American is not involved in sabotage or some type of nefarious activities against America. They minimize that. But they also have a process -- and Devon Nunes confirmed this -- that they wouldn't identify the name of the American, even if they knew who it was when they wrote up the report. Then they unmasked these people, even though they're innocent Americans that should never have been surveilled in the first place. And we have this dramatic increase in numbers! What can this -- if it's political surveillance on an opponents, what would that mean in terms of scandal to this country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "It would be one of the biggest scandals this country has ever seen if that's proven. And all you have to do is go back to 2011 when they loosened up these rules. John and I reported on this. And then we see an increase of this. We see, slowly but surely, increase of unmasking Americans and leaking of information. But what we don't know, Sean, yet is why. And that's why this investigation needs to continue both for John and I, as well as for the Senate, and as well as for Congress to continue to ask these questions. Susan Rice needs to answer these questions. Director Clapper, former director Clapper needs to answer these questions, as well as Director Brennan. We need to know what they were looking at and why. And if they were compiling dossiers on political opponents, that needs to be disclosed. That cannot be held under the shield of classified information."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Last question, and I've got to get to Rand Paul. John, I'll throw it to you. You said last week we may now know who these people are that were surveilled. I'll be joined in a second by Kentucky senator Rand Paul. Are we going to only see Trump supporters, Trump surrogates, Trump campaign, Trump transition, other Republicans in the House and Senate and not Democrats? That would be a pretty good indication it's political, wouldn't it."

    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think so. I think -- you know, there are going to be more names in Congress, no doubt. We're certain of that based on our reporting. You know, questions like the other presidential candidates. How about Marco Rubio? How about Bernie Sanders? We'd like to know the answer to those questions. We don't have those answers yet, but Senator Paul raises an important question that I think's going to carry on for several weeks."

Joining us now, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. Senator, this is beyond chilling. What did you hear? And when you hear the numbers of John and Sara, what does that tell you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.",
      "utterance": "You know, it's sort of mind-boggling. We've been hearing rumors and anonymous sources have been telling us for a couple of months now that they believe that the Obama administration was spying on other presidential candidates other than Trump and that it may be politically motivated. Now, I don't have the evidence. I haven't seen the evidence, but I've requested it. I've asked the White House to look into it, and I've asked both of the intelligence committees. There are about eight members of Congress who know more about spying and they get all of the information that most of us are not privy to. I've asked those eight members. These are the gatekeepers. There's something called a Gates notification. If they looked at my personal information -- if they listened to my phone call, they're supposed to have a Gates notification and there's supposed to be someone who knows that this happened. I've never been notified. And so my question is, are they supposed to tell me they're spying on me, or do I have to request it? But now that we've gotten these sources, I have made a formal written request to find out if the Obama administration did indeed spy on me."

      "utterance": "It may be even worse than that. When we spy on foreigners, we gather up maybe as much as a million pieces of information on a million different Americans. Now, they've looked at 30,000. So what you're hearing about is the ones they looked at, but they have a million different phone calls, transactions, e-mails from Americans who've talked to people overseas. The danger is, if they're willing to use this for political purposes, what if someone's making an international deal and buying a company and it's top secret? It would be devastating to your stock price to know you're negotiating a deal with a foreign country or a foreign company. What if someone decides to sell that to your competitors?"

      "utterance": "The main protection we have in our country is you have an independent judiciary. The police have to call a judge to listen to your phone call or to come into your house. What's happening here is there is no warrant for the American, the American just being scooped up in any conversation with people overseas, and then they're searching the data bank. What I would like to know, one of the questions I asked the White House is, Did anyone in the President Obama's administration query my name? Did they look in that database of a million Americans' phone calls and look me up specifically? Did they ask to unmask me? And they have these terms that sounds like, Oh, unmasking, how bad is that? It's the same as spying. They are able to look at your conversations, who you call, when you call, all of this data, this massive data bank, they're able to look into."

Democratic leaders already voicing their opinions against the nominations. At the start of the president's term, there were 130 vacancies in the lower courts. Tiffany Trump is headed to Washington D.C. The 23-year-old daughter of President Trump and ex-wife Marla Maples will continue her studies in the law school at Georgetown University.

And it's not just North Korea that continues to test the U.S. A senior U.S. defense official telling Fox News that on Sunday, the rogue regime in Tehran test-fired a high-speed torpedo in the Straits of Hormuz. Joining us now, the author of an incredible new book, I've been reading it, \"Democracy, Stories from the Long Road to Freedom,\" former secretary of state and NSA director Condoleezza Rice. Madam Secretary, I am honored to always have you. I've always appreciated -- I'm reading your book and I am loving it. It's up on my website and in the bookstores. You actually said this weekend we cannot tolerate what North Korea is doing building ICBM capability now that they have nukes. Japan, China, Seoul, South Korea, if we take out or try and attempt anything militarily, millions potentially could be in jeopardy. CONDOLEEZZA RICE, \"DEMOCRACY\" AUTHOR: It is a very bad situation and it's a dangerous situation because North Korea has made a lot of progress in the last several years on bomb design and on potentially marrying that to long- range missiles that could reach the United States eventually. And I don't know if the president is being told three, five years, but at some place soon. Now, you have to put together a packet of measures to try to stop it. And the first thing is to try to get the Chinese to change their calculations. Sean, the Chinese have always feared the collapse of the regime in North Korea because they worry about refugee flows, long border, instability. So they've been unwilling to do anything really tough with the regime to change the regime's behavior. They are really the only trading partner of consequence for the North Koreans. They are really the only ones that give the North Koreans military equipment. So you have to now say to the Chinese, all right, time to really get tough because it's not a choice between a nuclear North Korea and the collapse of the regime. It is the choice between you do something about the regime or we will."

I think one of the underreported stories about President Trump so far is the great relationship he is building with the Saudis, obviously with Israel, rebuilding that relationship which broke down, I would argue, in the Obama years, but the Jordanians, the Egyptians, and there's an opportunity. I think, and we'll get to that in a minute. But he was only supposed to meet with the president of China for a half hour. Those meetings went nearly five hours on two occasions. The Chinese president goes back, puts 175,000 troops on the borders, sends a shipment of coal from North Korea home, imports American coal instead, and says he's willing to renegotiate trade."

He got a chance to speak with him, as I understand it, in small sessions rather than large, for a long period of time. And I think they impressed upon the Chinese the importance of this moment. They impressed upon the Chinese that they really do have to do something about the North Koreans. And they did it through the old-fashioned way, which was negotiation and discussion. But also they've been really trying to reestablish American credibility on these issues. And credibility is not divisible.

In his first 100 days in office, President Trump was the target of 1,060 jokes from late-night comics. Presidents Obama, Bush, Clinton, didn't even face that many jokes, never mind how vile they are, after an entire year in office. Here with reaction, Fox News correspondent at large Geraldo Rivera, conservative commentator Monica Crowley. Think for a second. I think actually think, one of the things I've always said about President Obama, his kids seem pretty cool. They seem like great kids.

Remember Alinsky's Rules for Radicals number 13, which is pick the target, freeze it, personalize it and polarize it in order to humiliate the target. Alinsky went on to say go after people, not institutions. People hurt faster than institutions.

If you can reduce your opponent to a caricature, to a cartoon, then you feed into all of the negative traits that Donald Trump may or may not have -- by ridiculing him, you make him smaller.
