Today, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was supposed to gauge support for the various proposals until as you saw the president withdrew his support.  Now the White House, says it was a misunderstanding and the president does support the legislation which appears to include everything he asked for. Like $25 billion dollars to build the wall. Getting rid of the visa lottery program that leads to what the White House calls chain migration, allowing 1.8 million DACA recipients also known as dreamers to apply for a path to permanent residency, and ending the controversial practice they've all been talking about of separating families detained at the border. President Trump, blames families being separated on a law passed by Democrats. We don't know of such a law, but there is a 2008 policy called the Alien Transfer Exit Program which was widely used by the Obama administration and resulted in thousands of immigrant families being split up.   But when it comes to public finger-pointing, there appears to be collective amnesia followed by selective outrage. For example, this week, Twitter went crazy over an ACLU report detailing that children of illegal immigrants were quote allegedly beaten, threatened with sexual violence, and repeatedly assaulted while in custody. One Twitter post said, quoting, \"This is Trump's America, disgusting.\" Another said, \"Wow, are you happy Trump fans? This is what you wanted.\" But apparently, they didn't read the ACLU report very closely considering the incidents allegedly happened between 2009 and 2014.  And over the Memorial Day weekend, former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted his outrage over pictures of immigrant children being held in what looked like dog cages. Saying that this is happening right now. Except the pictures are from 2014. Bottom line, children of illegal immigrants have been placed in U.S. immigration shelters for decades and it appears everyone is now ready for it to end. Martha.",

So, when that happens, unfortunately, temporarily, while the parents go to the process here because they're not going to be caught in released anymore that they have to be separated.

So, there's such a thing as discretion and before zero tolerance was implemented, that was the case with immigrant families. We don't need to separate immigrant families.

If you verse is not having a child. The New York Times reported in April that in fact, these people are admitting this that families brought children knowing that there is a better chance that they would get through and be released and that others. And this is the series dynamic with both unaccompanied minors, and minors, in general, are people posing as parents. So, here we've got the outrage is overcoming the facts. Now, I'll give you an example, there's three reasons why parents or adults are separated from children. One, they are posing as the parent, and they're not the parent, they're a threat to the child, or they are put into criminal proceedings. This is -- it's not a wholesale division.",

And I don't think we're that far away from solving and both President Trump, as well as the Republicans and the Democrats all, say, \"This is an outrageous situation.\" Whose fault is it? Of course, it's the -- there's people who are faking bringing children over and saying that they're -- that their children that's not.  Of course, there's people who are breaking the law coming over illegally, all of that is bad. But the government has to be bigger than that to say what are we going to do about it because there are children who are there, who are alone, and it is traumatic from them, it's traumatizing for them. And I say this not from a theoretical perspective. I live in the South Bronx. I see what's happening to these families with these children. And I see children who are here without parents.

The second thing is that it raises this disturbing equality under the law issue because if Paul Manafort tampered with witnesses or tried to obstruct justice, then, by all means, let him suffer the full force of the law. But we're looking at an I.G. report where it's pretty clear that Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton whose wife was the subject of her investigation at the DOJ and they told us, they didn't want to release that. It was found out by accident, the stealthy meeting, but they asked us to believe that of the 5,000 airports in the United States, they just happened by accident and meet this particular one.",

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Martha. You know the wheels of the new immigration legislation began turning late yesterday when Republican leaders circulated copies of a discussion draft. Today, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was supposed to gauge support for the various proposals until as you saw the president withdrew his support. Now the White House, says it was a misunderstanding and the president does support the legislation which appears to include everything he asked for. Like $25 billion dollars to build the wall. Getting rid of the visa lottery program that leads to what the White House calls chain migration, allowing 1.8 million DACA recipients also known as dreamers to apply for a path to permanent residency, and ending the controversial practice they've all been talking about of separating families detained at the border. President Trump, blames families being separated on a law passed by Democrats. We don't know of such a law, but there is a 2008 policy called the Alien Transfer Exit Program which was widely used by the Obama administration and resulted in thousands of immigrant families being split up. But when it comes to public finger-pointing, there appears to be collective amnesia followed by selective outrage. For example, this week, Twitter went crazy over an ACLU report detailing that children of illegal immigrants were quote allegedly beaten, threatened with sexual violence, and repeatedly assaulted while in custody. One Twitter post said, quoting, \"This is Trump's America, disgusting.\" Another said, \"Wow, are you happy Trump fans? This is what you wanted.\" But apparently, they didn't read the ACLU report very closely considering the incidents allegedly happened between 2009 and 2014. And over the Memorial Day weekend, former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau tweeted his outrage over pictures of immigrant children being held in what looked like dog cages. Saying that this is happening right now. Except the pictures are from 2014. Bottom line, children of illegal immigrants have been placed in U.S. immigration shelters for decades and it appears everyone is now ready for it to end. Martha."

      "utterance": "Trace, thank you very much. Here now, Tammy Bruce, president of the Independent Woman's Voice and a Fox News contributor. Father Jonathan Morris, Fox News religion analyst, and Enrique Acevedo, Univision news anchor. Enrique, let me start with you. You know, when you look at these pictures and you look at the history of this law, it has been in place for a very long time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ENRIQUE ACEVEDO, NEWS ANCHOR, NOTICIERO UNIVISION",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I think we can all agree that family separation is cruel, it's inhumane. And in this case is completely unjustifiable. There is no law in our immigration books that says that children can be separated or should be separated from their parents. That's just not the case. Right now, what we have is a policy implemented by the Trump administration zero tolerance that it has resulted in over 1900 kids being separated from their families in just six weeks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But what -- Enrique, let me ask you this a bit. What do you make of Jeff Sessions explanation when he says -- you know, when a parent commits a crime, the child cannot go to jail with them in order to keep the family together. And they are saying crossing the border illegally is breaking the law. So, when that happens, unfortunately, temporarily, while the parents go to the process here because they're not going to be caught in released anymore that they have to be separated. So, they are trying to find safe places to hold these children. We saw images of some of those areas, obviously, is a terrible situation for families to be separated. But it -- you know, when you look at it that way, doesn't -- does that make any sense to you at all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ACEVEDO",
      "utterance": "Not at all. I think, there is such a thing as discretion. We're not putting shoplifters behind bars in every case and separating them from their families, and they broke the law. We're not putting people who are in possession of marijuana behind bars in every case and separating them from their children, and they're also breaking the law. So, there's such a thing as discretion and before zero tolerance was implemented, that was the case with immigrant families. We don't need to separate immigrant families. We don't need to separate almost 2,000 kids from their parents just to make a point and use that as a deterrent as Chief of Staff Kelly and Attorney General Sessions, had said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Tammy, the other thing that Jeff Sessions said about this is that since they sort of became lacks in this program, it was sort of understood by some people who wanted to get into the country that if you come as a family, they will let you through. So, this is a better way to come, bring your kids, and now, obviously, that changed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Right. That's one of the problems with the policy for years, is that we effectively subsidize this kind of an approach that people found out that if you have a child, you're going to be caught and released. If you verse is not having a child. The New York Times reported in April that in fact, these people are admitting this that families brought children knowing that there is a better chance that they would get through and be released and that others. And this is the series dynamic with both unaccompanied minors, and minors, in general, are people posing as parents. So, here we've got the outrage is overcoming the facts. Now, I'll give you an example, there's three reasons why parents or adults are separated from children. One, they are posing as the parent, and they're not the parent, they're a threat to the child, or they are put into criminal proceedings. This is -- it's not a wholesale division."

      "utterance": "It's a -- it's an -- and so, this is -- are also again. Something that was happening throughout the Obama regime, as well. But it comes down to catch and release. But we've facilitated the choice of a parents and others of bringing children across the border in order to in a way game the system at the border. This is what the president wants to have stopped, he stated he wants it stopped all of us or outraged that were even in this dynamic. And it comes down to an orderly immigration dynamic and security at the border where we can treat everyone with dignity and people are not encouraged to move into the country in this fashion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, let me bring in Father Jonathan. Father Jonathan, you have Catholic bishops and you have Franklin Graham, arguing that these families need to be held together. In fact, the Catholic Bishops going as far -- so far as to say that if anyone is helping to implement this program and is Catholic, they could potentially become excommunicated for being part of it."

    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN MORRIS, FOX NEWS RELIGION ANALYST",
      "utterance": "OK, that was one bishop who actually suggested that, and I don't think it represents all of them. But the fact is, is that we have 20 percent more children in this situation separated from their children this year compared to last year. So, that's a big deal. So, we have to solve this. And I don't think we're that far away from solving and both President Trump, as well as the Republicans and the Democrats all, say, \"This is an outrageous situation.\" Whose fault is it? Of course, it's the -- there's people who are faking bringing children over and saying that they're -- that their children that's not. Of course, there's people who are breaking the law coming over illegally, all of that is bad. But the government has to be bigger than that to say what are we going to do about it because there are children who are there, who are alone, and it is traumatic from them, it's traumatizing for them. And I say this not from a theoretical perspective. I live in the South Bronx. I see what's happening to these families with these children. And I see children who are here without parents. OK, the parents are definitely not perfect, and they shouldn't be crossing illegally. But the government has to figure out what we're going to do for the sake of these children."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So what do -- what do -- what do they do? Do they change the law? Do they incarcerate families together? You know, Enrique, what's the solution because you got the folks who are breaking the law, and there is a law, there is a border. You're not allowed to cross the border illegally. And then, you have I think everyone here in this conversation and outside of it who really understands that this is not an ideal situation the president made that clear himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ACEVEDO",
      "utterance": "I appreciate the question, Martha, because we should be focusing on solutions. And I think the solution is not separating families. There are very few examples of governments using family separation throughout history, and we don't want to be part of that. And the solution is just not building walls and reducing the legal path for immigrants to come into this country. And again, separating children from their parents. I think the solution has to do with fighting the root causes of immigration with having a wider legal path. So, people can come here and do the jobs that we need them to do. There are a lot of solutions that we could you know agree on -- in Congress but it seems that the extremes has taken over the debate. And now, there's no space for a comprehensive immigration --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, at this point, you got -- you got a couple of bills that are going to be considered eventually it looks like, that would allow $25 billion dollars to build the wall, as well as a solution to this problem to keep families together. So, is that a workable solution? Tammy, and then, follow, Jonathan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Well, let me just say that this is you -- we definitely want especially if it's a misdemeanor dynamic where you can keep up families together within a separate kind of facility, so, you don't have to separate them. And then, that process is very quick as a matter of fact. And then, you can go -- they can go home as a unit, but that becomes the political argument of do they go back home to their home country and others want them released here? So, that can be very -- a very quick framework of sending -- keeping families together. And once a criminal proceeding is over usually within the same day, and then, sent home. The other framework of -- I mean, this is -- this is the solution I think in general when it comes to how we handle keeping families together while also respecting our laws here at home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORRIS",
      "utterance": "I -- you know, Martha, I think, we have to can't forget that there is tremendous amount of hypocrisy over many different administration's. The fact that we have, we are right now allowing people to come in, giving them work -- no doubt, giving them work, and then, saying, \"Hey listen, but you can't be a full members of our society.\" Because we do not want to do it a verified system. In our country, we do not want to actually find out who's illegal. And we can't forget that because it's in -- we're taking advantage, and there are children who are growing up right now who have been here in the country for their whole lives, were with families, who simply with the parents are working, but they cannot become full members of society, and it's not helpful."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

So, let's see where it goes, thank you very much for all of you. Great to have you here tonight. So, still to come, former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, got some very bad news today. And tonight, he is behind bars. So what is this mean going forward? And the president also saying that the I.G. report exonerated him and proved why he was right to fire James Comey.

Chief Political Correspondent for the Washington Examiner and a Fox News contributor and Victor Davis Hanson senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Gentlemen, good to have both of you with us tonight. Byron, I'd like to start with you. Paul Manafort, I mean it raises the question of course you know whether or not he's being squeezed, are they putting pressure on him to turn. There's some discussion tonight that Michael Cohen is getting closer to that as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BYRON YORK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well this is kind of maximum pressure on Paul Manafort. The Mueller team has been very tough with Manafort all along. Remember that no-knock raid where FBI agents armed searches -- served a search warrant breaking into his apartment in Alexandria. There's been a lot of this with Manafort. And now this is -- putting him in jail is pretty much the maximum pressure. All of this is based on the idea that Manafort somehow has the smoking gun about Donald Trump that will prove collusion or something like that. But there's no evidence that we actually-- that he has that. Certainly, it hasn't popped up in any other way that we know of in the investigation."

    {
      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "I think two things, Martha. One is that in the United States jurisprudence, we go after a crime and the person who committed is incidental, we go after the crime. But we've inversed the process with Manafort. We start with him as guilty and then we find any crime we can to tag him with the mandate that says it was collusion as Byron pointed out. The second thing is that it raises this disturbing equality under the law issue because if Paul Manafort tampered with witnesses or tried to obstruct justice, then, by all means, let him suffer the full force of the law. But we're looking at an I.G. report where it's pretty clear that Loretta Lynch met with Bill Clinton whose wife was the subject of her investigation at the DOJ and they told us, they didn't want to release that. It was found out by accident, the stealthy meeting, but they asked us to believe that of the 5,000 airports in the United States, they just happened by accident and meet this particular one."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, what Giuliani is doing is part of the political case that the President is making against Mueller. The President is really doing a two- track defense. On one track is the is the legal case handled by Emmet Flood who you'll notice we never ever hear from in public."

      "utterance": "Exactly. We hear from him a lot. And we heard from the President himself this morning and basically, I think this I.G. report gives them a lot of ammunition because they can say look the FBI, the people who were running this investigation we're just shot through with anti-Trump bias. This whole thing was rigged which is what the President has been saying all along."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, the question that the President raises there, Victory, is a good one. Why -- how does Peter Stzrok still have a job? I mean, now that America has looked at all of these text messages and all of this sentiment, you know, it is remarkable and does it signal that we need really to clean house at the FBI? We heard some strong words from Christopher Wray yesterday, but what's required to fix the awful situation that we all read about yesterday?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I was disappointed in Christopher Wray because the I.G.'s data maybe wasn't reflected in its conclusions but it was pretty obvious that these FBI people had this disdain for Trump whom they were investigating at that time and even the Trump voter which they compared of some pretty horrible things I can't repeat on T.V. and it's really disturbing because we don't -- we get the impression that these people are never subject to the consequences of their behavior in a way that other people who are under investigation, you and I would be. And so it's a matter of a quality equal application of the law. But there's something -- I want to get back to one last point and that this entire thing was predicated on the premise that Hillary Clinton would have been present. They say that in these exchanges all along. So what we see is questionable even illegal behavior, they were under the assumption when they committed that they would be rewarded for noble service to a noble cause rather than fall under criminal exposure."

      "utterance": "It was -- it was politicized all the way through. I think one of the FBI agents who actually interviewed, Hillary Clinton said this is in July 2nd of 2016, said I just interviewed the president. So it was politicized from the beginning all the way through the end."

To give you a sense, during last year's back-to-back hurricanes, search and rescue efforts by the service saved more than 11,000 lives. The Coast Guard also plays a crucial frontline role in national defense from illegal immigration, to stopping human smugglers, to fighting to keep drug runners from bringing in billions of dollars' worth of opioids to the United States, all with fewer than 40,000 active service duty members in their ranks. Joining me now exclusively for his first interview as Commandant Admiral Karl Shultz. Admiral, congratulations and thank you very much for being here tonight."

What do you want people to understand about the work that you do there and what you think we need to do in order to make it safer?"

And in our efforts of the men and women in the Coast Guard are absolutely critical to the homeland security of the nation and the national security. You mentioned border security. You know, on the maritime front, we tend to push and try to push our borders as far away from the U.S. coastline as possible against transnational criminals. Last year we with partner agencies and national -- international partners we were able to stem 223 metric tons of cocaine. That's about 491,000 pounds of cocaine, kept that from American shores. That's the same illicit narcotics that fuels a lot of the migration that comes out of the tri border or the north interior that's Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. And those are the folks that leave those, you know, challenging places that show up at our southwest border."

How do we pressure up with what other countries have for this capability?"

We are operating the sole United States icebreaker, heavy icebreaker, the Polar Star. That ship was built in the 70's, it's more than 40 years old. With the support of the administration and the Congress we are on our way to build a heavy icebreaker replacement to serve our national interest that's projecting our sovereignty there. We also operate in the Antarctic where we go into the McMurdo Station and allow critical supplies to get in there to attend to the nation's interest in that part of the world as well."

And we did, as the president noted, we responded in the system more than 11,000, almost 12,000 people. And you know, the first responder it's really not about the number. It's about who that next person you are about to save is. But yes, we have an organization that has capital assets where 42,000 active duty strong. There are bills to pay. And my concern coming in is to assure the readiness of the coast guard. I talk about the coast guard through the lens about being ready, relevant responsible organization.

Hold on, if this is President Bush or President Obama, this never would have happened.

Just as it is in this administration's benefit, sometimes, to be in open hostility and conflict with what the president calls the lying press it works for them in that way and it works for individual reporters. But it's bad for the rest of us who are trying to do this in the right way.

I don't think he walks out at that moment and goes they are so awful, they're so mean, you know. I mean, maybe he says that on the surface.

After that debacle where the president talked to firing Comey over Russia once he said that they put the kibosh, they put -- and whether it was his legal team or comms team. He put the lid on it hard and we didn't hear much from it. Now he sat down with Bret, our colleague Bret Baier. He sat down with George Stephanopoulos from ABC.

I think we need to get the bar up off the ground a little bit from there. Look, the president is obviously speaks in hyperbole. He is always to -- he is too effusive in his praising and he is too effusive in his damning when he does it and no matter he always goes to 11. And when you are talking about Kim Jong-un, he has talked himself into some trouble on this and the salute and all that jazz because he goes over the top with everything. And that leaves him vulnerable. That leaves him open to people saying hey, what happened when -- what happened to this terrible monster that you previously described who now you meet him one time and you say he is great guy?"

When you look at what he says and what he does, you really have to do both all the time. Right? Because he does have some of these hostages returned. We are in the process of getting the remains returned from the Korean War, which is a very important issue for some of these families. And, in many ways, Chris, you know, until you start this process, you don't sort of shed light into the dark places where, perhaps, you can get to a point. I mean, this is the policy idea anyway. Where you begin to, perhaps, see a world where the gulags start to open up and the slave camps start to open up.
