And the framework seemed to do that. So, I'm confident it will get through the House. But, frankly, with the Senate, I mean, Neil, six Republican senators on the health care issue, six Republicans senators voted against the very legislation they supported 20 months ago, exact same language, same commas, punctuation. Everything was the same. They voted against it, though, after they told the voters they were for it and after they had actually supported it. They then voted against it.
