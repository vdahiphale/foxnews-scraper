He sort of has risen above it all. He hasn't had to worry about that. Remember they all came after him. And he still did OK in the polls. But now that it's getting a little bit tighter and you've had four of the candidates drop out, before this next debate, I think you will have to figure out how he can do that. One of the things that is charming about him while he has these gaps is that he is self-deprecating. And I think that helps them along the way. But Elizabeth Warren seems to be tapping into what people are upset about in the country. So she is going for the passionate vote and the anger vote while he is going for the electability vote. And electability is not like the prime mover of getting people out there to have a 15,000 person crowd at your campaign. The day before, she had a 12,000 person campaign. And I would watch the Bernie Sanders-Warren alliance. So far, they have been pretty nice to each other. And if that holds, I think Bernie Sanders will have to be in a position where he will ask his supporters to support her. And then, Elizabeth Warren will get to make the electability argument.",

I don't -- one way or the other, it doesn't make me like Joe Biden more or less when he makes these mistakes. He just -- he should just read off of a prompter. That's what I feel about this. What I find a more interesting is we are back in 2015 where we have the progressives versus the moderates. And what I find very interesting now is that you have the progressives having twice as much percentage of the vote as the moderate.

And he really thinks outside the box on a number of issues. But to the point about death and there were people killed, OK, this guy did crush ISIS. Also, you want to talk about saving lives, no one -- no one is hoping that anyone passes away, but if there were to be one more Supreme Court Justice, he might just nominate the next justice that will overturn Roe v.

Anything that Trump has said or done does not parallel to what we have seen with Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. However, Pete and I talked about this, two years ago, the whole Goldwater rule when it talks to psychiatrist publicly commenting on public figures when they haven't actually treated them, it is unethical. And they're not allowed to do it. And if you actually listen to this interview, it was so embarrassing and ridiculous because he was actually saying we should not be criticizing Trump. We should not be calling him crazy because that is really adding to the stigma for mental illness. But he said the word crazy no less than 20 times through that entire interview.

And now, they are his Spanish inquisition. My theory is that they -- they are trying to make up for what they have done it because they elected him.

Warren, she sees a big surge in the polls. Yesterday, she drew a crowd of 15,000 people in Seattle. Let's start with the poll, Dana. Of course, I think everybody would have predicted the race will tighten at some point. But right now, in a poll that's an outlier does have him basically in a three-way tie with Warren and Sanders. Want do you make of this?"

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, it's a pretty small sample size, but I do think it's hard. It could be an outlier. But I think the Biden people think it could be the start of a trend that they might be able to see. And Biden hasn't really landed a glove on anybody in one of the debates. He sort of has risen above it all. He hasn't had to worry about that. Remember they all came after him. And he still did OK in the polls. But now that it's getting a little bit tighter and you've had four of the candidates drop out, before this next debate, I think you will have to figure out how he can do that. One of the things that is charming about him while he has these gaps is that he is self-deprecating. And I think that helps them along the way. But Elizabeth Warren seems to be tapping into what people are upset about in the country. So she is going for the passionate vote and the anger vote while he is going for the electability vote. And electability is not like the prime mover of getting people out there to have a 15,000 person crowd at your campaign. The day before, she had a 12,000 person campaign. And I would watch the Bernie Sanders-Warren alliance. So far, they have been pretty nice to each other. And if that holds, I think Bernie Sanders will have to be in a position where he will ask his supporters to support her. And then, Elizabeth Warren will get to make the electability argument."

I don't -- one way or the other, it doesn't make me like Joe Biden more or less when he makes these mistakes. He just -- he should just read off of a prompter. That's what I feel about this. What I find a more interesting is we are back in 2015 where we have the progressives versus the moderates. And what I find very interesting now is that you have the progressives having twice as much percentage of the vote as the moderate. And that, for me, to be honest, it concerns me, but I am wondering how that's going to translate in the primaries because I do think the far majority of Americans lean a more moderate.
