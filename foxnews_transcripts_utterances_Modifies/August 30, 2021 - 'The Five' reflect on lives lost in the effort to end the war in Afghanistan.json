So, you can talk about what was mismanaged, you can talk about the future. And we are going to talk a lot about that, about the people left behind, about the people come -- about the legitimate terror state that's there. But ultimately, I got to tip my hat all to the Pentagon using an element of surprise, moving earlier than many people would think they would and getting all of our boys back. So, it is not been a smooth process. We've lost 13 American lives. Almost two dozen additionally wounded that will not be forgotten.

And then of course you have these conflicting stories about whether or not ISIS and Taliban hate each other but then why did they release all the ISIS people from prison. I don't understand that either. The demilitarization, it's what the word is for the equipment. He mentioned a few there but there's like tons and tons you saw that graph that came out yesterday in the Times of all the weapons. I think -- but the real thing now is account -- who is going to be accountable for the big botch. Because that's what this is. This was the big botch. And it's actually oddly a blunder made up of smaller blenders. And I don't know if it's all Joe's fault. But it sure feels that way because he's the guy at the top. But we need to, you know, we need to find -- I mean, like, did the Taliban actually offer control of the airport and did we decline that? That's a pretty huge blunder. And that was -- that's -- it's paled by the other blunders. But you can go -- you can keep going through them and through them and find them.

I'm delighted that they demilitarized those aircraft which means they made them inoperable and unusable. So, we didn't -- we left behind. There was a lot of small arms and stuff they already had. In terms of the threat to the homeland, I'm of the school that says we have over the horizon capability to strike if we see them, you know, coagulating again. I think ISIS is very low tech now. But as a father who had a daughter in Paris in 2015 for the attack that killed over 150 French people it doesn't take a lot of technology to cause a lot of harm. So, I think sadly that's in our future. I think we have that violence in our future. We have to guard against it. God bless TSA and all the rest of them. It's going to be a well time.

We learned that on the last flight out was General Donahue, the head of the 82nd Airborne who was one of the top military commanders on the ground, along with the ambassador, the State Department, DOD leaving hand and hand with the American flag on that last flight out. Heartbreaking images in terms of what General McKenzie had to admit, which was that they did not get every American out who wanted to leave. He mentioned that this will move from a military phase to a diplomatic phase. And that the Department of State will work tirelessly to get any American out who wants to get out by working with those partners on the ground, which include the Qataris who will have an embassy, the Turks who have their embassy and who will be in charge of -- in control of the airport. The Turkish NATO allies will work with the Taliban to get that airport operational so that commercial flights can come back in. General McKenzie was very clear that the military took a decision not to destroy aspects of the airport, operational aspects of the airport so that things like fire trucks and command and control so that the civilian aircraft can begin coming in because there is going to be a humanitarian disaster or otherwise. General McKenzie also made the point that the Taliban is going to have its hands full. Because as he said there are 2,000 ISIS-K fighters, ISIS fighters that the Taliban themselves let out of the prisons, the two key prisons, one at Bagram Air Base, one at Pul-e-Charkhi. Two thousand hardened ISIS fighters, that's going to be a problem. Because there are no Americans there right now, no American forces there right now for them to target. They are going to turn their weapons on the Taliban. And so, that is, I think the -- tonight I think I feel certainly the way, I hear Geraldo and I hear Katie, and the emotion in everyone's voices. We all feel it. The military here in this building, they feel it. This is -- it has been a long 20 years. The war is over but the heartbreak continues.",

There's lot of people feel like the way that we left in the last couple of weeks was not honorable, that it was a retreat to the Taliban. That it was at the behest of the Taliban. We just saw the press conference from the Department of Defense. We will soon see a press conference from the Department of State. Do you feel like this is the moment with all our troops home that the finger pointing begins because ultimately it was not a process handled properly?

And the fact that they got 122,000 vulnerable Afghans and Americans out of that country when they had to, they had to fight their way back in basically. The airport scenes you will remember them. The 82th Airborne secured that airport in 24 hours. And there were, for the most part, other than that tragic suicide bombing at Abbey gate, it was an -- it was an unbelievable effort. You had military planes landing every 45 minutes lifting people off to safety. Is it heartbreaking for the military commanders that they had to leave anyone behind? Obviously. I just asked General McKenzie how he feels after 20 years of war, handing the country that they had seized from the Taliban after 9/11 back to the very same Taliban. I can't imagine that anybody in this country, any American citizen is going to be unchanged by what we've just been through not only from the last 20 years but for the last two weeks.",

And if you look at those five rockets that were fired at the airport last night, the fact that they stopped a massive vehicle with explosives and had to carry out a drone strike with against two suicide in that vehicle earlier in the day. There was a sense that time was of the essence. And I think it's no surprise that those planes would have taken off, you know it was August 31st in Afghanistan. It's eight and a half hours ahead of us right now. And so, they left on August 31st. That was the deadline. They left and they did not leave under fire. So. And they got people out safely.

And the U.S. will keep an eye on things and make sure that nobody leaves the country and poses a threat to the U.S. homeland or other countries. But as long as they're engaged on the ground in Afghanistan, I think from the military perspective, the U.S. military perspective, that's a good thing. You heard General McKenzie say that the Taliban were both pragmatic and business like. Those were his words in these last two weeks. The Taliban wanted the U.S. to leave. General McKenzie met with Mullah Baradar at the beginning after August 14th. He met with him in Doha, Qatar. And he told him that if any U.S. troops were killed, if the Taliban struck against the U.S. forces at the airport that the U.S. would respond forcefully. That message was received loud and clear from the Taliban. And so, now this moves into a new phase. The Department of State will use whatever leverage it has left. Not necessarily military leverage but leverage in terms of the world community. And they will use that leverage to try and get any Americans who are left who want to leave out and also any Afghan allies who are threatened by the Taliban, they will be working tirelessly to do that.",

Those restrictions were dropped as soon as the Taliban took over and the U.S. military were back in to begin these evacuations. So those -- that paperwork was no longer an issue. The issue, and we saw this in real time. The issue was getting those vulnerable Afghans, those Afghan allies whether they were SIVs or people who had worked in, in some form with the U.S. government or women's groups who are now going to be targeted by the Taliban, the real issue was getting through Taliban checkpoints. The Taliban were willing to let Americans through and they were willing to let green card holders through. That's what they told the U.S. military. Sometimes they would turn a blind eye and let a group of Afghans through. But they were -- they did not want educated Afghans to be leaving the country. They need them to build the country. And so, the real problem for most of the SIVs and others who wanted to get to the airport was that those Taliban checkpoints on the periphery. People would try five, six times. We would be on the phone with them and hearing how they would get turned back at that checkpoint and it was absolutely gut wrenching. So now we move into a new phase. Perhaps there would be a land bridge corridor out of the country where convoys of some of these vulnerable Afghans will be escorted by friendly countries who maybe are still on the ground in Afghanistan working with the State Department. But those efforts are continuing. They're just moving into a new phase.",

But you still have 250 according to the U.S. State Department on the ground in Afghanistan. And this question of leverage will be the question on everyone's mind moving forward. The United States does not have much leverage over the Taliban in terms of negotiating the safe passage, not of these Americans but those estimated 80,000 Special Immigrant Visa holders, Afghans who helped the United States over the 20 years to make their way out of the country. It's such a dire situation on the ground. We are seeing reports out of countries like Iran and Pakistan and Tajikistan of Afghans fleeing on foot. The United Nations estimating over the next few weeks half a million Afghans could flee the country over land boarders because they don't have this critical air bridge anymore. And that leverage question is going to remain about how the United States will be able to use diplomacy.

Because we know that the United States wants to push to get the airport open again. Likely countries like Qatar or Turkey will help the Taliban to do so. And General McKenzie wanted to make very clear that the Americans were very specific when they left to destroy certain military equipment and not touch others. So, we actually saw the airport equipment and all of the things you would need to run an airport not touched by the U.S. military to ensure they will be able to get that airport operating again and get evacuees out. But it's a very big question about where these evacuees will go. Qatar took in tens of thousands, at one point it was about 40,000 Afghan refugees waiting here looking for permanent homes. And we've all seen those really heartwarming images of translators and those who worked with the United States who went through the appropriate visa process had the vetting done and then arrived at places like Dulles airport just outside of Washington where they were greeted by people by signs and just welcoming them to the country. Because it was such a difficult process for many of these Afghans as they left the country, taking five and six days just to get to that airport through Taliban checkpoints and then, obviously, that blast on Thursday just capping off such a tragic experience for the Afghan people and for the American military on the ground there.",

So, they're not only able to strengthen their military side, along with reinforcing the ranks with fighters that they actually released from prison, but you also have other actors in the region, extremist actors. Not only ISIS that we have to look at. But groups like Al Qaeda. We saw those images at the prison next to Bagram Air Base of Al Qaeda fighters along with Taliban militants being released from prison. And overnight there was a new video of a very senior Al Qaeda member who had been basically in exile in hiding in Pakistan for over a decade return today to Afghanistan. And it really gives you a sense on the ground of the types of players who will now be allowed to operate in Afghanistan. And despite these pledges by the Taliban that they will not allow the country to become a breeding ground for terror that could ultimately affect the west.

So, when we saw the President earlier today, he knew at that point in time that there were no more Americans coming home. And then immediately following that pool spray where we saw him for a few minutes, we had a briefing with White House press secretary Jen Psaki. She was asked a couple of times about, you know, where things stand, did not indicate we're going to be seeing this transpire. You can guess that that's because she didn't want to, you know, tip-off any sort of -- put our troops in any risk for some sort of an attack as they're finishing their withdrawal which is, as we know, the retrograde period is the most dangerous period. But that just sort of sticks out to me. We did have some discussion in that briefing about know where things go from here, because we were just 24 hours away from the withdrawal deadline, what are over the horizon capabilities look like? What that economic and diplomatic leverage looks like and whether it's going to amount to much. But you know, Jen Psaki said when she was asked, was this mission accomplished? She said, well, I'd point you to the fact that 120,000 lives were saved, but I'll let you decide for yourself. I think the President's going to have to, you know, be the one to speak on that whether this is considered a mission accomplished or just a mission finished.

We've been talking about not leaving people behind. And what we have just seen in the last two weeks is an incredible relationship between veterans groups, private citizens, heroes, all of them, and the U.S. government in terms of not leaving people behind. And so we can quibble right now about whether it's 250 Americans. Do we really know that all of those Americans want to come out? Anyone -- any American who wants to leave Afghanistan, I guarantee you, they will find a way to get them safely out of the country. You still have an airport in Mazar-i-Sharif, you still have a land bridge to Uzbekistan, to Pakistan. There are ways to get those people out. I think we really need to have some perspective on what was just accomplished in the last two weeks. The U.S. military could have said, we're not going back in. We're not going to risk American lives to go back and get all of these allies, Afghan allies, SIV holders out. They did not do that. They went back in under a very difficult circumstance. They fought their way back in. They re-controlled an airport, and they got 122,000 people, including 6000 Americans to safety. Now, the numbers of Americans left, I'm not diminishing that -- the fear that any of those Americans may feel right now. But again, some of them are people who are older, Afghans who have dual passports who've never been to the United States, who prefer to stay in their village out in, you know, outside of Kabul, where they might still feel secure. Some of you may be pregnant, Afghan women who -- American women who have dual passports, who've decided that they want to stay. I can't say for certain, but what I can say is what I saw behind the scenes here at the Pentagon, as well as with all of the nonprofit groups that I've worked with over the years, and I know Pete has worked with, this was an unbelievable American effort and no other country in the world could have pulled off what we just pulled off.",

And so, I think that once we look back on this and have, you know, process a lot of this, looking at how they were able to do that, and they went in and knew exactly where to go, who to get, and be able to get them out safely is going to be quite the story to tell.

This was veterans groups and outside groups pushing, pushing, pushing, finding willing counterparts inside the wire who were willing to break protocol at certain gates to bring American citizens and Afghans in. Eventually, the State Department and the DOD caught up with the idea that they're best advocates in juicing the numbers in getting people across were those outside veterans networks which is amazing. One more thing about what Jennifer said too. I believe completely, that the Pentagon has been wholeheartedly dedicated to this evacuation turned retreat. There's no doubt I have no doubt about the commitment and patriotism of people inside the Pentagon.

There was such confusion. Even if you had a U.S. passport, it was not a cakewalk to get onto the airport grounds. And this description that we saw so often by officials in Washington explaining how people could simply walk to the airport and get through was just not the reality. And I think you're going to hear this over and over again, as people analyze what went wrong, and also where the communication breakdown happened. We also talked with troops on the ground, though. And I think it's important to distinguish between the politicians in D.C. and those who were on the ground conducting and following through on the mission. Many of the officers and soldiers that we spoke with were happy to be there. And when we saw that tragic explosion on Thursday, I thought back to some of those conversations, and just the smiles of the American forces who were on the ground there. They were happy to be there, to be handing out food and water to these Afghan civilians, because they were not there for war. The war was coming to an end. They were there for peace. They were there for humanitarian reasons. And that was very clear.

The veterans groups having experienced war, they know what war is like. These guys, the politicians, they don't -- they come cruising in, VIP. They land for two, three days. They're gone, they're back home, and they tell the constituents here I was at the frontline with the troops. The people who have to fight the wars, they're the ones who are the ones that can tell us when the application of force is appropriate. And it's a sacred obligation to apply that force in a prudent way, in a patriotic way, but not in a way that is egregiously aggressive. Use your power when your power can accomplish something. I also want to say, I think that, you know, to diminish -- and Jen also agree -- to diminish the 120,000, you got to be real careful there. Vietnam was about the same number of people.

And then of course you have these conflicting stories about whether or not ISIS and Taliban hate each other but then why did they release all the ISIS people from prison. I don't understand that either. The demilitarization, it's what the word is for the equipment. He mentioned a few there but there's like tons and tons you saw that graph that came out yesterday in the Times of all the weapons.

I'm delighted that they demilitarized those aircraft which means they made them inoperable and unusable. So, we didn't -- we left behind. There was a lot of small arms and stuff they already had. In terms of the threat to the homeland, I'm of the school that says we have over the horizon capability to strike if we see them, you know, coagulating again. I think ISIS is very low tech now. But as a father who had a daughter in Paris in 2015 for the attack that killed over 150 French people it doesn't take a lot of technology to cause a lot of harm. So, I think sadly that's in our future. I think we have that violence in our future. We have to guard against it. God bless TSA and all the rest of them. It's going to be a well time.

And that the Department of State will work tirelessly to get any American out who wants to get out by working with those partners on the ground, which include the Qataris who will have an embassy, the Turks who have their embassy and who will be in charge of -- in control of the airport. The Turkish NATO allies will work with the Taliban to get that airport operational so that commercial flights can come back in. General McKenzie was very clear that the military took a decision not to destroy aspects of the airport, operational aspects of the airport so that things like fire trucks and command and control so that the civilian aircraft can begin coming in because there is going to be a humanitarian disaster or otherwise. General McKenzie also made the point that the Taliban is going to have its hands full. Because as he said there are 2,000 ISIS-K fighters, ISIS fighters that the Taliban themselves let out of the prisons, the two key prisons, one at Bagram Air Base, one at Pul-e-Charkhi. Two thousand hardened ISIS fighters, that's going to be a problem. Because there are no Americans there right now, no American forces there right now for them to target. They are going to turn their weapons on the Taliban. And so, that is, I think the -- tonight I think I feel certainly the way, I hear Geraldo and I hear Katie, and the emotion in everyone's voices. We all feel it. The military here in this building, they feel it. This is -- it has been a long 20 years. The war is over but the heartbreak continues."

There is honor in every aspect of what our troops have done over the last 20 years. There's lot of people feel like the way that we left in the last couple of weeks was not honorable, that it was a retreat to the Taliban. That it was at the behest of the Taliban. We just saw the press conference from the Department of Defense. We will soon see a press conference from the Department of State. Do you feel like this is the moment with all our troops home that the finger pointing begins because ultimately it was not a process handled properly? Do you get a sense that from DOD and state, there's going to be an attempt to rewrite the narrative of who is to blame for what didn't go right?"

I've seen people here at the Pentagon, as well at the Department of State, many of them will remain nameless over the years. But they worked and they were heroic in their efforts. And the fact that they got 122,000 vulnerable Afghans and Americans out of that country when they had to, they had to fight their way back in basically. The airport scenes you will remember them. The 82th Airborne secured that airport in 24 hours. And there were, for the most part, other than that tragic suicide bombing at Abbey gate, it was an -- it was an unbelievable effort. You had military planes landing every 45 minutes lifting people off to safety. Is it heartbreaking for the military commanders that they had to leave anyone behind? Obviously. I just asked General McKenzie how he feels after 20 years of war, handing the country that they had seized from the Taliban after 9/11 back to the very same Taliban. I can't imagine that anybody in this country, any American citizen is going to be unchanged by what we've just been through not only from the last 20 years but for the last two weeks."

That would have been about 3.30 p.m. Eastern Time. But as you know with the military there is always operational security considerations. And if you look at those five rockets that were fired at the airport last night, the fact that they stopped a massive vehicle with explosives and had to carry out a drone strike with against two suicide in that vehicle earlier in the day. There was a sense that time was of the essence. And I think it's no surprise that those planes would have taken off, you know it was August 31st in Afghanistan. It's eight and a half hours ahead of us right now. And so, they left on August 31st. That was the deadline. They left and they did not leave under fire. So. And they got people out safely. And I think that was, that was the ultimate goal of the mission."

So, I would be shocked if there were not civilian casualties. The military takes that very seriously. CENCOM is investigating. From initial reports we've heard that it was from the secondary explosions from the explosives that were in that vehicle, those two suicide bombers were packing those explosives in the vehicle, we were told earlier today. And there may have been civilian casualties. And that obviously was not the goal but the danger in terms of allowing that vehicle to head towards the airport the devastation would have been much greater."

I'm of the school that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. The Taliban hates ISIS. That makes the Taliban in this formulation my friend. I want the Taliban to snitch on ISIS. I want the Taliban to go after ISIS. Is that the feeling in the building that the Taliban will be an unusual partner? I mean, Germany joined us against Russia. Japan joined us against China. Is there a feeling that the Taliban will join us against ISIS?"

      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "It was an absolute marriage of necessity in these last two weeks to have to deal with the Taliban to have to negotiate with the Taliban, to have Taliban provide security at the perimeter at the airport. That is not a relationship that I envision continuing. I believe that the way the U.S. military sees it is that the Taliban and ISIS will go at it now. And the U.S. will keep an eye on things and make sure that nobody leaves the country and poses a threat to the U.S. homeland or other countries. But as long as they're engaged on the ground in Afghanistan, I think from the military perspective, the U.S. military perspective, that's a good thing. You heard General McKenzie say that the Taliban were both pragmatic and business like. Those were his words in these last two weeks. The Taliban wanted the U.S. to leave. General McKenzie met with Mullah Baradar at the beginning after August 14th. He met with him in Doha, Qatar. And he told him that if any U.S. troops were killed, if the Taliban struck against the U.S. forces at the airport that the U.S. would respond forcefully. That message was received loud and clear from the Taliban. And so, now this moves into a new phase. The Department of State will use whatever leverage it has left. Not necessarily military leverage but leverage in terms of the world community. And they will use that leverage to try and get any Americans who are left who want to leave out and also any Afghan allies who are threatened by the Taliban, they will be working tirelessly to do that."

Those restrictions were dropped as soon as the Taliban took over and the U.S. military were back in to begin these evacuations. So those -- that paperwork was no longer an issue. The issue, and we saw this in real time. The issue was getting those vulnerable Afghans, those Afghan allies whether they were SIVs or people who had worked in, in some form with the U.S. government or women's groups who are now going to be targeted by the Taliban, the real issue was getting through Taliban checkpoints. The Taliban were willing to let Americans through and they were willing to let green card holders through. That's what they told the U.S. military. Sometimes they would turn a blind eye and let a group of Afghans through. But they were -- they did not want educated Afghans to be leaving the country. They need them to build the country. And so, the real problem for most of the SIVs and others who wanted to get to the airport was that those Taliban checkpoints on the periphery. People would try five, six times. We would be on the phone with them and hearing how they would get turned back at that checkpoint and it was absolutely gut wrenching. So now we move into a new phase. Perhaps there would be a land bridge corridor out of the country where convoys of some of these vulnerable Afghans will be escorted by friendly countries who maybe are still on the ground in Afghanistan working with the State Department. But those efforts are continuing. They're just moving into a new phase."

The Taliban can spin it as we need their skills. But they now have their names and their biometric data in many cases, which makes them targets. What leverage do we have to prevent in the middle of a civil war which is likely to be unleashed to prevent these American citizens or allies of ours from becoming hostages from becoming poker chips in a game between two groups that want that leverage?"

Those people left behind. The Taliban they are going to be at the top of the list for the Taliban going to seek retribution. I find it hard to believe that the Taliban would want to go and seek out and kill Americans. You're right.

But you still have 250 according to the U.S. State Department on the ground in Afghanistan. And this question of leverage will be the question on everyone's mind moving forward. The United States does not have much leverage over the Taliban in terms of negotiating the safe passage, not of these Americans but those estimated 80,000 Special Immigrant Visa holders, Afghans who helped the United States over the 20 years to make their way out of the country. It's such a dire situation on the ground. We are seeing reports out of countries like Iran and Pakistan and Tajikistan of Afghans fleeing on foot. The United Nations estimating over the next few weeks half a million Afghans could flee the country over land boarders because they don't have this critical air bridge anymore. And that leverage question is going to remain about how the United States will be able to use diplomacy. We heard General McKenzie basically say that they will have to rely not only on allies but that loose relationship with the Taliban saying we are going to negotiate very hard and very aggressively to get those Afghans out. What those negotiations will look like it's really anyone's guess."

They're waiting in facilities, nice facilities but they are facilities nonetheless where they are basically going to try to figure out where they are going to head next. And many of the evacuees we talked with had no idea. They were simply just happy to be out of Taliban territory. And we can expect some trickle of people in the coming days and weeks from Kabul. Because we know that the United States wants to push to get the airport open again. Likely countries like Qatar or Turkey will help the Taliban to do so. And General McKenzie wanted to make very clear that the Americans were very specific when they left to destroy certain military equipment and not touch others. So, we actually saw the airport equipment and all of the things you would need to run an airport not touched by the U.S. military to ensure they will be able to get that airport operating again and get evacuees out. But it's a very big question about where these evacuees will go. Qatar took in tens of thousands, at one point it was about 40,000 Afghan refugees waiting here looking for permanent homes. And we've all seen those really heartwarming images of translators and those who worked with the United States who went through the appropriate visa process had the vetting done and then arrived at places like Dulles airport just outside of Washington where they were greeted by people by signs and just welcoming them to the country. Because it was such a difficult process for many of these Afghans as they left the country, taking five and six days just to get to that airport through Taliban checkpoints and then, obviously, that blast on Thursday just capping off such a tragic experience for the Afghan people and for the American military on the ground there."

I mean, the list really goes on of American funded military equipment that was in the hands of the Afghan Security Forces now in the hands of the Taliban. So, they're not only able to strengthen their military side, along with reinforcing the ranks with fighters that they actually released from prison, but you also have other actors in the region, extremist actors. Not only ISIS that we have to look at. But groups like Al Qaeda. We saw those images at the prison next to Bagram Air Base of Al Qaeda fighters along with Taliban militants being released from prison. And overnight there was a new video of a very senior Al Qaeda member who had been basically in exile in hiding in Pakistan for over a decade return today to Afghanistan. And it really gives you a sense on the ground of the types of players who will now be allowed to operate in Afghanistan. And despite these pledges by the Taliban that they will not allow the country to become a breeding ground for terror that could ultimately affect the west.

      "utterance": "Well, we did see the President earlier today. He was giving a discussion on Hurricane Ida. And what strikes me is that we heard from the general at the Pentagon that no American citizens were on the last five military flights to leave Kabul. So, when we saw the President earlier today, he knew at that point in time that there were no more Americans coming home. And then immediately following that pool spray where we saw him for a few minutes, we had a briefing with White House press secretary Jen Psaki. She was asked a couple of times about, you know, where things stand, did not indicate we're going to be seeing this transpire. You can guess that that's because she didn't want to, you know, tip-off any sort of -- put our troops in any risk for some sort of an attack as they're finishing their withdrawal which is, as we know, the retrograde period is the most dangerous period. But that just sort of sticks out to me. We did have some discussion in that briefing about know where things go from here, because we were just 24 hours away from the withdrawal deadline, what are over the horizon capabilities look like? What that economic and diplomatic leverage looks like and whether it's going to amount to much. But you know, Jen Psaki said when she was asked, was this mission accomplished? She said, well, I'd point you to the fact that 120,000 lives were saved, but I'll let you decide for yourself. I think the President's going to have to, you know, be the one to speak on that whether this is considered a mission accomplished or just a mission finished. But it certainly has wrapped up and now we do have that remaining continuing effort to get the Americans home 250, potentially, of them and countless Afghan allies. Dana?"

I mean, I understand the Pentagon coming out maybe after the president making an announcement to answer some questions about details of what's going to happen, the details, about who was on the plane, the number of people, etcetera. But the idea that Joe Biden is not speaking as the commander-in-chief about ending the war in Afghanistan and being the first one to say so I think follows the pattern of what -- how seriously he's taken this over the past two weeks. But just in terms of America and where we are, and the feelings that everybody is having, we've gone from, leave no man behind to, \"we did not get out everyone we wanted to get out\" knowing that these people were --"

Bowe Bergdahl, for example, where our troops are put at risk to get him when he was a deserter to get him back. And that was the big talking point, no man left behind. And now, we as America, allowed the Taliban to dictate our security, to take over the country. And then we didn't have any kind of deterrence to say, we're not going to leave until we get our people out. Now, you can help with that. You can make it faster or not. But the idea that we just left and are OK with this attitude of well, a few hundred people are still there. Hopefully, we'll be able to get them out. And we'll work with the Taliban to do it. We don't have a diplomatic presence on the ground. I think that really is -- we'll see how that goes, but I just think that's a huge change in the way that we think about leaving people behind in this country."

We've been talking about not leaving people behind. And what we have just seen in the last two weeks is an incredible relationship between veterans groups, private citizens, heroes, all of them, and the U.S. government in terms of not leaving people behind. And so we can quibble right now about whether it's 250 Americans. Do we really know that all of those Americans want to come out? Anyone -- any American who wants to leave Afghanistan, I guarantee you, they will find a way to get them safely out of the country. You still have an airport in Mazar-i-Sharif, you still have a land bridge to Uzbekistan, to Pakistan. There are ways to get those people out. I think we really need to have some perspective on what was just accomplished in the last two weeks. The U.S. military could have said, we're not going back in. We're not going to risk American lives to go back and get all of these allies, Afghan allies, SIV holders out. They did not do that. They went back in under a very difficult circumstance. They fought their way back in. They re-controlled an airport, and they got 122,000 people, including 6000 Americans to safety. Now, the numbers of Americans left, I'm not diminishing that -- the fear that any of those Americans may feel right now. But again, some of them are people who are older, Afghans who have dual passports who've never been to the United States, who prefer to stay in their village out in, you know, outside of Kabul, where they might still feel secure. Some of you may be pregnant, Afghan women who -- American women who have dual passports, who've decided that they want to stay. I can't say for certain, but what I can say is what I saw behind the scenes here at the Pentagon, as well as with all of the nonprofit groups that I've worked with over the years, and I know Pete has worked with, this was an unbelievable American effort and no other country in the world could have pulled off what we just pulled off."

There's thousands and thousands of Afghans have been fleeing even before this monumental event. Afghanistan is a -- is a deeply impoverished, violent place. I don't anticipate the violence level will diminish at all because of the Taliban. The Taliban is like 18 different groups anyway. You know -- and you got all the ethnic differences there in Afghanistan. You've got the Tajiks, the Uzbeks. You've got the Hazaras, you've got, you know, the Pashtuns. You got all these different groups who think that they have primacy. It's a mess. And that's why I think that if China hits this tar baby, their hands are going to stick right to it."

And so, I think that once we look back on this and have, you know, process a lot of this, looking at how they were able to do that, and they went in and knew exactly where to go, who to get, and be able to get them out safely is going to be quite the story to tell. And to hear from the people they rescued once they're either safe in the United States or a third party country is going to be quite harrowing to listen to."

But there's a bit of revisionism going on to believe that there was coordination from the beginning. This was veterans groups and outside groups pushing, pushing, pushing, finding willing counterparts inside the wire who were willing to break protocol at certain gates to bring American citizens and Afghans in. Eventually, the State Department and the DOD caught up with the idea that they're best advocates in juicing the numbers in getting people across were those outside veterans networks which is amazing. One more thing about what Jennifer said too. I believe completely, that the Pentagon has been wholeheartedly dedicated to this evacuation turned retreat. There's no doubt I have no doubt about the commitment and patriotism of people inside the Pentagon. What the Pentagon and the State Department of the White House are going to have to deal with is what we were going to talk about later on the show, which is the fact that 84 percent of Americans believe that Biden's withdrawal policy was a failure."

But many of the things that the administration has said, including from the President himself, for several weeks now have not matched with what we can see with our own eyes and hear with our own ears from our own reporting on the ground. You've reported on that too, Trey. And I think that's one of the reasons that one, the veterans are frustrated, the American people are coming up with number like 84 percent. You've probably couldn't get Americans to agree on a Mother's Day resolution at 84 percent. And now, you have this.

We talked with families when we were at the airport in Kabul last Sunday. And they described these harrowing scenes of being blocked not only at Taliban checkpoints, but then the area outside. There was such confusion. Even if you had a U.S. passport, it was not a cakewalk to get onto the airport grounds. And this description that we saw so often by officials in Washington explaining how people could simply walk to the airport and get through was just not the reality. And I think you're going to hear this over and over again, as people analyze what went wrong, and also where the communication breakdown happened. We also talked with troops on the ground, though. And I think it's important to distinguish between the politicians in D.C. and those who were on the ground conducting and following through on the mission. Many of the officers and soldiers that we spoke with were happy to be there. And when we saw that tragic explosion on Thursday, I thought back to some of those conversations, and just the smiles of the American forces who were on the ground there. They were happy to be there, to be handing out food and water to these Afghan civilians, because they were not there for war. The war was coming to an end. They were there for peace. They were there for humanitarian reasons. And that was very clear. So, the mismatch between what was happening on the ground and the statements we heard out of officials in Washington, very, very different."

So, they -- maybe it was the military who decided not to do Bagram, but they were dealing with the constraints handed to them by the government that said, you got to get this done before 9/11 so the President can like, have that on that anniversary.

Every time there is a crisis, regardless of where it is, what country, he wants to bomb it, he wants to get the military involved, he wants to commit our forces overseas. I think that the military- industrial complex is a real thing. It was a real lobby toward war and action. And it's not the veterans groups. The veterans groups having experienced war, they know what war is like. These guys, the politicians, they don't -- they come cruising in, VIP. They land for two, three days. They're gone, they're back home, and they tell the constituents here I was at the frontline with the troops. The people who have to fight the wars, they're the ones who are the ones that can tell us when the application of force is appropriate. And it's a sacred obligation to apply that force in a prudent way, in a patriotic way, but not in a way that is egregiously aggressive. Use your power when your power can accomplish something. I also want to say, I think that, you know, to diminish -- and Jen also agree -- to diminish the 120,000, you got to be real careful there. Vietnam was about the same number of people. We got out of Vietnam. We got into Guam, eventually to the United States including the Hmong tribesmen member, this -- the gymnast, the Hmong who won the gold medal for the United States of America. Immigrant vigor, this is not going to be horrible for the United States. And for Graham to say that the chance of another 9/11, that's so reckless and irresponse."

It's the idea that people from these lecterns are arguing that it was some great achievement when they're not answering the question about why are we having an airlift in the first place because they didn't listen to intelligence, they weren't prepared. They claimed they had all these contingencies ready to go. They clearly did not. So, it's not about saying, oh, well, that's not enough people or even though obviously, you can get a lot more people out if they plan more carefully. The issue is that the way this went down. It's not about not wanting to get out of Afghanistan. It's how we got out of Afghanistan is the issue."

And I'm as passionate as anybody else about making sure that our allies come in. They're dancing around about a number they didn't create, and that they don't have a sense of what it entails completely. And frankly, they're dancing around as hundreds of American citizens are still there. Yes, it is veterans who understand the battlefield better than anyone else and want to avoid it. We're also the ones that are going to go back and have to fight it if we leave behind the legitimize terrorist state. And I agree with leaving Afghanistan, I think we should have. We're long since should have. But it's like any sports fan who watches seven games of an NBA Finals. You watch teams compete all the way through and all that anyone ever remembers is the last shot in the last 15 seconds. And what we've done in that last 15 seconds, is airball the way that we executed our withdrawal from Afghanistan and that's what our -- the world remembers. That's what our enemies remember. That's what the Haqqani Network remember. Haqqani Network, Jalaluddin Haqqani was one of the greatest mentors of Osama bin Laden. His network is now the number two of the Taliban and in charge of Kabul. That's a situation because of how we executed not just the last year, but 20 years, that we are part of creating."

I mean, General Milley was happy to go to the podium after he walked to a church. He won't take to a podium about anything now. That consensus says one of two things to me. One, they really did recommend the military recommendations like Bagram, like not accepting the Taliban's agreement to not come into Kabul, all the other aspects. So, maybe they have made those bad decisions, or they didn't agree with them and they were willing to stay silent, which to me is just as problematic.

The refugee situation is not going to meaningfully affect it. You know, it could be anybody that could carry a bomb. I think we have to get used to incidents where our security forces foil one of these attacks in the subway or an airport or a school.

Well, there was a point during the 20 year process where lawyers were fighting the war, where guys were given their mission, and then when they carried out their mission, they were then threatened to be, you know, court-martialed or brought in front of Congress, and the interrogation program is a good example of this. And so, you know, the rules of engagement really held back our ability to do a lot of things, both in Afghanistan and Iraq for years. So, reassessing how we win wars instead of doing things like nation-building to get the job done rather than having those -- in your hands of soldiers tied behind their backs, because the lawyers are making phone calls about whether they can do an airstrike or not is how you win instead of lose."
