      "sentences": "All right. You can keep the volume up. Twelve thousand five hundred strong. The president speaking in Panama City, Florida, 12,500 people. You know, the president is right. We do not see the crowd a lot. Frank is our great director here.  Seeing more shots of the crowd, and overflowed crowd outside. We are told 12,500 strong estimated inside. Pretty big arena. Crazy Uncle Joe couldn't get a thousand people in, let's see, Iowa. Pretty amazing.  All right. There you have it. The president wrapping up.  And we start tonight with breaking news about the president fighting back after two-plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation, 1.5 million documents handed over. Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress. Not one time did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege, not once. Even White House counsel, which to me unfathomable, Don McGahn spent 30 hours with Mueller's pals and Hillary's attorney. Now, the president saying enough is enough, and today, the president did finally say enough is enough by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report. And the White House ordered former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. They already had 30 hours.  The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated not by the House Judiciary Committee, by their staff. For the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened. And the attorney general is saying, and it's not going to happen now. And the endless stream of documents, subpoenas, they're being now rejected now by the administration. In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost, and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge which is borne out of a mass psychotic rage against the President.  And by the way, four separate independent -- four! They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results. The nine-month FBI counterintelligence investigation -- Oh, Peter Strzok, no (ph) there. Oh, we had nothing.   In -- just before the employment of Mueller, Lisa Page said, \"We have the House Intel Committee Investigation.\" No collusion. No conspiracy. No cooperation with Russia. The bipartisan Senate investigation. And now, the 20-month Mueller witch hunt, all determining the same thing. No collusion, no obstruction. Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing in legal fees? And for what? What about every single person that had been called before the committees, or called before Mueller? They all have to pay for lawyers. Lawyers in Washington, D.C., can be as much as $1,000 an hour! Now, they are going to be called in to be asked the same questions, now a fourth, fifth and sixth time?   This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power. And frankly, a brand-new taxpayer-funded witch hunt designed to smear the duly elected President of the United States and anybody that has dared - that dares to enter his orbit in support. That's why tonight, we turn to the Washington Swamp, 19- term Congressman Jerry Nadler wasting valuable time, resources to continue to prolong and continue to push a debunked hoax of conspiracy. The desperation reeks in an effort to be totally transparent, the Attorney General gave Nadler 11 other senior lawmakers access to a totally un- redacted version of the Mueller report. That included everything except grand jury material. Everything but 0.1% was handed over because that's illegal. You've got to keep in mind this is because of a law that Nadler supported in the 1990s. Barr was under no obligation because people like Nadler wanted the law this way. He didn't even want the Starr report sent to the American people, to be seen by the American people, fighting against we the people seeing that. Then they change the law. Now, the Attorney General has no obligation to release one word of the Mueller report. But still, the Attorney General Barr, well, un-redacted classified information, ongoing case materials, other publicly withheld content that might reveal sources and methods, the whole entire country was able to see.  The Judiciary Chairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats all refused to actually take the time and see the un-redacted version. Go see the whole thing!   Instead today, Chairman Nadler's circus voted to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. And according to Nadler, this is all about Barr's decision to defy his subpoena which demanded that the un-retracted Mueller report be released to the full committee. Well, Ranking Committee Member Doug Collins will join us in a moment, pointed out that Nadler once claim that is a subpoena was \"a powerful and course of tool only to be used when attempts to reach an accommodation with the witness have reached an impasse.\" But during the hearing, Chairman Nadler on his high horse in his circus committee, well, he said the subpoena was merely intended to start a dialog with Barr's office.  Oh, that's new. Let's start a dialog. Here, we are going to subpoena you and we'll have other members threaten the sergeant of arms to put you in cuffs and drag you to the committee. Take a look.",

He lost his practice -- license to practice law. He did pay Paula Jones almost $1 million. And yes, he was impeached. Yet Nadler has a whole other standard for President Trump. Just like Democrats care about collusion, but not if it's Ukraine and Hillary. They care about obstruction but not Hillary and her deleting subpoenaed emails -- 33,000, BleachBit and hammers and SIM cards removed. They don't care about that.

The Attorney General will expose their hoax, their conspiracy theories, what really happened. It scares the living daylights out of them because he's going to investigate the biggest abuse of power and that's only just beginning.   So, they've got to smear him before he does his job.

The Inspector General Horowitz is expecting - we're expecting his report on FISA abuse. \"Wall Street Journal\" today pointed out it will focus seriously on the Dirty Dossier.   By the way, why didn't Mueller focus on that? On the other hand, Democrats, the media mob, bad actors in the Deep State will desperately try to extend, even though we've had four separate investigations that say no Russia collusion. They will try to pass it on as long as humanly possible. And this includes the king of the Deep State himself, James Comey, is noticeably flustered at the thought of the Attorney General that is now investigating the Deep State spying. And by the way, the FISA application, the first one that he signed in October, that verified the bulk of information that he claimed was true and verified to the best of his ability, that was in October of 2016 and in January 2017, told the President it is salacious and unverified. He lied either in October of 2016, January of 2017 or both. I know he thinks he's a super patriot. I have said it before. Jimbo, you have the right to remain silent. You talking like this is a bad idea. I suggest you take my advice. Take a look.

Everybody gets to talk to Mueller, everyone is encouraged to go talk to Mueller and Congressional committees, no executive privilege. President answers questions. It goes on and on.

      "utterance": "All right. You can keep the volume up. Twelve thousand five hundred strong. The president speaking in Panama City, Florida, 12,500 people. You know, the president is right. We do not see the crowd a lot. Frank is our great director here. Seeing more shots of the crowd, and overflowed crowd outside. We are told 12,500 strong estimated inside. Pretty big arena. Crazy Uncle Joe couldn't get a thousand people in, let's see, Iowa. Pretty amazing. All right. There you have it. The president wrapping up. And we start tonight with breaking news about the president fighting back after two-plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation, 1.5 million documents handed over. Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress. Not one time did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege, not once. Even White House counsel, which to me unfathomable, Don McGahn spent 30 hours with Mueller's pals and Hillary's attorney. Now, the president saying enough is enough, and today, the president did finally say enough is enough by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report. And the White House ordered former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress. They already had 30 hours. The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated not by the House Judiciary Committee, by their staff. For the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened. And the attorney general is saying, and it's not going to happen now. And the endless stream of documents, subpoenas, they're being now rejected now by the administration. In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost, and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge which is borne out of a mass psychotic rage against the President. And by the way, four separate independent -- four! They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results. The nine-month FBI counterintelligence investigation -- Oh, Peter Strzok, no (ph) there. Oh, we had nothing. In -- just before the employment of Mueller, Lisa Page said, \"We have the House Intel Committee Investigation.\" No collusion. No conspiracy. No cooperation with Russia. The bipartisan Senate investigation. And now, the 20-month Mueller witch hunt, all determining the same thing. No collusion, no obstruction. Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing in legal fees? And for what? What about every single person that had been called before the committees, or called before Mueller? They all have to pay for lawyers. Lawyers in Washington, D.C., can be as much as $1,000 an hour! Now, they are going to be called in to be asked the same questions, now a fourth, fifth and sixth time? This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power. And frankly, a brand-new taxpayer-funded witch hunt designed to smear the duly elected President of the United States and anybody that has dared - that dares to enter his orbit in support. That's why tonight, we turn to the Washington Swamp, 19- term Congressman Jerry Nadler wasting valuable time, resources to continue to prolong and continue to push a debunked hoax of conspiracy. The desperation reeks in an effort to be totally transparent, the Attorney General gave Nadler 11 other senior lawmakers access to a totally un- redacted version of the Mueller report. That included everything except grand jury material. Everything but 0.1% was handed over because that's illegal. You've got to keep in mind this is because of a law that Nadler supported in the 1990s. Barr was under no obligation because people like Nadler wanted the law this way. He didn't even want the Starr report sent to the American people, to be seen by the American people, fighting against we the people seeing that. Then they change the law. Now, the Attorney General has no obligation to release one word of the Mueller report. But still, the Attorney General Barr, well, un-redacted classified information, ongoing case materials, other publicly withheld content that might reveal sources and methods, the whole entire country was able to see. The Judiciary Chairman Nadler and his fellow Democrats all refused to actually take the time and see the un-redacted version. Go see the whole thing! Instead today, Chairman Nadler's circus voted to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress. And according to Nadler, this is all about Barr's decision to defy his subpoena which demanded that the un-retracted Mueller report be released to the full committee. Well, Ranking Committee Member Doug Collins will join us in a moment, pointed out that Nadler once claim that is a subpoena was \"a powerful and course of tool only to be used when attempts to reach an accommodation with the witness have reached an impasse.\" But during the hearing, Chairman Nadler on his high horse in his circus committee, well, he said the subpoena was merely intended to start a dialog with Barr's office. Oh, that's new. Let's start a dialog. Here, we are going to subpoena you and we'll have other members threaten the sergeant of arms to put you in cuffs and drag you to the committee. Take a look."

He lost his practice -- license to practice law. He did pay Paula Jones almost $1 million. And yes, he was impeached. Yet Nadler has a whole other standard for President Trump. Just like Democrats care about collusion, but not if it's Ukraine and Hillary. They care about obstruction but not Hillary and her deleting subpoenaed emails -- 33,000, BleachBit and hammers and SIM cards removed. They don't care about that. They care about - I believe but only for a high school student Kavanaugh, not for Lieutenant Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, selective modern outrage. Anyway watch this."

And by the way, his shift in opinion is not just an exercise in anti-Trump vitriol and hypocrisy, Nadler's current fishing expedition is about so much more than a simple case of Trump hate rage Derangement Syndrome. Democrats now fear the Attorney General, caught red-handed, concocting, perpetuating a massive fraud. This is what's underlying the fear and the hatred in the attacks against the Attorney General. The Attorney General will expose their hoax, their conspiracy theories, what really happened. It scares the living daylights out of them because he's going to investigate the biggest abuse of power and that's only just beginning. So, they've got to smear him before he does his job. We'll have more of that in a moment, but joining us with more the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Doug Collins. We'll get back to my monologue in a second. Congressman, you actually picked up, I saw on Twitter - you are the guy, a lot of credit, I stole it, so I got to give credit and attribution.

Bill Barr did what the regulations said they were to do. He actually offered more than he should have, and what are they rewarding with, a contempt in record time, ten times faster than Eric Holder was held in contempt.

But now, he has been very clear -- Hillary's rigged investigation, FISA abuse, we of course also have the Horowitz report, an attempt to undo duly elected President, the abuse of the Intelligence Committee -- the intelligence tools that we have by a few high-ranking people, all of this now will come to the forefront.

      "speaker": "COLLINS",

When you have a Chairman of the Judiciary Committee say that a subpoena is something to start a dialog with, that's crazy. That's not what a subpoena is for. It's not to prop up your position in court; it is actually to get documents and he asked for everything, including what the Attorney General can't give him. He's asking the Attorney General to break the law. You want to know what this was about today? All you got to do is listen to what Hank Johnson from Georgia said. He said we've got to get the documents. So, how can we impeach if we don't get the documents? And then when asked about the time frame, he said we don't have 400 days. Sean, this is -- the people need to know what's happening here. There is a rush to judgment because they don't like -- what you just saw just a few minutes ago in Florida where the American public are seeing a President who is leading, who has an economy that's booming and growing."

On the one hand, the Attorney General Barr will do his job. The Inspector General Horowitz is expecting - we're expecting his report on FISA abuse. \"Wall Street Journal\" today pointed out it will focus seriously on the Dirty Dossier. By the way, why didn't Mueller focus on that? On the other hand, Democrats, the media mob, bad actors in the Deep State will desperately try to extend, even though we've had four separate investigations that say no Russia collusion. They will try to pass it on as long as humanly possible. And this includes the king of the Deep State himself, James Comey, is noticeably flustered at the thought of the Attorney General that is now investigating the Deep State spying. And by the way, the FISA application, the first one that he signed in October, that verified the bulk of information that he claimed was true and verified to the best of his ability, that was in October of 2016 and in January 2017, told the President it is salacious and unverified. He lied either in October of 2016, January of 2017 or both. I know he thinks he's a super patriot. I have said it before. Jimbo, you have the right to remain silent. You talking like this is a bad idea. I suggest you take my advice. Take a look.

And now, in the coming weeks, they will try to subpoena everyone, anyone associated with the Special Counsel's 20-month investigation, including Mueller himself. And while the White House moves to block Mueller from appearing and put this divisive witch hunt to rest after two-plus years, Mueller does have serious questions I'd like answered. Let not your heart be troubled because, in the coming weeks, truth will prevail, justice will be served. Our constitutional republic will survive. Joining us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordon and I got to give credit to both of them and the entire Freedom Caucus, including Doug Collins.

They didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele was desperate to stop Trump, and they didn't tell the court that Christopher Steele had been fired by the FBI because he was out talking to the press, and yet they used the document."

Doesn't the application - you guys correct me if I'm wrong and thanks for not sharing all of the secret information, both of you got the information from Bruce Ohr that he warned everybody that Steele hated Trump, it wasn't verified, and Hillary paid for it. But now we have Steele at the State Department and all that information was withheld."

When we come back, a lot more to get to tonight. Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett on all this new breaking information and the attempts to character assassinate Barr, straight ahead."

      "utterance": "Alright, here with tonight's breaking news more on and author of the number one New York Times best seller, the Russia hoax Fox News Legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with Fox News Contributor, Sara Carter. Sara, let's start with the reporting side of this. President cooperates fully for over two years. Everybody gets to talk to Mueller, everyone is encouraged to go talk to Mueller and Congressional committees, no executive privilege. President answers questions. It goes on and on. The fourth time now, no conspiracy, collusion, nothing, okay. 1.5 million documents. Now, this is now about harassment. This isn't about trying to get information. And the people -- the working men and women, they don't make a whole lot of money in D.C. And every time they are stuck testifying, they're paying up to $1,000 an hour for their attorney because nobody would be stupid enough not to hire one to go for a perjury trap every time they are called in for this crap."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "That's right, Sean. I mean, we have seen what's happened to General Flynn, we've seen what's happened to other people who have testified like Sam Clovis. I mean, they are continually dragging it out. And I think the American people realize what is going on here. This has been so highly politicized. The President did the right thing, he did the right thing by evoking executive privilege over the Mueller Report. They have given -- Attorney General Barr has given every chance for Representative Nadler to view this. The only thing that's redacted is, like you said, a very small amount of grand jury material and that's by law. I think a second very important point is that we have to bring up here is that the FBI, if we're looking at the whole issue of spying and this debate and how the Democrats are politicizing this, the whole issue of spying is this - is the fact that--"

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, Comey just said he didn't spy. What planet is this idiot living on when he signed the FISA warrant to spy on Carter Page and the Trump campaign? All right, we are running out of time. In the 206 year history of the House Judiciary Committee, Nadler doesn't want to interview or question Barr, or the Democrats. They want their lawyers to do it. It's never happened, Gregg Jarrett. I wouldn't do that, nor - and they had access to the un-redacted Mueller report. They're just lying, it's a circus sideshow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, the ever hysterical Jerry Nadler is saying this is a constitutional crisis. He would think a dirty diaper is a crisis. Everything that Donald Trump and his administration does is somehow a crisis. The fact is that Barr could be prosecuted for turning over grand jury material that Nadler is demanding. So Barr is simply following the law and Jerry Nadler wouldn't know the law if it slapped him in the face, took him forever to get through a law school."

Thank you so much for watching. You make this show possible. Big show tomorrow The Great One, Mark Levin, is going to weigh in on the Attorney General. Oh, they want to stop him from getting to the truth, of course. But let not your heart be troubled. Why? Because the news continues. I think she is back in the swamp tonight. Laura Ingraham.
