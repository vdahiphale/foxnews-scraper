We're going to talk to Mike Huckabee about the left's new vigilante politics. First it was his daughter, now he's been targeted by the PC police and as well as the majority leader of the US Senate. Also even though the court backs Trumps ban in a new ruling, Democrats are still saying, \"Well, it's racist\". We're going to debate the fall out. And Victor Davis Hanson, that's always fun, here's an inventive way for the left to put its money where its mouth is when they talk of welcoming illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to the country. It's a debate you're not going to want to miss. But first, the New Know Nothings, that's the focus of tonight's Angle.  Now the Democrats like to portray themselves as members of the enlightened class. They're the elites and Conservatives are the vulgarians so Trump, of course, to them is the ultimate know nothing, right. I mean he's a guy who shoots from the hip and the mouth. He hasn't marinated himself sufficiently in the writings of let's say, Aristotle and Plato. And he doesn't understand world history or the complexity of geo-politics. He lacks compassion and is so, so crass.",

      "sentences": "Meanwhile the same left wingers who claim Trump is a low brow ignoramus, are conspiring to make our children something far worse in my mind. Not only do today's Liberals, many of them, hate our American traditions and a lot of our heritage, but they're also the agents of historical and cultural purge, the like of which I don't think we've ever seen in our nation.   Now you know it's gotten bad when just this week, leftist Librarians took it upon themselves to strike Laura Ingalls Wilder's name from a Becher Children's Book Award. The American Library Association first awarded the prize to Wilder herself back in 1954 and they later named it after her. But now the librarians claim that Wilder's work includes stereotypical attitudes not consistent with values regarding the depiction of Native Americans. Now I think I'm right here, Little House was after all set in the 1800's of Minnesota. So don't we want to know how people in the past lived, how they thought? And frankly, how they survived? My view is if we hide, or worse, demolish our history, where do our children go to learn the lessons of the past? So I guess Mark Twain, Truman Capote, Flannery O'Connor, Harper Lee and those other stereotypical writers who will also soon have to be banned as well. So who are the real book banners now? Well I guess there's always those lovely PC graphic novels kids. Now this is the same leftist mentality that has led to, of course, the destruction of historical markers and statues all over the country. What amount to marks the city councils have ordered the removal of confederal monuments from public spaces, removing history altogether, rather than allowing the next generation to see it, interpret it and yes, debate it. Now these official acts, I think, have inspired left wing activists to take it upon themselves to topple or deface statues, which for good or for bad of course, are part of our national memory.   And by the way, I'm saying this as a Connecticut Yankee, I got no affinity for the south, but it doesn't stop there. Even this 1925 World War One Cross in Maryland is now considered offensive to militant atheists. They filed a suit to have the memorial removed. And the four circuit court of appeals agreed with them and ordered the peace cross's demolition. So now, who are the intolerant know nothings again? The left I would submit is so blinded, dogmatic in their ideology and their hatred that they refuse to accept even basic facts, sometimes scientific facts. Abortion is but one example. Now they continue to deny the obvious truth of human life in the womb. Now far from the article of faith or religious understanding, there is a scientific fact and we have the pictures to prove it. Who could deny that an ultra sound of a 12 week old child, preborn child in the womb, is a living human being, growing and living? But groups like Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party at large, they are determined. Look the other way, they don't even like the fact that people can see this, mothers seeing these images. The visual evidence, the proof life is a threat, threat to the abortion racket, they make hundreds of millions of dollars on this, don't look. The left is so anti debate, so anti dialogue that they prefer to intimidate now and demonize their political opponents rather than convince them. Convince them that their argument's the right one, bring people along to your point of view. No, no, no we're not going to do that. Instead they resolve to slander and labelling Conservatives or Trump supporters as, remember Hillary called them the deplorables, Obama said they're people clinging to their guns and their religion.  Now we've told you about those 2016 texts, this all bleeds through the process, all the way down to FBI agents working on the Hillary Clinton probe. One said that Trump supporters, not deplorables, but they're all poor to middle class, uneducated, lazy POS, look it up if you don't know what it means, that think you will magically grant them jobs for doing nothing. Another referred to his voters from Ohio as, \"Retarded\". Nice, no bias there, but sadly now, it's gotten even worse.",

Treating a White House official like a criminal to be hunted and captured, completely justified in their minds.

Now again, the left refuses to acknowledge, basic truths, basic facts. It's a national security threat and it's posed by immigration from certain regions in the world. We can't vet these people, no systems in place. Well the court today weighed in.

Okay I don't like all Donald Trump's language either, however, he's not shutting down anyone's speech and in the great debate stage of ideas, Liberals can't win.   So if you're Milo Annapolis or if you're Ben Shapiro and you go to a college campus, they shut down their speech. If you're in the IRS, you shut down Conservative groups from organizing. If you're Secretary Nielson, you'll go to her house and shut her down there. If you're actually Peter Strzok you'll say, \"I'm going to shut down the will of the people in an electorate, I'm going to undo it in the FBI\".

But the targeting Garland, is what I find to be, that's scary because when you get crowds of people around an individual, it doesn't matter if it's in a public place, if they feel another person is sub-human.

All right, Allen, here are the 10 countries with the largest Muslim populations, this is the most recent time it was checked -- Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Algeria, Morocco. If Donald Trump was targeting Muslim majority countries, why wouldn't he target the largest Muslim majority countries in the world?",

It started from a complete class of people, including green card holders and non-immigrant holders, and it moved down to just people who are currently applying for visas. So it's a little bit different in scope and size. And just because you discriminate against one person out of that group doesn't mean you are not discriminating against the whole group as a whole.

And so we are really looking at a system where even Jimmy Carter had a country on the list. So did Ronald Reagan. So it's not unprecedented.

We're going to talk to Mike Huckabee about the left's new vigilante politics. First it was his daughter, now he's been targeted by the PC police and as well as the majority leader of the US Senate. Also even though the court backs Trumps ban in a new ruling, Democrats are still saying, \"Well, it's racist\". We're going to debate the fall out. And Victor Davis Hanson, that's always fun, here's an inventive way for the left to put its money where its mouth is when they talk of welcoming illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to the country. It's a debate you're not going to want to miss. But first, the New Know Nothings, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Now the Democrats like to portray themselves as members of the enlightened class. They're the elites and Conservatives are the vulgarians so Trump, of course, to them is the ultimate know nothing, right. I mean he's a guy who shoots from the hip and the mouth. He hasn't marinated himself sufficiently in the writings of let's say, Aristotle and Plato. And he doesn't understand world history or the complexity of geo-politics. He lacks compassion and is so, so crass."

      "utterance": "Meanwhile the same left wingers who claim Trump is a low brow ignoramus, are conspiring to make our children something far worse in my mind. Not only do today's Liberals, many of them, hate our American traditions and a lot of our heritage, but they're also the agents of historical and cultural purge, the like of which I don't think we've ever seen in our nation. Now you know it's gotten bad when just this week, leftist Librarians took it upon themselves to strike Laura Ingalls Wilder's name from a Becher Children's Book Award. The American Library Association first awarded the prize to Wilder herself back in 1954 and they later named it after her. But now the librarians claim that Wilder's work includes stereotypical attitudes not consistent with values regarding the depiction of Native Americans. Now I think I'm right here, Little House was after all set in the 1800's of Minnesota. So don't we want to know how people in the past lived, how they thought? And frankly, how they survived? My view is if we hide, or worse, demolish our history, where do our children go to learn the lessons of the past? So I guess Mark Twain, Truman Capote, Flannery O'Connor, Harper Lee and those other stereotypical writers who will also soon have to be banned as well. So who are the real book banners now? Well I guess there's always those lovely PC graphic novels kids. Now this is the same leftist mentality that has led to, of course, the destruction of historical markers and statues all over the country. What amount to marks the city councils have ordered the removal of confederal monuments from public spaces, removing history altogether, rather than allowing the next generation to see it, interpret it and yes, debate it. Now these official acts, I think, have inspired left wing activists to take it upon themselves to topple or deface statues, which for good or for bad of course, are part of our national memory. And by the way, I'm saying this as a Connecticut Yankee, I got no affinity for the south, but it doesn't stop there. Even this 1925 World War One Cross in Maryland is now considered offensive to militant atheists. They filed a suit to have the memorial removed. And the four circuit court of appeals agreed with them and ordered the peace cross's demolition. So now, who are the intolerant know nothings again? The left I would submit is so blinded, dogmatic in their ideology and their hatred that they refuse to accept even basic facts, sometimes scientific facts. Abortion is but one example. Now they continue to deny the obvious truth of human life in the womb. Now far from the article of faith or religious understanding, there is a scientific fact and we have the pictures to prove it. Who could deny that an ultra sound of a 12 week old child, preborn child in the womb, is a living human being, growing and living? But groups like Planned Parenthood and the Democratic Party at large, they are determined. Look the other way, they don't even like the fact that people can see this, mothers seeing these images. The visual evidence, the proof life is a threat, threat to the abortion racket, they make hundreds of millions of dollars on this, don't look. The left is so anti debate, so anti dialogue that they prefer to intimidate now and demonize their political opponents rather than convince them. Convince them that their argument's the right one, bring people along to your point of view. No, no, no we're not going to do that. Instead they resolve to slander and labelling Conservatives or Trump supporters as, remember Hillary called them the deplorables, Obama said they're people clinging to their guns and their religion. Now we've told you about those 2016 texts, this all bleeds through the process, all the way down to FBI agents working on the Hillary Clinton probe. One said that Trump supporters, not deplorables, but they're all poor to middle class, uneducated, lazy POS, look it up if you don't know what it means, that think you will magically grant them jobs for doing nothing. Another referred to his voters from Ohio as, \"Retarded\". Nice, no bias there, but sadly now, it's gotten even worse."

Now again, the left refuses to acknowledge, basic truths, basic facts. It's a national security threat and it's posed by immigration from certain regions in the world. We can't vet these people, no systems in place. Well the court today weighed in.

Now in the 1850's, America saw the rise of the Know Nothing Party. It was an anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic Political movement that sprang from what was ultimately a secret society. And today, we're seeing the rise of another Know Nothing Party made up of secret forces deployed to undermine the will of the people and their representatives. They know nothing of facts, nothing of history and nothing of the damage that they're doing now to the Republic. They're called Democrats and that's the Angle.

He started off during his campaign by talking about punching people, beating people, he's called the NFL players SOBS so I think that this is a rare toxic atmosphere in Washington DC but I think the President has to take a lot of responsibility for it.

The problem is what they do on the left is say, \"Well Donald Trump uses language we don't like\". Okay I don't like all Donald Trump's language either, however, he's not shutting down anyone's speech and in the great debate stage of ideas, Liberals can't win. So if you're Milo Annapolis or if you're Ben Shapiro and you go to a college campus, they shut down their speech. If you're in the IRS, you shut down Conservative groups from organizing. If you're Secretary Nielson, you'll go to her house and shut her down there. If you're actually Peter Strzok you'll say, \"I'm going to shut down the will of the people in an electorate, I'm going to undo it in the FBI\". There's a difference in speech versus taking action to shut down speech. I would say if you at this young lady who yelled FU to the President as he walked into the capitol last week."

Putting a wanted poster in your neighbourhood. Telling people to crowd around other people. So you can disagree with Trump, you don't like the travel ban, you don't like the immigration laws, that's fine in debate, I have no problem with that, interesting debate on both sides. But the targeting Garland, is what I find to be, that's scary because when you get crowds of people around an individual, it doesn't matter if it's in a public place, if they feel another person is sub-human. We saw this in the racist south, people were considered sub-human and they felt lie they could do anything to Black America.

Now it seems like the left is on a mission for it to be impossible to be a Conservative in public, when we come back, we'll show you more. The left's turned vigilante politics is not slowing. Protestors descended on the apartment of Senior Presidential advisor, Stephen Miller, yesterday chanting immigrants are welcome here. Well who said they weren't welcome in the apartment, I'm sure they are. They cast out wanted posters calling Miller a white nationalist, oh that's original, accusing him of crimes against humanity and promoting Nazi and other extremist ideologies. They're so tedious, they got come up some ne lingo. Additionally late night comedians are attacking White House secretary Sarah Sanders, not because of anything she did, but because she was recently asked to leave a Virginia Restaurant because of the President's policies. SETH MEYERS, HOST \"LATE NIGHT WITH SETH MEYERS\": Well this weekend Sarah Huckabee Sanders got to do what Conservative white women love to most, speak with the manager.

All right Gov, you gave me some good news on my radio show on Monday. You broke it that that Red Hen manager walked across the street with a group of people and followed your daughter's family, because she was already gone, to another restaurant. So they apparently can't eat anywhere, period. But now you see Stephen Miller being targeted with these wanted posters which, again, incites people to do what?

You labelled him well a moment ago, not very complimentary in some ways, but pretty accurately, he's a very nerdy policy guy, brilliant, beyond brilliant. But he is no screaming kind of guy. He is nose to the grindstone sort of fella. But when this becomes personal and people take it away from the public venues of a town hall or a speech in public at a university campus and they start taking it to people's homes. And they start making it so that a person like Pam Bondi can't go see a Mister Rogers movie, or so that my daughter can't even get to the appetizer because the moment she gets there, the manager tosses her out and tells her to leave.

But I do think her attitude was, \"I could stay and make a scene, sure I could demand that she serve me\", but to what end? How does that serve a growing level of civility? The truth is it doesn't. So when the manager made it clear that she wanted her to exit the restaurant, she did it quietly and she did it politely. That's the way southern women do things, they don't disrespect others.

I'll tell you, Peter Fonda ought to be in jail tonight and I mean that sincerely, the man ought to be in jail for having said that kind of thing.

Let's debate that with San Francisco attorney Harmeet Dhillon, the RNC committeewoman from California, and Washington immigration attorney Allen Orr. Great to see both of you. All right, Allen, here are the 10 countries with the largest Muslim populations, this is the most recent time it was checked -- Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, Iran, Turkey, Algeria, Morocco. If Donald Trump was targeting Muslim majority countries, why wouldn't he target the largest Muslim majority countries in the world?"

The difference between the Obama administration and this administration is the time length of the actual bans. And so celebrating today's travel ban restrictions as a win really isn't the case because what you saw from the court was constant changing. So you are at the third version of the travel ban. It started from a complete class of people, including green card holders and non-immigrant holders, and it moved down to just people who are currently applying for visas. So it's a little bit different in scope and size. And just because you discriminate against one person out of that group doesn't mean you are not discriminating against the whole group as a whole.

P.R.-wise, communication-wise, the way it was drafted, I would have done it differently, but easy to say with hindsight. But the court here said statements by the president during the campaign were not dispositive. This is a textualist reading of the statute itself that gives the president this broad power on immigration, correct?"

I think that first travel ban done seven days after the administration was sworn in was rough in a lot of waves and I am really glad that the system has worked down to the system where the Supreme Court said they have a lot of safety checks and allow a lot of people in on a waiver basis. And the administration has been able to prove to the court that they've already lifted some countries from the ban. So Chad, for example, has come off the list, Iraq. And so we are really looking at a system where even Jimmy Carter had a country on the list. So did Ronald Reagan. So it's not unprecedented. And what the Supreme Court ruled here was very correct which is that if a statute gives the authority to the president then the motivation isn't really part of what their consideration should be.

You have to go to school with them, you have to live next to them. You have to be empathetic, and you can't just view them as cheap or inexpensive labor. And that's part of the whole point. When Peter Fonda tweets from Paradise, Montana, one of the least diverse places in the United States about Barron Trump, it would have been so much easier if he had said you know what, my grandkids are going to go to the L.A. city schools where 70 percent Latinos and we're not going to engage in white flight. Mark Zuckerberg could say you know what, no more Sacred Heart or Castilla or private academies. Let's live with the other and let's match our ideology with concrete realities."

Harvard University's endowment is $35.7 billion, Standard $22.4 billion, MIT $13.2 billion, Columbia a paltry $9 billion. That's a lot of money. They give a lot of scholarships out which is nice, and some of them go to illegal immigrants, but why not open up the campus at least in the summer time. What do you think?"

If the president and the administration had prepared before they literally shut the doors and separated the children from their parents, then it may be part of the solution. Look, let's be practical about this. Food, security, liability insurance, all of these issues have to be vetted, and they can't be vetted by schools that have their own interests. We have a very interesting history with foreign nationals and students going to the schools. And it seems that the schools for years profited from all of the tuition. And there was always this interest that they would pony up in Congress and hold their share. But this is, as much as the gentlemen intends it, not a very serious solution to the problem."

That's why I really admire people who work with organizations on the ground in helping people in their home countries. I talk about Food for the Poor a lot. They are great organization. They do work in Central America and Haiti on the ground with people, helping them be self- sustainable. Great. But when you sit in Brentwood or Malibu or Georgetown here in Washington and then you go put a target on a piece of paper on Stephen Miller and paper the neighborhood, I'm not impressed. I'm really not impressed."

      "utterance": "What is symptomatic of this entire issue is that people don't live the consequences of their loud ideology. I'm looking at the window at my farm house and I see mostly illegal immigrants up and down my rural road. My kids went to public schools with them. I see them every day. I am trying to be part of the solution. I don't agree with illegal immigration, but it's a fact and we're dealing with it. But my problem is the universities at which I work, I hear all of this loud acrimony, and yet when I look carefully at where people live, where they put their kids at school, whom the associate, whom they hire to do their dirty work, it's a reality that doesn't match the abstract ideology, and therefore we create cynicism. That's what created Donald Trump is all these people said globalization and open borders were wonderful, but the ramification in the real world, how it affected real people did not affect them. They were able to navigate because of their power, their influence, their wealth. They were able to navigate around the ramifications of their own ideology and that's where we are today. We have a highly cynical population that does not trust elite bromides for this problem."

Now we are supposed to flood the country with more low-skilled workers that are going to come to the country and drive me out of whatever business I'm in.
