All right, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen sounding the alarm on the border crisis, but the Democrats will have none of it - or maybe they're just too overwhelmed by the radical chic in their own party. And then they seem to have an anti-Semitism problem.  And our R. Kelly speaks out in an explosive new interview. I just watched it on the way over this studio, claiming he's not the victim - whoa he is the victim, not the women accusing him of sexual abuse. Dr. Drew Pinsky will analyze.  Plus Raymond Arroyo on why Will Smith isn't black enough for a new role, and what a new focus group will tell us about the future of the Democratic Party? But first the Dems big border lie, that's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle\"  Today Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen went up to Capitol Hill to share a little dose of something called reality with Congress.",

Well, instead of focusing on the surge of the border and the lack of facilities to house the people crossing the border, Democrats are throwing sand and throwing down the race card.

Family units or people posing as family units would not make this dangerous trek once word spread in their home country. Congress should pass this law. If you want to apply for asylum, that's fine. But you should do so in the safety of your home country. Or as is beginning to happen now, once you're in the United States and you declare, you should be set to Mexico until your case comes up for hearing. We have a backlog right now of 800,000 immigration cases. The current system today, it's obvious - come on everybody knows this, Democrats know this, it incentivizes human trafficking, the abuse of kids and more illegal crossings period. That's why you have a big jump.   Any Democrat or any Republican who refuses to act now are the ones who are truly lacking in the feeling and the compassion and the empathy, not only for the illegal immigrants, but for the American people they're supposed to be representing, and that's \"The Angle\".

One of the things he did say, a couple things came - jump down to me about his interview that I thought we're very interesting. One is, he compartmentalized a lot. He talked about our R. Kelley vs. Robert and my understanding is he had some very serious trauma himself, and that's how people who are traumatized think. They compartmentalize the self and their emotions and that's sometimes how they carry out things that are not good. This compartmentalized piece of themselves is disavowed. That's not really me. I'm really Robert. And they can do some awful stuff and be a good person at the same time. That's one thing that jumped out at me in this particular interview. There seemed to be a good deal of compartmentalization. The other thing is something that I see celebrities do all the time which is the name they use out in the world, R. Kelly, again, versus Robert, it's not just compartmentalization. The thing you know of as the celebrity, they distance themselves from, as though that's just a cartoon character, so when people criticize that celebrity, R.

It's not painful and it's not an attack. It's a grooming process. And by the same token, because they loved that celebrity, they loved Michael Jackson, they wanted to protect them, they had all these ambivalent feelings that when they really woke up to what he had been doing to them, there was a flood of emotions and then there was a desire to talk about it. So the theory here, if these allegations are true, is they finally got enough distance. And in fact in both men's' case, it was the fact that they had children that they started to look at the child and go, oh, my God, something did something to me when I was young.

All right, DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen sounding the alarm on the border crisis, but the Democrats will have none of it - or maybe they're just too overwhelmed by the radical chic in their own party. And then they seem to have an anti-Semitism problem. And our R. Kelly speaks out in an explosive new interview. I just watched it on the way over this studio, claiming he's not the victim - whoa he is the victim, not the women accusing him of sexual abuse. Dr. Drew Pinsky will analyze. Plus Raymond Arroyo on why Will Smith isn't black enough for a new role, and what a new focus group will tell us about the future of the Democratic Party? But first the Dems big border lie, that's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle\" Today Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen went up to Capitol Hill to share a little dose of something called reality with Congress."

If these numbers hold, every 4 months we'll import the equivalent of the population of Richmond, Virginia or Baton Rouge, Louisiana into the United States, and this isn't a national emergency? Let's face it most Democrats know this is a crisis. The sheer volume of crossers is overwhelming our facilities. And liberals then blame Trump, point a migrant doesn't see a doctor immediately? As with their embrace of infanticide and reparations, Medicare-for-All, Democrats have gone far left on immigration, and now they are in effect, for open borders."

And while we're creating these grand new plans to hold the illegal immigrants accountable and retract them, let's not forget who's footing the bill here. Guess what the cost is, $82,000 per year per illegal immigrant in the United States. And then of course, the children they have, and then the children are citizens and then no one's deported.

It's an enclosure for sure, was used by the Obama administration to detain illegal miners during their processing until they could be placed with sponsors. Now where was the Democrat outrage when Obama was using the same fencing facilities that liberal do-gooders now deplore and make a big deal about at a hearing to get on shows like this? Well, instead of focusing on the surge of the border and the lack of facilities to house the people crossing the border, Democrats are throwing sand and throwing down the race card. It's about all they know these days. When the CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that walls and barriers in key hot spots along the border had an immediate impact in reducing the crossings, Senator Dick Blumenthal, he didn't want to hear any of it."

      "utterance": "Girls are being abused, raped, and in some cases trafficked as part of these caravans and it is despicable what is happening to these young people. Congress needs to get its head out of the sand and stop this madness once and for all. If someone crosses the border illegally with rare exception, they should be turned back immediately. Family units or people posing as family units would not make this dangerous trek once word spread in their home country. Congress should pass this law. If you want to apply for asylum, that's fine. But you should do so in the safety of your home country. Or as is beginning to happen now, once you're in the United States and you declare, you should be set to Mexico until your case comes up for hearing. We have a backlog right now of 800,000 immigration cases. The current system today, it's obvious - come on everybody knows this, Democrats know this, it incentivizes human trafficking, the abuse of kids and more illegal crossings period. That's why you have a big jump. Any Democrat or any Republican who refuses to act now are the ones who are truly lacking in the feeling and the compassion and the empathy, not only for the illegal immigrants, but for the American people they're supposed to be representing, and that's \"The Angle\". The House Democrats aren't doing anything about the crush at the border. They're too busy grappling with the growing radicalism within their own ranks. And now House Democrats are focused on watering down a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, and not even mentioning Congressman Ilhan Omar by name when she is the one this all should be really all about.

And some of the leaders of the party, you know this, are good friends of Louis Farrakhan, who said I'm not an \"anti-Semite, I'm anti-termite\". I mean, this is the viewpoint of this party that is completely off the rails. And I think it's not - I would say it's funny, but it's not funny. I mean this is a real problem that we have in history and today in this party. And I think, you know what, Nancy Pelosi if she had a backbone, she'd bring the resolution up and call these folks out and go, let's have a vote and let's see where you stand about anti-Semitism."

There were loud voices and there was - basically it sounds like they were shouting and a big argument about this because the freshmen - the newcomers and Hakeem Jeffries, a few others, feel like this is a - this is like a targeting a Muslim woman.

And you saw a real push back, because I think there's lot of Democrats inside that Democratic Caucus who don't want to take a vote on that resolution, which really exposes the true feelings of Democrats and the radical wing of the Democrat Party.

We have someone sitting on that Committee who is a racist, whose views are more aligned with Islamic Jihad, than they are with the U.S. Constitution. We have Democratic members of government who are campaigning with people like Linda Sarsour who is connected to the Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a designated terrorist group. And now we have a Democratic Party, that's been hijacked to the extent that it cannot even pass a resolution condemning anti-Semitism without being forced to water it down and make it meaningless.

And fame - we have such - we elevate people with fame to such a degree, we are easily seduced by it and it's possible. I don't know. We just don't know what has actually gone on. One of the things he did say, a couple things came - jump down to me about his interview that I thought we're very interesting. One is, he compartmentalized a lot. He talked about our R. Kelley vs. Robert and my understanding is he had some very serious trauma himself, and that's how people who are traumatized think. They compartmentalize the self and their emotions and that's sometimes how they carry out things that are not good. This compartmentalized piece of themselves is disavowed. That's not really me. I'm really Robert. And they can do some awful stuff and be a good person at the same time. That's one thing that jumped out at me in this particular interview. There seemed to be a good deal of compartmentalization. The other thing is something that I see celebrities do all the time which is the name they use out in the world, R. Kelly, again, versus Robert, it's not just compartmentalization. The thing you know of as the celebrity, they distance themselves from, as though that's just a cartoon character, so when people criticize that celebrity, R. Kelly, the it doesn't get to me, Robert."

      "utterance": "We don't know these guys, we don't know if the allegations are true or not. But I will tell you the documentary shows, again, the grooming process, precisely how it happens. If you saw Oprah's interview after the \"Leaving Neverland\" second part, she talks about that, how this is a really important for people to understand, that it's something people are drawn into. It's not painful and it's not an attack. It's a grooming process. And by the same token, because they loved that celebrity, they loved Michael Jackson, they wanted to protect them, they had all these ambivalent feelings that when they really woke up to what he had been doing to them, there was a flood of emotions and then there was a desire to talk about it. So the theory here, if these allegations are true, is they finally got enough distance. And in fact in both men's' case, it was the fact that they had children that they started to look at the child and go, oh, my God, something did something to me when I was young. This unbelievable, and that's where the emotional flood broke through. And somebody chose to tell the story, whether it's true or not."

But there are people for whom this is their ticket to whatever racket they are running, including the political racket. And it's tragic. What's tragic is that there are so many people out there who simply respond to words rather than ask themselves, is what this person says true? How can I check it? And so on."

Kelly is not focusing on race, but the Smollett case became one about race. And it was almost like there were certain people out there who were disappointed when it seemed like this thing with a big hoax. They wanted this to be a racial incident, a racial hate crime, reinforcing the stereotypes that this is what's wrong with society today, the overriding problem in society today is one of race, Tom."

What's painful to me is how few people there are today who bother to check out the facts. In many cases, just the smallest effort at checking out the facts would cause so many of these things to fall apart. And we have a whole history of this, going back to the Tawana Brawley woman back in the 19-somethings, and then the Duke Lacrosse case. So there have been any number of these things. But as long as they keep succeeding politically, they will continue to run that play."

Would you recommend that he do that?"

But there has to be some thoughtful notions about how free markets and other kinds of activities that are different from one are normally heard, how those things impact. And I don't see any sign of that of any significance unfortunately from the Republicans. I never cease to be amazed at how many opportunities they let go by. Right now, for example, Democrats around the country are lining up to stop charter schools from expanding, trying to cut back on them. And many of them are the very schools that are most successful, are the ones they are zeroing in on, places like Success Academy or KIPP Schools, and so forth. And the Democrats, I understand they have to do that because they are beholden to the teachers' unions. But why the Republicans don't say anything about it, that is what baffles me."

It's just that we now have more than half a century of knowledge, a track record of these kinds of ideas being put into practice in countries around the world and failing time and time again. Not merely failing, but making things worse than they were before. Venezuela is the classic case. And yet during the whole period when people are starving in Venezuela under socialism, the young people right out of our colleges are flocking to Bernie Sanders because they are judging by his words and how wonderful it sounds and not by what happens when you try to put those notions into practice, as has been tried again in countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, South America."
