The party that often pride itself for being a so-called champion for women is now facing widespread turmoil after multiple high profiled Democrats had been accused of sexual misconduct. Minnesota Senator Al Franken was forced to issue yet another apology yesterday after two more women came forward and accused him of inappropriately grabbing them from behind. Bringing the total number of alleged sexual harassment victims to four. The apology read in part, quote, \"I'm a one person. I hug people. I've learned from recent stories that some of those encounters I crossed the line for some women and I know that any number is too many. I feel terribly that I've made some women feel badly and for that, I am so sorry. And I want to make sure that never happens again.\"  Senator Al Franken is not the only Democrat facing accusations of sexual misconduct. Long time Congressman John Conyers is also accused of harassment including one instance where he held a meeting in his underwear. Unfortunately, the so-called party of women's rights isn't quite united in its response to this inner party sexual harassment. With some calling for Conyers to step down while others try to dodge the subject. Watch this.",

What can be done, we need to get the Attorney General involved and see if there's any mischief involve in a lot of this domestic terror groups such as Antifa, but even more than that, we have to expose how the left have become funded by these billionaires, now Jeff Bezos worth $100 billion to corrupt our democracy and the change the trajectory of this country.",

President Trump responded on Twitter saying \"can you believe that the disrespect for our country, or flag, or anthem continues without penalty to the players. The commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. Players are the boss.\" Earlier this week, the president called out the NFL with a suggestion of keeping teams in the locker room during the anthem. He tweeted \"the NFL is now thinking about a new idea, keeping teams in the locker room during the national anthem next season. That is almost as bad as kneeling. When will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing her league.\" Joining us now with reaction is Fox News contributor, and pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Robert Jeffress and Fox News contributor David Webb.

The party that often pride itself for being a so-called champion for women is now facing widespread turmoil after multiple high profiled Democrats had been accused of sexual misconduct. Minnesota Senator Al Franken was forced to issue yet another apology yesterday after two more women came forward and accused him of inappropriately grabbing them from behind. Bringing the total number of alleged sexual harassment victims to four. The apology read in part, quote, \"I'm a one person. I hug people. I've learned from recent stories that some of those encounters I crossed the line for some women and I know that any number is too many. I feel terribly that I've made some women feel badly and for that, I am so sorry. And I want to make sure that never happens again.\" Senator Al Franken is not the only Democrat facing accusations of sexual misconduct. Long time Congressman John Conyers is also accused of harassment including one instance where he held a meeting in his underwear. Unfortunately, the so-called party of women's rights isn't quite united in its response to this inner party sexual harassment. With some calling for Conyers to step down while others try to dodge the subject. Watch this."

I wanted to have the same reaction regardless of whether the perpetrators are Republican or a Democrat. The other thing I want to say is that, I understand when someone is an accused rapist or like Bill Cosby or an accused sexual predator like Judge Moore is. But sex harassment, there is a big wave now, what is it exactly? Conyers wears his underwear in front of a staffer. You know, I heard someone say today, it definitely was not sexual.

That and of itself, that misuse of the taxpayer funds should be enough to call for his resignation. But what we're seeing Kimberly really is a case of the powerful praying on the people. It's five party lines, its people and powerful positions, be it in Hollywood, be it in media, be it Congress preying on the American people. It's a swamp that Donald Trump talked about all along."

What about the allegation that's gained quite a bit of legitimacy that George H.W. Bush, Bush 41 from his wheelchair tells a joke when women stand alongside him, who's your favorite comedian? Mine is David Tapafil (ph), you know, and he pats the lady on the butt. I mean, if it's outrageous for Franken, it's outrageous for George H.W.

And you know, for him to have done the things that he did and then continue to maybe even run for mayor of New York City, I mean, you have to put these things in perspective.

If you want to talk about Uranium One, if you want to talk about the dossier, there are a lot of unanswered questions there.

And you know, you mentioned Juanita Broaddrick. As a prosecutor, you surely would know that when there are multiple stories, multiple accounts of what happened in an event, it's a much tougher case to litigate when the person who allegedly was violated has told different stories at different times."

If they are so concerned about the long term, the post- traumatic stress of women who go through these sorts of things as they say every day, right? Whenever they can get in the news, trying to take some moral high ground now, then they should be concerned about the fact that these women are still traumatized by what happened to them under that administration. And they've been continually traumatized as all of their allegations have been swept under the rug for all these years. And it's just too convenient for the time now for them to come out and say, oh, wait a minute, we are the party of sexual purity suddenly. The public isn't going to buy this."

Put another way, I think we need to be nonpartisan about it, not trying to cast one party or the other party as a party of sex.

It makes it very tough to go back to be able to examine the veracity of it and get those statements. It's not something that can't happen, you know, overnight to be able to figure it out.

You know, it's decided that all of a sudden now, this election should be overturned for an entire state.

The Washington Post tells us we don't know anything about it. Instead of being horrified and embarrassed at the fact that one of their reporters was demonstrating a clear bias by attending that meeting."

I mean this would be at the top of 60 minutes and on the top page of The New York Times. The silence on the left is deafening with this conspiracy on the left. Look, there is one thing that I'm hoping that the next 3-7 years of President Trump's administration that he cleans out the cobwebs of this international network. It's not just George Soros. Its other billionaires that we don't hear from that are behind this international effort to often undermine and contradict actually stated U.S. foreign policy and cause domestic mischief."

      "utterance": "There should be some accountability and ethics and it should start with the Attorney General should open an investigation into the open society foundation which is George Soros' nonprofit organization which he just transferred $15 billion in two. To have to give away 5 percent in a year. Think about how much money that is, but there is good evidence to show that George Soros has been instrumental in funding left-wing groups such as black lives matter and Antifa which are now being investigated by the FBI. You have to follow the money, you have to see is he actually funding this groups and where are they getting their source of training and their financial backing. What can be done, we need to get the Attorney General involved and see if there's any mischief involve in a lot of this domestic terror groups such as Antifa, but even more than that, we have to expose how the left have become funded by these billionaires, now Jeff Bezos worth $100 billion to corrupt our democracy and the change the trajectory of this country."

You look back at the campaign and the paid protesters and what was going on, they're really trying to stifle democracy and the election process. Now having the tentacles so far is you know very widely read and available newspapers that can really impact not just American journalism, the truth, and the facts that get out there, but also discuss the implications of foreign domestic policy."

Remember back in the campaign when you had CNN asking the DNC to go over and debate questions when you had Donna Brazile turning over the questions to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Again, this is a very serious issue and it's important for all of the viewers to understand they need to be news consumers, they need to be good stewards of where they get their news and it's important for all of us to understand what's really going on here."

Trying to disrupt democracy here in this country. The left has really been funded by these people who want to create a government and not see America continue in international dominance and they want to be stabilize capitalism as we know it. This is very, very dangerous, these are people who do not share our values and other they have a limited amount of money, they have unlimited amount of power which is what the left wants. The viewers need to continue to pursue good news channels such as Fox and read the Wall Street Journal and stay away from these new sources that are being funded by people who do not share our values and want to see America succeed."

You have generations of young minds being poisoned. We have an opportunity with this president in office, the Attorney General really needs to investigate this and I hope that Tillerson will take that letter from six United State Senators that they need to stop funding these George Soros related and far left-wing groups that are often times violent and kind of the foreign version of Antifa that we spoke of earlier.

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to this special edition of \"Hannity.\" An American tradition is to watch football on Thanksgiving Day, but one player chose to bring politics into the game. As you can see, Olivier Vernon for the New York Giants took a knee during the national anthem, something he is been doing for several games now. President Trump responded on Twitter saying \"can you believe that the disrespect for our country, or flag, or anthem continues without penalty to the players. The commissioner has lost control of the hemorrhaging league. Players are the boss.\" Earlier this week, the president called out the NFL with a suggestion of keeping teams in the locker room during the anthem. He tweeted \"the NFL is now thinking about a new idea, keeping teams in the locker room during the national anthem next season. That is almost as bad as kneeling. When will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing her league.\" Joining us now with reaction is Fox News contributor, and pastor at the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Robert Jeffress and Fox News contributor David Webb. David, I'll begin with you. It is us the right move for the president to continue to call out the NFL, call at the players, call out the commissioner for their unpatriotic actions?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVID WEBB, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It absolutely is. The president is winning on the issue. Cultural Americans and see the anthem and the flag as one. We stand for the anthem, we face the flag once flown for those key minutes and he is winning on that issue culturally. The subjective ideas around his tweeting is just that. The NFL is paying another price. We've done the business many times over the years. The NFL is losing image and the advertising which means as you look at playoff numbers, you look at sales, you look at costs, and they are losing their business as well. The players are affecting their business and the ignorance and the uninformed part of this. March on, I want to go back to lynch, he stand for the Mexican anthem. If you take him out of the celebrity bubble and he is arrested in Mexico, he will be treated significantly differently than he would as a celebrity. And to all of those NFL players, I've said this for weeks on my show and I'll say it again. If you really want to go back to Colin Kaepernick, and you really want to protest police brutality as you see it, then turn around and take any in front of a police officer, not to the flag in the anthem."

      "speaker": "ROBERT JEFFRESS, FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH, DALLAS",
      "utterance": "I think it is and I think there's a bigger issue here, Kimberly. Whether it's calling out LaVar Ball is the president and earlier this week and now calling out the NFL, I think President Trump is touching on a very important issue in America right now and that is a lack of gratitude. These NFL players ought to be thinking god every day that they live in a country not only where they can earn millions of dollars every year, but they can disrespect our flag without being thrown in prison or worse as they would if they lived in China or North Korea. Contrary to what the left would tell you, this is not a racial issue. This is a grateful issue. It's an issue I'm glad the president is hitting head on. The fact is that if all Americans were grateful for the good things god and others have done for us, I think you would see a lot of the negativity in our country dissipate overnight. I think our president is showing great moral leadership and addressing this topic."

It doesn't make any logical or coherent sense. I don't think they even understand what messages behind this."

      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "Taking the point of grateful and their right to do this was never in question, the responsibility to do it on the job which is affecting the league, but there is also something else. This flag and what it stands for, greater than the cloth is printed on. It stands for the very reason they can do this, so they are ungrateful. I have to say this about LaVar Ball. I tweeted this out last week. Shoplifting a pair of sunglasses and no big thing, is it ok if we shoplift the big bowler shoes because is no big thing? There uninformed, they are ungrateful. I will stand with them if there is real issue, a brutality. You are a prosecutor, you deal with the facts, and I will be there with them. There is an effective way to deal with that issue. We need to deal with bad shoots, but we need to respect we have in this country."

I think it shows courageousness and transparency that he is willing to take a stand, not necessarily for what's popular to get involved, but speaking as a businessman at a patriot and a commander in chief, let's all try to be a little more graceful and responsible for our behavior and by the way, the failure contract that you signed and agreed to be able to go and play the game that you are paired very well and blessed to be able to go out and excel in the field."

That is why he is president because he does weigh in on issues and people are tired of normal, they want somebody who will deal with it. That is why he got elected and I predict that is why he will get reelected. People like this kind of president."

It seems like every time we talk about this issue, some of the players are not even correctly articulating what the original message is, it becomes a different kind of protest. Why are they kneeling, if you ask some of them, its police brutality, then its equal rights and it's constantly changing?"

      "speaker": "WEBB",

We have to celebrate what our police do positively for us. I agree with David. If they are really sincere about this, what they ought to do is say and protest, I'm not going to take my salary for the next six months and I am going to donate it at ACLU to fight injustice. Why not do that, if they are sincere."

Look, if they want to do the real work, I be doing the real work in these communities for years. Help this children, help this families that is what we need to do in America and that is the American family, is not black or white. Our culture is strong. When we are strong, the world is better off."
