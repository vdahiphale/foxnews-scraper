      "sentences": "This is going to be extremely ugly. You're going to be shocked by a lot of what you'll hear, and it's going to help Donald Trump. And you'll have a front row seat to all of it.  And we're going to have a preview, real preview coming up. We'll have a rundown of the madness. It's all coming up in a \"Hannity\" special mini monologue.   But, first, we do begin tonight with a Fox News alert. The weaponization of intelligence, deep state abuse of power is undeniable as ever. Tonight, we have brand new documents we will show you. According to these just-released documents obtained by the American Center for Law and Justice through the Freedom of Information Act, and a request, we now have what is some of the clearest evidence to date of what is nothing short of an attempted coup, a soft coup against this president.  These documents shed even more light on this timeline of corruption and an effort to try and undermine -- well, first stop and prevent a president from winning they didn't like and rig an election, but then afterwards, to undermine the duly elected president. Remember, a long while back, we talked about this a lot. We reported how the Obama administration in their final days vastly expanded the intelligence sharing capabilities of America's most powerful agencies.   Remember, we talked about this executive order 12333. And it was the basis of all of this. And I was warning about this as far back as 2017. Now, we are learning tonight that literally days before President Trump's inauguration, well, we find out the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under James Comey was eagerly pushed to totally overhaul the sharing of raw intelligence which expanded the sharing of this raw intelligence from just three agencies to 17. Wow. Why would they as an ongoing administration want to impose standards on the incoming administration, standards they never imposed on themselves for eight years?  That's teh big question. According to new documents, well, the director of national intelligence office was eager to get the new procedures signed by the attorney general before the conclusion of this administration. Not only that, around the same time the DNI general counsel, his name was Robert Litt, wrote, quote: I really want to get this done and so does the boss, likely reference to Clapper. I don't know, is there any chance at all that the boss is Obama?  I keep asking the question: what did Obama and Biden know? When they did it all? Hopefully, we'll get answers one day.   Remember, all of this Russian interference happened on the Biden and Obama watch. Even though people like Devin Nunes, former chairman, House Intel Committee, he was warning the Biden-Obama administration that Russia was going to do all of this. He warned them in early 2014. They didn't listen. They let it happen. They did nothing. It happened on their watch; not Trump's watch. And here's the kicker. The NSA discussed in early January 2017, it could, quote, have a signature from A.G. as early at this week, certainly prior to the 20th of January. That would be the date of President Trump's inauguration.  OK. Let's break this down. What does it all mean? For eight years, the Obama administration, well, did they did allow the sharing of raw information with 17 separate agencies, they only allowed three. And then literally in the final days, just before Donald Trump is about to become president, there was a complete overhaul of our intelligence gathering to give a lot more access of the most sensitive, raw, and in many cases not even confirmed material to deep state bureaucrats without getting any input from the new incoming administration.  Now, it was championed by Clapper's DNI. It was signed by Loretta Lynch, as you see there. Remember, there are some of the same people involved in the phony Russia collusion probe, and in the case of the attorney general, what really happened on the tarmac in Phoenix, Arizona, when she said he was talking to Bill Clinton for 45 minutes about grandkid just days before she is supposed to make a decision whether to indict his wife or not.  Now, Crossfire Hurricane, Hillary Clinton's exoneration without an investigation, don't forget, vastly expanding access to this intelligence material meant it was harder to trace the information, harder to weed out the leakers, harder to hold anyone in the deep state accountable. They know exactly what they were doing. They were trying to put the intelligence on the radar of as many people as possible so they would not be able to find the people who knew what they did was an abuse of power.  It was corruption at the worst level, but it's still being exposed anyway. Look at how urgent these messages are. They know they had two weeks to get this done. Really? Is this what they cared about two weeks ago? Deep state in a mad scramble. It looks like Clapper was leading the way.  Let's take a look, you combined this with what we already know about, oh, Hillary Clinton literally funneling money through a law firm Perkins Coie, and then hiring an op research for them, hiring a guy by the name of Christopher Steele. Christopher Steele puts together a bunch of documents that becomes the dirty, the dirty Russian dossier that was used to rig the 2016 election and like they rigged the primary and stole it from Bernie Sanders. He had no shot from the beginning. The same people involved in unmasking, the secret informants.   It's all coming into focus. It's now getting clearer every day. They are not getting away with this. We told you the curtain was being lifted. It is. We told you -- you heard the Attorney General Lindsey Graham. Act one of the Mueller report, whether they want -- sorry, I dropped my pen -- whether they want to believe, it's gone. Act two now, the deep state, the conspiracy theory Democrats and the media mob, they know the day of reckoning is absolutely near. Look at, you know, the cowardly shift who is panicking because he's, quote, running out of time to interview Mueller and continue with his endless conspiracy theories, his hoax. The great irony every time I look at this idiot who won't come on our show, we've offered him four straight hours, three hours radio, one hour in TV, is that he is the only one that we have on tape conspiring with a Russian, or someone he thinks is a Russian about getting dirt to influence our elections. Yes, that would be the cowardly Schiff.  Take a look.",

Joining us to explain even more on the phone, the American Center for Law and Justice, their chief counsel, he's the attorney, the counsel for the president, Jay Sekulow is with us. Full disclosure, Jay has sadly got stuck with me as a client and done legal work with me in the past, which to his great embarrassment. Jay, this is huge what you have found here. I want you to give your take on it because what I'm seeing -- why would you, all of a sudden, be in a deep state of panic, urgency - panic, two weeks to go imposing, literally opening up raw intelligence to 17 agencies if there was not a real cause and underlying reason? JAY SEKULOW, AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE (via telephone): Well, here's what we know. We know that the Operation Crossfire Hurricane started in 2016. We know it started before the president was even the nominee. We also now know because of the documents that we obtained through litigation that we had the appropriate agency here, maximum security agency, this is what we know, the documents that we've obtained have established that Director Clapper was eager in pushing aggressively to get these new raw intelligence sharing information in place, quote, procedures signed by the attorney general before the conclusion of this administration.   Now, this is happening at the end of December and in early January days before President Trump was inaugurated. Then we have the general counsel for the office of the Director for National Intelligence, Robert Litt, he is the general counsel for DNI, he on an email what he says really want to get this done and so does the boss. Then we have a document from the NSA that discusses it could have a signature from the Attorney General Loretta Lynch as early as this week, certainly prior to January 20th. This is, of course, Inauguration Day.  So, you have this situation going from three agencies, or three agencies has getting information to over 17 agency.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's very hard to believe that the president of the United States would not have known about this drastic expansion of the sharing of what is called raw signal intelligence. As you said, the executive order is executive order 12333. So, it's a presidential executive order. What we have learned is if you put it together, you had Crossfire Hurricane, which was the initial fake investigation that was going on here. You had at the same time within weeks and months, the FISA warrant. And we're going to soon learn what was in those. I think I like to call that FISA abuse.   So, you had Crossfire Hurricane, FISA abuse, a fake dossier by Chris Steele, who is giving information to Bruce Ohr who's the number four man at the Justice Department whose wife is working on this in a private capacity with Fusion GPS which is coordinating all of this.  So, now, what we have is a document, or a series of documents I should say from the NSA through our litigation we went to court to get that established as I said, first, that they wanted -- that James Clapper, Director Clapper wanted this information signed, procedures signed by the attorney general, quote, before the conclusion of this administration and then you've got his lawyer saying we want to get this done and so does the boss. And then the third I think you have is the NSA itself has in its own document saying we could have a signature from the A.G. as early next week, certainly prior to January 20th. So, they were on a very aggressive mission to accomplish this goal, literally within days of the 45th president of the United States Donald Trump being sworn into office. Now, I said it again, Sean, eight years the Obama administration limited the scope of where the raw intelligence could go. It was in the waning hours of the administration that they make this change. So, you don't have to be -- you don't have to be a math wizard to figure out what was going on here. So, you have Crossfire Hurricane. You have the FISA abuse, you have the dossier, and then on top of this at the same time going on, you have this demand, this rush to get the documents -- this single intel change. So, this is very, very significant.",

Huge news tonight, not good news for the deep state. Also tonight, the new extreme Democratic Party, they are ramping up their open borders agenda that's pushing outright lawlessness Look at Congresswoman, well, kind of speaker of the House but really, Ocasio- Cortez, over the weekend, giving legal advice to illegal immigrants on how to evade federal law enforcement.   Why does this sound like aiding and abetting crime to? They don't like me.  Sitting members of Congress trying to hinder immigration authorities, the law of the land, putting our nation's safety and security at risk. Yes, 90 percent of the heroin crosses that border and kills people in this country.  Unfortunately, as this become all to common in this new, extreme Democratic Party. Well, the president called off nationwide deportations at the request of Democrats for two weeks, to give them time that they to negotiate. It's become clear the Democrats, in my view, they have no interest in securing our southern border. They were already offered DACA. They were already offered Dreamers. They didn't want it.  Now, which couldn't be more out of touch with the American people. Look at this new Gallup poll. More Americans than ever consider immigration a top problem in America. Much more of our monologue coming up later in the show. Also developing tonight, President Trump is putting the squeeze on Iran.  Oh, counterintuitive to what the media said. Oh my gosh, he's going to start World War III. No, delivering even more crippling sanctions on this radical rogue regime and Khamenei himself also making clear that Tehran will be held accountable and if need be, he will obliterate them.

It's dumb to tell you and telegraph what I am going to do. That's smart. It's imperative to we was a country, I've been saying this, develop the next generation of military weaponry. Now, we have learned from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, sadly, that we start wars, they become politicized by these idiots in Washington and they do not end as they should, complete victory. Good news, we are already seeing some of that advanced weaponry on display.  A new report details the U.S. military launched cyber attacks this weekend, not a lot of press, against Iranian military after they shot down that drone. Well, it sounds like we're hitting back, striking back with some of the most advanced weaponry that we need for future conflicts, better than having our kids, our national treasure, go door to door.  We can devastate enemies with this new generation of weaponry from Tampa.  We can devastate with a growing economy. By the way, the Straits of Hormuz used be to very strategic, because that's the free flow of oil at market prices. But we are energy independent for the first time in 75 years because of this president's policies.  That gives us enormous leverage. Why is the media missing this part? We are energy independent. And net exporter of energy. Actually, it makes the Straits of Hormuz less important than ever for us. We don't rely on other people for the lifeblood of our economy. And the president understands this. He's actually being very transparent, following through on his promises. All right. Here with reaction with all of this breaking news tonight, we're going to get to the crazy Democrats and the preview of what's going to happen this week, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows and Republican Congressman Jim Jordan.  By the way, these two guys especially, all of those closed doors -- sorry, it's true -- all those closed door testimony that was released by Congressman Doug Collins, showed they asked every single right question and worked so hard behind-the-scenes. We would not be here, knowing what we know about the deep state without these guys courageously doing that. Good to see you both. Let me start with the news, Mark Meadows, what Jay just broke. And, oh, but we've got to get this done. We're going to change the way we did it for eight years. We have an urgency to now share intelligence with 17 agencies and not three. We've got to get it done in two weeks, something we would never do to ourselves.   Why?",

That means John Brennan was well aware of what was going on. So, this isn't going to be narrow scope.

And we're going to have a preview, real preview coming up. We'll have a rundown of the madness. It's all coming up in a \"Hannity\" special mini monologue. But, first, we do begin tonight with a Fox News alert. The weaponization of intelligence, deep state abuse of power is undeniable as ever. Tonight, we have brand new documents we will show you. According to these just-released documents obtained by the American Center for Law and Justice through the Freedom of Information Act, and a request, we now have what is some of the clearest evidence to date of what is nothing short of an attempted coup, a soft coup against this president.  These documents shed even more light on this timeline of corruption and an effort to try and undermine -- well, first stop and prevent a president from winning they didn't like and rig an election, but then afterwards, to undermine the duly elected president. Remember, a long while back, we talked about this a lot. We reported how the Obama administration in their final days vastly expanded the intelligence sharing capabilities of America's most powerful agencies. Remember, we talked about this executive order 12333. And it was the basis of all of this. And I was warning about this as far back as 2017. Now, we are learning tonight that literally days before President Trump's inauguration, well, we find out the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under James Comey was eagerly pushed to totally overhaul the sharing of raw intelligence which expanded the sharing of this raw intelligence from just three agencies to 17. Wow. Why would they as an ongoing administration want to impose standards on the incoming administration, standards they never imposed on themselves for eight years?  That's teh big question."
    },

      "speaker": "According to new documents, well, the director of national intelligence office was eager to get the new procedures signed by the attorney general before the conclusion of this administration. Not only that, around the same time the DNI general counsel, his name was Robert Litt, wrote, quote",
      "utterance": "I really want to get this done and so does the boss, likely reference to Clapper. I don't know, is there any chance at all that the boss is Obama?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "I keep asking the question",
      "utterance": "what did Obama and Biden know? When they did it all? Hopefully, we'll get answers one day. Remember, all of this Russian interference happened on the Biden and Obama watch. Even though people like Devin Nunes, former chairman, House Intel Committee, he was warning the Biden-Obama administration that Russia was going to do all of this. He warned them in early 2014. They didn't listen. They let it happen. They did nothing. It happened on their watch; not Trump's watch. And here's the kicker. The NSA discussed in early January 2017, it could, quote, have a signature from A.G. as early at this week, certainly prior to the 20th of January. That would be the date of President Trump's inauguration. OK. Let's break this down. What does it all mean? For eight years, the Obama administration, well, did they did allow the sharing of raw information with 17 separate agencies, they only allowed three. And then literally in the final days, just before Donald Trump is about to become president, there was a complete overhaul of our intelligence gathering to give a lot more access of the most sensitive, raw, and in many cases not even confirmed material to deep state bureaucrats without getting any input from the new incoming administration. Now, it was championed by Clapper's DNI. It was signed by Loretta Lynch, as you see there. Remember, there are some of the same people involved in the phony Russia collusion probe, and in the case of the attorney general, what really happened on the tarmac in Phoenix, Arizona, when she said he was talking to Bill Clinton for 45 minutes about grandkid just days before she is supposed to make a decision whether to indict his wife or not. Now, Crossfire Hurricane, Hillary Clinton's exoneration without an investigation, don't forget, vastly expanding access to this intelligence material meant it was harder to trace the information, harder to weed out the leakers, harder to hold anyone in the deep state accountable. They know exactly what they were doing. They were trying to put the intelligence on the radar of as many people as possible so they would not be able to find the people who knew what they did was an abuse of power.  It was corruption at the worst level, but it's still being exposed anyway. Look at how urgent these messages are. They know they had two weeks to get this done. Really? Is this what they cared about two weeks ago? Deep state in a mad scramble. It looks like Clapper was leading the way. Let's take a look, you combined this with what we already know about, oh, Hillary Clinton literally funneling money through a law firm Perkins Coie, and then hiring an op research for them, hiring a guy by the name of Christopher Steele. Christopher Steele puts together a bunch of documents that becomes the dirty, the dirty Russian dossier that was used to rig the 2016 election and like they rigged the primary and stole it from Bernie Sanders. He had no shot from the beginning. The same people involved in unmasking, the secret informants. It's all coming into focus. It's now getting clearer every day. They are not getting away with this. We told you the curtain was being lifted. It is. We told you -- you heard the Attorney General Lindsey Graham. Act one of the Mueller report, whether they want -- sorry, I dropped my pen -- whether they want to believe, it's gone. Act two now, the deep state, the conspiracy theory Democrats and the media mob, they know the day of reckoning is absolutely near. Look at, you know, the cowardly shift who is panicking because he's, quote, running out of time to interview Mueller and continue with his endless conspiracy theories, his hoax. The great irony every time I look at this idiot who won't come on our show, we've offered him four straight hours, three hours radio, one hour in TV, is that he is the only one that we have on tape conspiring with a Russian, or someone he thinks is a Russian about getting dirt to influence our elections. Yes, that would be the cowardly Schiff. Take a look."

Either he's going to come in voluntarily or we're going to have to subpoena him, I hope that we'll reach that decision this week because we want him to come in during July, and I think that's going to be the case, Jake, whether it's voluntarily or involuntary by subpoena."

Joining us to explain even more on the phone, the American Center for Law and Justice, their chief counsel, he's the attorney, the counsel for the president, Jay Sekulow is with us. Full disclosure, Jay has sadly got stuck with me as a client and done legal work with me in the past, which to his great embarrassment. Jay, this is huge what you have found here. I want you to give your take on it because what I'm seeing -- why would you, all of a sudden, be in a deep state of panic, urgency - panic, two weeks to go imposing, literally opening up raw intelligence to 17 agencies if there was not a real cause and underlying reason?"

      "utterance": "Well, here's what we know. We know that the Operation Crossfire Hurricane started in 2016. We know it started before the president was even the nominee. We also now know because of the documents that we obtained through litigation that we had the appropriate agency here, maximum security agency, this is what we know, the documents that we've obtained have established that Director Clapper was eager in pushing aggressively to get these new raw intelligence sharing information in place, quote, procedures signed by the attorney general before the conclusion of this administration. Now, this is happening at the end of December and in early January days before President Trump was inaugurated. Then we have the general counsel for the office of the Director for National Intelligence, Robert Litt, he is the general counsel for DNI, he on an email what he says really want to get this done and so does the boss. Then we have a document from the NSA that discusses it could have a signature from the Attorney General Loretta Lynch as early as this week, certainly prior to January 20th. This is, of course, Inauguration Day. So, you have this situation going from three agencies, or three agencies has getting information to over 17 agency."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

And, OK, I can understand people saying the boss could be Clapper, strong possibility. I don't know the answer. But also -- but we do have to remember that this is not Clapper's executive order, 12333. This is Obama's executive order. What did know? When did he know it? Because wasn't this his signature?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Well, it's very hard to believe that the president of the United States would not have known about this drastic expansion of the sharing of what is called raw signal intelligence. As you said, the executive order is executive order 12333. So, it's a presidential executive order. What we have learned is if you put it together, you had Crossfire Hurricane, which was the initial fake investigation that was going on here. You had at the same time within weeks and months, the FISA warrant. And we're going to soon learn what was in those. I think I like to call that FISA abuse. So, you had Crossfire Hurricane, FISA abuse, a fake dossier by Chris Steele, who is giving information to Bruce Ohr who's the number four man at the Justice Department whose wife is working on this in a private capacity with Fusion GPS which is coordinating all of this. So, now, what we have is a document, or a series of documents I should say from the NSA through our litigation we went to court to get that established as I said, first, that they wanted -- that James Clapper, Director Clapper wanted this information signed, procedures signed by the attorney general, quote, before the conclusion of this administration and then you've got his lawyer saying we want to get this done and so does the boss. And then the third I think you have is the NSA itself has in its own document saying we could have a signature from the A.G. as early next week, certainly prior to January 20th. So, they were on a very aggressive mission to accomplish this goal, literally within days of the 45th president of the United States Donald Trump being sworn into office. Now, I said it again, Sean, eight years the Obama administration limited the scope of where the raw intelligence could go. It was in the waning hours of the administration that they make this change. So, you don't have to be -- you don't have to be a math wizard to figure out what was going on here. So, you have Crossfire Hurricane. You have the FISA abuse, you have the dossier, and then on top of this at the same time going on, you have this demand, this rush to get the documents -- this single intel change. So, this is very, very significant."

      "utterance": "All right. Jay Sekulow, we're going to be following this now for days and really dissecting this. There's a lot more here. Jay, thank you for joining us. Huge news tonight, not good news for the deep state. Also tonight, the new extreme Democratic Party, they are ramping up their open borders agenda that's pushing outright lawlessness Look at Congresswoman, well, kind of speaker of the House but really, Ocasio- Cortez, over the weekend, giving legal advice to illegal immigrants on how to evade federal law enforcement. Why does this sound like aiding and abetting crime to? They don't like me.  Sitting members of Congress trying to hinder immigration authorities, the law of the land, putting our nation's safety and security at risk. Yes, 90 percent of the heroin crosses that border and kills people in this country. Unfortunately, as this become all to common in this new, extreme Democratic Party. Well, the president called off nationwide deportations at the request of Democrats for two weeks, to give them time that they to negotiate. It's become clear the Democrats, in my view, they have no interest in securing our southern border. They were already offered DACA. They were already offered Dreamers. They didn't want it. Now, which couldn't be more out of touch with the American people. Look at this new Gallup poll. More Americans than ever consider immigration a top problem in America. Much more of our monologue coming up later in the show. Also developing tonight, President Trump is putting the squeeze on Iran.  Oh, counterintuitive to what the media said. Oh my gosh, he's going to start World War III. No, delivering even more crippling sanctions on this radical rogue regime and Khamenei himself also making clear that Tehran will be held accountable and if need be, he will obliterate them.

The exact thing he said, following prudence which he promised on the campaign trail.  He's not going to be goaded into endless boots on the ground conflict. He made that clear as he kept those other promises. He assured the American people his response will be measured and effective. And I'm not going to tell you what I'm not going to do. It's dumb to tell you and telegraph what I am going to do. That's smart. It's imperative to we was a country, I've been saying this, develop the next generation of military weaponry. Now, we have learned from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, sadly, that we start wars, they become politicized by these idiots in Washington and they do not end as they should, complete victory. Good news, we are already seeing some of that advanced weaponry on display.  A new report details the U.S. military launched cyber attacks this weekend, not a lot of press, against Iranian military after they shot down that drone. Well, it sounds like we're hitting back, striking back with some of the most advanced weaponry that we need for future conflicts, better than having our kids, our national treasure, go door to door. We can devastate enemies with this new generation of weaponry from Tampa.  We can devastate with a growing economy. By the way, the Straits of Hormuz used be to very strategic, because that's the free flow of oil at market prices. But we are energy independent for the first time in 75 years because of this president's policies. That gives us enormous leverage. Why is the media missing this part? We are energy independent. And net exporter of energy. Actually, it makes the Straits of Hormuz less important than ever for us. We don't rely on other people for the lifeblood of our economy. And the president understands this. He's actually being very transparent, following through on his promises. All right. Here with reaction with all of this breaking news tonight, we're going to get to the crazy Democrats and the preview of what's going to happen this week, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows and Republican Congressman Jim Jordan. By the way, these two guys especially, all of those closed doors -- sorry, it's true -- all those closed door testimony that was released by Congressman Doug Collins, showed they asked every single right question and worked so hard behind-the-scenes. We would not be here, knowing what we know about the deep state without these guys courageously doing that. Good to see you both. Let me start with the news, Mark Meadows, what Jay just broke. And, oh, but we've got to get this done. We're going to change the way we did it for eight years. We have an urgency to now share intelligence with 17 agencies and not three. We've got to get it done in two weeks, something we would never do to ourselves. Why?"

So, this is one of those six ways. Couple with all the other things we know that you talked about, the dossier, the person named Azra Turk, the plant they put pretending to be somebody else next to George Papadopoulos. And all that stuff took place. This is exactly what Chuck Schumer said they were going to do, and it sure looks like they did. That's why what Mark just said is so important. The attorney general of the United States and U.S. attorney John Durham are doing an investigation, and they have told us, this is broader than just the FBI. They're going to look at all of this.

Comey, McCabe, Baker, Strzok and Page, they've all screwed up. They all did things wrong. He said spying occurred.

Now, you and I talked about this, and you are very clear that it's not the FBI rank-and-file. It was the leadership. And so, let's let John Durham complete his work. Everybody respects him.  Let's let Michael Horowitz. Those names have been mentioned tonight.

I believe these will be made public. That's what I'm hearing that they will be made public, and I think Senator Graham has a very important point here. Let the American people be the judge. Don't just listen to me. Don't just listen to Sean Hannity or you know anyone else out in the cable news, network field. Let the American people see what they already know. These are facts. We've already seen a number of things pointing in the direction of malfeasance at the FBI, even within the DOJ. And I'm going to tell you this, Sean, it's going to go far beyond that. It is going to take in the scope of the intelligence community because we know there were foreign actors involved and when foreign actors and foreign states are involved that means those intelligence services both in Italy and Great Britain. That means John Brennan was well aware of what was going on. So, this isn't going to be narrow scope. This isn't just about what was happening at the FBI, it's what was going on at the DOJ, what was going on in the Obama Administration. As Jay Sekulow pointed out in those documents that he now has under (FOA) and what was happening within the CIA and the NSA as the scope widened and who were they actually looking at listening to and who were they working with as far as the investigation into President Trump in the campaign."

Now, I think we know some of this is would be in the Gang of Eight information in that bucket. But if that exculpatory evidence was in fact hidden which you tell me if you interpreted what Trey is saying as I did, then you've got two different briefings about Russia from the Obama administration to the Trump and Clinton campaigns, is that also a possibility."

But I think what Representative Gowdy is referring to is the exculpatory evidence relating to Papadopoulos and Carter Page who had conversations with at least one undercover operative for the FBI, maybe the CIA. And I think you'll find that there is a transcript of those conversations between Stefan Halpert and in particular George Papadopoulos in which it's completely exculpatory. And Carter Page but that information which is by law required to be presented to the FISA court when you're seeking an application to spy was hidden and concealed. That's a lie and a fraud on the court. So, I think those are - and by the way, Papadopoulos says that the Australian diplomat, Alexander Downer recorded his conversation. There is likely a transcript of that, which is exculpatory and has been concealed."

Here's where it gets really interesting Warren is taking all this step further proposing also because there weren't reparations in the Democratic parties. We're going to add in LGBTQ persons for past discrimination. She didn't explain how it would work. Of course, specifics aren't a priority for the new radical Democrats and they're not going to tell us how to pay for anything. They'll say and do anything to try and get elected to take away every person's fear with false promises and lies that really are about their power. Look at Senator Booker, who is writing off meeting with a radical, very anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan.

He's the mayor. 51 percent of residents don't agree that they have \"an overall feeling of safety in their neighborhood.\" He's the mayor. 64 percent of residents disagree that the city is a safe community for everyone. And the list goes on. So, you see what's happening here. You got a radical new socialist extreme Democratic Party totally crumbling before our eyes, open borders, the economy killing Green New Deal, 70 percent top marginal tax rate for individuals, 90 percent top corporate tax rates, no business will stay in business and after all of that, you pay a wealth tax and then a death tax that they want to raise. By the way, there will be no more oil and gas, we'll eliminate planes and even cows, because of flatulence and will have during and after birth infanticide which many are advocating for reparations, open borders, government guaranteed everything. By the way, how to keep your doctor, keep your plan and save money workout. Then you're going to have Medicare for All, but no choice of your own insurance. These aren't principles, this is just non-stop pandering to try and buy votes. This is dangerous. This will destroy the prosperity of this country. Frankly, the reason the Straits of Hormuz are not that meaningful to us as they once were is because this President made us independent energy wise, energy independent for the first time in 75 years and we're now net exporter of energy. This is also the greatest wealth creator that we have available. Our energy which we have an abundance of more than all these countries, we can bring Iran to its knees. We won't have to get involved in many foreign conflicts for the free flow of oil at market prices. We can bring Putin, the hostile actor that he is to his knees. All because the President is smart.

He said, he asked the President because he's embarrassed by the fact that Obama is not endorsing. So, he goes and says, I asked President Obama not to endorse me.

That's something they do with Republicans. You say sleepy creepy, those are all true about Biden, slow Jesse, you're right about that. But I think Joe China is the strongest hit. Joe Biden has enriched his son and his family on the backs of the working class, on the backs of America's manufacturing. And that is a devastating blow because the Democrats who promised four years to take on China and never did a damn thing. And Donald Trump came in two and a half years, he has not just revived the economy, but he has made this a blue-collar recovery. He has brought back American manufacturing.

Another video, the moment Chicago police enter after Jussie Smollett's apartment for the first time after the alleged attack, Smollett is standing there with a large amount of white rope around his neck, the alleged noose. Police asked Smollett, if he wants to take the rope off, Smollett says, yes, I do. I just wanted police to see it. And then Smollett says they poured bleach on me.
