      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" We are just hours from the 2018 midterm elections as you well know, and the noise levels are becoming almost unbearable. Certainly, everybody is shouting and posturing and trying to scare and bully you into voting for this or that candidate. It's all very loud. But pause for a second and consider what you are not hearing. What is missing from this cacophony? For starters, there is hardly word about Russia.  Remember that dastardly Vladimir Putin and the collusion plot that hacked our democracy? Whatever happened to that? And while we are at it, what about Brett Kavanaugh? Does that name ring a bell? What about his High School Yearbook and his purported teenage drinking problem and those gang rapes he's supposedly committed?  What about those? Those were the biggest stories in the world not so long ago. 24/7 on the other cable channels. Those stories were going to define this election and they were going to define this entire historical era. Everybody on television told us that.  And now they are just fading memories. It turns out they were sideshows. The midterm elections were never going to be fought over Vladimir Putin or Brett Kavanaugh or just about anything else we spent most of our time talking about. This election like all elections was always going to turn on issues that actually affect the life of the country. This year there are three big issues. Immigration, the economy and nationalism. The first is the most obvious. Immigration determines who lives next door to you.  It determines who works in your office, who chooses your leaders. There is nothing more fundamental in any country than the question of citizenship. Whatever Donald Trump doesn't know, he definitely knows this. He's been talking about immigration for three years now. For all of that time, official Washington has been trying to make him stop.",

      "sentences": "In other words, shut up, racist. But Trump will not shut up so they have changed tactics. The newline is, immigration doesn't really matter. The threat is hyped, only dumb people and bigots care about borders. By the way, parties of both sides seem to believe this. Paul Ryan's office, let it be known to Politico this morning that the Speaker of the House begged the President last night to stop yammering about this caravan from central America and talk about something important like Paul Ryan's Tax bill. That's pre-emptive blame shifting obviously. If Republicans lose tomorrow, Paul Ryan can point the finger at Trump rather than accept responsibility for not funding the wall that voters said they wanted. But it's also a ludicrous position to take because it's untrue. Immigration does matter.   If, for example, Arizona and Texas go to the Democrats tomorrow, immigration will be the reason. Those are Republican states until the population changed. So, no matter how much you lie about it, immigration is inherently important and voters understand that. If you want people to stop worrying about the border, maybe you should secure the border, then it won't be an issue. People are also worried about other things that Washington doesn't notice or think is important. Here in Washington, the economy is synonymous with the stock market. Markets have boomed for ten years, their entire cable channels are devoted to chronicling that boom. Here in Washington the assumption is that the economy must also be booming but the truth is that after a decade of stocks going higher, the effects, the positive ones are still not very obvious outside select zip codes on the coast.  In middle America, many young people understand that they will almost certainly make less than their parents make that is a reversal of the American dream. They know they won't be able to buy cars or buy houses, they are not getting married, they're not having kids.   Our current economic system makes it more difficult than ever for families to form. Our middle class is becoming unable to reproduce itself. Washington should be absolutely panicked about this. It is the most basic sign of failure, their failure, but nobody in either party seems to care. Their answer is just to import new families from other countries. So maybe it's not so surprising that young people say they like socialism? Because what we have now is not working for them, and unless we fix, we may get actual socialism which will be a disaster.  And that leads to the third issue of this election which is nationalism. Now despite what you are hearing day in and day out, nationalism is not a racial category. It has nothing to do with race or ethnicity. Nationalism is the belief that leaders ought to put the interest of their own countries above those of other countries. It's very straightforward. The President himself declared himself a nationalist, the other night. Watch.",

Twitter and Facebook will surely be banning the term if they haven't already. But why? What exactly is going on here? Why are they so intent on stamping out not just a concept but the very word? It's simple. What you are watching is people protecting their own prerogatives. Globalization which is the opposite of nationalism has caused an enormous transfer of wealth from the American middle class to what we used to call the third world, to other countries. Americans factories closed but the jobs didn't go away, they just went to other countries.  Now some Americans got very rich from this, many other got poorer, that's what happened. Rather than admit what actually happened though, the people who got richer are trying to make the people who got poorer, shut up and stop complaining about it.  A borderless world has been hugely profitable for them that's why they support it. Nationalism is their kryptonite so they must stop it. So, they scream racism and hope that nationalism will go away. Will it go away? Probably not. Because the core idea is appealing to people, all people in all countries over all time. People want leaders who are above all on their side. They always have wanted that, they always will want that. That's what we know. What we don't know is what's going to happen in the elections tomorrow. We won't even guess, nothing would surprise us. But we know what the real issues are because it's obvious and we're going to spend the next hour talking about those issues. We're going to begin this night on immigration with Ann Coulter, she is the author of \"Resistance is Futile.\" Had the Trump hitting Left, lost its collective mind.

Please talk about the economy, don't talk about immigration.  Number two, the only argument from their side that you just played, I guess from Joe Scarborough was to accuse people who are opposed to dumping millions of poor people on the country, driving down the wages of the working place and Joe Scarborough's maid, is to claim racism. The Left is so lucky that the poor countries to the South of us are Latin American countries and we're not taking in like Poland's poor or Eastern Europe's poor, maybe gypsies.

It's terrific for them but again, for the poor people already here, and not just poor people, it goes up the scale. So, the working class gets pushed aside as well and it shows Trump's magnificent political instincts, I think, other than actually fulfilling his promises on building a wall and deporting illegal aliens, he's doing the best he can on these midterms. I love that his instincts are, no, I have to keep talking about immigration.

Despite that, American elites tell us that nationalism is bad and only globalism is morally acceptable. They say this because nationalism is racist, they claim. But in fact, nationalism has nothing at all to do with race. And if you want proof, look no further than the Democratic party is obsessed with race, literally. People are celebrated or attacked purely on the basis of their skin color. Democrats want jobs, college slots, opportunity itself divided, divide up based on DNA.

And the other party's plan is they want Afghanistan and Yemen and Libya and everyone in those countries to come and move to America, to solve as you were saying earlier, the problem that they have caused of later family formation because Americans can no longer afford to form families and have children as young as they used to. The Democrats and half the Republican party want to bring in foreigners to be a kind of permanent peasant class, reproducing at the rates that they think are necessary for the economy.

That it reverses the impact of what we're trying to do for women for the last 20 years to get them to be taken seriously, on the issue of sexual assault and domestic violence et cetera. But you hear crickets, its silence and even the media. This was so important. Of course, it consumed media 24/7 for weeks, if not upwards of a month. And now you think if this is still such a dynamic issue, I mean, my goodness. Is it not a rapist that we've got on the supreme court, wouldn't that even require more outrage and more investigation and yet, not only is there no more investigation into Kavanaugh, but there is no defense of the women. Right? Now, Julie Swetnick and Avenatti and others, but certainly they're going to need lawyers. Right? They're going to need money moving to the future, they're going to need to be able to defend themselves at a federal level. And there is like silence for them, too. Everybody has run for the hills and what this does confirm is this was simply a stunt. That they knew what they were doing. They didn't care about the impact on women overall and they still don't and that is the largest fraud facing the American people. The American Left not only not being champions for women and others on the fringe and for these issues, they've been enablers of having those issues get worse. And they are the enemy of women across this country and I believe tomorrow we're going to see some of the results of that.

Certainly, everybody is shouting and posturing and trying to scare and bully you into voting for this or that candidate. It's all very loud. But pause for a second and consider what you are not hearing. What is missing from this cacophony? For starters, there is hardly word about Russia. Remember that dastardly Vladimir Putin and the collusion plot that hacked our democracy? Whatever happened to that? And while we are at it, what about Brett Kavanaugh? Does that name ring a bell? What about his High School Yearbook and his purported teenage drinking problem and those gang rapes he's supposedly committed? What about those? Those were the biggest stories in the world not so long ago. 24/7 on the other cable channels. Those stories were going to define this election and they were going to define this entire historical era. Everybody on television told us that. And now they are just fading memories. It turns out they were sideshows. The midterm elections were never going to be fought over Vladimir Putin or Brett Kavanaugh or just about anything else we spent most of our time talking about. This election like all elections was always going to turn on issues that actually affect the life of the country. This year there are three big issues. Immigration, the economy and nationalism. The first is the most obvious. Immigration determines who lives next door to you. It determines who works in your office, who chooses your leaders. There is nothing more fundamental in any country than the question of citizenship. Whatever Donald Trump doesn't know, he definitely knows this. He's been talking about immigration for three years now. For all of that time, official Washington has been trying to make him stop."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "In other words, shut up, racist. But Trump will not shut up so they have changed tactics. The newline is, immigration doesn't really matter. The threat is hyped, only dumb people and bigots care about borders. By the way, parties of both sides seem to believe this. Paul Ryan's office, let it be known to Politico this morning that the Speaker of the House begged the President last night to stop yammering about this caravan from central America and talk about something important like Paul Ryan's Tax bill. That's pre-emptive blame shifting obviously. If Republicans lose tomorrow, Paul Ryan can point the finger at Trump rather than accept responsibility for not funding the wall that voters said they wanted. But it's also a ludicrous position to take because it's untrue. Immigration does matter. If, for example, Arizona and Texas go to the Democrats tomorrow, immigration will be the reason. Those are Republican states until the population changed. So, no matter how much you lie about it, immigration is inherently important and voters understand that. If you want people to stop worrying about the border, maybe you should secure the border, then it won't be an issue. People are also worried about other things that Washington doesn't notice or think is important. Here in Washington, the economy is synonymous with the stock market. Markets have boomed for ten years, their entire cable channels are devoted to chronicling that boom. Here in Washington the assumption is that the economy must also be booming but the truth is that after a decade of stocks going higher, the effects, the positive ones are still not very obvious outside select zip codes on the coast. In middle America, many young people understand that they will almost certainly make less than their parents make that is a reversal of the American dream. They know they won't be able to buy cars or buy houses, they are not getting married, they're not having kids. Our current economic system makes it more difficult than ever for families to form. Our middle class is becoming unable to reproduce itself. Washington should be absolutely panicked about this. It is the most basic sign of failure, their failure, but nobody in either party seems to care. Their answer is just to import new families from other countries. So maybe it's not so surprising that young people say they like socialism? Because what we have now is not working for them, and unless we fix, we may get actual socialism which will be a disaster. And that leads to the third issue of this election which is nationalism. Now despite what you are hearing day in and day out, nationalism is not a racial category. It has nothing to do with race or ethnicity. Nationalism is the belief that leaders ought to put the interest of their own countries above those of other countries. It's very straightforward. The President himself declared himself a nationalist, the other night. Watch."

Twitter and Facebook will surely be banning the term if they haven't already. But why? What exactly is going on here? Why are they so intent on stamping out not just a concept but the very word? It's simple. What you are watching is people protecting their own prerogatives. Globalization which is the opposite of nationalism has caused an enormous transfer of wealth from the American middle class to what we used to call the third world, to other countries. Americans factories closed but the jobs didn't go away, they just went to other countries. Now some Americans got very rich from this, many other got poorer, that's what happened. Rather than admit what actually happened though, the people who got richer are trying to make the people who got poorer, shut up and stop complaining about it. A borderless world has been hugely profitable for them that's why they support it. Nationalism is their kryptonite so they must stop it. So, they scream racism and hope that nationalism will go away. Will it go away? Probably not. Because the core idea is appealing to people, all people in all countries over all time. People want leaders who are above all on their side. They always have wanted that, they always will want that. That's what we know. What we don't know is what's going to happen in the elections tomorrow. We won't even guess, nothing would surprise us. But we know what the real issues are because it's obvious and we're going to spend the next hour talking about those issues.

Please talk about the economy, don't talk about immigration. Number two, the only argument from their side that you just played, I guess from Joe Scarborough was to accuse people who are opposed to dumping millions of poor people on the country, driving down the wages of the working place and Joe Scarborough's maid, is to claim racism. The Left is so lucky that the poor countries to the South of us are Latin American countries and we're not taking in like Poland's poor or Eastern Europe's poor, maybe gypsies.

Globalism is great for the rich people who live on the coast, people who need a lot -- who have a lot of servants. Pool boy, nanny, somebody to pick up the kids. It's terrific for them but again, for the poor people already here, and not just poor people, it goes up the scale. So, the working class gets pushed aside as well and it shows Trump's magnificent political instincts, I think, other than actually fulfilling his promises on building a wall and deporting illegal aliens, he's doing the best he can on these midterms. I love that his instincts are, no, I have to keep talking about immigration. A little tip for the President, it would be so much better when you're running for re-election if you actually did the stuff that you've been promising to do for three years."

We're looking at about $5 billion spent in this midterm race. The Democrats start in a deficit in the Senate. John James is an interesting candidate, I would watch that race in Michigan tomorrow night. He's only two points behind, he's really close hard in that race. One thing that happens though that in those rust belt states, lots of the Republican governors are up, like Scott Walker. He's in a very tight re-election effort there. So, lot of stuff happening in the rust belt. The Democrats however, they are favorite to win back the House by some but there is still a chance. Let's just say this.

They talked about tax cuts 2.0, is that going to cut it? Can they really go into 2020 not addressing health care?

Probably the worst, Woodrow Wilson was an avid globalist and it's not surprising that he got us into the single most pointless war in history. Over a 100,000 Americans died in the First World War. Despite that, American elites tell us that nationalism is bad and only globalism is morally acceptable. They say this because nationalism is racist, they claim. But in fact, nationalism has nothing at all to do with race. And if you want proof, look no further than the Democratic party is obsessed with race, literally. People are celebrated or attacked purely on the basis of their skin color. Democrats want jobs, college slots, opportunity itself divided, divide up based on DNA. This is tribalism and it's destroying the country. Nationalism doesn't cause tribalism, it is the antidote to tribalism. Rally around the nation and not your tribe. Author and columnist Mark Steyn believes this is obvious, having spent his life traveling around the world, and writing about it. But he joins us tonight to reiterate it. So, this is so Orwellian because leaving Trump out of it, nationalism is the antidote to tribalism. We're all in different tribes. Ignore our tribes, come together, 'e pluribus unum' around the country, right?"

And if you weaken nationalism, people look for other identities and it doesn't matter whether they're racial identities or they're religious identical like Islam, or they're sexual identities, you then as you say tribalize the population and people's sub-national identity becomes more important to them than their national identity.

So, when you have a situation, which is you said putting Trump aside but let's move him back, just a moment. A couple of years ago, people switched on the television and they found that the mainstream candidates of one party were talking about boots on the ground in Afghanistan or Libya or Yemen or wherever is next. And the other party's plan is they want Afghanistan and Yemen and Libya and everyone in those countries to come and move to America, to solve as you were saying earlier, the problem that they have caused of later family formation because Americans can no longer afford to form families and have children as young as they used to. The Democrats and half the Republican party want to bring in foreigners to be a kind of permanent peasant class, reproducing at the rates that they think are necessary for the economy. These are all insane. I mean, sometimes that's made absolutely explicit. Angela Merkel in Germany brought into million young Muslim men to be the children that Germans didn't have for themselves.

Last week one of the accusers of Brett Kavanaugh admitted to the senate judiciary committee that she in fact fabricated, made up the rape allegation against him. Senator Chuck Grassley has asked the Department of Justice to investigate that person. Tammy Bruce is radio host and president of Independent Women's voice, she joins us tonight. Tammy, you think that there would be people who make a living protecting women who would say, wait a second. This is a big deal, you should always admit when you're wrong but I haven't heard anybody talk about the story and certainly no one on the Left. Why?"

The problem is though is that they should also be angry. If they were serious, they would be angry that these certain people lied. That it reverses the impact of what we're trying to do for women for the last 20 years to get them to be taken seriously, on the issue of sexual assault and domestic violence et cetera. But you hear crickets, its silence and even the media. This was so important. Of course, it consumed media 24/7 for weeks, if not upwards of a month. And now you think if this is still such a dynamic issue, I mean, my goodness. Is it not a rapist that we've got on the supreme court, wouldn't that even require more outrage and more investigation and yet, not only is there no more investigation into Kavanaugh, but there is no defense of the women. Right? Now, Julie Swetnick and Avenatti and others, but certainly they're going to need lawyers. Right? They're going to need money moving to the future, they're going to need to be able to defend themselves at a federal level. And there is like silence for them, too. Everybody has run for the hills and what this does confirm is this was simply a stunt. That they knew what they were doing. They didn't care about the impact on women overall and they still don't and that is the largest fraud facing the American people. The American Left not only not being champions for women and others on the fringe and for these issues, they've been enablers of having those issues get worse. And they are the enemy of women across this country and I believe tomorrow we're going to see some of the results of that. We saw some change when it comes to Democrats' enthusiasm and the gap between the enthusiasm after the Kavanaugh hearing because I think that fraud finally was exposed. And now it has been confirmed with Senator Grassley's report."

      "utterance": "Hi Tucker, the fact that President Trump made his second visit to Indiana in less than a week, is a good indicator that GOP believes Republican challenger Mike Braun has a genuine shot at knocking off Indiana's incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly. The Real Clear Politics average has it at dead heat with Donnelly at 44.3% and Braun at 43%. Though the latest Fox news poll has a Braun down by seven points. But the Indianapolis star newspaper says people waited in line for hours in Fort Wayne to get into see President Trump's rally. Lou Holtz, a man who also beloved in Indiana for his 11 seasons coaching Notre Dame spoke as well tonight. But listen to what the President said."

      "utterance": "Meantime, in the Missouri Senate race, it doesn't matter what polls you look at, it's a toss-up. The RCP average has Republican challenger Josh Hawley with a little more than a half point lead over Missouri Democrat incumbent Claire McCaskill. The Fox news poll has them deadlocked at 43% each, and the NBC Marist poll has McCaskill up by three points but that is still within the margin of error. It's is notable that 54% of like Missouri voters approve of President Trump's job performance and, in an effort to push Josh Hawley across the finish line, the President is also holding a rally in Missouri about an hour and 5 minutes from right now. Tucker."

      "utterance": "Trace Gallagher, thanks for that. Fundamentally most elections are about the economy, that has always been true but what's a striking and appalling in this one is how many voters say they want profound change to the U.S. economy? Young people famously say they identify with socialism, pretty strongly. The question is, why is that? It's not just that they're being misinformed is the current economy not working for them? Mark Blyth is a Professor of Political Science and International Public Affairs at Brown University in Providence and he joins us tonight. Professor, thanks for coming on so my theory, and I think it's right, is that a lot of young people say they want real economic change because the current economy is not working for them. And the boom that we're seeing in markets isn't reflected in the economy they experienced, do you think that's true?"

      "utterance": "I think there's definitely a lot of truth and what a lot of viewers will obviously feel themselves is that they're working harder constantly but at the same time, well, there is lots of employment and lots of jobs and no one is saying the economy isn't good, it's not really showing up in wages and that's been a story that's been going on for a very long time that all the way back to the late 70s in fact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Interesting. So, is it also true that young people entering the labor markets here for the first ten years of employment, 22 to 32, that they are finding themselves behind where their parent's generation was at those ages?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLYTH",
      "utterance": "That's true. And they've also got something that their parents didn't have in many cases, a very large debt burden coming from student loans. So if you think about what that does by the time that their parents were getting into their 30s, they're marrying, they're having kids, they're building houses and homes, they're forming assets as you would say, you are paying off your debt and you haven't had a chance to do that yet so that's acting as a drag on their future consumption and ultimately, on their lives."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "What I don't understand is why this isn't causing alarm bells to go off. If your young people can't form families by definition, your society will become less stable, but nobody seems to care. Why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLYTH",
      "utterance": "I think because the incentives for both parties are skewed in a really interesting way which is the following. Old people own 80% of all the assets in the world and the old people vote twice as much as young people. So, if young people are too busy worrying about paying off their loans and not going out to vote then politicians are going to go where the money and the votes are and that's for the old people and that's what they care about."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But I mean, don't long term you risk having upheavals in your society, things become really volatile and that's bad for everybody, if you don't have an economy that allows people to get vested in the society?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLYTH",
      "utterance": "What is particularly dangerous less than the social upheaval is in the financial sector. So, we all borrow against our futures and we try to use that cash wisely to invest in ourselves but if your wages haven't been rising, people are borrowing for consumption. And if at the end of the day, their wages aren't going to rise, they're not going to be able to pay that off over the long term. And that puts big stress in the financial sector."

      "utterance": "Well, in the past two years, the Democratic party has outsourced much of its political philosophy to late night TV shows, they haven't closed the think tanks here in D.C. but they don't pay any attention, they pay attention to \"Saturday Night Live.\" It's not as funny as it used to be but it does tell you a lot about what the Left now believes. Here for example is their final pitch for the 2018 midterms. Republicans are disgusting, some of them are even wounded in wars."
