Turkey has no interest in Iran dominating Damascus. At the end of the day, their economy is better off hooked up with us versus Russia and Iran. They are a NATO ally.  So, I came away from my meeting somewhat encouraged that we can start over with President Erdogan in a win-win fashion, securing the northeastern part of Syria in fashion acceptable to Turkey, and they can be a better ally when it comes to pushing back against Iran and ISIS.",

You can't have the S-400, we'll find a substitute for that. If you release the prisoners that are caught up in the coup, that helps us enormously.  There's a win-win situation in northeastern Syria.

You know, Dana, I've worked for probably three presidents, all of whom have said the same thing. Now, I think for the first time, we are releasing the Europeans actually start going in the right direction. Every ally is now increasing defense spending. We've had the largest increase in defense spending since the Cold War. And in the year and a half since President Trump has been in office, it has doubled since 2014. So, I think he is making an impact and I think that the Europeans, including Chancellor Merkel just recently who has said we are going to do more. It we need to do more, it's the right thing to do and she is encouraging her Bundestag, her parliament, to increase the defense budget so that we will be more fit for purpose in NATO for the fights that we want to deter."

The president reportedly has said Crimea should go to the Russians since most people there speak Russian. Does that concern allies like those in the Baltic States? And is it still the position of the United States that our NATO allies have reason to be concerned about threats from Russia?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUTCHISON",
      "utterance": "Oh, I think definitely we are hardening our defenses as a deterrence against the invasion of any outside influence. It is most certainly Russia, which has had much-maligned influence that has been an attempt to destabilize our alliance and our allies. It's also counterterrorism. We have a major effort, and it was President Trump's request that we prioritize at NATO more in the counterterrorism area, which we are doing. And I think it's very important that we support the Ukraine and the illegal invasion of Crimea and the also still tensioned area in Eastern Ukraine. Ukraine is trying very hard to be a strong and sovereign nation, and NATO is committed to helping them do that with the reforms that they are seeking. So, I do think that we are allied in that and I know that all of us in the United States is right there too want to assure that we have the mutual defense against any kind of malign influence that Russia might attempt and most certainly the export of terrorism from Afghanistan and other countries that is in our interest to do."

They want to destabilize the strongest defense alliance and a history of the world, and that is NATO. And every effort that we can make that strengthens our alliance as well as the partners that we have is very helpful, very productive and very necessary. And Turkey is one of our alliance's most strong members. They are a framework nation helping us in Afghanistan. They have been an ally for a long time and we will continue to work with them and we know that Russia is trying to move into that, but they are strong and they are a NATO strong member."

We are very much against that because it will affect the interoperability of our NATO forces in Turkey. We can't have a Russian-built defense system with F35s going into Turkey. So, we are working with Turkey in every way not to put this Russian system in the middle of their country when they are such a strong ally of NATO, as well as the United States."

You've said that there is no discussion regarding U.S. troop withdrawal from Germany, but I understand the Pentagon is undertaking a cost analysis of the 35,000 U.S. troops that we have there. How do you describe within NATO or even to the president the rationale for keeping U.S. troops in Germany?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUTCHISON",
      "utterance": "Well, the U.S. troops in Germany, which there are in the neighborhood of 30,000, are there for many purposes, part of which, of course, is our ally Germany, but also, they are a forward basing presence. They are hospital focus for us that helps when we have injured soldiers that need immediate care. They fly to Germany. They are a basing operation, and they're going to be part of our military mobility in NATO. So, of course, we want to make sure that we are getting help with the cost of troops in Germany when it is in our interest to have them. That is a negotiation that we always have with countries where we have basing, but I will say that Germany has been a very solid partner in having our troops there and it has a long-standing support basing both for us as well as for Germany."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUTCHISON",
      "utterance": "Well, we do have troops in Poland. It is a rotating force, part of our enhanced forward presence and we have a great relationship with another great ally of ours in NATO, Poland, and they have offered permanent basing. Certainly, we look at all offers made like that, but no decision is being made right now. But looking at it, yes. In fact, Congress has asked that our Defense Department look at the cost involved in new basing of any kind, wherever it might be."

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who just wrapped up two days of meetings in Pyongyang maintained his visit produced results but said sanctions would remain for now. Joining me from Clemson, South Carolina, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham just back from a trip. So, we're glad to have you here. If we could start with North Korea, the obvious improvement in relations because you have Kim Jong-un used to say that President Trump was a dotard. Now, he's actually engaging on policy, but it probably doesn't surprise you that much that the North Koreans issued a statement yesterday saying that the meeting was regrettable, saying they were robber-like and really pouring cold water on it. What do you think of it?"

      "speaker": "SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA, SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "I see China's hands all over this. We are in a fight with China. We buy $500 billion worth of goods from the Chinese. They buy $100 billion from us. They cheat and President Trump wants to change the economic relationship with China. So, if I were President Trump, I would not let China use North Korea to back me off of the trade dispute. We've got more bullets than they do when it comes to trade. We sell them $100 billion, they sell is $500 billion, we can hurt them more than they will hurt us. And all we're looking for is for them to stop cheating when it comes to trade. There's no doubt in my mind that it's the Chinese pulling a North Koreans back. And to our North Korean friends, can't say the word friend yet. You asked Pompeo, did he sleep well? If you knew what I knew about what we could do to the leadership of North Korea, you wouldn't sleep very well."

Meanwhile, President Trump will meet one-on-one with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki next Monday. \"Bloomberg\" reports the Kremlin is working with the U.S. to have a deal that the president will except, they say Putin has agreed in principle to U.S. and Israeli demands that Iranian-backed forces in southern Syria be kept away from Israel's border, replaced with troops loyal to the government and Damascus. That's according to two Kremlin advisers. Would you recommend the president agreed to that deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Given Russia's behavior, absolutely not. Russia was supposed to make sure that Assad had no chemical weapons. The last thing you can rely upon is the Russians to take care of American-Israeli interests. There is ideal to be had in Syria. Our troops in northeastern Syria working with the Syrian Democratic forces, Arabs and Kurds, have demolished ISIS and if we stay there, we have about 2,000 troops, ISIS won't come back. If we stay in northeastern Syria, Iran can't march from Tehran to Beirut. I don't trust the Russians to implement any agreement when it comes to the Iranians, but there is a way to break Iran from -- Russia away from Iran, but no way can it be achieved about us staying there. Our presence in northeastern Syria is an insurance policy against Assad taking over Syria and ISIS coming back and the Iranians owning the whole region."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, first, when Putin denies that he was involved in our election in 2016, reject the denial, challenge him. Don't let him deny the obvious. They are still trying to disrupt the 2018 election cycle. When it comes to Syria, we need to be partnering with Turkey to make sure that we can maintain the presence in northeastern Syria. At the end of the day, Iran is a weak economy. They've got problems in their own backyard. What we need to do is partner with Turkey and Russia and break Iran away. Iran has a different reason for being in Syria than most everybody else. Israel cannot tolerate Hezbollah and Iranian presence in Syria. If you leave Assad in power, the Arabs will never accept him, nor will the Syrian people. There's a way to get Russia pulled away from Iran, but we've got to have a presence in Iraq and Syria to be successful. In 2007, we lost 900 soldiers fighting in Iraq and the last three and a half years, we have lost 14. President Trump has done a good job of destroying ISIS and countering Iran. Our soldiers in Iraq and Syria are insurance policies against Iran domination and the rise of ISIS. If we keep this configuration in place, we've got some leverage regarding Russia and Iran."

      "utterance": "He is going to be inaugurated for I think the fourth term tomorrow. And while Turkey has been somewhat helpful in Syria as you mentioned and Ambassador Hutchison just said, are you concerned that Turkey is an ally adrift, and is there a strategy to get them back on track?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, they are definitely an ally adrift but there's a new chapter in Turkish history. Erdogan won big and he's going to have a long time to serve in Turkey and we need to come to grips with that. We need to push him when it comes to the way they treat the press and some human rights abuses. They have Americans in captivity for no good reason. But having said that, we need to assure Turkey that the Kurdish forces we are partnered with in Syria will not present a threat to Turkey. That's a legitimate concern. Turkey has no interest in Iran dominating Damascus. At the end of the day, their economy is better off hooked up with us versus Russia and Iran. They are a NATO ally. So, I came away from my meeting somewhat encouraged that we can start over with President Erdogan in a win-win fashion, securing the northeastern part of Syria in fashion acceptable to Turkey, and they can be a better ally when it comes to pushing back against Iran and ISIS."

It will just be a matter of time before the S-400 would be used in a fashion to undermine the F35. They have to pick. I would like them to buy the Patriot missile battery made by the United States and our partners. They are a NATO partner. They need to release Pastor Brunson, who has been held in my view way too long, very much illegally. But you've got to remember that President Erdogan was under siege two years ago, there was an armed coup. I left that meeting believing that we can do business with Erdogan. You can't have the S-400, we'll find a substitute for that. If you release the prisoners that are caught up in the coup, that helps us enormously. There's a win-win situation in northeastern Syria. I think Turkey understands their future is better with the West economically, and I'd like to do a free trade agreement one day with Turkey when they get their house in order and that would neuter Russia and Iran's influence vis-a-vis Turkey better than anything I could think of."

The next day, he let us go see Pastor Brunson who is doing well physically but has been in jail now way too long. He's lived in Turkey for 24 years. He has nothing to do with the coup when it comes to what happened in 2016. He got caught up in a net and he is not a threat to the people of Turkey. That is the defining issue between us and Turkey. But I'm encouraged. I don't believe he would let us go see Pastor Brunson if they were not looking for a way to end this and they have some other embassy personnel in Turkish prison and we need to get this issue behind us. I left Turkey thinking that this new -- after Erdogan's election, we've got a chance to do business with him better than in the past, and I hope he'll take it, because we need Turkey and they need us."

You're on the Judiciary Committee. You've been around before for Supreme Court nominations. How much different like this one be and do you feel confident that the Republicans will be able to confirm one of President Trump's nominees before the midterms?"

    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I think I've got two words and I heard Supreme Court and confidence. So, we've got a technical problem, but here's my answer. Republicans are holding four lottery tickets and all of them are winners. If you are a conservative Republican, the four people named, particularly Thomas Hardiman, I'm glad he is on the list, are all winners and every Republican should embrace these picks. Here's the truth. Donald Trump could nominate George Washington or John Marshall and they couldn't get through. It may be a handful of Democrats will vote for a Trump pick because they have to politically. I've never seen at this dysfunctional. There's nobody that President Trump could nominate from a conservative bent that will get many Democratic votes. But this is a nightmare for red state Democrats to oppose a highly qualified nominee and all four of these people are highly qualified, been on the court, know what they are doing, mainstream judges. So, red state Democrats are going to have a very hard decision and I hope every Republican will rally behind these picks because they are all outstanding."

And he is certainly the first major party nominee who went on to be president to put a litmus test on Supreme Court justices. And that was to actually overturn Roe v. Wade. So, we believe him. He's got a vice president who committed to, you know, throw Roe on an ash heap of history. So we think that's the mind-set that many Americans are actually going into this with because it was such a vocal talking point for him. And the -- we also know that the backpedaling that's happening now from people who have long been critics of Roe v. Wade is partially because they know what we know, which is most American people actually, regardless of how they feel personally about abortion, believe that legal access is core to our country's precedence (ph)."

And 67 percent of Americans say they do not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned. Though there is some variation by degrees. In another poll, 50 percent say it should be legal under certain circumstances, 18 percent say it should not be legal at all. So if -- with 68 percent of people saying some or no -- all restrictions or some restrictions, how do you plan to go forward? And is it a situation where you might let the states decide if there is this public opinion change?"

It's, you know, similar to other freedoms and protections of people we've seen in this country without a federal guideline that affirms the fact that Roe should be legal. Many states already have decided that abortion should be criminalized. In fact, there are states with laws on the books right now that would make abortion the criminal act the minute Roe falls. And that makes women and doctors criminals. And so we think that the federal protection is necessary. We also know that that number of people who say, in some circumstances, of course, right? It's a complicated issue. But when you poke (ph) out a little bit further, what we find is that people are very, very uncomfortable sitting in judgment. Every individual has a story and that most people are compassionate and recognize that allowing people to make their own decisions about their families is that compassionate and healthy choice."

So we believe that actually what Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- and we have the clips -- said is, in fact, perfect, which is that women should be afforded this right to privacy, to make their own decision.

And we think that's a very compelling message for folks. Do we think Susan Collins is the only person that needs to hear it? Absolutely not. I mean I think this is a real be careful what you wish for a moment for Republicans who have spent decades being able to campaign against abortion but are reading the same polls that we're reading, which is why you have Leonard Leo backing off, which is, most Americans actually really support this rule (ph)."

Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume. Columnist for \"The Hill,\" Juan Williams. Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner. And former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz. Brit, it's a pleasure to have you here today. And wanted to ask you about Senator Mitch McConnell. He's taking a bum rap, right, for being this obstructionist, but don't the Democrats deserve some of the blame for the polarization on judges? If you go back to Bork, all the way through Harry Reid getting rid of the filibuster in 2013."

      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "It has been hardball politics on Supreme Court nominations at least since Bork, and arguably you can go back before that. And that is a function of the fact that the Supreme Court has been the source, and the other courts as well, of so many of the victories that the left has claimed on policy for decades now. And a result of that had been, of course, is there's this huge premium now on the Supreme Court nominees and everybody on -- in the political branches has pulled out all the stops to see that they can get their nominees confirmed, or in the case of some blocked. And that's where we are and that is what Mitch McConnell has dealt with, that's what Harry Reid was trying to deal with. But when you get down to it, it is hardball politics all the way and has been for the longest time."
    },

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And, Juan, conservatives have been galvanized around judicial issues for a really longest time. Democrats, not so much. Look at what Brian Fallon, who is now with Demand Justice, said in the Washington Post yesterday. He said, if Trump succeeds in this confirmation fight, progressives will learn the hard way of the importance of the courts. It's unfortunate it might take that for the left to realize the courts are an institution worth fighting for. Is the concern about a rightward shift in the court about to change that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "I think so. I think even now you can see that the perception of a court -- and I think that's largely at stake here because you are going from Justice Kennedy, who was a swing vote. He's like a guy standing in the middle of the road, especially on social issues. Certainly a conservative. But when it came to social issues, I'm thinking here in specific of abortion rights, I'm thinking of gay rights, Justice Kennedy was open to this discussion. And I think the public could see that while he could be persuaded one way or another. The potential here is for a very conservative justice to be put in place by President Trump that would really say to the public, no, the court really is a rubber stamp for a conservative social agenda. And I think that would be not only harmful in terms of public perception of the court, which people want to trust, but I think it would suggested that, to your point, liberals, or Democrats, have to -- would suddenly realize, they have to get as activated on this issue as conservatives have been in the past. Remember, the list that President Trump is choosing from is basically set by the Federalist Society. You had Leonard Leo, a clip from him on earlier. He's a key player in this. There is no such person on the left."

So it could be that Democrats decide to turn out to vote, but conservatives turn out to vote in this case as well. But a lot of this attention will be on the Senate. Do the Senate -- House Republicans run any risk of losing some focus and energy in that regard?"

      "speaker": "JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN (R-UT)",

And that gave a lot of enthusiasm to a very conservative base that knew that the court has made critical decisions. And Republicans, notoriously, have made mistakes in this in the past. They've put up some nominees who didn't turn out to be quite so conservative. So even though it's a House seat, they don't get a vote. It's the same base of voters that gets enthusiastic and actually shows up to vote, even in a midterm election."

And I don't think anybody knows the answer yet. I don't think the administration -- I don't think Secretary Pompeo knows the answer yet. And not because he's not knowledgeable, but because I don't think -- it's going to take another few weeks for that to become apparent. But one thing the administration is doing now is really circling the wagons. Everybody from Secretary Pompeo, the president, Heather Nauert, the State Department spokesperson, to Ambassador John Bolton, now national security adviser, they've got a message, and the message is to stay cool, calm and collected in the face of this, whatever -- whether it's a bump in the road or a crisis and to emphasize that it's a process and the process is ongoing and the process is on track. The first thing that Secretary Pompeo said yesterday when asked about the foreign ministry comments from the North Koreans was, they can say whatever -- basically, they can say whatever they want to the press, but the process is ongoing. Look, we've already got our next meeting set up."

He may be right. He may be wrong. So we get -- we move forward. We get to this point. The North Koreans come out with all of this bluster. Pompeo seems serene about the whole thing. So the question, it seems to me, the way to access this is, who do believe? Do you believe these North Korean spokesman, or do you believe Mike Pompeo? In this case, in terms of how this meeting went, I'd be inclined to believe Pompeo, which is by no means to say that all of this is going to end very well and they will denuclearize."

So this is not in our interest. The question is, how do you get him -- how do you break that linkage? I think that's what Senator Graham was coming to, making it clear to them.

So Erdogan is going to be there for a long time. I'm glad Senator Lindsey Graham was there. But this all comes -- it's multidimensional chess here. And going back to Juan's point, I want to make this really quickly, about -- about Putin. I do think Donald Trump is right, the president needs to have a good working relationship. But people on both sides of the aisle want to see President Trump take a much tougher stance with Vladimir Putin and say, you can't meddle with our elections, you can't be doing what you're doing in Syria and we are going to stand our ground.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEFANIK",
      "utterance": "I got a lot of pushback initially. Very few people took me seriously. Paul Ryan actually was one of the individuals that encouraged me and gave me great advice. You have two ears and one mouth, use it in that ratio. Listen to what voters concerns are."
