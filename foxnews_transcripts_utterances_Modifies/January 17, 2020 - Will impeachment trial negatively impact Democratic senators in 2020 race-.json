Two historic new trade deals, a record-setting economy, major progress on the border wall, safety, security, and prosperity for all Americans. Nobody can dispute any of this. None of it matters to today's radicalized Democratic socialist party. Today, the president summed it up perfectly during an event with college football national championship LSU. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Democrats know the president will be vindicated at the end of the Senate's trial. They don't care. They are more interested in finding an outlet for psychotic anti-Trump rage, tried to bloody the president up so it hurts him running in 2020. On Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi -- all smiles, there she is, literally signing off on her B.S. partisan impeachment articles, handing out commemorative gold pens with her autograph on them and taking -- well, pictures with anybody who wanted them. It was her crowning and only achievement basically as House speaker. That very same day Democrats tried to derail the Senate impeachment trial with a last-minute smear campaign disguised as important new evidence. The exact same tactic they used, remember, against Brett Kavanaugh. Did the same thing. Now, by the way, new evidence said that Joe and Hunter were innocent and that the prosecutor that was investigating zero experience Hunter was corrupt. Oh, that's new evidence? Oh, great. Glad they determined all of that right before their very eyes. And that night, the left anointed a brand new savior. This is Michael Avenatti 2.0, a man out on bail charged with felony campaign finance fraud and hiding -- get this, you can't make it up -- a million dollar payment from the country of Russia. Like I said, Avenatti 2.0; 254 appearances for Avenatti in one year. Just like their love affair with the currently imprisoned attorney, Democrats and the mob are willing to overlook massive credibility issues. Run with it, because that guy, yes, who's being charged with serious crimes, Lev Parnas, feeds into their anti-Trump hysteria. Same people who are lying to you then are lying to you now. Same cast of characters. Now, we'll break this down in detail coming up. And, of course, we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this week's jam-packed news cycle, and yet somehow, fake news CNN, they found time to spend an entire day whining about Republican Senator Martha McSally. How dare she call one of their reporters a liberal hack, when they are liberal hacks? One idiot called it a chilling attack. The mob and the media, they're so sensitive. Democratic allies truly live in this alternative reality. But buckle up, because -- well, if they get their way, well, in the come days, it will only get worse. In the days and weeks ahead, they want to drag this country through the mud and now the president has a chance to fight back, finally. He has now assembled a legal team to represent his case in the Senate, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone; along with the president's personal attorney, that would be Jay Sekulow; former independent counsel Ken Starr who conducted the investigation that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton. Starr is joined by former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and two other experienced lawyers. We know about Robert Ray and Jane Raskin. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz will also play a vital role, leading the constitutional oral arguments against impeachment. The president's legal time will easily destroy the Democrats' two bogus articles of impeachment.  Because this entire impeachment charade is nothing but a political smear campaign, Democrats -- well, they're going to try and drag the trial on for as long as humanly possible. They want to slow-walk this sham Schiff show and build the intensity and insanity so they'll have a major crescendo of conspiratorial drama. So, they're going to try to enter into evidence -- well, new things. They're going to try to demand that new witnesses testify. They're going to try and demand that new investigations based on new evidence, magically turns up at the last second, be introduced from the guy that is indicted. They're going to do anything and everything to derail the president's forthcoming acquittal. But their Achilles heel is none other than this guy, the real quid pro quo guy, quid pro quo Joe. And, of course, his son, zero experience Hunter Biden, who made millions and millions and millions from a corrupt Ukrainian oil and gas company, all while his father was spearheading the Obama administration's policy on Ukraine. Vice President Biden even leveraged a billion of your tax dollars in order to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, son of a B., he did. Why did he want the prosecutor fired? He was investigating his zero experience son. What company would ever pay somebody millions if they have zero experience? None. Any of you ever get that deal? Now, that is the very real corruption, the very core of this impeachment charade. Democrats, if you want to draw this out, go down this road, well, now, it becomes a very dangerous game. And the Senate is now officially the new Schiff sham show. And, by the way, just like the Russia collusion hoax and the Kavanaugh smear and every other con job from the radical left, the Trump-hating left, we know how this story will end. Complete vindication. Joining us now with more, two people who will play a very important role in the upcoming trial, including the author of \"The Case Against Removing Trump\", Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Good to see you both. Pam Bondi, let's start with you. Let's get a preview if we can of what you see, how this all goes down when it begins on Tuesday.",

They are ready to go last week. They are ready to go today and next week. We're ready to get this behind us because, as you said, the president has done absolutely nothing wrong. If they had articles of impeachment of an alleged crime, they should are been presented in the House. If the president was a clear and present danger, really, that should have been sent over prior, way prior to Christmas. Remember Pelosi's comments. Yet, they held it because they have nothing and they still have nothing. So, what we are going to have here, Sean, is a fair trial. And we're very excited to put this behind the president, get this behind him as soon as possible because he did nothing wrong. They have sent over the flimsiest of flimsy evidence if you can even call it that. And so, I think this is going to go very quick. And I think it's going to be put behind the president, because, as you said, while he is signing the China deal, one of the greatest deals in our lifetime with China, what is she doing? Signing the impeachment articles and giving out ceremonial pens? That's shameful. That's nothing. Trying to impeach a president should not be a day of joy and celebration. It should be somber and, frankly, shameful for all of them.",

      "sentences": "Professor Dershowitz, I know you're going to do -- deal with the constitutionality of this. Constitution is clear about the specific role that it's solely in the House's power, their realm to impeach. They've done that. Now, they have House managers chosen. They will present their case. Trials to be held in the Senate. We have -- the presiding judge will be the Supreme Court chief justice, John Roberts. Question is, why do some Republicans want to somehow do the House's job if they didn't do a good job which we know they didn't do a good job and this is a nothing case? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, \"THE CASE AGAINST REMOVING TRUMP\" AUTHOR: Well, my job next week will be to present the constitutional case against impeachment. A case that I've been presenting on your show, in two books and 25 articles. I will not deal with the nitty-gritty of the facts and whether there should be witnesses or not. But just from a personal point of view, the Constitution approach, which was suggested in prior impeachments, was always to have the facts presented to the House of Representatives, cross-examination, you then get a report. And the report is what's put on trial. The one thing that's critically clear is that if the Democrats are allowed to call witnesses, President Trump's lawyers will have to be allowed to call witnesses. And they're going to determine initially whether the witnesses are relevant. On CNN all day, they've been saying today that Hunter Biden wouldn't be relevant. But, of course he'd be relevant if witnesses were called because the issue is, was he corrupt? Did the president legitimately have an interest in ferreting out corruption, including the corruption of Hunter Biden? So I think if the Democrats begin to open the door, they will regret it. Also, it will put the trial off for months, maybe even longer than that, because they're going to call Bolton. Bolton will want to testify. The president will invoke executive privilege, and then, the Senate will have to take that case to court. And the court will have to decide either on a blanket way or question by question way whether or not Bolton has the right to answer these questions. Remember, he doesn't get to make the decision. It's made by the president in the first instance and then the courts.",

Who brought up Rudy Giuliani? It was President Zelensky, not President Trump. Who brought up Bill Barr and in what context?

They are more interested in finding an outlet for psychotic anti-Trump rage, tried to bloody the president up so it hurts him running in 2020. On Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi -- all smiles, there she is, literally signing off on her B.S. partisan impeachment articles, handing out commemorative gold pens with her autograph on them and taking -- well, pictures with anybody who wanted them. It was her crowning and only achievement basically as House speaker. That very same day Democrats tried to derail the Senate impeachment trial with a last-minute smear campaign disguised as important new evidence. The exact same tactic they used, remember, against Brett Kavanaugh. Did the same thing. Now, by the way, new evidence said that Joe and Hunter were innocent and that the prosecutor that was investigating zero experience Hunter was corrupt. Oh, that's new evidence? Oh, great. Glad they determined all of that right before their very eyes. And that night, the left anointed a brand new savior. This is Michael Avenatti 2.0, a man out on bail charged with felony campaign finance fraud and hiding -- get this, you can't make it up -- a million dollar payment from the country of Russia. Like I said, Avenatti 2.0; 254 appearances for Avenatti in one year. Just like their love affair with the currently imprisoned attorney, Democrats and the mob are willing to overlook massive credibility issues. Run with it, because that guy, yes, who's being charged with serious crimes, Lev Parnas, feeds into their anti-Trump hysteria. Same people who are lying to you then are lying to you now. Same cast of characters. Now, we'll break this down in detail coming up. And, of course, we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this week's jam-packed news cycle, and yet somehow, fake news CNN, they found time to spend an entire day whining about Republican Senator Martha McSally. How dare she call one of their reporters a liberal hack, when they are liberal hacks? One idiot called it a chilling attack. The mob and the media, they're so sensitive. Democratic allies truly live in this alternative reality. But buckle up, because -- well, if they get their way, well, in the come days, it will only get worse. In the days and weeks ahead, they want to drag this country through the mud and now the president has a chance to fight back, finally. He has now assembled a legal team to represent his case in the Senate, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone; along with the president's personal attorney, that would be Jay Sekulow; former independent counsel Ken Starr who conducted the investigation that led to the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton. Starr is joined by former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and two other experienced lawyers. We know about Robert Ray and Jane Raskin. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz will also play a vital role, leading the constitutional oral arguments against impeachment. The president's legal time will easily destroy the Democrats' two bogus articles of impeachment.  Because this entire impeachment charade is nothing but a political smear campaign, Democrats -- well, they're going to try and drag the trial on for as long as humanly possible. They want to slow-walk this sham Schiff show and build the intensity and insanity so they'll have a major crescendo of conspiratorial drama. So, they're going to try to enter into evidence -- well, new things. They're going to try to demand that new witnesses testify. They're going to try and demand that new investigations based on new evidence, magically turns up at the last second, be introduced from the guy that is indicted. They're going to do anything and everything to derail the president's forthcoming acquittal. But their Achilles heel is none other than this guy, the real quid pro quo guy, quid pro quo Joe. And, of course, his son, zero experience Hunter Biden, who made millions and millions and millions from a corrupt Ukrainian oil and gas company, all while his father was spearheading the Obama administration's policy on Ukraine. Vice President Biden even leveraged a billion of your tax dollars in order to get a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, son of a B., he did. Why did he want the prosecutor fired? He was investigating his zero experience son. What company would ever pay somebody millions if they have zero experience? None. Any of you ever get that deal? Now, that is the very real corruption, the very core of this impeachment charade. Democrats, if you want to draw this out, go down this road, well, now, it becomes a very dangerous game. And the Senate is now officially the new Schiff sham show. And, by the way, just like the Russia collusion hoax and the Kavanaugh smear and every other con job from the radical left, the Trump-hating left, we know how this story will end. Complete vindication. Joining us now with more, two people who will play a very important role in the upcoming trial, including the author of \"The Case Against Removing Trump\", Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Good to see you both. Pam Bondi, let's start with you. Let's get a preview if we can of what you see, how this all goes down when it begins on Tuesday."

They are ready to go last week. They are ready to go today and next week. We're ready to get this behind us because, as you said, the president has done absolutely nothing wrong. If they had articles of impeachment of an alleged crime, they should are been presented in the House.

And we're very excited to put this behind the president, get this behind him as soon as possible because he did nothing wrong. They have sent over the flimsiest of flimsy evidence if you can even call it that. And so, I think this is going to go very quick. And I think it's going to be put behind the president, because, as you said, while he is signing the China deal, one of the greatest deals in our lifetime with China, what is she doing? Signing the impeachment articles and giving out ceremonial pens? That's shameful. That's nothing. Trying to impeach a president should not be a day of joy and celebration. It should be somber and, frankly, shameful for all of them."

      "utterance": "Professor Dershowitz, I know you're going to do -- deal with the constitutionality of this. Constitution is clear about the specific role that it's solely in the House's power, their realm to impeach. They've done that. Now, they have House managers chosen. They will present their case. Trials to be held in the Senate. We have -- the presiding judge will be the Supreme Court chief justice, John Roberts. Question is, why do some Republicans want to somehow do the House's job if they didn't do a good job which we know they didn't do a good job and this is a nothing case? ALAN DERSHOWITZ, \"THE CASE AGAINST REMOVING TRUMP\" AUTHOR: Well, my job next week will be to present the constitutional case against impeachment. A case that I've been presenting on your show, in two books and 25 articles. I will not deal with the nitty-gritty of the facts and whether there should be witnesses or not. But just from a personal point of view, the Constitution approach, which was suggested in prior impeachments, was always to have the facts presented to the House of Representatives, cross-examination, you then get a report. And the report is what's put on trial. The one thing that's critically clear is that if the Democrats are allowed to call witnesses, President Trump's lawyers will have to be allowed to call witnesses. And they're going to determine initially whether the witnesses are relevant. On CNN all day, they've been saying today that Hunter Biden wouldn't be relevant. But, of course he'd be relevant if witnesses were called because the issue is, was he corrupt? Did the president legitimately have an interest in ferreting out corruption, including the corruption of Hunter Biden? So I think if the Democrats begin to open the door, they will regret it. Also, it will put the trial off for months, maybe even longer than that, because they're going to call Bolton. Bolton will want to testify. The president will invoke executive privilege, and then, the Senate will have to take that case to court. And the court will have to decide either on a blanket way or question by question way whether or not Bolton has the right to answer these questions. Remember, he doesn't get to make the decision. It's made by the president in the first instance and then the courts."

      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Now, there are two ways you can litigate it. One, you can make a motion to the chief justice. I think he would defer to the Senate. And then the issue, if the Senate votes, they will probably agree that it's executive privilege. Then, the Senate probably could take it to the courts and seek to have a redetermination in the courts. But, it would take forever. Remember, the Democrats said the reason they didn't bring the Bolton subpoena to the courts because it would take so much time. Now they want to do it again, which will make even more time and postpone the Senate trial for possibly months until they get a definitive decision from the United States Supreme Court. So, they're trying to have it both ways."

Sanders, along with his good friend, you lied about me, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar will now have to spend their time in Washington, D.C. at their day jobs. The longer the Senate trial lasts, the longer these three candidates will be off the trail. And for what? President Trump will be acquitted, vindicated, articles of impeachment are bogus. And, recently, former congressman and prosecutor, Trey Gowdy, pointed out the president's single best piece of evidence is the transcript of the very call in question. Joining us now to explain, FOX News contributor, Trey Gowdy. Well, we know what we have. We have the transcript. More importantly, they never talked about aid in that call. Would you do us a favor because, you know, we hear about election interference. And separate and apart from Russian interference, we know Ukrainian court determined so, \"Politico\" wrote about it in January of 2017. So, my question is, how do you see this going down?

The very best piece of evidence President Trump has is the transcript itself. We don't need to know how anybody else felt that was on the call. We don't need to know what they thought. We have the transcript. It was the second call between President Trump and President Zelensky. If President Trump were really hell-bent on conditioning aid on investigating the Bidens, why did he not bring it up in the first call? Not a word in the first call. The second call is because Rick Perry wanted him and bugged him to call Zelensky again. Need you to do us a favor. Who is us? Well, he answers the question -- our country has been through a lot. Who brought up Rudy Giuliani? It was President Zelensky, not President Trump. Who brought up Bill Barr and in what context? And I'm sorry, Sean, but if it is an impeachable offense to the have attorney general of the United States call about potential evidence or impropriety, then God help every president hereto come because your A.G. is going to be in a lot of trouble."

Did Mike Pence know about it? Absolutely he knew about it. Then three seconds later, well, it's improbable that he didn't know about it. And then three seconds later, well, it's possible. That's great if you're picking out a headline for \"The Hill\" or \"Politico\". It's a lousy witness if you're calling them an impeachment hearing. So, if you're going to call Lev Parnas, if you're going to call him and make his credibility, his believability an issue, then let's call 20 people who have an opinion on whether or not you should believe Lev Parnas. And now, we're up to, what, 21 witnesses? I mean, you can do that -- you can do any witness that Schiff wants to call. Then Republicans have the right to say, you know what, the credibility, believability of this witness is at issue.

If Mike Pompeo was an indispensable witness, why did you not call him, not to go to court, not sort out privilege? On the issue of privilege, Sean, every privilege that exists keeps you from accessing information -- priest-penitent, doctor-patient, attorney-client. Every privilege keeps from you accessing information. But we value the relationship more than we do the information, which is why we have privileges. If Adam Schiff wanted Mulvaney and Giuliani and Pompeo and Bolton, he had months and months to go to court and get a ruling that they had to talk. He didn't want that. He wants Cory and Martha and Joni Ernst and Thom Tillis to vote on these witnesses. He knows he's not going to get a conviction. He wants to take the Senate so the second Donald Trump term beginning in 2021 is neutered because Chuck Schumer is the majority leader.

Leading the former Vermont governor to say, Bernie is willing to play dirty in an attempt to, quote, \"Hillarize\" Warren. Squabble, well, could open things up for Joe -- quid pro quo Joe with Democrats reportedly no longer believing his campaign will self-destruct even though quid pro quo Joe continues making unbelievable gaffes like thinking Robert Beto Bozo O'Rourke is Latino.

All right, Congressman Gohmert, I don't see anybody and I'll quote Van Jones and Al Sharpton -- they didn't see anybody in that debate that can beat Donald Trump. Now, you've got the impeachment, the Schiff sham show has now gone over to the Senate. So, we've got to go through this nonsense. Then, you got these weak candidates. Who do you think emerges?

It sounds like they are trying to prevent that and Warren - - they're going it prevent these senators from having a shot at getting the nod from the DNC. And look at the impeachment, they're talking about this -- the Democrats are talking about adding witnesses to drag it out. Who does that keep from getting the nomination? Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, keeps them tied up, gives a better shot to poor -- low energy Joe, and also maybe if Hillary wants to get back in, it will help her again."

And it occurred after the debate was over. Yes, no, I think that what we're seeing right now and I think what we're seeing right there is the fact that Elizabeth Warren realizes what the rest of the Democratic Party realizes, you know, the party poobahs and what Hillary Clinton probably realizes, which is all the energy is with Bernie Sanders. And I think that Mr. Gohmert is exactly right. I think that DNC will do everything in their power to do what Hillary Clinton did last time. They are going to -- and if it goes to a brokered convention, they'll bring back Hillary if they have to. Anything -- they'll do anything to keep Bernie Sanders from getting the nomination. I don't agree with anything Bernie Sanders says. But, he got screwed the last time. They stole the nomination from him last time.

I don't -- I'm not saying that she doesn't believe some crazy things. I think she probably does.

Here with reaction, author of \"Witch Hunt\", \"New York Times\" bestseller, FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, along with \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist, FOX News contributor, Kimberley Strassel. You know, Kim, we have now sent Lawrence -- we have sent to San Francisco twice. People shooting up all over the place, defecating in the streets, urinating all over the place. It's a mess, Oracle pulled out $60 million worth of investment time that they spend there. Then you have L.A., we have gone to L.A., then we have been to Chicago. Then, we've been to Baltimore. Here's my question. Big cities, all the same pattern. They have the most crime, most drug use, and liberal policies have done, what, for the people?"

And that's the thing that makes the Austin story so sad, is that homelessness is real. It's a problem. But there are cities that go about it in a better way and cities that go about it in a failed way. And Austin looked out there and it purposefully chose to mimic the actions of L.A. and San Francisco. They legalize panhandling, legalize staying on the street, legalize camping. And this didn't become an issue overnight. It became an issue for Austin in a space of weeks. So there is your direct connection. The policies are what causes the problem."

It was amazing in San Francisco where all of this is like centered, all the drug use, all the urination, all the defecation. It's made it unlivable for the residents. One mile in one direction is Nancy Pelosi's multimillion-dollar gated community and a mile in the other direction is Nancy Pelosi's office. I don't see Nancy Pelosi going to her millionaire friends and saying, hey, why don't we help these people that desperately need help and build a shelter and get them food and drug counseling and a bed and clothes or whatever they need, showers?"

Meanwhile, the city that I used to live in, San Francisco, once, you know, pristine and beautiful and clean is now a filthy mess, unsanitary conditions, needles, defecation on the streets. And homeless people everywhere and it's not just a health danger, it's a public safety issue as Lawrence's story in Austin just pointed out those are stories in homeless encampments everywhere, stabbings and murders. And, you know, I agree with Kimberley, there are some cities that have done it correctly. They have passed ordinances. They make it illegal to live out on the streets in public parks if there's available shelters. And the problem is in many of these liberal cities, they are not creating the shelters to put the homeless in. And one can only conclude that they just don't care enough."
