Moments ago, the president along with GOP lawmakers gathered at the White House to celebrate the passage of the tax reform bill. This marks the biggest overhaul of the tax code in three decades.

And it's almost as if they had to get through the failure to figure out then how to work together later on. So I think it actually all worked out. I want to ask you something because the house guys always complain that they passed 400 bills and the senate doesn't do anything.

They missed that opportunity, and they could have tackled each of this individually. But nevertheless, now here we are coming on Christmas, a huge victory. And nobody but nobody should have to justify and, quote, pay for, allowing the American people to keep their own money in their own wallet. The fundamental problem that the Democrats is they sold Obamacare on a lie. Keep your doctor. Save $2500. That turned out to not be true.

When you think you haven't heard this expression, but we are making America great again. You haven't heard that, have you? Paul Ryan admits it's a little team.

He's spending his entire career trying to pull this off. A lot of praise. A lot of patting people on the back. And I think, next year, when people have more money in their wallet despite duking out that I saw yesterday between you and Jesse. Democrats didn't have a plan. They don't have a solution.

There're three things about this, you cut corporate taxes and you cut individual taxes, that's one, drilling Anwar, Obamacare mandate. What just happened today is what I always dreamed of.

And I wonder what the conference thinks of this. To have put this forward ahead of Obamacare repeal and replace because of repealing the mandate and tax reform putting a win on the board for something that they can get some consensus building about, and also effectively, you know, defunding Obamacare with this mandate aspect."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",

I actually think that they -- I think it worked out the way it was supposed to, partly because if you think of the first of the year, the president and some of his aides were always going after establishment Republicans because they weren't doing enough. And it's almost as if they had to get through the failure to figure out then how to work together later on. So I think it actually all worked out. I want to ask you something because the house guys always complain that they passed 400 bills and the senate doesn't do anything. And Juan says, well, this is only a singular legislative accomplishment. But if you're doing three things in one bill all at once, then that's actually several accomplishments. Plus you add the circuit court judges, and the senate really delivered."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, and you have Neil Gorsuch sitting on the Supreme Court. And so, the president, actually, got done in 12 months -- not even 12 months, faster than anybody else is doing it. But to answer your question, Republicans did have two shots at reconciliation where they only had to get to the 50 vote threshold. They missed that opportunity, and they could have tackled each of this individually. But nevertheless, now here we are coming on Christmas, a huge victory. And nobody but nobody should have to justify and, quote, pay for, allowing the American people to keep their own money in their own wallet. The fundamental problem that the Democrats is they sold Obamacare on a lie. Keep your doctor. Save $2500. That turned out to not be true. When you tell the American people you're going to get to keep your own money, that's actually what's going to happen. And that will make a fundamental difference."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. To me, there's so many invitations now that Republicans, even on this day of celebration, are setting themselves up for, I guess, what some people would call a tidal wave election. I think it's going to be 2018, a tsunami. What we see now in the Wall Street Journal poll is that Democrats have an 11-point preference in terms of who controls congress. But the most stunning number out in the Wall Street Journal this morning is now the case that Democrats are seen by the American people as better able to handle the economy than Republicans. That's how damaging this bill is."
    },

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "It really has been a bad year for Trump when you think about this tax bill, and you think about the judges, and you think about the new energy policy, and you think about ISIS, deregulation. Imagine what a good year would be. I mean, I don't know if we can handle a good year. If this is a bad year for Trump, a good year, we might all have heart attacks."

I mean, I think for the sanity of people like Rosie O'Donnell, before they completely implode and end up being incarcerated against their will. You have to admit that this is an effective consequential phenomenon. It's an effective presidency even if you don't like it. You have to admit because or else you're going to go crazy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I also have to think it's an effective presidency because you have cooperative Republicans on the house and senate side. When you think about Obama's first year, so he had the majorities of Democrats in both the house and senate, and they were able to do his signature achievement which was Obamacare which ended up becoming the albatross around their neck. I don't think tax reform is going to be that way for Republicans."

If we don't have tax reform after the failure of Obamacare repeal, it will be devastating for the party. We will go into 2018 and we will be shellacked. Republicans will say you didn't deliver. That's what drove this in seven weeks. All of sudden, everybody had to get on board, bite your tongue. Don't say it's a bad bill. Don't say we have good ideas. Don't say all the money is going to the rich and the big corporations."

Upon hearing this, the Trump administration has decided to cancel the move. I kid. U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley tweeted this, \"At the U.N. we're always asked to do more and give more. So when we make a decision at the will of the American people about where to locate our embassy, we don't expect those we've helped to target us. On Thursday, there'll be a vote criticizing our choice. The U.S. will be taking names. \""

      "utterance": "Taking names. You got to love that. It's politics meets \"The Godfather.\" I'm shaking. So, Haley shows us what American foreign policy looks like with a spine. For so long we've endured a relationship with the U.N. that verges on spousal abuse. No matter what we do -- save lives, help those in need, trying to pull violent countries out of their own deadly chaos -- the U.N. then kicks us in the teeth. It's nice to see Haley hit first and hard to counter the coming petulant whine, and whine they will. After all, it's our embassy, not theirs. So shut up, you ungrateful brats. And I hope we do take names and make these double parking dip wads pay. They're always double parking. So the good news for America, there isn't just a new sheriff in town but a new contagious sentiment, one that mixes no B.S. bluntness with a disgust for what went on in the past. The new boss is definitely not the old boss, and now the U.N. must deal with it, not the other way around. Amen. Thanks, Greg. You're welcome. So this is a letter, I think it's Haley's letter to delegations."

Juan, I guess America doesn't want more of Hillary Clinton.

She might think it's because she takes tough stances on issues or something. And she did the book. I think she wanted to try to be the first to write history. And she's probably made a lot of money on the book. But the fact that you -- then you're out there, reminding people about your loss and why you lost, I do think that that adds into it. If you're at a 36 percent approval rating, that means it's not just Republicans disapproving. It's also Democrats, who are frustrated; and they probably do want to move on.
