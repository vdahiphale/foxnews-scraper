In the last 30 years, the top 1 percent has seen an increase in the wealth of $21 trillion, while the bottom half of America has seen an actual decline in their wealth of some $800 billion. In other words, we have an economy today that is working phenomenally well for the top 1 percent, while the working class of this country is being decimated. Meanwhile, it seems to me, that if we’re going to bring about real change in this country, that means health care to all people, raising the minimum wage to a living wage. Making sure that all of our young people can afford to go to college, dealing with climate change, dealing with criminal justice reform. We need a fundamental change. We need a political revolution. We need millions of people, working class people, whose lives have been decimated for the last 45 years to stand up to Wall Street, to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies.

Meanwhile, massive demonstrations in Hong Kong, even though its Beijing- backed chief executive suspended a controversial bill.

These were attacks by the Islamic Republic of Iran on commercial shipping on the freedom of navigation with the clear intent to deny transit through the strait. This was on the Gulf of Oman side of the Strait of Hormuz. There's no doubt the intelligence committee has lots of data, lots of evidence, the world will come to see much of it, but the American people should rest assured we have high confidence with respect to who conducted these attacks, as well as half a dozen other attacks throughout the world over the past 40 days."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But Iran and its surrogates, as you noted, have responded to the maximum pressure campaign with more aggression, not less. Attacking tankers, firing missiles in Iraq and into Saudi Arabia and targeting U.S. drones in Yemen and the Persian Gulf. Question, Mr. Secretary, what's the administration going to do about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Well, remember, Chris, where we took over. We took over from an administration that allowed Iran to create enormous wealth, build their missile program, a clear pathway to a nuclear weapon system. This is where the Trump administration came in. So, we wisely withdrew from the JCPOA and put in place an economic pressure campaign, one that continues. We had a ban on a number of petrochemical companies just this past week. President Trump has done everything he can to avoid -- we don't want a war. We've done what we can to deter this. The Iranians should understand very clearly that we will continue to take actions that deter Iran from engaging in this behind some kind of behavior. I made a number of calls to my colleagues around the world yesterday. I am confident we will have partners that understand this threat. You have to remember, Chris, too, very little of our crude oil comes to the gulf these days. China is relying for over 80 percent of its crude, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, these countries are very dependent on freedom of navigation throughout these straits and I'm confident that when they see the risk -- the risk of their own economies and their own people and outrageous behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran, they will join us in this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I want to pursue this question of -- you say perhaps more action and perhaps more international action. The Pentagon is reportedly considering sending as many as 6,000 more troops to the area along with warships, warplanes, submarines. There's also been talk about an international coalition to escort commercial ships through the Strait of Hormuz. Are those on the table, and I guess basically, how far is President Trump prepared to go?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Chris, President Trump has been unambiguous, Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. That's the goal, that's the objective of our entire campaign with respect to Iran and to create stability throughout the Middle East as part of that effort. I don't want to talk about options that are out there, options that are not there. The president has made it very clear we're going to achieve this objective. We continually update options for the president. We've taken a handful of those actions to increase the opportunity to convince Iran that these actions aren't in their best interests and it appears to be Iran that wants to continue to escalate this conflict."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Chris, what you should assume is we are going to guarantee freedom of navigation throughout the strait. This is an international challenge. This is important to the entire globe. The United States is going to make sure that we take all the actions necessary -- diplomatic and otherwise -- that achieve that outcome."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Meanwhile, Congress -- and we're talking now both about Republicans and Democrats -- appears ready to block an emergency U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia, which, of course, is one of the major enemies of Iran. If they go ahead and do that, block the U.S. arms sale that the Trump administration wants, what message will that send to mullahs in Tehran?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Yes, it would be most unfortunate. I think the decision we made to move forward with these arm sales was the right decision, was an important decision. I think the events of this past week are another piece of that evidence. I think we have 40 years of history. But even these past 40 days demonstrate the malign activity that puts Saudis at risk. Remember, Chris, just this past week, was an Iranian-backed Houthi effort that flew a missile into an airport in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has the right to defend itself. The United States wants to support our important defense partner in the region. And I think, moving forward, these arms sales made enormous sense, and we are going to continue to push forward with them."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's turn to Hong Kong. The chief executive in Hong Kong appointed by Beijing has announced that she is suspending, not killing, but suspending a bill of extradition that would allow people in Hong Kong to be extradited to the Chinese mainland. The response for the people in Hong Kong and there was a massive protest again today, is to protest the measure, millions of citizens coming into the street. They say the measure would allow China to crack down on critics. You have spoken out against this measure, but President Trump has said nothing critical about it. He simply commented about the size of the demonstrations. Is he more concerned about maintaining his relationship with President Xi than he is in defending human rights?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "The president has always been a vigorous defender of human rights. He's going to get the opportunity, I think, to see President Xi in just a couple weeks now in Osaka, Japan, at the G20 Summit. I'm sure this will be among the issues that they discuss. We have a wide range of very important issues in the way China and United States interact for an awfully long time under a Republican, Democrat presidents, we allow China to take advantage of us on trade and in other ways. President Trump has pushed back very strongly against them. We see what's happening, what's unfolding in Hong Kong. We are watching the people of Hong Kong speak about the things they value. And we'll see what CEO Lam's decision is in the coming days and weeks ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's turn to another subject. There were reports this week that the CIA had turned the half-brother of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, into a CIA informant before he was murdered in February of 2017. President Trump seemed to tell Kim this week that that kind of thing wouldn't happen on his watch. Take a look."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "As the former head of the CIA, before you took this job, and some of these contacts with Kim Jong Nam reportedly happened on your watch, is there something wrong with the U.S. spying on North Korea and even using a family member to do so?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "I never comment on intelligence matters in any way, Chris. I think you had me on what I was the CIA director. I'm going to stay with that rule today. The American people should rest assured, the United States is taking all the actions that it needs to take to make sure we understand the risks and the threats that are posed by North Korea. And now, in my current role, I'm working to achieve a diplomatic outcome that gets the nuclear weapons out of the hands of North Korea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Just at the risk of pressing this, I understand you're not going to say what you're doing, but the president seemed to imply that there were some kinds of spying on North Korea, as he said, that would not happen under his auspices. And I think a lot of people are asking, why not?"

The U.S. is reporting today that the U.S. has increased digital incursions into the electrical grid of Russia in effect to send a warning. You do cyber attacks on us, we can respond and we can mess up your infrastructure. President Trump called this report in \"The New York Times,\" and I want to get his quote right: a virtual act of treason.

They called out by name and office of the work for me, clandestine officer that worked for me. It was outrageous. It was deeply inconsistent with American values and it was unnecessary. It was a throw away. It didn't add to the story line one iota and yet they chose to do that. I've seen the story this morning. I don't have anything to say about the contents of that. I don't talk about intelligence matters. But President Trump has been crystal clear during my now two and a half years with the administration -- we are going to do everything we can prevent any country from interfering in any election in the United States of America. We'll continue to work hard of that. I'm proud of the work this administration does. I only wish the previous administration had done the same."

I think, frankly, I am the strongest candidate to defeat Trump. I think we can win in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan and some of the other battleground states, and that's a fight that I look forward to."

      "utterance": "You seem to be competing most directly, perhaps on the left side of the Democratic race with Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, and in a new CBS News poll out today of 18 battleground states, she actually leads you by one point in those 18 states, obviously within the margin of error. She says that she supports capitalism and she supports markets, but she wants them more tightly regulated. Why do you think that you're a better choice for voters than Senator Warren with that approach?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "Well, Senator Warren is a friend of mine and she's a great senator, but let me just give you my perspective. Chris, according to Federal Reserve data, the average worker in America today, despite a huge increase in productivity and technology, is earning exactly the same wages that he or she earned 45 years ago. In the last 30 years, the top 1 percent has seen an increase in the wealth of $21 trillion, while the bottom half of America has seen an actual decline in their wealth of some $800 billion. In other words, we have an economy today that is working phenomenally well for the top 1 percent, while the working class of this country is being decimated. Meanwhile, it seems to me, that if we’re going to bring about real change in this country, that means health care to all people, raising the minimum wage to a living wage. Making sure that all of our young people can afford to go to college, dealing with climate change, dealing with criminal justice reform. We need a fundamental change. We need a political revolution. We need millions of people, working class people, whose lives have been decimated for the last 45 years to stand up to Wall Street, to stand up to the insurance companies and the drug companies. A political revolution. That is what I believe in."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But critics, sir, say that you’re defining down democratic socialism to make it more palatable to voters. They say that it isn't just new social programs, you listed some and you're going to get into them in the moment, it's actually a dramatic change and a transfer of economic power to the people, is that true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "Well, it means to say that we have to break up the large financial institutions on Wall Street, who have unbelievable economic power. It means that we have to stand up to the drug companies who are or charging us twice as much for the medicine that we need compared to other countries. It means that we have to stand up to the insurance companies and move to a Medicare-for-All, single-payer system. We have to stand up to the military-industrial complex where there's enormous fraud and waste within the Pentagon. So, it does mean, Chris -- I think, you know, what you said is basically true, right now, real power -- most people understand this -- rests with a handful of large corporations and very wealthy individuals. And the time is now for us to say, you know what, we need an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent. And if people want to accuse me of believing in that, I plead guilty. Yes, that's what I believe. I believe in a vibrant democracy where ordinary people get a fair shake rather than just the 1 percent getting it all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But -- sir, let me drill down on that, because here's what Maria Svart, the executive director of the Democratic Socialist for America told \"The New York Times\" last year. Our ultimate goal really is for working people to run our society and run our workplaces and our economies. And back in the '70s, you seem to agree. Here's a quote from you: I favor the public ownership of utilities, banks, and major industries. Senator, do you still believe that in the public ownership of major industries?"

A lot of electric departments all over this country are publicly owned. Do I believe that workers should have more say and be sitting on the boards of large corporations? Yes, I do. Do I believe that we should break up some of the major banks on Wall Street and support credit unions and community banks? Yes, I do. So, I think really one of the things we have to look at is the fact that power in this country rests with just a handful of people. You've got six financial institutions that have assets equivalent to 54 percent of the GDP. Six institutions control the flow of trillions of dollars. When we talk about democracy, it means not just voting every two years, is giving working people more of a say in what goes on in the economy."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's take a look at perhaps your biggest proposal -- and you have a number of proposals -- Medicare-for-All. And let's put up some of the details. Half of Americans, 156 million people get their health insurance through their employer. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 68 percent of them give their health plan a grade of A or B. So I guess the question is, why take away a system that millions of Americans like?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, every single year tens of millions of people move from one plan to the other plan. Second of all, what we are talking about, despite a lot of misinformation coming from the insurance companies and the drug companies is allowing all of the American people to continue to go to the doctor that you want to go to. Go to the hospital that you want to go to. And, in fact, under a Medicare-for-All, single-payer system, we expand Medicare for seniors to include dental clear -- dental care, hearing aids and vision care, eyeglasses. So, we expand Medicare. But right now, Chris, you have a dysfunctional health care system. You've got 70 million Americans who either have no health insurance or they are under insured with high deductibles and copayments. We are paying twice as much as any other country on earth for the prescription drugs that we need. We spend far more per capita on health care as do the people of any other country. Medicare, as you know, is the most popular health insurance program in the country right now. But it only applies to people 65 or older. What I want to do is over a four-year period, expand Medicare to every man, woman and child in this country. It will save the average person significant sums of money and provide comprehensive care. We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all people and that has got to change."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",

That sounds like a lot of money, but do know what happens if we keep the current system, which is the most wasteful and expensive system in the world over a 10-year period? Their estimates of the cost will be $50 trillion. So the health care costs go up, everybody shows that Medicare-for-All will be less expensive than continuing the current dysfunctional health care system."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "Look, Medicare itself is health insurance program, it's far, far more popular than our private insurance companies. People don't like insurance companies, they like their doctors and they like their hospitals. And we maintain that. And right now, Chris, as you know if you're in one plan, it may cost you a fortune to go to the doctor you want if he or she is not in the same plan. We do away with that. We give people complete freedom of choice as to the doctor that they want to go to or the hospital they want to go to. They will save money. We will join every other major country on earth in guaranteeing health care to all. We will cut prescription drug costs in half. I think that's a pretty good deal."

Well, the new Fox poll has some interesting numbers on this subject, and let's put them up on the screen. A record -- and this is pretty surprising, 50 percent now think the Trump campaign actually coordinated with the Russians in 2016. That's higher than a year ago and it's higher than this March, just before release of the Mueller report cleared the president of collusion. Guy, it was pretty clear to me that Secretary Pompeo was not especially appreciative of my asking him about its -- what it seems to me as an inescapably big story.

As for the poll that you just put on the screen, with 50 percent of Americans believing now that there was coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, I just want to read for the record from the Mueller report, the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."

RICH LOWRY, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": So, a couple things. One, you're for the information that the Trump campaign got being from -- from ill-gotten sources, but there was no information. They had the meeting and it came to absolutely nothing. And the dossier clearly missed cued the FBI and the media from the very beginning based on information from shadowy Russian sources that there was some deep conspiracy here that there wasn't. Now, I think Trump's answer was bad, but the reason he gave it, I believe, is that he just doesn't want to admit that Don Junior made a mistake in taking this meeting. And the idea than anyone from the Trump campaign, after three years of investigation and criminal exposure for Don Junior supposedly is going to take a call from Russia or China and say, yes, I'm going to do that meeting is completely absurd."

And you also have to consider that United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia are involved in wars against Iran with surrogates in places like Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, go on. That's why this is so dangerous.

      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "So the CBO is only going to score something over a 10-year period. They haven't gotten the score in and, you know, my guess -- and -- and most people are guessing $10 billion to $12 billion is going to be the figure that -- that comes through. But, remember, that's over a 10-year period. And then extending it past that -- the VCF part of this is going to get smaller and smaller because even for the first 11 -- the first responders of the 9/11 community, the average age now is in the 50s, where it was, you know, 36, 37 on 9/11. So, you know, if you're looking for a sunset clause on this bill in terms of funding, it's there. The sunset clause is death. And so many of these individuals are -- are sick and dying that, you know, when we talk about just extending it through 2090 to go along with the health care fund, that's just to ensure that none of these men and women ever have to come down and hat in hand beg for this kind of thing again. But, realistically, the money for these funds will slowly diminish. Not necessarily the health care portion, but the VCF portion will get smaller."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's talk practical politics, because that's, of course, in the end, what this is all about. It's very likely that the House is going to pass the full bill that you want, extending the program through the lives of these people."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "That a certain someone, by which it appeared that you meant Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, cannot be allowed to use this as a, quote, political football, in negotiations on other spending bills. Have you had problems with Senator McConnell?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "Ah, yes. I mean, not me personally, but in terms of getting the 9/11 bills past, Mitch McConnell has been the white whale of this since 2010. In 2010 -- you know, and this brings up something, because I think it's -- it's the cynicism that's displayed by Washington that also causes this situation to be so emotional. They asked Mitch McConnell about the testimony after it was done and he said, oh the, gosh -- I think he used the word gosh. Gosh, we haven't looked at that in a while, but we will look at it and I'm sure we'll deal with it as compassionately as we have in the past. But I want to make it clear that this has never been dealt with compassionately by Senator McConnell. He has always held out until the very last minute. And only then, under intense lobbying and public shaming, has he even deigned to move on it. This is not a Republican-Democrat issue. There are Republicans on the bill. We'd obviously like to have more of them. But Senator McConnell has seen fit to -- in 2010 he used it to make sure that the Bush tax cuts would be permanent. In 2015, he took it out of the transportation bill because he wanted to extract some promises on oil imports. And so in -- in this bill right now, in 2019, he's been aware of this -- we were told in August that this fund was running out of money and that people were going to have their awards slashed by 30, 50, up to 70 percent."

      "utterance": "First of all, some of the -- critics, and mostly Republican senators, say, one, that the -- that the fund should not be open-ended, and, two, they say, look, this should be handled by the states, not by the federal government. Briefly your response to that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEWART",
      "utterance": "OK, it should be open-ended because cancer doesn't have an expiration date on it and the gestation period of different illnesses goes along different words. The idea that this is a state issue, 9/11 was -- you know, it would be like after Pearl Harbor saying, you know what, we're not going to do anything for people in Pearl Harbor because that's a Hawaii issue. This was an attack on America. As I said in the meeting, they didn't shout \"death to Tribeca.\" And to try and push this off as a New York issue -- and I think they do that because they believe New York is reliably liberal and Democratic and it's not as important to them. Not all Republicans oppose this, but everyone who has opposed is a Republican. And it's unacceptable. And they've done it now for years. Senator McConnell -- Lindsey Graham is the one who's the head of Judiciary. He's the one who's going to be negotiating, whether it's five, ten years. We cannot make these individuals continue to live in the agonizing uncertainty of not knowing that these programs will be extended and that they will be able to move on with their lives. And it has to be done."

There's a tremendous amount of people down there doing great work with good will, but there is a very small, concentrated group of people at the top that have lost sight of what they're there for and how it looks to the outside world. You know, they criticized us for saying, you're so upset that it's an empty Congress, but this is just a subcommittee. We knew it was a subcommittee, and they said 12 out of the 14 people were there the whole time, but they weren't. You get marked as present on the subcommittee showing up for just a minute. When Lou Alvarez was speaking, when Michael Connell was speaking, there was only six members out of 14. Seven members out of 14. That's a failing grade and that shouldn't happen."
