      "sentences": "Thank you, Bill. Well, super worries on this Super Tuesday, not over how voting is going, but how this virus is spreading. And now even a huge half-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve cannot contain the selling.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  And stocks plummeting, as interest rates hit record lows, the yield on a 10-year treasury falling below 1 percent for the first time ever. Here's why that might not have any big effect, though.  There are now nine confirmed deaths from the coronavirus in Washington state. That's up from six just yesterday, and a second patient is now being treated in New York City. So, no matter how low interest rates go, this thing is far more worrisome because we don't know how high it goes. We have got you covered with FOX Business' Deirdre Bolton on investors bailing, Bryan Llenas in New York City, where virus fears are growing, and John Roberts at the White House, from where the president will soon be speaking.  We begin with Deirdre -- Deirdre.",

      "sentences": "Yes, hey, Neil.  The Fed, to your point, doesn't have a vaccine against the coronavirus. And that is essentially what sent the stock market into a freefall, closing lower, you can see on your screens, more than 3 percent, more than 800 points lower.   As you just alluded to, Neil, this is the first time that the Fed cut rates in between scheduled meetings since 2008. We know what kind of environment that was, of course, during the credit crisis. So this really stood out to investors, and essentially had the opposite effect. In many ways, it made investors more fearful. Take a look at the groups that really put the most pressure on the markets. I'm going to read off my notes here. So you had financial, technology, energy stocks. Those were the ones that sold off the most. And, keep in mind, a lot of those are really areas where investors tend to bet on future growth. So, the idea, of course, is that the coronavirus is going to slow the global economy. At least, that was the sentiment that guided trade today.   If you look at the 10-year, you had an historic low for that yield. It closed down, that 10-year, below 1 percent for the first time ever. This often happens when investors don't know what else to do with their money. They bet on the safety and the sanctity of the U.S. government's. And if that is not sound, the implication is, we all have bigger problems. Now, we know that the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, said he hoped that the rate cut would provide a meaningful boost to the economy. We also know that President Trump would like more cuts. In fact, the president, of course, calling for more rate cuts even before the coronavirus outbreak. Here's the president.",

And what happened is that, literally, within a period of a couple of days, we were able to stick it in. And now, as I said, we're going to go into a phase one trial in about three months from that day -- well, we're probably a month or so -- I mean, I don't want to over promise. I said a month and a half the other day; it may be about a month or so. And then very soon, we'll be sticking the first person with the vaccine. But I want to caution everybody: That's only the first stage of the development of the vaccine because we emphasized to the President that since we'll be giving the vaccine to normal, healthy people, that safety is very important and you really need to know that it actually works.

So, within a reasonable period of time, you're going to know if it works or not.  So, right now, as of like today, there are two large trials going on in China that are comparing one of the drugs -- and there are several -- one called remdesivir with the standard of care alone. And when we get those results -- which likely will be several months because you're going to have to accumulate hundreds of patients to decide. We have our own trial right now in the United States with some people at the University of Nebraska who are infected and put there.

Let's go to Jackie DeAngelis, following all this closely, Stanford School of Business lecturer Dave Dodson, and The Wall Street Journal's John Bussey.

So you had the Fed rate cut today. It was interesting, Neil, that they're getting really out trying -- they're trying to get out ahead of this. I mean, they're trying to act before that they did in the 2008 crisis. They're trying to signal to the markets that they're there. On the other hand, there's not much they can do. There's not a lot further that the Fed can cut. And that holds true for international central banks as well. Greg Ip has a story on WSJ.com right now that says that how much an exogenous event like a coronavirus can hurt the economy, it was only half of a percentage point in the 1918 Spanish flu, about the same in 1957 and '67, when there were bad flus. But that was before an integrated supply chain globally. And that could have an unpredictable effect on companies and earnings. And I think that's what the Fed was thinking about today.",

But the -- but the markets are smart enough to know that we can't just keep hitting a button every time something goes wrong and says, well, the Fed is going to move the interest rates up or down and our world's going to get better. In 2008, that was a financial crisis. We had liquidity issues. We had banking issues. And that was a great place for the Fed to enter. But this - - people have a fever now, and you don't fix a fever by dropping interest rates. In what world is someone now going to go on vacation because the Fed dropped the interest rate? Or in what world is someone who was going to have a business trip tomorrow canceled are they going to do that business trip? That's not how you solve this problem.

We were starting to pause and say, yes, the coronavirus is serious, but measures are being taken to get through it. Everybody needs to just take a deep breath with this. Today, when you see the Fed acting in this way, it's almost an alarm bell for the market. And that's why it's sold off 785 points, because, to the previous points, you can solve a liquidity crisis with interest rate cuts, but the consumer is in charge here. If the consumer gets scared, isn't going out, isn't shopping, isn't traveling, isn't doing all of those things, you're not really going to be able to stem the damage that occurs, that comes to the economy. And that's what everyone's worried about.

That's why we saw the fluctuations yesterday and today, but, longer term, the market is looking at this and saying, look, we see the trajectories that happened in Korea and in China and in Italy. And the presumption is that it won't be any different in the United States, probably a safe bet. That's a concern, particularly when testing was -- there were problems with testing.

Now, let's keep in mind there's a little bit of a difference here. This woman happened to be from China, and she had -- or had gone through China, had been in Wuhan. And so she came over, and she was a part of the first cohort and then ended up in this facility. And then they thought she was negative and they let her out. The additional -- those that were released, the 100, they were from the cruise ship. And so they have been those who have not exhibited symptoms and that had been in a holding facility being observed. So they felt pretty confident that they were safe and that they were in a place where they could release them properly. But CDC needs to do a better job in making sure they're making good decisions, so they can keep people's confidence in what they're doing.

Nobody thought that Joe Biden would come back with the decisive victory that he had in South Carolina. And that really changes Michael Bloomberg's pitch to the Democratic Party. He jumped in the race to fill a void. Now that void is sort of filled by Joe Biden himself. And I just think when you're getting calls from your own advisers to drop out, which is what we're hearing from people inside of Bloomberg's campaign -- even his campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, apparently had a meeting where he urged him to drop out and put his support behind Biden -- that's problematic. Now, I know he's saying he's going to stay in the race. It's going to be tough for him to resist calls from people in his own team and on the outside to drop out, especially when his whole pitch to the party was, I'm doing this because no one else can win.",

You see him out on the campaign trail making the mistakes that he makes. He's the horse that they're betting on that seems to run the wrong direction around the track too frequently. But he's the guy and he's considered the moderate in the race. I mean, nobody's going to be able to outspend Michael Bloomberg.

And now even a huge half-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve cannot contain the selling. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And stocks plummeting, as interest rates hit record lows, the yield on a 10-year treasury falling below 1 percent for the first time ever. Here's why that might not have any big effect, though. There are now nine confirmed deaths from the coronavirus in Washington state. That's up from six just yesterday, and a second patient is now being treated in New York City. So, no matter how low interest rates go, this thing is far more worrisome because we don't know how high it goes. We have got you covered with FOX Business' Deirdre Bolton on investors bailing, Bryan Llenas in New York City, where virus fears are growing, and John Roberts at the White House, from where the president will soon be speaking. We begin with Deirdre -- Deirdre."

      "utterance": "Yes, hey, Neil. The Fed, to your point, doesn't have a vaccine against the coronavirus. And that is essentially what sent the stock market into a freefall, closing lower, you can see on your screens, more than 3 percent, more than 800 points lower. As you just alluded to, Neil, this is the first time that the Fed cut rates in between scheduled meetings since 2008. We know what kind of environment that was, of course, during the credit crisis. So this really stood out to investors, and essentially had the opposite effect. In many ways, it made investors more fearful. Take a look at the groups that really put the most pressure on the markets. I'm going to read off my notes here. So you had financial, technology, energy stocks. Those were the ones that sold off the most. And, keep in mind, a lot of those are really areas where investors tend to bet on future growth. So, the idea, of course, is that the coronavirus is going to slow the global economy. At least, that was the sentiment that guided trade today. If you look at the 10-year, you had an historic low for that yield. It closed down, that 10-year, below 1 percent for the first time ever. This often happens when investors don't know what else to do with their money. They bet on the safety and the sanctity of the U.S. government's. And if that is not sound, the implication is, we all have bigger problems. Now, we know that the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, said he hoped that the rate cut would provide a meaningful boost to the economy. We also know that President Trump would like more cuts. In fact, the president, of course, calling for more rate cuts even before the coronavirus outbreak. Here's the president."

If schools close, you got to think about child care. You want to make sure your prescription medicines are filled. You want to make sure you're practicing good hygiene, washing your hands, don't cough on people, cough into your cough pocket, your elbow.

So, we have been getting -- we have been learning with regard to how to handle patients.

So, within a reasonable period of time, you're going to know if it works or not. So, right now, as of like today, there are two large trials going on in China that are comparing one of the drugs -- and there are several -- one called remdesivir with the standard of care alone. And when we get those results -- which likely will be several months because you're going to have to accumulate hundreds of patients to decide. We have our own trial right now in the United States with some people at the University of Nebraska who are infected and put there. So once you get the result with the therapy -- unlike a vaccine, which takes quite a while -- once you get a result, you can start distributing the medication."

Biden is running a much more attribute-related campaign, having been a partner to Barack Obama, the most popular Democrat in America, and having led the country as vice president for eight years. So, you have an attribute candidate vs. an issues candidate, and Mike Bloomberg, the third person. The challenge for him is that he's the advertising candidate. Very few voters have actually met him. Very few have seen him in his town halls. They basically only see him either in the debates or in the ads.

We need a serious focus both on issues and on attributes, because both of them matter. And when candidates take those cheap shots, it encourages the voters to do it. And it discourages reasonable, legitimate, civil conversation. I say this for FOX News viewers, for CNN, for MSNBC, for those who watch networks and those who get their information from newspapers. We got to stop, that this coronavirus is serious, and it's much more serious than we realize. It's going to hit America very strongly. There's a reason why the stock market has gone down. And it's not just going to be about science and about health. It's going to affect the economy. It's going to affect travel and tourism. It's going to affect everything.

Biden's going to get his 15 percent all across the country. I think Bloomberg will get it in enough places. But Bernie Sanders is going to come out the clear leader. If the Democrats try to step in and take that nomination from him, even though he may not get a majority, I think there's going to be outrage among the Democratic Party.

The fact that they did it by half-a-point well before their meeting between meeting, something they haven't done since the financial meltdown back in 2008, did raise eyebrows. And the traditional view seems to be, what do they see that we don't? Let's go to Jackie DeAngelis, following all this closely, Stanford School of Business lecturer Dave Dodson, and The Wall Street Journal's John Bussey. John, I do think -- it's just my opinion -- that I think this finger- pointing and name-calling and dismissiveness, in the middle of something of this ilk does rattle folks, not just investors, but rattles folks. What do you think?"
    },

      "speaker": "JOHN BUSSEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Yes. And it -- I mean, nervousness and anxiousness, you're seeing that reflected in the stock market right now, because of the coronavirus and its effect on, ultimately, earnings, but, before that, supply chains, which are getting all bollixed up by this, the consumer, who's holding back on that vacation or travel, and then ultimately corporate earnings. So you had the Fed rate cut today. It was interesting, Neil, that they're getting really out trying -- they're trying to get out ahead of this. I mean, they're trying to act before that they did in the 2008 crisis. They're trying to signal to the markets that they're there. On the other hand, there's not much they can do. There's not a lot further that the Fed can cut. And that holds true for international central banks as well. Greg Ip has a story on WSJ.com right now that says that how much an exogenous event like a coronavirus can hurt the economy, it was only half of a percentage point in the 1918 Spanish flu, about the same in 1957 and '67, when there were bad flus. But that was before an integrated supply chain globally. And that could have an unpredictable effect on companies and earnings. And I think that's what the Fed was thinking about today."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

What did you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAVID DODSON, STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF BUSINESS",
      "utterance": "That's the point, right, isn't it? I mean, we have a situation where the Fed drops a half-a-point, big deal, in an emergency meeting. Hasn't been done since 2008. And it's ho-hum to the market. And the reason why that is, is, I think what the Fed did is, they said to the world, this is a big deal, and we should be worried about it. But the -- but the markets are smart enough to know that we can't just keep hitting a button every time something goes wrong and says, well, the Fed is going to move the interest rates up or down and our world's going to get better. In 2008, that was a financial crisis. We had liquidity issues. We had banking issues. And that was a great place for the Fed to enter. But this - - people have a fever now, and you don't fix a fever by dropping interest rates. In what world is someone now going to go on vacation because the Fed dropped the interest rate? Or in what world is someone who was going to have a business trip tomorrow canceled are they going to do that business trip? That's not how you solve this problem. And then, to make matters worse, in my opinion, Trump tweeted that it wasn't enough. And so how much signaling can we send to the economy that the economy is so fragile right now that, if the interest rates are anything above 1 percent, the growth is going to stop?"

Jackie, what worries me the most about this -- and I know a lot of people say, oh, you're making a big deal of politicians being politicians and pointing fingers at each other, names and all that. But, once again, much like we had during the financial crisis, it's like the whole civilized political world, if that's not an oxymoron, I don't know what is, is relying on the Federal Reserve to save the day. And to the professor's point, Jackie..."

      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I mean, these are two totally different circumstances. So, I think the initial market reaction today was the Pavlov's dogs kind of reaction, which is, the market goes up a little bit when you get a rate cut, and then it starts to digest it and say, hey, yesterday, we were up over 1,000 points. We were starting to pause and say, yes, the coronavirus is serious, but measures are being taken to get through it. Everybody needs to just take a deep breath with this. Today, when you see the Fed acting in this way, it's almost an alarm bell for the market. And that's why it's sold off 785 points, because, to the previous points, you can solve a liquidity crisis with interest rate cuts, but the consumer is in charge here. If the consumer gets scared, isn't going out, isn't shopping, isn't traveling, isn't doing all of those things, you're not really going to be able to stem the damage that occurs, that comes to the economy. And that's what everyone's worried about. It was Goldman Sachs and Citi last week saying that, if the coronavirus really does become this pandemic that people think it could become, you're going to see earnings growth wiped out for 2020. And that's the issue. Interest rate cuts really aren't going to help that."

So, whether the numerator or denominator changes or not, the fact of the matter, John Bussey, people generally don't trust what they're being told. They were told that it wasn't a problem here. Suddenly, it's a big problem here. They were told that it wouldn't spread much beyond Asia. It spread to better than 60 countries well beyond Asia. So they don't really trust anything or anyone. That's a very big differentiator."

      "utterance": "Yes, it's a difficult situation. Jay Powell said as much, that, look, my rate cut is not going to fix the supply chains that are getting very seriously disrupted by the virus. And your point is well taken. I think that the market is looking at this. It's buy on the rumor and sell on the news. That's why we saw the fluctuations yesterday and today, but, longer term, the market is looking at this and saying, look, we see the trajectories that happened in Korea and in China and in Italy. And the presumption is that it won't be any different in the United States, probably a safe bet. That's a concern, particularly when testing was -- there were problems with testing. The CDC didn't have a proper kit at the beginning. There's questions in the market about the preparedness of the United States for those trajectories when they do come to the United States."

These things are a little bit hard to predict, but we had between three and six minutes of alarm in the county. I do feel that that actually probably saved a lot of lives. Some of the areas that I have been in, people said that they heard it, they moved, they changed locations, they got their pets, they brought each other close. And it was a help. Now, other systems may in time get you more notice than that. But, a few years ago, Nashville had zero warning in this kind of event. And this ended up being three to six minutes."

The business districts that were hit, people were not living in those business districts. The airport that it hit, it was at night. There was nobody there.

      "speaker": "REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX)",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil. I have been digging into it. As a congressman who represents a good chunk of San Antonio, I have been in close contact with the mayor's office, with the county judge there, and with the city council, and trying to make sure that we're representing their interests to DHS, to HHS, to DOD and all those that are involved with all of this. And, look, I think the CDC made a mistake. I think they would acknowledge they made a mistake. They shouldn't have let this woman out. Now, let's keep in mind there's a little bit of a difference here. This woman happened to be from China, and she had -- or had gone through China, had been in Wuhan. And so she came over, and she was a part of the first cohort and then ended up in this facility. And then they thought she was negative and they let her out. The additional -- those that were released, the 100, they were from the cruise ship. And so they have been those who have not exhibited symptoms and that had been in a holding facility being observed. So they felt pretty confident that they were safe and that they were in a place where they could release them properly. But CDC needs to do a better job in making sure they're making good decisions, so they can keep people's confidence in what they're doing. But we have been pushing hard to make sure that Texas is being considered here, rather than the federal government just making decisions for us."

The president got a lot of grief for shutting down some of the airline traffic. And they have been making some good decisions to make sure we hold the line here, while we can keep doing research and our partners in Israel and our smart folks here, University of Texas in Austin, they're doing a lot of research to find a vaccine and make sure that we keep calm and remember that, if you wash your hands and do all our normal things, we should be fine."

But is it your sense here that we're told to calm down and everything's going to be OK -- we're up to these nine deaths now across country, largely in the Washington state area, I grant you. But that's why people get a little bit anxious, right, because they hear this, and they hear the stories, it's not a problem here, and we have got things buttoned here. Invariably, things are beyond a lot of people's control. I get that. But are we being a little bit too calm in that regard?"

It's like any other virus, flu and everything else, that we should be careful. However, it's really important that we treat these cases at the level of heightened scrutiny that they should be treated. That's why I have been beating up on CDC, HHS, DOD, to make sure they're doing the right things."

    {
      "speaker": "ROY",
      "utterance": "That's right. You have to plan for something. This is an illness like we deal with every year in terms of the sense of people getting exposed to it. But it's an illness we don't know that much about, right? The numbers in China are very troubling, but we don't get good information from China. But what I don't want to see is a House of Representatives or a Senate passed a bloated $8.5 billion bill because they're reacting, rather than doing responsible approach. The president sent up a $2.5 billion supplemental that at least gets some of the money from existing dollars. We're in appropriations season. And we can do it the right way. But, instead, they're going to send us another bloated bill. This is why we have $23.4 trillion of debt. It's because D.C. is going to do D.C. stuff. And so we want to make sure we're fighting to make sure the American people have what they need, go after the vaccine, but we shouldn't use it as an excuse for D.C. to do what it always does, which is, like Rahm Emanuel said, never let a good crisis go to waste."

Nobody thought that Joe Biden would come back with the decisive victory that he had in South Carolina. And that really changes Michael Bloomberg's pitch to the Democratic Party. He jumped in the race to fill a void. Now that void is sort of filled by Joe Biden himself. And I just think when you're getting calls from your own advisers to drop out, which is what we're hearing from people inside of Bloomberg's campaign -- even his campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, apparently had a meeting where he urged him to drop out and put his support behind Biden -- that's problematic. Now, I know he's saying he's going to stay in the race. It's going to be tough for him to resist calls from people in his own team and on the outside to drop out, especially when his whole pitch to the party was, I'm doing this because no one else can win."

They have decided to invest in Joe Biden. They're betting on him. And he's kind of a strange candidate to bet on for a number of reasons. He's not a particularly strong candidate. You see him out on the campaign trail making the mistakes that he makes. He's the horse that they're betting on that seems to run the wrong direction around the track too frequently. But he's the guy and he's considered the moderate in the race. I mean, nobody's going to be able to outspend Michael Bloomberg. That gives Bloomberg a tremendous amount of bargaining power if they get to a convention where nobody has a majority. But in the meantime, this is a Democratic Party in chaos, and I don't think today is going to offer any clarity to that."

He's saying, look, there's still a chance in a contested convention. But this is where money really talks for him. We already know that, privately, he's trying to court donors and Democrats behind the scenes, so maybe trying to get them to change their views on Joe Biden, maybe go to him, if there is a contested convention. Let's not forget, Bloomberg is somebody who has spent a lot of money on causes and politicians over the years, and I think he may be asking for a little payback, should he get to a contested convention. So that's where I think money could really play a role."

And, shortly after, we may finally get some much needed clarity into the state of the Democratic race. Will Bernie Sanders run away with this nomination and finally be able to head into the convention with a commanding delegate count? Or is Joe Biden going to begin to increase his delegate count and really become a serious threat to Bernie Sanders? And then, of course, what about Mike Bloomberg? He is making his debut on the ballot here in Virginia and in all of the other Super Tuesday states? Bloomberg has spent more time here in Virginia than any other candidate. This is actually the state where he held his very first campaign event. And he has poured millions and millions of advertising dollars into this state. But Joe Biden, he just picked up a critical endorsement from Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. Biden's hoping that Kaine will be able to do for him in Virginia what Congressman Clyburn just did for him in South Carolina. And, as for Bernie Sanders, he's simply looking to do better than he did in 2016, when he got beaten by Hillary Clinton by 30 points -- Neil."
