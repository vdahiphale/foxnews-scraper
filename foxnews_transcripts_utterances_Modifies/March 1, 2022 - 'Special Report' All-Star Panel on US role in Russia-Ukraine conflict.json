Russian oil is paying for cluster bombs that are killing children in Kyiv and Kharkiv and other cities throughout Ukraine. There is a direct line from Russian oil, the money that comes in, the invasions that is underway, the atrocities for which hopefully war crime trials will be held. And 57 percent of people asked by Quinnipiac in a new poll released today, has President Biden been too tough, not tough enough, or just right -- 57 percent said not tough enough. I think they think they are talking about the oil sanctions. We need to stop that oil. We need to do it yesterday. Hopefully he will announce it in the State of the Union.",

The U.S. NATO could likely destroy it. But that would be direct involvement against Russia and risk everything.

I think what we want is understanding, and I just go back to what we heard in the previous segment, that we're dealing with someone who appears to be erratic. The normal purpose, planning, perspective, that we associate with a calculating former KGB agent, Vladimir Putin, is absent. And I think he is trying to provoke some reaction from the United States, from even the NATO allies that would therefore allow him to justify taking more brutal action against the Ukraine. And I think in coming days, given the fact that his military does not -- is not having success, he's going to try ramp things up. And we have got to be in position to be patient, to use the high level intelligence we have had to preview and anticipate his moves rather than play into his hand and suddenly make us the topic of conversation rather than his villainy.",

If we're going to do sanctions, they need to be comprehensive and they need to be severe. And to spare the energy sector, which is the lifeline of Putin and Russia, doesn't make a lot of the sense here. You have got to go after the energy sector. Biden is concerned -- one of the reasons we are not doing this is out of domestic policy concerns of Joe Biden. He is worried that it will redound to energy prices here to U.S. where inflation is already at a 40 year high. He doesn't want to exacerbate that situation. But if Biden wants to tackle that, then stop the war on fossil fuels here in the U.S. Open up the drilling on federal lands. We are a large energy producer. Exploit that.
