His spokesman Andrew White is blaming a racist and sexist trial and a racist and sexist media. Sorry, Cosby was found guilty based on the evidence in the Andrea Constand case. And at the sentencing, he didn't utter a single word of remorse. MSNBC's Joy Reid has been sued for defamation by a California woman named Roslyn La Liberte, who was captured in a viral photo wearing a Make America Great Again hat in what looked like a heated debate with a teenaged boy. You see that moment and tweeted apology from Mrs. Reid said: \"It appears I got this wrong. My apologies for Mrs. La Liberte Reid and Joseph.\" Now, Reid has made no public comment, had retweeted that the woman had yelled at 14- year-old Joseph Luevanos and called him a dirty Mexican. In fact, Joseph was born in this country, says he appreciated their talk, and that everything was civil. And the video shows them hugging at the end. Why would Joy Reid who has apologized also for hateful postings a decade ago, make this baseless charge in the first place? That's it for this edition of \"MediaBuzz.\" I'm Howard Kurtz.

Mollie, what's your assessment of how the media covered Brett Kavanaugh's highly emotional testimony as opposed to how they covered Christine Ford's highly emotional testimony?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Well, just in general, I don't know if I have ever seen such a reprehensible performance by the media as they have done with this larger story. They have thrown away any devotion to facts in favor of emotion. You saw that from almost everyone who was covering this. They were talk about emotion. They weren't talking about actual facts, actual news. And it was very frustrating to watch, was very angering to watch, and it was as if they had just thrown off any semblance of objectivity."

      "utterance": "It was infuriating. It was disappointing. It is disappointing as a journalist. You expect -- you expect people who are in politics to play politics. Democrats to be one way, Republicans to be another. But for the media to align themselves so completely with Democratic Party politics here, it is frustrating and it's frustrating and it is just unacceptable and it should not be tolerated in any way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Susan, what I saw on the hearing day was a rough consensus during the breaks, that Christine Ford had been a credible witness and a sympathetic witness. But much more of a left-right split among not just commentators but journalists about Judge Kavanaugh and his account and his demeanor. So, for example, New York Times front page headline yesterday taking issue with the judge's tone. \"Diatribe by Nominee Threatens Neutrality of Court. Some Fear.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN FERRECHIO, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Well, that's because -- because he was going after the Democrats. No matter what you say about whether you're saying there was too much credence given to the testimony of Ford and whether he was too impassioned, what was unusual here was that he directly addressed the Democrats and he went back to the original confirmation hearing which he called as an embarrassment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And he talked about the revenge of the Clintons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "That's right. He gave them talking points on that front. So I have to say I agreed with that coverage because you did -- that was highly unusual, to have a Supreme Court nominee do that. But they leave out the fact that even on the Supreme Court now, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has come out against Donald Trump in the past. So it's not like the Supreme Court is completely devoid of politics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Marie, I've really been struck by a divide among many male commentators and female commentators in the way they view this. Just to read you a couple of headlines. National Review's Rich Lowry, the headline is, Judge Kavanaugh should be angry, because he's defending himself against charges that he says are completely bogus. Slate's Christina Cauterucci, Kavanaugh's anger made it easier than ever to picture him as an aggressive entitled teen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "I actually think that it's not just commentator members as (ph) woman who saw that anger that Judge Kavanaugh displayed differently. I think it was people around the country. I'm hearing from folks, friends on Facebook, people on social media. The other thing, Howie, that we're hearing are or that I really noticed about the coverage is can you imagine the coverage if this nominee who was crying and screaming and being very hysterical had been a woman?"
    },

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "This is precisely the kind of disgusting thing that I think is just --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "-- disgusting, Mollie. I'm a commentator, I'm not a journalist, and that's how I felt when I watched it. And can I just be very clear though, this hearing was actually not a hearing about facts. This was a hearing that was in large part emotion. We know most of the facts that came out. No new facts generally were introduced during the hearing because we didn't hear from people we hadn't heard from before like Mark Judge. We heard very emotional testimony on both sides. So the fact that the story focused on the emotion, like, I don't think it's fair for you to say my feelings watching the hearing were disgusting."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

In this country, we do have rule of law. We do have due process. And this is something that men and women care about. It is not something that only men care about. Women care about due process. We care about the men in our lives. We care if they are accused of something that we don't say, oh, it feels a certain way to me. We say what are the facts, what are the facts that support destroying this man's life, his name, his reputation, his honor that he spent decades building up? Now, in journalism, we care about facts, facts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me give you one more chance because Mollie brings up what I thought was extreme allegation by a far less credible accuser, we forget too in a moment about gang rapes in parties and so fort. Did that -- the other accusers money the lawyers, so Christine Ford looked like just one of several women who coordinated last-minute desperation campaign which is trying to take the judge down?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "I think in the coverage leading up to the hearing before we heard from Dr. Ford yet, the other allegation sort of made it a little more complicated. You're right, Howie. But I think on the hearing coverage because it was the first time we have heard from Dr. Ford and first time we've seen her other than photos from high school basically, I think that the coverage focused on the hearing actually was much more on Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh and less than I expected on this other allegations. I thought those would play more of a role in the hearing itself and in the coverage and it didn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Susan, I want to get you in on this, but I also want to talk about President Trump at that U.N. news conference. He acknowledged, he has been questioned by reporters, that his view of the Kavanaugh allegations is influenced by what he says are many false allegations against him in the sexual harassment area. And that seems to be a big thing for the press, you know, first of all, they asked the president about it, that he and the Republican Party, you bring up Roy Moore and cases like that, are insensitive to sexual misconduct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "-- by several women. That influences the way he thinks about it. Look at the fair points of view. It's kind of taboo. We never supposed to question the accuser. I think in whether there may be false allegations, I think that's not a good thing. I think --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You don't think that's being questioned this week in this heavily intense coverage? Does Christine Ford have one single person who can corroborate her accusations as hard felt and as upset as she was at that hearing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "I still feel like despite that, despite these gaps in her memory and inconsistencies that Rachel Mitchell, the prosecute, elevated during the discussion in the hearing, it still feels like taboo to bring up the fact that we have not looked at Ford's own credibility issues. And whether she has anything (p), we are not supposed to touch that, like, no, no, no, she is not the one who is trying to land a seat on the Supreme Court, but she is launching an allegation against someone who is. And I think there should be actually more focus on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Wait, Mollie, this is an important point about the coverage. The way we talk about those other witnesses and the language we use, some commentators who want to believe her are pointing out that they don't say it didn't happen, they say they have no memory of it. Kavanaugh's supporters who are saying they completely --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "The claim was that as an adult, she attended 10 gang rape parties where she saw under-aged people gang raped by Brett Kavanaugh. That is ludicrous on its space. Why compare it to the Pizzagate story where the media condemns people, whoever believe in Pizzagate. Here they were trafficking, promoting, putting this man on the airwaves so he can do this. This has real costs to people. It is so beneath the standards that we should have."
    },

      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",

His gang is Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Joe Manchin. The four of them are working together. He, among them, was a sole member of the Judiciary Committee.

GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS You write, after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorneys, she did become confident that it was him."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Right. Jane Mayer is someone who doesn't have a very good record for reporting on things. She has had problems in her past in how she has reported. Ronan Farrow had a really good reputation. By running this story which was based on a woman coming up, developing a new memory a couple of weeks ago that a lawyer helped her work on after she was reached out to by Senate Democrats, is just -- it is such a disservice. And it makes it look like his previous journalism might be in question if he thought that this was a good story, if he thought this was actually credible to run with it without any corroboration from anybody. And it weakened the overall case against Kavanaugh. I think she took at least plausible story in the first accuser and then each subsequent story has gotten more and more ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. I should say that Jane Mayer does have a long record as an investigative reporter. We can debate it at some other time. So, I went to publisher and here's why. You go to the story and there it is, a big flashing red light. Her memories contain gaps. She was drinking. Only after six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorneys that she felt confident enough to say this. But The New Yorker obviously under some time pressure did publish it."

I don't know what information the FBI thinks they are going to obtain or what the Democratic senators think the FBI's 302s are going to give them, but they will have no excuses after they have the opportunity to read those reports from the FBI not to support Judge Kavanaugh, unless they want to play strictly partisan politics, which is what this has -- this has evolved into."

So, look, I think this is the media trying to hone in on one thing and not looking at everything that the president said about this. And it's the president's decision to make sure the FBI was involved in this, so that they can clear Judge Kavanaugh of these charges or at least get to the bottom of it. And that's what this president has done. But you have to remember, everybody comes to situations with their own personal experience behind them. And to think it hasn't impacted him, knowing he has been accused of things similar in the past that we now know have no basis and no merit is of course weighing on him. That's why he moved forward with the FBI's investigation. And that's why he has done that at his request. And I think what you will find is that Judge Kavanaugh is going to have his final arbitration in front of the U.S. Senate where he'll be confirmed the next Justice of the Supreme Court."

So, overall, do you think the media have been more sympathetic to Christine Ford and her very emotional account before the Senate than to Brett Kavanaugh who also was very emotional, who some said came across as very angry?

And all of a sudden, USA Today says that he should be off the court until this is all resolved? Can you imagine for one second they said about -- that about Al Frank or some other Democrat? Of course not, that's a liberal bias the American people are sick of."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

So, now, we hear many pundits saying you know, look, Judge Kavanaugh is very likely to be convicted. But even if he is, they say, there is going to be a shadow over him on the court because of his -- what they say an angry performance. And it is going to hurt the Republican Party in the midterms because the GOP is associated -- will be responsible for putting Kavanaugh on the high court. Your thoughts."

His reputation, not just his, but his family's, has obviously been attacked. And the testimony that he provided, which I thought was the most compelling, was when he talked about his 10-year-old daughter asking for a prayer for Dr. Ford. That was so compelling. That should tell you about the character of this man who raised his children to do what the right thing to do is here. And I think Republicans or the Establishment Republicans, what they are well known to be, or the Trump Republicans are unified in their support saying we want to see Brett Kavanaugh confirmed. And that is driving them now. That's energizing them to show up in just over five weeks to show up on Election Day."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, it was very clear to me that he and his wife, they were understandably nervous and uptight about this. They obviously talked about you know the lines that he wanted to remember to say and to hammer home as anybody does when you know sort of going into a difficult situation like that. I felt he was simmering beneath the surface. And it was almost as if he had a cork in the top. But it was very clear there was a lot of emotion going on. And I think when we saw him coming to that hearing this week it was clear the cork had popped, and he was tired of sticking to any sort of talking points. And he knew how important it was for him to fully express himself. And I think -- and I think looking back on it, he probably looks back on Monday as you know sort of an enlightening experience in terms of how he needed to express himself if he really wanted to be convincing."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You could sense the tension underneath. Here is what everybody wants to know. Were you surprised when Judge Kavanaugh volunteered that he didn't have sexual intercourse until many years after high school."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, one of the most interesting things about that is that that came after -- I went through all three different allegations with him, the woman that we now know as Julie Swetnick, Debra Ramirez and also Dr. Ford. We didn't know her name at that point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But that allegation was out there already. And that was the point when I asked him about that, about the gang rape allegations, the train, him being in the hallway standing in line to participate in something like this. That was when he was extremely emotional and that launched him into this alibi essentially of saying that wasn't me. I would never do that. In fact, I never had sex all through high school and into many, many years after that. So, you know, that was the specific reference to that last allegation, which clearly, he thought it was so important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Since at the time that you sat down, we didn't know Julie Swetnick, we didn't know the details of what she was going to say in her statement, why did you decide to include that, because you knew it would be bubbling up afterwards?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know what, I didn't necessarily know it would bubble up afterwards. But it was well out there in the public domain and people were discussing it. And I wanted to give him an opportunity to respond to it. And I'm glad I did, because there was a name attached to it within 48 hours after that. You know, that was one -- that's one of the trickiest things obviously in covering these stories, because there are so many wild allegations out there. And we saw another allegation that came out of Rhode Island, which was then shot down by the person who presented it in the first place."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, we, as reporters, obviously have to very careful with these things. I put it out there, it was in the public domain, and I asked him to respond based on what we knew at the time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. You tried to get Kavanaugh to talk about the motivations of his accusers, The New Yorkers journalism and publishing the allegations, Deborah Ramirez, and he continually deflected it. Were you conscious of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Was it frustrating at all that he wouldn't go there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It was frustrating because I see -- you know, I could sense in him he was extremely frustrated about what he saw, the powers behind all of this. And it is clear if you're saying he said I didn't do any of these things. And he is looking at me saying, you know, I didn't do this. I said to him, where do you think this is coming from? What do you think is behind this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Logical question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And he said I don't know. But by the time -- between Monday and when we saw the hearing later in the week, he clearly had decided that there was no reason for him to hold back on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And just briefly, given you knew he had the only interview given the huge stakes with the Supreme Court seen in the balance, did you feel a lot of pressure?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, absolutely. And you know, as I said, we had put in a request for him some time ago. Supreme Court nominees do not do interviews. They speak -- they do interviews when they speak with senators on the Hill. And it was clearly a unique situation. And when they did --- you know, give us the go ahead that he wanted to sit down..."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I did feel a big responsibility to the public and also to him. And I felt it was very important to get those allegations out in front specifically as difficult as some of them were to talk about in front of him and his wife. But I felt it was important for the American public to watch his response to them and to start to gauge what they thought and see how they judge his responses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, the New York Times among others said you delivered a tough round of questions. Martha MacCallum, thanks so much for sitting down with us."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "President Trump had a lot to say about the media at the 80-minute U.N. news conference. Reporters such as CBS Weija Jiang, as I alluded to earlier, tried to personalize the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEIJA JIANG, CBS REPORTER",
      "utterance": "How are your personal experiences being accused by more than..."
    },

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I have been accused. I have been accused false accusations."

      "speaker": "JIANG",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Excuse me, I've been accused. And I was accused by I believe it was four women. You can check with Sean Hannity, you can check with Fox because they covered it very strongly. Excuse me, I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them and the mainstream media refused to put it on television. The next day, I picked up the papers, there wasn't one word about it. The next day, I watched ABC News, I watched NBC, I watched CBS. I didn't watch CNN, but next time I will watch. I watched everything. There wasn't one story other than Fox."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, CBS, ABC, and the New York Times and the Washington Post did report the following, although not always quickly in a big way. Attorney Lisa Bloom said she lined up hundreds of thousands of dollars from donors to potentially compensate four Trump accusers she was representing for relocation and security expenses, not to make up stories about him, also money wound up being returned. We found no reports on this by NBC or CNN. The president was clearly having a good time at the press. As you are seeing, he called on his biggest nemesis in the press corps, CNN Jim Acosta, and even had this to say about the failing New York Times."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "The Times, I think they are going to endorse me. I think that ABC -- well, Fox, I like Fox, I really do. But I think ABC, CBS, NBC, the Times, they are all going to endorse me, because if they don't, they will go out of business. Can you imagine if you didn't have me?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, first networks don't endorse candidates. Second, the Times is -- how shall I say this? It's extremely unlikely to take back Trump. And while they're not going out of business without him, the truth is he is boosting everyone's ratings and circulation. And one other presidential point about the Times' front page coverage of him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Now, I think I average about three or four a day, right. And the three or four, they're all negative. No matter what I do, they're negative. But you know what, that's OK. I still love the paper."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I have been telling you it's a love-hate relationship. This is what I've said in my book. As for the mockery over the president calling on a Kurdish reporter and calling him Mr. Kurd, calm down, he was kidding. And the reporter loved it. Still the come, a lawsuit against MSNBC's Joy Reid over a racial slur. And Bill Cosby behind bars, his spokesman is blaming the racist media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Bill Cosby is in state prison now, serving a 3- to 10-year sentence. And I don't feel a twinge of sympathy for him, even though I love his comedy while I was growing up, given all the women's lives he ruined. His spokesman Andrew White is blaming a racist and sexist trial and a racist and sexist media. Sorry, Cosby was found guilty based on the evidence in the Andrea Constand case. And at the sentencing, he didn't utter a single word of remorse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MSNBC's Joy Reid has been sued for defamation by a California woman named Roslyn La Liberte, who was captured in a viral photo wearing a Make America Great Again hat in what looked like a heated debate with a teenaged boy. You see that moment and tweeted apology from Mrs. Reid said",
      "utterance": "\"It appears I got this wrong. My apologies for Mrs. La Liberte Reid and Joseph.\" Now, Reid has made no public comment, had retweeted that the woman had yelled at 14- year-old Joseph Luevanos and called him a dirty Mexican. In fact, Joseph was born in this country, says he appreciated their talk, and that everything was civil. And the video shows them hugging at the end. Why would Joy Reid who has apologized also for hateful postings a decade ago, make this baseless charge in the first place? That's it for this edition of \"MediaBuzz.\" I'm Howard Kurtz.
