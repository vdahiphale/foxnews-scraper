What a show on tap for tonight. Kellyanne Conway, Anthony Scaramucci are both live, Candace Owens also, Patti Blagojevich, wife of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich joins me to talk about the big move President Trump is considering for her husband.  But first, as you know, if you are a regular \"Justice\" viewer. I do an opening statement at this time every Saturday, and more often than not, it's about whatever has got me fired up that week.  And this week I am fired up, I am angry, but I am even more confused. Confused as to why Congressman Trey Gowdy of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, one of the few people in Washington who has the intelligence, the expertise and the ability to see through the nonsense, if not illegality going on at the FBI and the Department of Justice. Trey Gowdy would say this about a spy placed in the Trump campaign.",

Number two, saying that the placing of a spy or a confidential human source as the big shots call it in the Trump campaign has nothing to do with Donald Trump is ridiculous. But instead of me taking on Trey Gowdy tonight in an opening statement, which I fully intended to do, I instead decided to get some insight into what may be his thinking from some of his closest colleagues.  So joining me now, Congressman Jim Jordan, Chairman Mark Meadows and Congressman Ron deSantis, all members of the Freedom Caucus and unrelenting voices in the fight for truth in this Russia probe, all on the Congressional -- the House Oversight and Reform Committee.   Now, I am going to start with you, Mark Meadows. Under no circumstances would anyone even think of placing a spy or as they want to call it, a confidential human source, someone who clearly has foreign intelligence capabilities in the campaign of a man running for President of the United States. It has never happened in the history of this country, but these guys did it. So why shouldn't I be furious and who do they think they are kidding?",

And what do have is a growing body of evidence that would suggest just the opposite of what my good friend, Trey Gowdy said, is indeed the FBI and DOJ did do things improperly.

He is too sophisticated. He is a prosecutor. He is in fact one of my heroes, I have got to tell you that. I always loved Trey Gowdy, but I don't know if he went to the dark side or what is going on here, so why would Trey Gowdy, who understands credibility, understands lying, understands a courtroom talk to Christopher Wray and Rod Rosenstein and say, \"I haven't seen the documents, but hey, I believe everything they are saying.\" That's hog wash.",

Instead, they chose to take taken aggressive posture vis-a-vis the entire campaign, and they continued that. They launched this massive counter-intelligence investigation based off of Papadopoulos saying something to Downer. And we now know Judge, when Downer reported that to US authorities, he didn't even mention e-mails. It was supposedly, \"Oh, the e-mails got hacked. He heard about e-mails.\" There was never a discussion about e- mails.  So, the start of this is as thin as you can possibly be, and I would also say there was more information or evidence that would require you to surveil Hillary's campaign than Trump's campaign.  I mean, look at the national security implications with the e-mails. Look at the Clinton Foundation.

I want my viewers, I want you to follow this. There is an Ambassador from Australia who invites a low-level fourth layer volunteer on the Trump campaign, they have a drink at a bar in the United Kingdom, all right, and then this kid supposedly says, \"Hey, you know, they've got dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russians.\"   Now, the problem with that is the guy who is the Ambassador from Australia, he was involved in $25 million from Australia going to the Clinton Foundation.

When we see this, all the evidence would suggest that the FBI and DOJ are not coming clean. Jim Jordan said this right. We are having to not only get documents but read those document and then find the evidence that they should have been forthcoming with. You know, it's not just about a judge, it's about the fact that there were redactions made or and over again.

The sheer volume and velocity t which this President does his work and progresses on behalf of the American people, Jeanine, very simply, we are more prosperous, we are more secure and our government is more accountable. Any one major achievement taken by itself would be enough in the first 500 days, but when you think of all them put together, ISIS is decimated. We are being respected in the world stage. This President's leadership has brought North Korea literally to the White House, literally to the negotiating table, the discussion table, and as the President said yesterday, a meeting will take place June 12the. South Korea and Japan have also been very helpful in getting that to happen. The jobs numbers -- the \"New York Times\" itself admitted yesterday, they ran out of ways to describe these jobs numbers. Meaning, they had exhausted all of the superlatives. Listen, America, if you are a man, if you are a woman, if you are a teenager, if you are African- American, if you are Asian, if you are Hispanic -- you have the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years if ever.  For only the seventh time since 1970, Jeanine, the unemployment rate is below 4%. The seventh time since 1970, think of that, in 48 years. That doesn't happen by coincidence. That happens by causation. And Jeanine, right up your alley, one-eighth of our US Circuit Court now includes a Trump judge. That's very important. Twenty one US circuit court judges, and of course, Justice Neil Gorsuch of the United States Supreme Court, so everywhere you look, there is Trump progress, the regulatory reductions, small business confidence, consumer confidence -- it's all around us. And those who deny it are just spitting into the wind as they always are, but who cares. We won't even pay attention.

And that letter from the President covered the entire waterfront, that it was North Korea who was sending the invitation, the United States accepted it, it looked like things weren't happening, that's fine, meeting cancelled. But the President -- and now it is back on. The President himself said, on Thursday on the record to the media that it may take more than one meeting. Jeanine, we had nearly 70 years of war. This President has been at it for seven weeks, seven months. He and Secretary of State Pompeo, in earnest on this issue. It's been a very short period of time, but people should stop cheering depending on who is involved and they should actually look at the substance of the issue, and that is why I have such faith in the American people. They see it.

This as he did pardon conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza.  Now, D'Souza says that he was singled out for prosecution by former President Obama's administration because of his conservative politics.

      "utterance": "Hello, and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight and thanks for once again making \"Justice\" number one all last weekend. Thank you. What a show on tap for tonight. Kellyanne Conway, Anthony Scaramucci are both live, Candace Owens also, Patti Blagojevich, wife of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich joins me to talk about the big move President Trump is considering for her husband. But first, as you know, if you are a regular \"Justice\" viewer. I do an opening statement at this time every Saturday, and more often than not, it's about whatever has got me fired up that week. And this week I am fired up, I am angry, but I am even more confused. Confused as to why Congressman Trey Gowdy of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, one of the few people in Washington who has the intelligence, the expertise and the ability to see through the nonsense, if not illegality going on at the FBI and the Department of Justice. Trey Gowdy would say this about a spy placed in the Trump campaign."

      "speaker": "REP. TREY GOWDY, R-S.C.",
      "utterance": "I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got, and it has nothing to do with Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "So, why was I stunned and why was I upset with that answer? Number one, Trey Gowdy knows he's not supposed to confirm or deny spy gate. Number two, saying that the placing of a spy or a confidential human source as the big shots call it in the Trump campaign has nothing to do with Donald Trump is ridiculous. But instead of me taking on Trey Gowdy tonight in an opening statement, which I fully intended to do, I instead decided to get some insight into what may be his thinking from some of his closest colleagues. So joining me now, Congressman Jim Jordan, Chairman Mark Meadows and Congressman Ron deSantis, all members of the Freedom Caucus and unrelenting voices in the fight for truth in this Russia probe, all on the Congressional -- the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Now, I am going to start with you, Mark Meadows. Under no circumstances would anyone even think of placing a spy or as they want to call it, a confidential human source, someone who clearly has foreign intelligence capabilities in the campaign of a man running for President of the United States. It has never happened in the history of this country, but these guys did it. So why shouldn't I be furious and who do they think they are kidding?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. MARK MEADOWS, R-NORTH CAROLINA",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge, you should be furious, and I can tell you that as we look at the evidence, and Jim and I and Ron have read thousands of pages as we look at this, you should be furious because whether it's spying on the Trump campaign or the Bernie Sanders campaign or any Presidential campaign, it's wrong. And what do have is a growing body of evidence that would suggest just the opposite of what my good friend, Trey Gowdy said, is indeed the FBI and DOJ did do things improperly. We know that indeed that there was informants within the Trump campaign prior to the FBI opening an investigation, so we have got to make sure that we get to the bottom of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

      "utterance": "No, they were not. They were spying on -- a term I don't particularly like -- but on what the Russians were doing, trying to understand were the Russians infiltrating and trying to gain access, trying to gain leverage and influence, which is what they do."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, so Jim Jordan, I think you know where I am going with this. Since when do we put spies in a Presidential campaign to find out what the Russians are doing? Why not intercept them on the way in unless you are trying to infiltrate the President's campaign?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO",
      "utterance": "And more importantly, Judge, why not tell the Trump campaign? Why not tell the candidate himself? Why not tell the guy who is now President of the United States, \"Hey, we think Russians are trying to infiltrate your campaign.\" Work with people in the periphery -- why not give them a briefing -- a defensive briefing. That didn't take place. So that to me is the fundamental reason and to say he doesn't like the term spy, what else can you call it? It wasn't an informant, it wasn't inside, it was someone from the outside contacting people associated with the Trump campaign to try to get information. If that's not a spy, I don't know what is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know what's interesting, Jim is that, I think it was Comey who said it's not a spy, a confidential source. But then, he never answers it, he just says there is a difference."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, Judge and the FBI and the DOJ want us to say, \"Oh, you can trust us now. We are giving you a briefing.\" They gave these guys a briefing last week, didn't show them any information to my understanding..."

      "utterance": "Well, that's where I am going."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Think about this, we have caught them hiding information from us in the past. They hid the fact that Peter Strzok and Judge Contreras were friends. To say, a FISA court judge Contreras, the same judge who heard Flynn's case. They tried to hide that from us, redacted that information when they gave us some of the Strzok-Page text messages, so now, they tell us, \"Don't worry, even though you caught us hiding information from us, don't worry, you can trust us now.\" Come on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know what's interesting, Congressman Jordan, is the fact that then Contreras is recused from the case, so clearly there was wrongdoing there like within a week. But I want to go to Congressman deSantis. Trey Gowdy makes this statement, which unfortunately reminds me of Clapper's statement basically saying, you know, \"I'm going to rely on Rod Rosenstein from the Department of Justice who has put Mueller in there after Mueller was taken to the head of the FBI and Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI, all right, he then says, \"Oh, I don't believe any of this was a problem, and my fellow Americans would want this to happen.\" The guy is too smart, Ron. He is too sophisticated. He is a prosecutor. He is in fact one of my heroes, I have got to tell you that. I always loved Trey Gowdy, but I don't know if he went to the dark side or what is going on here, so why would Trey Gowdy, who understands credibility, understands lying, understands a courtroom talk to Christopher Wray and Rod Rosenstein and say, \"I haven't seen the documents, but hey, I believe everything they are saying.\" That's hog wash."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLORIDA",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I mean, I disagree with his analysis and it goes to what Jim said, it is obviously, they should have just told candidate Trump that this was something they were concerned about. Instead, they chose to take taken aggressive posture vis-a-vis the entire campaign, and they continued that. They launched this massive counter-intelligence investigation based off of Papadopoulos saying something to Downer. And we now know Judge, when Downer reported that to US authorities, he didn't even mention e-mails. It was supposedly, \"Oh, the e-mails got hacked. He heard about e-mails.\" There was never a discussion about e- mails. So, the start of this is as thin as you can possibly be, and I would also say there was more information or evidence that would require you to surveil Hillary's campaign than Trump's campaign. I mean, look at the national security implications with the e-mails. Look at the Clinton Foundation. Look at the fact that they were paying a foreign national, Christopher Steele to collect dirt on candidate Donald Trump, and yet, they never took any aggressive action vis-a-vis Hillary, it's a big double standard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know what -- but we are going to go beyond double standard tonight, but I want to go back to Congressman Meadows. So, we are now supposed to take the word of the FBI and the Department of Justice when they started this investigation or the FBI did under the guise of it being a counter intelligence investigation. I want my viewers, I want you to follow this. There is an Ambassador from Australia who invites a low-level fourth layer volunteer on the Trump campaign, they have a drink at a bar in the United Kingdom, all right, and then this kid supposedly says, \"Hey, you know, they've got dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russians.\" Now, the problem with that is the guy who is the Ambassador from Australia, he was involved in $25 million from Australia going to the Clinton Foundation. So, let me just remind my viewers, the Ambassador from Australia, $25 million going to the Clinton Foundation is the guy who basically gets the information to say to the FBI, we've got to start a counter-intelligence investigation. That smells to high hell or heaven."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, it does smell. I think probably the other thing, Judge, is this. When we look at all of this, the collusion narrative is really more a collusion narrative with the Hillary Clinton campaign and Christopher Steele and some of the other contacts. When we see this, all the evidence would suggest that the FBI and DOJ are not coming clean. Jim Jordan said this right. We are having to not only get documents but read those document and then find the evidence that they should have been forthcoming with. You know, it's not just about a judge, it's about the fact that there were redactions made or and over again. It's the fact that Brennan, the CIA Director actually briefed Harry Reid on some of this very information with the knowledge of the White House and colluded with the FBI."

So Rod Rosenstein, the guy who appoint Mueller who is a friend of Comey to investigate the President of the United States, because Rosenstein convinced Sessions to back out. I mean, the whole thing if you throw in a movie on this, no one would believe it. He says that the House Committee Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that it is constitutionally obligated to have oversight over his own department, the Department of Justice is committing extortion. Because extortion -- that's a quote because you guys want the information that you are entitled to have. What say you? Whoever is next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it can't be extortion, Judge, when it's your constitutional duty. We have an obligation as a separate and equal branch of government to get the information, to get answers for the American people. I have the utmost respect for Trey Gowdy, but when he made the statement, the FBI behaved exactly like my fellow citizens would want them to behave, really? The FBI behaved appropriately when James Comey didn't tell the American people that the guy he leaked information through Daniel Richman was actually an employee of the FBI? Was Andy McCabe behaving appropriately when he lied three times under oath? Or Strzok and Page when they said all the terrible things they said about the President of the United States? Behaving appropriately? And when they took the dossier to the court and didn't tell the court who paid for it and (inaudible)."

They are a bunch of -- at the upper echelon -- they are a bunch of fosters right now trying to make you look like fools and trying to make this 2018 election get past them, so that they can say that the President is corrupt."

We should have done a long time ago, but we finally put -- we are going to depose -- pre-step, we are going to depose Steinbeck, other people the FBI and what we are pushing for is we need a deposition of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, so that needs to happen ASAP. It should have happened months ago, you are right, but let's do that and the President should in fact -- the three of us sent a letter to him, Judge. We have asked the President to give us the information we are entitled to see."

    {
      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, I could go through a long list, but I will just give you the highlights, that's the whole point isn't it? There is so much that has happened. The sheer volume and velocity t which this President does his work and progresses on behalf of the American people, Jeanine, very simply, we are more prosperous, we are more secure and our government is more accountable. Any one major achievement taken by itself would be enough in the first 500 days, but when you think of all them put together, ISIS is decimated. We are being respected in the world stage. This President's leadership has brought North Korea literally to the White House, literally to the negotiating table, the discussion table, and as the President said yesterday, a meeting will take place June 12the. South Korea and Japan have also been very helpful in getting that to happen. The jobs numbers -- the \"New York Times\" itself admitted yesterday, they ran out of ways to describe these jobs numbers. Meaning, they had exhausted all of the superlatives. Listen, America, if you are a man, if you are a woman, if you are a teenager, if you are African- American, if you are Asian, if you are Hispanic -- you have the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years if ever. For only the seventh time since 1970, Jeanine, the unemployment rate is below 4%. The seventh time since 1970, think of that, in 48 years. That doesn't happen by coincidence. That happens by causation. And Jeanine, right up your alley, one-eighth of our US Circuit Court now includes a Trump judge. That's very important. Twenty one US circuit court judges, and of course, Justice Neil Gorsuch of the United States Supreme Court, so everywhere you look, there is Trump progress, the regulatory reductions, small business confidence, consumer confidence -- it's all around us. And those who deny it are just spitting into the wind as they always are, but who cares. We won't even pay attention. He's there for the forgotten men and the forgotten women, not the cranks on cable TV who don't want to give him any credit."

Now that it's back on for June 12th, and you know, all the naysayers said, \"Oh, it will never be back on. It will never be back on.\" Americans have to say to themselves, this guy really does know what he's doing. He's bringing Kim Jong-un to the table. Yes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONWAY",
      "utterance": "Literally. And everyone should be happy about it. Jeanine, a denuclearized Korean peninsula is in everybody's interest. I don't know why the Democrats would cheer the lowering of the fortunes or the rising of the probability that maybe the meeting wouldn't happen. It is the President of the United States who sent that letter only ten days ago, only eight days before North Korea was here in Washington, DC trying to get to the next step for that June 12th summit to actually occur. And that letter from the President covered the entire waterfront, that it was North Korea who was sending the invitation, the United States accepted it, it looked like things weren't happening, that's fine, meeting cancelled. But the President -- and now it is back on. The President himself said, on Thursday on the record to the media that it may take more than one meeting. Jeanine, we had nearly 70 years of war. This President has been at it for seven weeks, seven months. He and Secretary of State Pompeo, in earnest on this issue. It's been a very short period of time, but people should stop cheering depending on who is involved and they should actually look at the substance of the issue, and that is why I have such faith in the American people. They see it. They know we are more prosperous, we are more secure and that's why we are calling Monday 500 days of American Greatness, any one of these accomplishments by itself would be plenty but all of them put together is 500 days of American greatness. And if people aren't going to get the message out, we will."

Now, D'Souza says that he was singled out for prosecution by former President Obama's administration because of his conservative politics.

I thought that the story that she was telling about her children was obviously, I am very sympathetic to her, but what happened there was the sort of the fire starter for what ultimately they ended up doing to candidate Trump and President Trump because they were getting away with so much latitude and prosecutorial overreach and basically weaponizing these agencies and using them as political instruments, to take out their enemies. And so, whether they were crimes like Dinesh D'Souza or the nonsense and factual incorrectness of the Blagojevich situation, they knew that they could put people in jail and make big splashes and really disrupt and subvert the rule of law. One of the things that the President is doing by putting out these pardons, he's basically sending a message to the American people that this nonsense is over. He is effectively resetting the fairness in the judicial process, Judge, and so, I'm super happy about that, particularly for the people I know that I know were treated unfairly."

But you know, here is the difference between what they did, what a lot of them did. Nobody gave donald Trump money to do this. And if you think about Bill Clinton pardoning Marc Rich after his wife gave him millions of dollars for whatever, maybe the Foundation -- the library, and he does it on his way out. This President has the fortitude or the chutzpah, let's say, to just do it and say, \"You know what? Come at me, I'll tell you why.\""

And by the way, I have absolutely no problem with him doing that, that is his constitutional right to do so. And so I am proud of the President's moves. It's once again the disrupter-in-chief doing the things that he thinks makes sense for the American people and is off the mark of that system that we now call the swamp, Judge. You know, you were talking about Trey Gowdy earlier in the show, I have an enormous amount of respect for Trey Gowdy, but what happens when you spend too much time in that system, you get some swamp juice on you. And so, he is saying things now, where he's parsing things in a way that Trey Gowdy, two or three years ago wouldn't be sounding the way he's sounding today on the way out."

Apologies accepted. No problem. We will issue a tweet and a statement. Somebody on the right that does the same thing, they want to hit the eject button like they did in the \"Austin Powers\" movie and flip people into the fire, and so they do that constantly. And it is upsetting, you know, Sean Hannity and I have actually debated this. He originally wasn't for boycotts. Now he is for boycotts, because unfortunately, if you don't fight fire with fire, Judge. Sean's position was in the beginning, I don't want anybody boycotted, I believe in free speech.

      "utterance": "Oh, yes, I think there is a double standard across the board. It's kind of -- not just Democratic and Republican, but it kind of -- a lot of people are hypocritic, they will say one thing and do another."

You never have to miss \"Justice.\" Set your DVR if you are not going to be home, plus get ready, my new book, \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy\" comes out in July, but it's my birthday today, so you can preorder it now on amazon.com and Barnes & Noble. To all those people I went to Israel with on United West, it was great being with you all. To Prime Minister Netanyahu, the only interview who gave an interview on the day of the opening of the embassy, it was a pleasure interviewing you. And I want to thank the Vanderhogans (ph) for opening their home to us when we were there. Thanks for watching, I'm Jeanine Pirro, advocating for truth, justice and the American way. \"The Greg Gutfeld Show\" is coming up and I'll see you next Saturday.
