In the world of progressivism, the act of caring about the powerless is often a way to enhance your own power. It's your moat against criticism, giving you a pass for derelict behavior. You can still flaunt your Louis Vuitton bag as long as your receipts are made of recyclable material. And if you say all the right liberal things, no one dares peek behind the curtain to call out your scams. Thank God for the Emmys. Right?  They should give themselves an award for best tone-deaf clown carnival. It's where our greatest Hollywood celebs went maskless Sunday to converge in an orgy of mutual masturbation.  But if anybody should be hiding their faces behind a mask, it's the self- absorbed sanctimonious sellouts. There was more integrity in a holding cell at Rikers. It's a prison U.S. coasters. To while your kids must wear masks in school and while you must wear masks at the gym, and while I must wear a mask in bed, has nothing to do with COVID, but everything to do with role-playing.   These recognition craving lemmings pack themselves together without a mask in sight. Well, except, of course, for the non-celebs, the assistants, the servers, and the press who all embraced the role of handmaidens to their famous superiors. They all look like extras from Eyes Wide Shut.  Speaking of handmaids, congrats to that show, which broke the record for most Emmy losses in history. Or should I say, her story? What a shame it had such a positive message. Yes, turns out, creating a dismal miserable mess of male loathing only works in women's studies classes.  My colonoscopy won more Emmys. To be fair, what a surprise ending. Four matchbox cars. I counted three at the time. But at least -- at least they were jokes.",

It turns out that the more sanctimonious judgments these bozos make to viewers, the fewer viewers they end up having because we see who they really are. Couple that with the gloom and doom content that's always trying to brand the consumer is evil, and you're left with an auditorium full of virtue signaling billionaire -- terrified that their personal scandals might finally be met with accountability. It's why Rose McGowan scares the -- out of them.   In some, award shows are like a mobster's trunk. They stink of death. And maybe that's why they help or wearing masks after all.

Now, aside from the buzzards circling above him, Biden is not the only one who enjoys the beach. Taliban terrorists snap these vaycay pics, trading in tanks for pedal boats at a lake that's popular with horny spring breakers. And we do mean horny since the bikini babes were all sheep. They remember -- they remember to pack sunscreen, speedos, and assault rifles, which you know was the original name for \"LIFE, LIBERTY, AND LEVINE\". What hopes with their new love of water can still be far behind for the Taliban. But back to Biden, according to Bob Woodward's new book, Peril, top aides have tried to shield him from long interviews and unscripted events. And by long, they mean anything that cuts into his putting time. They call the effect of cocooning of the president, which protects Biden from tough questions and children from being sniffed by Joe Biden. By the way, Cocoon was an 80s movie about old folks starring Wilford Brimley who was 26 younger than Joe Biden is now. I get a laugh. Meanwhile, the growing border crisis in Del Rio only worsens it. According to the polls, our country is as divided as Robert Shaw at the end of Jaws. Some unifier. No wonder even Biden's media defenders can't do their jobs.",

In the poll, 75 percent of black voters oppose reducing the police force compared to 51 percent of white voters. Now, this poll is significant because November voting ballots will include a measure on whether to give city officials the power to replace the police department with a new Department of Public Safety, which will make residents as safe as a doughnut rolling past Brian Stelter's office. Poor little donut, never had a chance. Turns out people don't want to replace the police either. And the same poll found a racial disparity there too. White -- while 51 percent of whites support replacing the police in giving the City Council have the authority to do so, just 42 percent of black voters support this same measure. Wow. That's the kind of talk that gets the media to call you the black face of white supremacy. In other words, a year after defund the police became a rallying cry in many cities, it's not black citizens who want to end the police, it's dumb woke white people.

      "utterance": "Happy Monday everyone. The greatest show on television. All right, they say that some pictures are worth a thousand words. Well, this one just won't shut the f-up. Wherever this dress worn by A-list socialist AOC at the ghoulish Met Gala where the master sauntered around maskless, while the servants impersonated the gimp from Pulp Fiction. There hasn't been a more stark contrast of the powerful and the plebes since I was on the daily show. Each tick -- a ticket costs $35 grand. Yes, real working-class event. Must feel great waiting on snobs who paid your yearly income for a night out. But the good news is they also think you're rife with disease, so you better keep the masks on. Tax the rich was the in-your-face maskless face message. I just screwed that up, but I don't care. It was the message to the rich, white libs who would like nothing more than for you to think that they agree. Which is why this message was about as edgy as the world's greatest grandpa coffee mug. But worse and not that surprising, the designer of AOC's dress happily ignores her own message. A New York Post exclusive portrays Aurora James as a notorious tax deadbeat with unpaid debts dogging her in multiple states. It's true, Wesley Snipes has a better reputation with the IRS than her. Dress as well. She has six IRS tax liens totaling 103,000 bucks on her parent company, and $17 grand fine for failing to carry workman's comp. That parent company sounds more like a deadbeat dad. She faces legal challenges for non-payment of worker benefits. The company currently owes $62 grand says The Post. $62 grand. Do you know you could buy with that type of moolah? Yes, two tickets to the Met Gala. Her company, culture its broker -- a cultural brokerage has been hit with more warrants than your average MS-13 gang member. 15 to be exact since 2015. That's at least 10 more than Kat. But to be fair, unlike Kat's, they don't involve puncturing a nightclub's bouncers' eardrum with a stiletto."

In the world of progressivism, the act of caring about the powerless is often a way to enhance your own power. It's your moat against criticism, giving you a pass for derelict behavior. You can still flaunt your Louis Vuitton bag as long as your receipts are made of recyclable material. And if you say all the right liberal things, no one dares peek behind the curtain to call out your scams. Thank God for the Emmys. Right? They should give themselves an award for best tone-deaf clown carnival. It's where our greatest Hollywood celebs went maskless Sunday to converge in an orgy of mutual masturbation. But if anybody should be hiding their faces behind a mask, it's the self- absorbed sanctimonious sellouts. There was more integrity in a holding cell at Rikers. It's a prison U.S. coasters. To while your kids must wear masks in school and while you must wear masks at the gym, and while I must wear a mask in bed, has nothing to do with COVID, but everything to do with role-playing. These recognition craving lemmings pack themselves together without a mask in sight. Well, except, of course, for the non-celebs, the assistants, the servers, and the press who all embraced the role of handmaidens to their famous superiors. They all look like extras from Eyes Wide Shut. Speaking of handmaids, congrats to that show, which broke the record for most Emmy losses in history. Or should I say, her story? What a shame it had such a positive message. Yes, turns out, creating a dismal miserable mess of male loathing only works in women's studies classes. My colonoscopy won more Emmys. To be fair, what a surprise ending. Four matchbox cars. I counted three at the time. But at least -- at least they were jokes."

This implosion of awards shows, what's happened because we're just more aware of their hypocrisies. It turns out that the more sanctimonious judgments these bozos make to viewers, the fewer viewers they end up having because we see who they really are. Couple that with the gloom and doom content that's always trying to brand the consumer is evil, and you're left with an auditorium full of virtue signaling billionaire -- terrified that their personal scandals might finally be met with accountability. It's why Rose McGowan scares the -- out of them. In some, award shows are like a mobster's trunk. They stink of death. And maybe that's why they help or wearing masks after all. Sadly, no mass can block the stench of hypocrisy, privilege, and clueless self-absorption. The only people who don't know what are the losers who keeps showing up thinking they are winners."

He enjoyed a beachside bike ride, ignoring reporters as he whizzed on by. He's just like Lance Armstrong, except there's no drugs that will enhance his performance. Thank you. Now, aside from the buzzards circling above him, Biden is not the only one who enjoys the beach. Taliban terrorists snap these vaycay pics, trading in tanks for pedal boats at a lake that's popular with horny spring breakers. And we do mean horny since the bikini babes were all sheep. They remember -- they remember to pack sunscreen, speedos, and assault rifles, which you know was the original name for \"LIFE, LIBERTY, AND LEVINE\". What hopes with their new love of water can still be far behind for the Taliban. But back to Biden, according to Bob Woodward's new book, Peril, top aides have tried to shield him from long interviews and unscripted events. And by long, they mean anything that cuts into his putting time. They call the effect of cocooning of the president, which protects Biden from tough questions and children from being sniffed by Joe Biden. By the way, Cocoon was an 80s movie about old folks starring Wilford Brimley who was 26 younger than Joe Biden is now. I get a laugh. Meanwhile, the growing border crisis in Del Rio only worsens it. According to the polls, our country is as divided as Robert Shaw at the end of Jaws. Some unifier. No wonder even Biden's media defenders can't do their jobs."

In the poll, 75 percent of black voters oppose reducing the police force compared to 51 percent of white voters. Now, this poll is significant because November voting ballots will include a measure on whether to give city officials the power to replace the police department with a new Department of Public Safety, which will make residents as safe as a doughnut rolling past Brian Stelter's office. Poor little donut, never had a chance. Turns out people don't want to replace the police either. And the same poll found a racial disparity there too. White -- while 51 percent of whites support replacing the police in giving the City Council have the authority to do so, just 42 percent of black voters support this same measure. Wow. That's the kind of talk that gets the media to call you the black face of white supremacy. In other words, a year after defund the police became a rallying cry in many cities, it's not black citizens who want to end the police, it's dumb woke white people.

Narrowing polls still show Beto down by five. But perhaps, Texas Democrats hope they can make up the difference with Californians fleeing to their states. Now, talk about bringing your bad ideas with you. What Californians who flee to Texas end up voting for Beto and he wins? Basically, they're electing the precise monstrosity that they're escaping from and punishing their new Texas neighbors. How absolutely stupid and wrong is that? That's like escaping an insane asylum only to recreate your own personal Loony Bin. Which is why all important California should be banned from voting for at least five years in Texas.

I guess I'll have to talk to Kilmeade about blasting Paul Abdul every time he picks me up for brunch. Speaking of Kilmeade, another new study shows that today's humans are actually more likely to mate with their cousins. More so than prehistoric ancestors were thousands of years ago.
