According to the new estimate, roughly 22 million people could lose insurance coverage over the next decade, and we'll have more on this coming up. Also this hour, we'll take you live to the Rose Garden where President Trump will soon be with Indian Prime Minister Modi, where there's been a lot of talk about boosting military cooperation between the U.S. and India. But first, the Supreme Court decided to partially reinstate President Trump's travel ban policy, and it will consider the case of the president's broad immigration powers this fall. The opinion today will impose the ban with the exception that it, quote, may not be enforced against foreign nationals who has a credible claim of bonafide relationship with a person or an entity in the United States.

I have always had a deep admiration for your country and for its people, and a profound appreciation for your rich culture, heritage and traditions. This summer India will celebrate the seventieth anniversary of its independence, and on behalf of the United States, I want to congratulate the Indian people on this magnificent milestone in the life of your very, very incredible nation. During my campaign, I pledged that, if elected, India would have a true real friend in the White House, and that is now exactly what you have, a true friend. The friendship between the United States and India is built on shared values, including our shared commitment to democracy. Not many people know it, but both American and the Indian constitutions begin with the same three very beautiful words: \"We, the people.\"  The prime minister and I both understand the crucial importance of those words, which helps to form the foundation of cooperation between our two countries. Relations between countries are strongest when they're devoted to the interests of the people we serve, and after our meetings today, I will say that the relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, has never been better. I'm proud to announce to the media, to the American people and to the Indian people that Prime Minister Modi and I are world leaders in social media. We're believers. Giving the citizens of our countries the opportunity to hear directly from their elected officials and for us to hear directly from them. I guess it's worked very well in both cases. I am thrilled to salute you, Prime Minister Modi, and the Indian people for all that you are accomplishing together. Your accomplishments have been vast. India has the fastest-growing economy in the world. We hope we're going to be catching you very soon in terms of percentage increase, I have to tell you that. We're working on it. In just two weeks, you will begin to implement the largest tax overhaul in your country's history. We're doing that also, by the way. Creating great new opportunities for your citizens. You have a big vision for improving infrastructure, and you are fighting government corruption, which is always a grave threat to democracy. Together our countries can help chart an optimistic path into the future, one that unleashes the power of new technology, new infrastructure and the enthusiasm and excitement of very hard-working and very dynamic people. I look forward to working with you, Mr. Prime Minister, to create jobs in our countries; to grow our economies; and to create a trading relationship that is fair and reciprocal. It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country. I was pleased to learn about an Indian airline's recent order of 100 new American planes, one of the largest orders of its kind, which will support thousands and thousands of American jobs.  We're also looking forward to exporting more American energy to India as your economy grows, including major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas which are right now being negotiated, and we will sign them. I'm trying to get the price up a little bit. To further our economic relationship, I'm excited to report that the prime minister has invited my daughter, Ivanka, to lead the U.S. delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India this fall, and I believe she has accepted. Finally, the security partnership between the United States and India is incredibly important. Both our nations have been struck by the evils of terrorism, and we are both determined to destroy terrorist organizations and the radical ideology that drives them. We will destroy radical Islamic terrorism. Our militaries are working every day to enhance cooperation between our military forces; and next month, they will join together with the Japanese navy to take part in the largest maritime exercise ever conducted in the vast Indian Ocean. I also thank the Indian people for their contributions to the effort in Afghanistan and for joining us in applying new sanctions against the North Korean regime. The North Korean regime is causing tremendous problems and is something that has to be dealt with and probably dealt with rapidly. Working together, I truly believe our two countries can set an example for many other nations; make great strides in defeating common threats; and make great progress in unleashing amazing prosperity and growth. Prime Minister Modi, thank you again for joining me today and for visiting our country and our wonderful White House and Oval Office. I enjoyed our very productive conversation this afternoon and look forward to its continuation tonight at dinner. The future of our partnership has never looked brighter. India and the United States will always be tied together in friendship and respect.  Prime Minister Modi, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

According to the new estimate, roughly 22 million people could lose insurance coverage over the next decade, and we'll have more on this coming up. Also this hour, we'll take you live to the Rose Garden where President Trump will soon be with Indian Prime Minister Modi, where there's been a lot of talk about boosting military cooperation between the U.S. and India. But first, the Supreme Court decided to partially reinstate President Trump's travel ban policy, and it will consider the case of the president's broad immigration powers this fall. The opinion today will impose the ban with the exception that it, quote, may not be enforced against foreign nationals who has a credible claim of bonafide relationship with a person or an entity in the United States.

And if you look at the exit polling, one fifth of the voters had said the Supreme Court was their number one issue. They vote for President Trump 57 to 40 percent, so this was a huge issue during the campaign. But in regard to the travel pause, this is a big win for President Trump."

Thank you guys both for being here. I want to start with you on this, Kris. Now Eric says he thinks this is a court moving far to the right. But this is a 9-0 Supreme Court decision. We don't see those all that often. So I'm just going give you my kind of bird's-eye view. I don't know if it's a conservative or right-leaning move by the court, as much as -- it's really a legal no-brainer that the president enjoys broad authority on these issues of immigration."

I mean the totally unprecedented arguments. And then on the statutory argument against the ban is a pretty weak one too, to the way the Supreme Court has traditionally interpreted those statutes to give the executive a lot of authority. So, I'm not surprised that it's 9-0. And the other thing I would point out is something some people haven't caught onto yet. The Supreme Court won't hear the case until October, and they won't decide the case until November at the earliest. So that 90 days is going to go, that full 120 days on the refugee ban is going to go or the pause."

We have about 30 major terror use the refugee program to stay in the country or get in to the country."

In addition to that, there're constitutional elements here, due process, equal protection and the establishment clause. But the bigger scheme of things is this. Let's just go back 65 years ago.

But then, you know, some of these places -- if the president can make the argument that this is truly a national security issue, then I don't think -- I agree with you, there's not very much challenge that's going to circumvent that. I think though what I see from this court -- tell me what you think about this prediction, the burden has shifted.

If you look for example at Syria, the previous administration had been granting 93 percent of Syrian refugee applications. This is at the same time that the Syrian so-called fake refugees who are going in and detonating bombs in Europe, and driving vehicles into people in Europe. So clearly 93 percent was a little too high. And so we have to figure out a way of separating out the true refugees from those who are claiming refugee status."

And then once they're here, they claim asylum and it's a very similar standard, a similar program, you get the same benefits of the refugee, and they too can just disappear into the fabric of the country when their asylum thing denied.

But in the meantime, just a short time ago, the congressional budget office released its score on the Senate health care bill. The CBO estimated that roughly 22 million more people could be without health insurance within the next decade. That's 1 million fewer uninsured than the house bill estimated. Many lawmakers were awaiting the score before making a final decision, but the bill could still face an uphill battle with a July 4th target looming.

So it is much more difficult task to get this passed in the Senate than it is in the house. And senators hold a lot of power. And we've already seen at least five different holdouts. They're all going to try to extract something from the conversations. There was a reason why majority leader Mitch McConnell released it as a discussion draft because he knew that there was going to have to be some give and take done. And I also think Republicans are looking at what happened from Democrats. You know I was at the NRCC during the 2010 election cycle where ObamaCare, they're studies that shows that it cost Democrats 5.8 percentage point at the polls, those who voted for ObamaCare, same thing in 2014, 2016, so it seems to be a big political issue for Democrats. So I think there's a lot of Republicans that are going to proceed with caution in weighing the different elements of this."

You haven't heard from the two ladies from Maine, or the one lady, actually, now from Maine, because Angus King, you know, is now replacing one of them, Susan Collins. But then we have to hear from Olympia Snowe. So the moderates are going to have a problem with this. The conservatives have a problem with this. But the facts are facts. Twenty two million people are not going to have insurance. This is going to be bad for people with pre- existing conditions. This is going to be bad for people who are older, who are sick. And guess what, the president made a clear promise during the campaign. He said if you have -- everybody is going to get covered. Everybody is going to get a great coverage and pre-existing conditions are going to be covered. So what shows us is that after seven years of Republican promises."

      "utterance": "Don't obscure that all though. Kris, one thing to consider is with the alternative is keeping ObamaCare, and there's a lot of Republicans who say, any cost we don't want our people -- my constituents to keep ObamaCare. One final thought, CBO projected 24 million would be covered under ObamaCare, only 11 million were actually covered. They're not a hundred percent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KOBACH",
      "utterance": "So I see the CBO score is a shot in the arm for the Republican bill. The reason is the Senate Republicans are sited there thinking, OK, I've seen the house bill, not sure I like the house bill, and then they see the Senate bill, and they just learned that the Senate bill results in a 1 million fewer uninsured, and saves $200 billion more than the house bill does. So they can say to their constituents the Senate bill is better, and both respects in the house bill. The other thing you have to remember is these five Republicans who've gone out on the limb and said we are no votes until you do something for us. It's a political ploy. Most of them are willing to take the -- and vote yes. But as soon as three of them fold and say I got the amendments I wanted, or two of them folds and say I got the amendments I wanted, then the pressure is immense on the other three. They do not want to be the one Republican who stops the repeal and replace of ObamaCare. So I'll say is going to pass, maybe not by the fourth of July, but it will pass."

I think it costs the Democrats hugely when they push this down people's throats and people weren't all that satisfied with the product and the result. I don't know, Kris, that the political costs are going to make sense for every Republican because if their constituents -- you know, we can talk about the $200 million savings -- I don't know if those leads matter to everyday Americans who are just looking at skyrocketing health care costs."

      "utterance": "But I'm going to agree with you on this, Eboni. Hold on. Here's what I don't get about this. I'm still trying to figure out how they come up with $300 billion deficit savings from this without really fixing the underlying problem. And they have premiums going down, and the only way they have premiums going down is by throwing taxpayer money at it. So there's money coming from somewhere. I can't find out where it is yet."

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",

And also in the long term to allow states to be able to do some more things within the parameter -- like, for instance, look at the 1332 state innovation waiver, which is currently under section 1332 of ObamaCare. The problem is if you're in difficult for states to get those approved. And so, the Senate bill makes things like that easier.

This summer India will celebrate the seventieth anniversary of its independence, and on behalf of the United States, I want to congratulate the Indian people on this magnificent milestone in the life of your very, very incredible nation. During my campaign, I pledged that, if elected, India would have a true real friend in the White House, and that is now exactly what you have, a true friend."

Relations between countries are strongest when they're devoted to the interests of the people we serve, and after our meetings today, I will say that the relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, has never been better. I'm proud to announce to the media, to the American people and to the Indian people that Prime Minister Modi and I are world leaders in social media. We're believers. Giving the citizens of our countries the opportunity to hear directly from their elected officials and for us to hear directly from them. I guess it's worked very well in both cases. I am thrilled to salute you, Prime Minister Modi, and the Indian people for all that you are accomplishing together. Your accomplishments have been vast. India has the fastest-growing economy in the world. We hope we're going to be catching you very soon in terms of percentage increase, I have to tell you that. We're working on it. In just two weeks, you will begin to implement the largest tax overhaul in your country's history. We're doing that also, by the way. Creating great new opportunities for your citizens. You have a big vision for improving infrastructure, and you are fighting government corruption, which is always a grave threat to democracy. Together our countries can help chart an optimistic path into the future, one that unleashes the power of new technology, new infrastructure and the enthusiasm and excitement of very hard-working and very dynamic people. I look forward to working with you, Mr. Prime Minister, to create jobs in our countries; to grow our economies; and to create a trading relationship that is fair and reciprocal. It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country. I was pleased to learn about an Indian airline's recent order of 100 new American planes, one of the largest orders of its kind, which will support thousands and thousands of American jobs. We're also looking forward to exporting more American energy to India as your economy grows, including major long-term contracts to purchase American natural gas which are right now being negotiated, and we will sign them. I'm trying to get the price up a little bit. To further our economic relationship, I'm excited to report that the prime minister has invited my daughter, Ivanka, to lead the U.S. delegation to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India this fall, and I believe she has accepted. Finally, the security partnership between the United States and India is incredibly important. Both our nations have been struck by the evils of terrorism, and we are both determined to destroy terrorist organizations and the radical ideology that drives them. We will destroy radical Islamic terrorism. Our militaries are working every day to enhance cooperation between our military forces; and next month, they will join together with the Japanese navy to take part in the largest maritime exercise ever conducted in the vast Indian Ocean. I also thank the Indian people for their contributions to the effort in Afghanistan and for joining us in applying new sanctions against the North Korean regime. The North Korean regime is causing tremendous problems and is something that has to be dealt with and probably dealt with rapidly. Working together, I truly believe our two countries can set an example for many other nations; make great strides in defeating common threats; and make great progress in unleashing amazing prosperity and growth. Prime Minister Modi, thank you again for joining me today and for visiting our country and our wonderful White House and Oval Office. I enjoyed our very productive conversation this afternoon and look forward to its continuation tonight at dinner. The future of our partnership has never looked brighter. India and the United States will always be tied together in friendship and respect. Prime Minister Modi, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

Now that ISIS, or at least ISIS sympathizers, are getting into the hacking game, that increases the -- the importance of us taking every measure we can. We do things like hiring outside groups to red flag and try to hack in and show us where our weaknesses are. But this just elevates the importance of it. And you know, putting out a message, a pro-ISIS message, on the front page, that's bad, but it could be a lot worse, and thankfully, at this point, it's not. You haven't seen them actually been able to hack and get into the databases the governments have."

That is the real threat that is a real problem. As ISIS becomes more and more irrelevant, as they're going to lose more ground in Iraq -- the fight for Mosul is almost over; they're going to lose more ground in Syria -- the fight for Raqqah is over; our U.S.-backed coalition in the north is pushing through. And we're going to shoot down any plane that goes over -- you know, over our guys. We're not going to take that empty Russian threat seriously. I don't know why they did it. Maybe they thought Trump was bluffing, and he's not going to shoot down Russian planes. But if they shoot down American planes, you can bet, you can make sure, you can be rest assured the U.S. will respond. ISIS becomes more and more irrelevant. With that, they're going to go into cyber, and they're going to do lone-wolf, stupid attacks here and there, driving through people, driving with cars and attacking people."

Even the previous administration, officials had admitted that one of the big problems when you're looking at countries like Syria is it's incredibly difficult when the country itself doesn't have the kind of databases that we do in America. So it is very difficult to check and to be aware of the individuals that are living within your borders. And not only that, we've seen reports of ISIS being able to print fake passports. So that's a big concern, as well. So you know, I think that the concern is fair about vetting, particularly from countries like Syria.

Just this weekend, it was announced that Bernie Sanders, the socialist man of the people, is under an FBI investigation for bank fraud, the same Bernie Sanders that preaches against income inequality. Now, in my new book, \"The Swamp,\" we take a look back at the history of the swamp. But \"The Swamp\" is not just about the many mind-blowing scandals of the past and present. It offers a future where we can start draining the murky waters. Trump can do that. President Trump has my book. And I offer him dozens of solutions to restore faith in Washington. Term limits is one. Lobbying bans, slashed budgets. I have a few more ideas. But the swamp is ready to be drained, and President Trump is just the man to do it. OK. Now it's time to \"Circle Back\" with our specialists, Kris Kobach and Ari Aramesh. Now Kris, you were on board with the Trump train from very early on."

But some of the things he's doing, like putting limits on how soon you go through the revolving door and start lobbying, that's very -- that can be easily done. Term limits. I'm a huge proponent of term limits, like you are. That's a heavy lift, because you've got to get Congress to vote for a constitutional amendment to limit their own terms.
