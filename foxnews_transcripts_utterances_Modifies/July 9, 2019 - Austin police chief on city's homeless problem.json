Tonight, as team Obama and other candidates continued to kind of pile on Joe Biden all the time, there's a new analysis that looks beneath the numbers of the frontrunners current standing and asks the question, is Joe Biden really the front runner here? First, in the most straightforward way, the answer is yes, according to the current polls. But how long will that last? Because look at the trend here. He's been on a steady decline, basically, since he stepped on the debate stage. He will, however, get another shot at that later this month.  And while he's garnered more endorsements, that's just one measure than anyone else, really most of the big endorsements have not backed to anybody yet including him. All of this and Obama team support confused to be lukewarm to downright cold.  Last night, former White House communications director Jen Psaki, chimed in about Biden's frequent mention of his friendship with a former president.",

And, of course, there's always the next step where this could end up at the Supreme Court in the middle of a 2020 presidential campaign, in election.  So, I mean, the stakes are really high here.  Essentially, what the opponents are arguing is that, listen, when Congress a couple of years ago, zeroed out the penalty that tax you would pay if you didn't comply with the individual mandate, they say that was the whole linchpin holding this entire thing together. You'll remember the Supreme Court said they hung it on that. It's a taxation power that means the House could start this thing, it could go through the process on the Hill. So, the opponents are now saying that that's gone, the whole thing has to go.  And two of these three judges today, one of them didn't say a word, we're told during the arguments today in New Orleans. Two of the three had serious concerns about how the law could survive.   So, it looks like, at least, from the arguments today, they were pretty open to what the plaintiffs had to say about getting rid of the Affordable Care Act altogether.",

So, you do have a mix on the panel there, but it's almost certain that whomever wins or loses here, this thing is going to end up at the Supreme Court.

So, we know that Joe Biden got a very nice pop because he was probably the only name that people knew in the early going here. He -- he's at that 30 percent line in terms of recognition there.

And he's missing what 2020 feels like for especially for grassroots Democrats. Now, I do think there's another side of all of this. And that is there's a tremendous tension inside the Democrat Party to get as far left as they can, but still, defeat Donald Trump.   You've got the pragmatist who just want to defeat Trump. They really don't care who it is as long as it's not Trump. But you've got the people who are ideological, who really want to use this moment to get to the left.

Joe Biden has been part of the problem in Washington for nearly 50 years and the entire time he's been in Washington, he's been trying to figure out how to become president. And he's run a couple of times and it's -- and it's been disastrous. And the only -- the closest he's ever gotten to the White House is when Barack Obama needed somebody that fitted his description.

And I think this tension that's going to play out between different wings of the party and between the older wing and the younger wing, that's a natural process to happen in a primary.  This is the most on steroids mega version where we got 26 candidates now on the Democratic side.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott opposes the idea tweeting last month before it became a reality, quote, \"If Austin or any other Texas City permits camping on city streets, it will be yet another ordinance the State of Texas will override. At some point cities must start putting public safety and common sense first.\" Austin Mayor Steve Adler called on the governor to do more to help solve the homeless crisis as Austin commits to an 18-month study of the problem.",

He's been on a steady decline, basically, since he stepped on the debate stage. He will, however, get another shot at that later this month. And while he's garnered more endorsements, that's just one measure than anyone else, really most of the big endorsements have not backed to anybody yet including him.

Essentially, what the opponents are arguing is that, listen, when Congress a couple of years ago, zeroed out the penalty that tax you would pay if you didn't comply with the individual mandate, they say that was the whole linchpin holding this entire thing together. You'll remember the Supreme Court said they hung it on that. It's a taxation power that means the House could start this thing, it could go through the process on the Hill. So, the opponents are now saying that that's gone, the whole thing has to go. And two of these three judges today, one of them didn't say a word, we're told during the arguments today in New Orleans. Two of the three had serious concerns about how the law could survive.

So, you do have a mix on the panel there, but it's almost certain that whomever wins or loses here, this thing is going to end up at the Supreme Court. And listen, it's going to be a political event as well because if the Democrats lose, they're going to say, OK, Republicans are stripping away health care from tens of millions of people but they have no backup plan. They've talked about it quite a bit, you know, the GOP has not been able to come up with enough of one to get everybody together to vote on it.

If Joe Biden uses this challenge as an opportunity and goes out nerds the nomination in a way this would be the best thing that could happen to him.

So, we know that Joe Biden got a very nice pop because he was probably the only name that people knew in the early going here. He -- he's at that 30 percent line in terms of recognition there. Now, think about the fact that Hillary Clinton was at 60 percent. In the same measure according to 538. And Ari, she lost as we all well know."

He just feels like yesterday's senator. And that's his problem. This is what he talked about the segregationist that he knew in the 70s, because it was comfortable it was natural, it was Joe. And he's missing what 2020 feels like for especially for grassroots Democrats. Now, I do think there's another side of all of this. And that is there's a tremendous tension inside the Democrat Party to get as far left as they can, but still, defeat Donald Trump. You've got the pragmatist who just want to defeat Trump. They really don't care who it is as long as it's not Trump. But you've got the people who are ideological, who really want to use this moment to get to the left.

And they would do anything to topple him. And, of course, they ran off with Howard Dean for a long time. And then, at the last minute, they were reminded the electability was the only thing they cared about. And so, they jumped into the arms of John Kerry, which, of course, didn't work out very well for him. But, you know, people forget. Joe Biden has been part of the problem in Washington for nearly 50 years and the entire time he's been in Washington, he's been trying to figure out how to become president. And he's run a couple of times and it's -- and it's been disastrous. And the only -- the closest he's ever gotten to the White House is when Barack Obama needed somebody that fitted his description. And so, you know, it's a good reminder that he really is kind of bad at this."

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",

They either from what who their home state was or people that they're working for so. That explains part of it. And I think this tension that's going to play out between different wings of the party and between the older wing and the younger wing, that's a natural process to happen in a primary. This is the most on steroids mega version where we got 26 candidates now on the Democratic side. So, I don't think that just the fact that there are a bunch of Obama staffers who have chosen somebody else besides Joe Biden, necessarily means he's going to have trouble.

I think a lot of regular Democratic voters who are their base outside of Washington. And that's bad for Democrats because I don't think they can win the White House that way -- that way.

And try taking it to battleground states like Wisconsin, or Ohio, or Michigan, states that run the Union side in the Civil War and say well, thank you for winning the war and for abolishing slavery but now you're all guilty and you're all part of this institutional racism.

You talk about collective victimhood and guilt. Talk about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBBINS",
      "utterance": "Well, the only way that this can really work and what the proponents of this are talking about is saying things like what Beto said that we're all guilty of it, that it's collective American guilt. And this is how they avoid the question of the you know, the genealogical question of who's responsible, and also the fact that the people who held slaves and the slaves themselves are all since passed away. But that's not really an American concept, collective guilt. That's not in our law, it's not in our history, and it's not something that people like. I think that pursuing that really makes people more indignant because Americans don't feel that they had anything to do with this and not these days."

You know, what about the you know, the success? You heard Mitch McConnell talk about the fact that we've had an African-American president. You know that's something that people point to, all of the success of so many African-Americans in this country, but people who are in favor of reparations would say yes, we're so far from done. We're not all the way there yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBBINS",

Reparations and now it's done. We no longer have any more work to do towards racial harmony or anything else. You wanted the payout so there it is.

They sponsor terrorism all over the region, primarily as proxy forces that by the way killed and maimed hundreds of Americans in Iraq.

They could continue to pour millions of dollars into Hezbollah and other proxy terrorist organizations, and that wasn't a violation of the deal. They could carry out sanctions' evasions on behalf of Syria, which is the reason why that ship was seized by the British marines off Gibraltar, because it was taking oil to a prohibited entity and it didn't violate the deal. And ultimately, at some point down the road, once they have their missiles, once they poured billions of dollars from sanctions relief into building their capabilities to do all of these things, then Iran would announce, you know, we are going to be nuclear-capable and we're going to enrich, at that point they will have achieved a lot at this and they will be hoping that at that point in time the world will be less willing to reimpose sanctions. That was their plan all along and the president was right to get us out of the deal, and by the way, this was an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. The president said he would pull us out of the deal, Hillary Clinton said she would keep it."

That was true during the deal, before the deal and after the deal. That will always be true. If Iran attacked the United States, they are going to get a response that will be strong and definitive. That said, the sanctions continue in place. We are not going to -- we are not going to put back this relief so that they can have millions and millions of more dollars every month that they can use to build the rockets to sponsor the terrorism. My goodness, you've already seen that Hezbollah has announced openly that they are having budget problems and funding problems. That is related to the sanctions being put back in."

Before I let you go, though, I want to ask you a Florida question with relation to this Epstein case. And the Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta, who was involved, he's one of the prosecutors who was part of what was seen as just a very sweet deal, given what was at stake here. What you think should happen? Should he remain as labor secretary?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I think we need to know exactly why the deal was made. There's only two -- there's only two ways this happen. The first is it was a very difficult prosecutorial decision, which as Secretary Acosta has said that at the time, they didn't have enough witnesses, they didn't have enough evidence, the state grand jury couldn't even indict him and there was a real fear he could walk. It was either that, that in hindsight looks terrible, or it was political influence and people protecting him. And that's why the Department of Justice is undertaking a probe right now if there was prosecutorial misconduct, there should be accountability for that and that's what we are hoping to find out from this probe, and we should wait before it comes back before we make any further pronouncements about that."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, despite the strong economy, many cities, including New York, L.A., Seattle, San Francisco, are drawing more and more homeless citizens to their towns and cities. Now Austin can be added to that list. The city council there has decriminalized public camping and sleeping and panhandling on their public sidewalks. In moments we are going to talk to Austin police chief Brian Manley about that, but first, the back story from chief correspondent Jonathan Hunt. Good evening, Jonathan, thank you."

      "speaker": "JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. Under the new law, the Austin Police Department cannot arrest anyone who is camping, laying, or sitting in a public area unless they present a public health or safety hazard or are blocking a walkway. Supporters of the move say it will help break the cycle of homelessness because if someone is arrested for sleeping in public spaces it can give that person a criminal record, which can make it harder to get work or find a real place to live. Texas Governor Greg Abbott opposes the idea tweeting last month before it became a reality, quote, \"If Austin or any other Texas City permits camping on city streets, it will be yet another ordinance the State of Texas will override. At some point cities must start putting public safety and common sense first.\" Austin Mayor Steve Adler called on the governor to do more to help solve the homeless crisis as Austin commits to an 18-month study of the problem."

    {
      "speaker": "HUNT",
      "utterance": "The ordinance does not allow people to camp in city parks, but it does give them to go ahead to sleep and placed tents on sidewalks, outside private homes or businesses, for instance, if they are not unreasonably blocking anyone. Mayor Adler, by the way, is this week visiting Seattle and Los Angeles to learn how those cities deal with the problem of homelessness. Austin has around 2500 homeless people by a recent count. Seattle around six times that number, and here in L.A., Martha, the homeless population is estimated at around 55,000. Martha?"

    {
      "speaker": "MANLEY",
      "utterance": "So, we are only a week into the change in the ordinances and as with any change we get, whether it be from our local governing body or the state legislature, the officers are complying with the new regulations. We put out training bulletins and again emphasized to the officers what the new requirements of the new ordinances are that we are focused on the behavior that is either dangerous or hazardous, or that is blocking the passageways."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Obviously, you know, as you point out, your force and you are newly in charge. You did an excellent job handling the bombing situation in Boston and were promoted to chief there, but whatever is put in front of your officers is what they will carry out and what they will handle and manage as best they can. But on the Austin Police Association Facebook page, people are starting to weigh on it and I'd like to get your reaction to some of this. It says, \"Officers and citizens are reporting camps sprouting up all over town. Officers are confused on how to enforce the changes. Department direction is vague at best according to this one individual. Hashtag bad, bad decision.\" Obviously, he's not happy. What do you say to him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, again, social media was an avenue where people can post whatever they like. We've put out clear directions to the officers as far as what the new ordinances require. I think the big change for us as a community and as a department is areas where officers used to have the ability to impact complaints that we would receive being individuals that felt like their safety was in jeopardy or didn't feel comfortable in a situation. If that doesn't rise to the level where an officer believes it would meet the threshold of being hazardous or dangerous, we won't have the opportunity to try and gain voluntary compliance to get that person to either change their behavior or move to another location. And we had a pretty good success with that in dealing with homeless populations, especially in our downtown area. We were seeing compliance rates somewhere in the neighborhood of 98 percent when we would ask an individual to either change the behavior or move, that they would comply."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, let me ask you, because here is an example from another person who put a question to the police online. \"People are sleeping on the sidewalk in front of my residence. This is concerning for my family. Can't you all do anything about that?\" And the answer was \"No, the new obstruction camping ordinances allow camping on the sidewalks, alleyways, and other public places except parks in city hall, which includes in front of your house.\" Your reaction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANLEY",
      "utterance": "So depending upon that location, if it was on public property, people's private property is still protected and their private property rights are not impacted by this, but if it is on that portion of public property between the street and the private property, if it is not unreasonably blocking someone from utilizing sidewalk or that passageway, and we cannot establish that it's hazardous or dangerous --"

Karina, I saw THE STORY weeks ago in the New York Post. And I just thought the pictures were so beautiful and we have some of those pictures I think of you celebrating with all of your students there. You are right in the middle of that group. How did you get all of these kids to do so well on this test and has this ever happened before at your charter school?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARINA MATTEO, MATH TEACHER, SUCCESS ACADEMY",
      "utterance": "So, to answer your first question, it's really just believing in them and letting them know that the bar is high because they can do it. I mean, that's how we really did it. And in terms of we've ever done it before, last year it was the first year that we did algebra one in the eighth grade because it's a ninth grade test, last year, we had a 100 percent passed, and about 85 percent get aced, but this is the first year that we had 100 percent of them passed and a 100 percent of them get an A."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, it really is a great feat and when you look at the numbers in district nine in the Bronx, only 2 percent scored an 85 percent or higher. So, what is your, what is your trick and what do you say to those who say, well, you know, you've got the cream of the crop?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATTEO",
      "utterance": "So, I wouldn't say that it's a trick. It's more so, these scholars have been in an amazing educational program since kindergarten. They've been prepped with progressive teachings since, again kindergarten. So, by the time they got to me, there were no gaps that I have to close as much. I mean, there are always some, but they weren't drastic. So, again, a large part of it is Success Academy and that foundation. But also, it's always having a high bar. So, it's from day one letting them know like every mini quiz, every homework, every little do now, you need to do your absolute best. And when you do your absolute best, you will see the results."

These kids are benefiting from this opportunity and because of our school, I know that they are going to go on to have as many doors open for them as possible. So, I just don't know how you can be against our kids, our families when it's so positive. These kids believe in themselves. They can go out into the world and say that they are great at math. How many kids can say that?"
