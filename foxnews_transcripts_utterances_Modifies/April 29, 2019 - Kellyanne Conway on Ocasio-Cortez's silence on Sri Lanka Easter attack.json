Why? The actions of a deranged, sick, twisted evil individual who said and what was his own manifesto, he hated Israel, and he hated Donald Trump himself.

      "sentences": "Now, predictably, Democrats refused to see the writing on the wall. As we speak, yes, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler is desperate to besmirch President Trump and everyone around him. Instead of actually legislating, no, that's not a part of their agenda. Nadler, his Democratic colleagues, they are now dedicating nearly 100 percent of their time to a never, ever, ever, ever, ever ending investigation surrounding an actual hoax.   Now, despite four separate probes now -- four, proving zero evidence of Trump Russia collusion, Nadler still frantically trying to conduct Capitol Hill interrogations on everyone in Trumps orbit. This week, Nadler wants to haul the attorney general, Barr, before the Judiciary Committee lawyers, not them, the lawyers. Now, the attorney general wisely declining that invitation, said look, I'll only appear for an actual hearing with real committee members that I have oversight. Not some cross examination with your government lawyers on a mission to destroy President Trump.  And while the left continues to obsess over their sick collusion fantasy and their conspiracy theories, well, they are more than happy to ignore serious claims of corruption at the highest level of the federal government under Obama, and then thereafter. And tonight, Vice President Mike Pence, he is demanding an investigation into whether or not former Trump-hating lovebirds from the FBI, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, were plotting to infiltrate his staff in the West Wing. And according to new text messages obtained by the senators, Chuck Grassley, Ron Johnson, high level FBI officials discussed the possibilities of, quote, developing potential relationships at a November 2016 briefing where presidential transition team staff -- in other words, Strzok and Page, well, they were trying to spy on incoming members of the Trump White House.  We had a report from Sara Carter now out, revealing that Pence's former chief of staff, Joshua Pitcock, actually was the top target for the scheme because his wife worked as an analyst for Strzok during the Clinton investigation.  Now, Pitcock released a statement denying he ever had any contact with Strzok or Page. He emphasized that he never took any actions on their behalf. Now, of course, that is just the latest example. High ranking FBI, Obama, DOJ officials aggressively investigating, and yes, spying, on the incoming president and his staff. And, of course, then candidate Trump before that.  Of course, that's after they gave a rigged investigation into Hillary Clinton -- real crimes, Espionage Act, destroying subpoenaed emails.  Nobody ever heard of Bleach Bit before, and nobody ever heard about hiring aides to bust up your iPhones and your BlackBerrys and rip out the SIM cards. You did that? That would be called obstruction.   Now, from using informants on the campaign trail as well, rampant FISA abuse against Carter Page, spying on the Trump campaign that way, using that dirty Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier. Even \"The New York Times\" is now saying, oh, it might have been Russian disinformation. Bob Woodward is saying this dossier needs to be examined. By the way, a little late, guys. We have been doing this for over two years. That to the nearly 300 percent increase on unmasking requests in 2016 carried out by Susan Rice, oh, and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Powers. Why would she be unmasking anybody?  And as we mentioned at the very center of all of this, yes, Hillary Clinton's dirty, phony, unverified bought and paid for Russian lies, used as the basis for almost all of the deep state spying operations. Look at this Grassley letter from over a year ago. We know that President Obama, James Comey, Susan Rice, and others held multiple meetings in January 2017 about the misinformation, as \"The New York Times\" is suggesting, dossier.  Joe Biden even attended one of those meetings.  As I told you last week, by the time this is all said and done, Creepy Crazy Uncle Joe and Obama himself will need to be answering some questions.  For example, what did they both know, and when did they know it? Just how long were they using campaign opposition research to spy on a candidate of the opposition party? Recently, former Obama deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, who looked pretty nervous when pressed about these very serious questions. Watch this bit. Take a look.",

I think this is something that also other committees are looking into as well. Ben Rhodes, he spoke at Georgetown University. Nicholas Ballasy wrote that story, asking him very significant questions. What did the Obama White House know? Now, Ben Rhodes has denied this completely. He is saying that the White House knew nothing, just as you said, but there's going to be a significant investigation. Remember, John Brennan, James clapper, James Comey, the former FBI director, are all very well aware of what was going on.  And according to sources that I have spoken with within the intelligence committee, there would be no way that Obama would not have been briefed on some of this, considering this was a potential candidate for the presidency during the beginning of the investigation, and then after he became president.

And she spread it and her friends spread it, that rigged her investigation was total garbage. She didn't read that part. Pretty unbelievable. Pretty selective.  While the left continues to try and distract, we do have a president that is interested in keeping the progress of the country moving forward -- yes, to make America great. Don't wear a hat if you are a 16-year-old kid in Washington. The results are palpable.  Now, this is -- the media mob will never show you this, but our economy is booming. And the news you will not hear anywhere else, we know that in the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at an impressive 3.2 percent, outpacing all expectations. Oh, with a government shutdown. Keep in mind, Obama never averaged at least 3 percent GDP growth in a single year, the only president ever to achieve that. This quarter of consumer spending increased to its highest levels now in nearly ten years.  In Pennsylvania, the unemployment level is now so low that some employers are going to local jails, hoping to fill vacancies when these guys get out of jail.  And the president has slashed regulations. The biggest tax cut in history.  Finally, we are energy independent and a net exporter of energy for the first time in 75 years. Our economy is breaking records. American lives are improving. President Trump is fulfilling his promise to make the country great again, and of the media mob is nowhere to be found except -- what does shiftless Schiff have to say again? With us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. You know, there are 53 -- and I will start with the boss, Jim, although you used to be the boss until the (INAUDIBLE) took over. No pun intended.  Congressman Meadows, we got so much information. It really was the two of you, when you read these closed-door sessions. Strzok, and Page and Nellie and Bruce Ohr and all of these other people, and I thought Priestap was pretty revealing.

She says the world is going to end in the next 12 years. Doesn't seem to understand the way tax incentives work. She got rid of Amazon and the 25,000 jobs is going to bring to New York and then said, \"Well, we can't give away $3 billion to them\".

I mean all of this is, which is crazy, and she's being brushed back by none other than the Speaker Pelosi. Saying, \"Hey, this class of voter can win in those safe Liberal Democratic districts\". And \"What are they? They're just five of them\" - really brushing back some of these progressive freshmen. Because Pelosi of course is under enormous pressure to actually produce and perform. And has a lot of more centrist moderate members who came to Washington and try to get things done. But I really had a call her out here, because I'm on television shows and I'm asked constantly, \"Why didn't Donald Trump say this? Why did you use that word? Where's this semicolon in his tweet, where I believe it should be\". And I said. \"Hey, why - does anybody ask Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who you give the hero's welcome to?\" All you fan girls ever bothered to ask her, why she is being completely silent on the massacre against Sri Lankans on Easter Sunday? And I only asked that, because I had noticed that she had tweeted many times about the killings in the mosque in New Zealand. She had tweeted about other things. And I was on the same show condemning violence against people of all faiths. I said specifically by name, the mosque in New Zealand, Emmanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the Christians in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the synagogue in Poway, California and on and on it went.

As we speak, yes, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler is desperate to besmirch President Trump and everyone around him. Instead of actually legislating, no, that's not a part of their agenda. Nadler, his Democratic colleagues, they are now dedicating nearly 100 percent of their time to a never, ever, ever, ever, ever ending investigation surrounding an actual hoax. Now, despite four separate probes now -- four, proving zero evidence of Trump Russia collusion, Nadler still frantically trying to conduct Capitol Hill interrogations on everyone in Trumps orbit. This week, Nadler wants to haul the attorney general, Barr, before the Judiciary Committee lawyers, not them, the lawyers. Now, the attorney general wisely declining that invitation, said look, I'll only appear for an actual hearing with real committee members that I have oversight. Not some cross examination with your government lawyers on a mission to destroy President Trump. And while the left continues to obsess over their sick collusion fantasy and their conspiracy theories, well, they are more than happy to ignore serious claims of corruption at the highest level of the federal government under Obama, and then thereafter. And tonight, Vice President Mike Pence, he is demanding an investigation into whether or not former Trump-hating lovebirds from the FBI, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, were plotting to infiltrate his staff in the West Wing. And according to new text messages obtained by the senators, Chuck Grassley, Ron Johnson, high level FBI officials discussed the possibilities of, quote, developing potential relationships at a November 2016 briefing where presidential transition team staff -- in other words, Strzok and Page, well, they were trying to spy on incoming members of the Trump White House. We had a report from Sara Carter now out, revealing that Pence's former chief of staff, Joshua Pitcock, actually was the top target for the scheme because his wife worked as an analyst for Strzok during the Clinton investigation. Now, Pitcock released a statement denying he ever had any contact with Strzok or Page. He emphasized that he never took any actions on their behalf. Now, of course, that is just the latest example. High ranking FBI, Obama, DOJ officials aggressively investigating, and yes, spying, on the incoming president and his staff. And, of course, then candidate Trump before that. Of course, that's after they gave a rigged investigation into Hillary Clinton -- real crimes, Espionage Act, destroying subpoenaed emails.  Nobody ever heard of Bleach Bit before, and nobody ever heard about hiring aides to bust up your iPhones and your BlackBerrys and rip out the SIM cards. You did that? That would be called obstruction. Now, from using informants on the campaign trail as well, rampant FISA abuse against Carter Page, spying on the Trump campaign that way, using that dirty Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier. Even \"The New York Times\" is now saying, oh, it might have been Russian disinformation. Bob Woodward is saying this dossier needs to be examined. By the way, a little late, guys. We have been doing this for over two years. That to the nearly 300 percent increase on unmasking requests in 2016 carried out by Susan Rice, oh, and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Powers. Why would she be unmasking anybody? And as we mentioned at the very center of all of this, yes, Hillary Clinton's dirty, phony, unverified bought and paid for Russian lies, used as the basis for almost all of the deep state spying operations. Look at this Grassley letter from over a year ago. We know that President Obama, James Comey, Susan Rice, and others held multiple meetings in January 2017 about the misinformation, as \"The New York Times\" is suggesting, dossier.  Joe Biden even attended one of those meetings. As I told you last week, by the time this is all said and done, Creepy Crazy Uncle Joe and Obama himself will need to be answering some questions.  For example, what did they both know, and when did they know it? Just how long were they using campaign opposition research to spy on a candidate of the opposition party? Recently, former Obama deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, who looked pretty nervous when pressed about these very serious questions. Watch this bit. Take a look."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, Sean. What we know now is that Senator Grassley, Senator Johnson had sent a letter to Attorney General William Barr, asking those very questions. They want him to probe deep into what was going on between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and the text messages that went between them, basically, looking to recruit potential sources within the White House. I think this is something that also other committees are looking into as well. Ben Rhodes, he spoke at Georgetown University. Nicholas Ballasy wrote that story, asking him very significant questions. What did the Obama White House know? Now, Ben Rhodes has denied this completely. He is saying that the White House knew nothing, just as you said, but there's going to be a significant investigation. Remember, John Brennan, James clapper, James Comey, the former FBI director, are all very well aware of what was going on. And according to sources that I have spoken with within the intelligence committee, there would be no way that Obama would not have been briefed on some of this, considering this was a potential candidate for the presidency during the beginning of the investigation, and then after he became president. So I think that there's going to be a lot of questions being asked and a lot of people having to answer them."

You can't have an attempt to spy on opposition party candidates using Russian lies all bought and paid for, but not tell FISA court judges. That, and of course, using unverified material. There is no shortage of high-ranking government officials plotting to take down Donald Trump, clear Hillary Clinton, rigged the election in her favor. She did steal the primary from Bernie Sanders, yet with seemingly never-ending investigations into the Russia hoax still ongoing. The Democratic Party is fast becoming -- well, pretty much a laughingstock. The problem is it's serious.

Now, by the way, I wonder what Hillary Clinton said when she found out that James Comey was reopening the case into her private email server? I wonder why Hillary didn't read the part in the Mueller report that cleared the president of all and any collision, or the part indicating that her dirty dossier, Russian lies, \"The New York Times\" is suggesting as part of a Russian disinformation campaign. And she spread it and her friends spread it, that rigged her investigation was total garbage. She didn't read that part. Pretty unbelievable. Pretty selective. While the left continues to try and distract, we do have a president that is interested in keeping the progress of the country moving forward -- yes, to make America great. Don't wear a hat if you are a 16-year-old kid in Washington. The results are palpable. Now, this is -- the media mob will never show you this, but our economy is booming. And the news you will not hear anywhere else, we know that in the first quarter of this year, the economy grew at an impressive 3.2 percent, outpacing all expectations. Oh, with a government shutdown. Keep in mind, Obama never averaged at least 3 percent GDP growth in a single year, the only president ever to achieve that. This quarter of consumer spending increased to its highest levels now in nearly ten years.  In Pennsylvania, the unemployment level is now so low that some employers are going to local jails, hoping to fill vacancies when these guys get out of jail. And the president has slashed regulations. The biggest tax cut in history.  Finally, we are energy independent and a net exporter of energy for the first time in 75 years. Our economy is breaking records. American lives are improving. President Trump is fulfilling his promise to make the country great again, and of the media mob is nowhere to be found except -- what does shiftless Schiff have to say again? With us now, Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. You know, there are 53 -- and I will start with the boss, Jim, although you used to be the boss until the (INAUDIBLE) took over. No pun intended. Congressman Meadows, we got so much information. It really was the two of you, when you read these closed-door sessions. Strzok, and Page and Nellie and Bruce Ohr and all of these other people, and I thought Priestap was pretty revealing. And also, the White House counsel that actually thought Hillary should be indicted, information we didn't have. But we have 53 more of those? Those closed-door testimonies to reveal?"

I think what we will find is you had Ben Rhodes on there. We will find that he gets four Pinocchio's for his performance today, because the evidence would suggest that not only was he aware of it, but certainly the Obama administration was aware of it. We know ten days after what we now know as Hurricane Crossfire, the investigation into Trump, that there was a briefing at the White House with Obama's chief of staff, and so to suggest that they didn't know anything is just not accurate."

      "speaker": "JORDAN",

There is a basis for his concern. He also said he felt that there was a lack of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI, and he used a term that we really haven't heard much, and that was unauthorized surveillance. So, I am convinced the attorney general wants to know the same thing that you and I, Mark, want to know and so many Americans. How did this all start? What was really the catalyst for this investigation? And did things happen in the realm of spying that were not authorized and should not have happened? And I -- that's what I want to get to the bottom of, and that's where the American people want us to go."

And also when it comes to Ben Rhodes, remember, he is the same guy who told us that catalyst for Benghazi and the attack that took place there where four Americans gave their lives for our country. He's the same guy who told us it was all caused by a video, so I don't put a whole lot of weight and what he says. What I do know is that this thing started clear back in July 31st, 2016.  And all kinds of crazy things were going on. What I do know is that an opposition research document was the basis to go get a document to do what?  Spy on a prison associated with the Trump campaign. I do know those things happened, and it seems to be based on what Bill Barr said a couple of weeks ago, he thinks there maybe more there and he is putting it together to investigate that."

But they never told the FISA court and they never verify the dossier. Now, even Woodward and \"The New York Times\" are saying, that may have been Russian disinformation. So, they got in that way before the election and used after the election to bludgeon the president. What about Stefan Halper? Who empowered him to meet Clovis, Papadopoulos and Page? Wasn't he spying on those people?"

But more important than that, they want us to hold people accountable. And we are committed to doing that. When we look at this, I think it goes back even before July 31st in 2016.  That much of this investigation, and the surveillance -- you can use the word surveillance. I use \"spying\", because I think at this point, that's more applicable to this particular situation. And it goes beyond infiltrating the vice president. You know, we see these text messages.  They were looking for intel each and every day to find what they could find, and ultimately, all they found was dossier that was not Russian information. It was Democratic Party disinformation. I think we ought to be clear about that."

I think it's interesting, Sean, she told him to call the Clinton investigation a matter, when it was obviously an investigation. He complied with that. But he wouldn't tell the truth to the American people when the president said tell the American people, I'm not under investigation after Comey had told this to President Trump in three different times, and he wouldn't say that to the American people. So he is willing to mislead them on the Clinton matter, and not on the Trump-Russia investigation. We will see, but I think all those people need to be examined."

And then just this weekend, after more widespread condemnation, well, an anti-Semitic cartoon appeared in the international edition of the paper, also depicting - again, this is in the past. One of those back in, I believe, May. Now Alan Dershowitz, is writing column for \"The Hill\" says \"One of the weapons of hate against Jews deployed by Nazi Germany were cartoons and caricatures that depicted Jews as subhuman animals - often as dogs or spiders\".

And, look, this whole thing around blaming President Trump for the synagogue shooting, the media needs to look at the way they're dividing the country.

I usually leave Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and some of these other freshmen like Ilhan Omar and Tlaib alone. Because basically when they speak, it's a gift to conservatives and the Republican Party, when she holds forth about, \"We can't have any more gas, we can't have any more cows, we can't have any more gas coming from cows\". She says the world is going to end in the next 12 years. Doesn't seem to understand the way tax incentives work. She got rid of Amazon and the 25,000 jobs is going to bring to New York and then said, \"Well, we can't give away $3 billion to them\". Meaning, she really didn't understand the way the tax incentives work. She said that the unemployment rate is so low because people have two jobs. I mean all of this is, which is crazy, and she's being brushed back by none other than the Speaker Pelosi. Saying, \"Hey, this class of voter can win in those safe Liberal Democratic districts\". And \"What are they? They're just five of them\" - really brushing back some of these progressive freshmen. Because Pelosi of course is under enormous pressure to actually produce and perform. And has a lot of more centrist moderate members who came to Washington and try to get things done. But I really had a call her out here, because I'm on television shows and I'm asked constantly, \"Why didn't Donald Trump say this? Why did you use that word? Where's this semicolon in his tweet, where I believe it should be\". And I said. \"Hey, why - does anybody ask Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who you give the hero's welcome to?\" All you fan girls ever bothered to ask her, why she is being completely silent on the massacre against Sri Lankans on Easter Sunday? And I only asked that, because I had noticed that she had tweeted many times about the killings in the mosque in New Zealand. She had tweeted about other things. And I was on the same show condemning violence against people of all faiths. I said specifically by name, the mosque in New Zealand, Emmanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, the Christians in Sutherland Springs, Texas, the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the synagogue in Poway, California and on and on it went. So we - and my boss, the President of United States and me and others we're condemning attacks on people of all faiths.

But the very next day, they were still picking through the rubble in Sri Lanka, looking for survivors or the deceased. She had time to tweet about her Netflix documentary about her.

They were so cowardly, they voted present, including those, who are running for President said, \"We must have a Green New Deal. This is the future. Yay\". And then they didn't have the guts to even give an affirmative vote to it. So a lot of these ideas sound great. They are sugar high, empty calories, free this, free that - Americans are too smart for that. When they hear that you're going to have free housing, free college, free health care, they know they're going to be the ones paying the bills someway, somehow.
