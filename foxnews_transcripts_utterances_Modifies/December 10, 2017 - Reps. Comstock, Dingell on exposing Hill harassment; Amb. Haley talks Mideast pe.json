Congresswoman Comstock, you’re working on legislation. What you want to see? How much do you want to streamline that process for women to file complaints?

Having said that, I would add that I think for a lot of women they may feel like, well, you know, in the past when these things came up, there wasn't so much speed about addressing the complaints, that they got swept under the rug. What we’re into right now, though, as these sort of extreme points of view show, is a situation where contrary to Senator Kaine, there isn't a new standard. There is a shifting standard. There is not an established rule here either about what a fireable offense is, or what the procedure should be and at the end of the procedure, what the punishments should be. So, I think, you know, what the Democrats politically are trying to do by ousting Franken is established we are consistent. We are the party that, you know, means what it says and says what it means. I would suspect that's going to be very difficult actually to sustain a consistent view of this because every case is going to be a little different and the politics are going to change constantly, and I think that was the wisdom of your two guests when they said this isn't a partisan matter, because truthfully as cases come along, you were going to see it's very hard to be consistent about this.",

However, I do think politics is seeping into this. Democrats have longed sort of fashion themselves as a party of women. And right now, they are trying to show their base that they not only spouse this verbally, but they act on this as well, and they’re going to try to claim they have the moral high ground when 2018 comes and say, we pushed our members out who had this issue. However, I do not think this is just Democrats, right? We have a president who is embracing a candidate in Alabama who has been accused of child molestation, right? I know there's a bunch of Republicans on the Hill who are very uncomfortable with this and think that he's only doing this because of politics.

He introduced 141 pieces of legislation amendments, not a single one in his entire career, including time with the Democrat president, was ever signed into law. Al Franken was a mean-spirited bulldog who had no purpose in the United States Senate if he couldn't be a mean-spirited bulldog, which he couldn't do with these allegations out there.

And Thursday, the resignations of Senator Al Franken and Congressman Trent Franks. All this ahead of Tuesday's Senate contest in Alabama with a Republican candidate, Judge Roy Moore faces allegations of sexual misconduct with teenagers.

Election eve in Alabama will feature a robocall from President Trump and a rally headlined by his former chief strategist Steve Bannon. In a statement to Fox, the deputy campaign manager for the campaign, Hannah Ford, says, quote, turnout is the key to victory and we have pulled all hands on deck to activate Judge Moore's conservative and evangelical base. Our volunteers are on fire and are determined to stop pro-abortion, pro-taxes and pro-amnesty liberals from stealing their Senate seat. The Democrat Doug Jones is counting on heavy African-American turnout to flip the Senate seat Jeff Sessions held for 20 years and called into potential 2020 contenders on Saturday.

Now, the voters are going to decide on Tuesday, but I think what they’re going to have is an ethics investigation and what we've been doing on my committee is we've been hearing the voices of the women and the victims, and that is where it’s going to happen, because every woman has a story.

But this has been going on for a very long time, Chris. We know what our values are. I don't consider this a partisan issue. I find it -- I mean, Barbara and I totally agree on this issue. I’ve also called that I think Congressman Farenthold should resign. Eighty-four thousand dollars is a lot of money, and it wasn't for nothing. We cannot have a double standard. And we still have somebody running for office. We still have somebody in the White House that has acknowledged that they have done things that are not OK, or at least the president has.

I’m on the committee of jurisdiction. We were looking at this issue even before some of the stories came forward because we knew if we were seeing what we saw in media and entertainment industries and across all industries that it was going to be in Congress too and that's why we’re going to change the procedures. We've already passed resolution, my bill, on having mandatory training. And we know there's a lot more that we need to do both in Congress, as well as the public at large. So, I think it's important that this not be seen as partisan because the watershed moment where men and women are coming together across the partisan divide to change the culture here, and that's why you are seeing people leaving, Democrat and Republican. There are still some Democrats and Republicans there who have been asked to leave who haven't left yet. But this is still going to be playing out. But let's focus too on the women and their stories because we need to see what their stories are and how we can make them whole. And that's the real problem here, is that women have been denied their careers because of these men in power and it's a power abuse, not really about sex so much."

I’ve heard reports that as many as 30 or 40 members of the House and Senate may face allegations of sexual harassment."

The only reason I wondered, I didn’t wonder into it -- I know this issue is very personal to me, but this isn’t real. Everybody says this is a watershed moment, is this really a watershed moment if it's not real for the tip waitress or the factory worker, or somebody in the law firm or a teacher nurse or a doctor? And we need to look at the way that even those that have the courage to come forward in the last few weeks have been treated and then demonized. And that has been the people -- we are all trying to wrap my head around this. It's happening so fast. And there are names that nobody -- some had heard, some didn't know. We need to make sure that we come out of this, men and women together, changing the culture, working together as we go forward. So, we got to make sure that women who do have the courage to come forward aren't hurt, that their careers are not hurt, they’re treated with respect.

There's a 90-day process, including counseling and a cooling off period before a staffer can file a complaint. The Office of Compliance has paid out more than $17 million in taxpayer funds to secretly settle workplace complaints, not all of them, but certainly some of them about sex harassment. Congresswoman Comstock, you’re working on legislation. What you want to see? How much do you want to streamline that process for women to file complaints? How much disclosure, transparency, do you want to see for people who have settled complaints in the past, and should we be naming past people, or should they somehow be protected?"
    },

      "speaker": "COMSTOCK",

I think we may need to have maybe an outside counsel come in to totally review any of these cases to make sure we get that all out there. So, I do fully support it. But also, the priority needs to be on the victims and fundamentally changing the system so that the victims feel they have a process that works for them and advocates for them. So, we've been advocating either having a counsel or some type of advocate that protects the victims so they feel there's a system that allows them to come forward. But I think first we have to know who in the past, those names should be disclosed. They’re going to come out one way or the other, and they should. As you mentioned, all about -- not at all for sexual harassment. So, whatever sexual harassment should come forward and I believe it will, and I support it. I also support nondisclosure for them not having to honor those nondisclosure agreements. The woman in the Alcee Hastings case contacted my office. I spoke with her this weekend. She's already speaking out and we need to make sure that women like her will be protected to come forward and talk and I fully support protection for them."

The party -- it’s amazing to me, especially that he wrote number one bestseller, \"Giant of the Senate\", supposedly a very funny book. He's a comedian. We all know he’s a comedian.

Having said that, I would add that I think for a lot of women they may feel like, well, you know, in the past when these things came up, there wasn't so much speed about addressing the complaints, that they got swept under the rug. What we’re into right now, though, as these sort of extreme points of view show, is a situation where contrary to Senator Kaine, there isn't a new standard. There is a shifting standard. There is not an established rule here either about what a fireable offense is, or what the procedure should be and at the end of the procedure, what the punishments should be. So, I think, you know, what the Democrats politically are trying to do by ousting Franken is established we are consistent. We are the party that, you know, means what it says and says what it means. I would suspect that's going to be very difficult actually to sustain a consistent view of this because every case is going to be a little different and the politics are going to change constantly, and I think that was the wisdom of your two guests when they said this isn't a partisan matter, because truthfully as cases come along, you were going to see it's very hard to be consistent about this."

They were uncomfortable with what the stories they were hearing and there were sort of this agreement that if one more credible accuser came forward, they would all jump together and ask him to resign, and that's what you saw happen. However, I do think politics is seeping into this. Democrats have longed sort of fashion themselves as a party of women. And right now, they are trying to show their base that they not only spouse this verbally, but they act on this as well, and they’re going to try to claim they have the moral high ground when 2018 comes and say, we pushed our members out who had this issue. However, I do not think this is just Democrats, right? We have a president who is embracing a candidate in Alabama who has been accused of child molestation, right? I know there's a bunch of Republicans on the Hill who are very uncomfortable with this and think that he's only doing this because of politics.

If that's not something that hangs over him and the entire Senate can be more effective at legislating rather than every time he walked down the hall, you have to talk about this, that or the other end, and instead can point to an investigation. It relates to Al Franken. And the other thing that didn't come out in this conversation about Al Franken is that Al Franken had absolutely no interest in being a serious legislator. He introduced 141 pieces of legislation amendments, not a single one in his entire career, including time with the Democrat president, was ever signed into law. Al Franken was a mean-spirited bulldog who had no purpose in the United States Senate if he couldn't be a mean-spirited bulldog, which he couldn't do with these allegations out there. He wasn't interested in being a legislator before. He isn't interested in being a legislator now. I think that's part of why he stepped down.

Presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama all said they were for it but never did anything about it. And this president said it's time. And we think this is actually going to help us fast-ball the peace process going forward."

It's the right thing to do. Israel should be no different. We didn't set any parameters. We didn't say this was the final status. What we said is, we're going to do like we do in every other country and we're going to put the embassy in its capital and we're going to continue and are going to continue the fact that we are as committed to the peace process as we've ever been before.

Are you suggesting that this -- this fight, President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital, to begin to move the embassy there, that the final status of Jerusalem is still up for negotiation, that in a negotiation East Jerusalem could still end up as the capital of the Palestinian state? And, again, if so, why make this move mow?"
    },

      "speaker": "HALEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the president, if you notice in his speech, he made a point not to talk about borders or boundaries. What he did was say that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and that we're moving our embassy there, because he strongly believes that those final status issues should be decided between the Palestinians and the Israelis. No outside group should decide what the final status looks like. And we're leaving it up to them to do that. At the end of the day, they have to be comfortable with the peace process and the resolution that we come up with. We just want to support them in that process."

Israel bashing sessions, constantly trying to find ways to pick at them and -- and we've seen that start to diminish. But I want the Security Council and all of the international community to understand, when you bully Israel, you are not helping the peace process. And we see Israel as one of our best allies. We're not going to put up with it any more. So when we see it, we call them out on it. It's time for them to realize that all of these things they've done to Israel have only hurt the process. We need to treat Palestinians and Israelis fairly. We need to hope that they both come together for a peaceful solution and we need to support both of them.

And this was the president telling the world the truth. And this was him going through with the will of the American people who had asked for 22 years to get this done. And he had the courage to show it and I think a lot of Americans are -- having a huge sigh of relief because of it. And now, hopefully, we can see the peace process really come together."

You say that the world has cut of 90 percent of trade with North Korea, but only 30 percent of oil to North Korea.

So we've done a great job at doing that. China has followed through on the sanctions. But to be clear, China can do more. And we're putting as much pressure on them as we can. The last time they completely cut off the oil, North Korea came to the table. And so we've told China they've got to do more. If they don't do more, we're going to take it into our own hands and then we'll start to deal with secondary sanctions."

You know, diplomacy is great in some respects, but you have to also be honest. And this was something that North Korea needed to hear and the international community needed to hear. North Korea has pushed the envelope to an extreme level. The United States isn't going to put up with it. And the international community has also rallied around saying that North Korea has to denuclearize. But that's just the honest facts.

First, that lead agent, FBI Agent Peter Strzok was taken off the case in July after Mueller learned he was sending anti-Trump messages to a colleague. Second, that top Justice Department Official Bruce Ohr had undisclosed meetings with two people involved with the so-called Russia dossier. Michael, how seriously does this compromise the Mueller investigation?"

Now you look at this. The very best thing that can be said about Peter Strzok is he's completely unprofessional, for someone in that role to be sending anti-Trump pro-Hillary tweets. The FBI refuses -- the Justice Department refuses to talk about what role did this Russian dossier, that now we find out a top Justice Department official was involved in, in talking with the person who put it together, what role did that play in getting a FISA warrant to be able to investigate members of the Trump campaign?

We saw that this week with the clip you played with Goodlatte talking about tainted agents that the FBI needs to rid itself of. They also accuse the FBI, of course, of botching the Clinton email investigation. However I think there's sort of a split right now in the Republican Party and we're going to see that -- evidence of that going forward. There are some, like Devin Nunes, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee that is investigating the investigator, who are calling for the FBI to be held in contempt of Congress. But you have people like Speaker Paul Ryan, Lindsey Graham, Trey Gowdy, the oversight chairman, you don't hear a lot of that coming from them. And so I think there are some Republicans who want to let Mueller do his job and don't want to sort of make this a partisan mudslinging."

The other thing is to look at, you know, Hillary gets discussion I think for four hours, never under oath, so she can't possibly have committed perjury. Meanwhile, you get General Flynn, after 35 years in service. Now, he did something bad. Of course Hillary's top two aides clearly committed perjury, but they don't get attacked. I mean the imbalance in the Justice Department's entire process between the Clinton investigation and going -- the way they've gone after the president is just, I think, staggeringly corrupt.

And the whole idea of honest brokers, though, is breaking down in our country across the board. And people don't trust institutions. They don't trust the federal government. They don't trust the media, et cetera, et cetera. And so when mistakes are made, people will accept them if they're perceived to be made in good faith.
