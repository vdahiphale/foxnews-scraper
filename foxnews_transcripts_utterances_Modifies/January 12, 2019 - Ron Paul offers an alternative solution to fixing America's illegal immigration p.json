Exhibit 1, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer delivered the Democratic response to President Trump's Oval Office address on the border crisis.  Forty million viewers tuned in to see Nancy and Chuck after the President standing awkwardly together at the podium - just one podium.  Americans were more amused by their presentation than informed, and the duo got roasted hard on social media.  Here are some of the best memes: \"American Gothic anyone.\"  How about, \"The twins from \"The Shining.'\"  \"Super villains.\"  There they are, I think that's the Joker in \"Batman.\"  And speaking of super villains, how about this, \"I see Pelosi went with the Dr. Evil outfit.  Who wore it better?\"  And many saw Nancy and Chuck as parents, \"We're not mad, we're just disappointed.\"  And my favorite Face Swap, terrifying.  As Greg Gutfeld said the other day on \"The Five,\" their response should have been followed by quote unquote, \"Paid for by Donald Trump for President.\" Exhibit 2, another political opponent of the President, CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta went down to McAllen, Texas on the U.S.-Mexican border.  Acosta doesn't want a wall and doesn't believe that there is any crisis at the border, but he posted a video that destroyed his own argument.",

There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence here in the McAllen, Texas area.  As a matter of fact, there are some other businesses behind me along this highway.  There's a gas station, Burger King and so on, but no sign of the national emergency that the President has been talking about.  As a matter of fact, it's pretty tranquil down here.",

Here with me now, senior advisor to the Trump 2020 campaign, Katrina Pierson and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, the author of \"Trump:  The Blue Collar President,\" which I read and I highly endorse. All right, guys what did you guys think about my brilliant commentary?  I mean, they just shot themselves in the foot and the Republicans didn't even have to squeeze the trigger.  Go ahead, Katrina.  Ladies first.  KATRINA PIERSON, SENIOR ADVISOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN:  Well, you know, look, Jesse, this was really karma.  You have CNN and Jim Acosta specifically who spend the majority of their days trying to undermine the President and undermine his agenda with a ton of fake news and it turns out, it all came back around full circle today and yesterday, and it's going to continue moving forward because the President has been very courageous in pushing forth very bold policies to secure the southern border of this country, to protect American citizens and as Jim Acosta pointed out, his position is the right position.  Walls work and CNN just showed the entire country the President is right on this issue.",

So listen, I mean we've got to get through this though and we have to get the government reopened because it's going to eventually start to affect things like the stock market and the economy that there's this high level of dysfunctionality. The President's a hundred percent right, but unfortunately the system requires a compromise so hopefully, they'll get to a compromise and get the government back open again because the President's up 28 to zero in terms of what he's done for the economy and I don't want him to lose his lead going into the 2020 elections.  So let's just put this behind us --",

The homeowners were away during the incident, but have since spent hours sanitizing their doorbells.  I'm just going to use the knocker.  Wonder if the perp will get a major tongue lashing in court?  I apologize for that.

Exhibit 1, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer delivered the Democratic response to President Trump's Oval Office address on the border crisis.  Forty million viewers tuned in to see Nancy and Chuck after the President standing awkwardly together at the podium - just one podium."

So listen, I mean we've got to get through this though and we have to get the government reopened because it's going to eventually start to affect things like the stock market and the economy that there's this high level of dysfunctionality. The President's a hundred percent right, but unfortunately the system requires a compromise so hopefully, they'll get to a compromise and get the government back open again because the President's up 28 to zero in terms of what he's done for the economy and I don't want him to lose his lead going into the 2020 elections.  So let's just put this behind us --"

Bush, 13; President Obama, 12.  I mean, declaring national emergencies is not something like out of thin air, it's been done by other Commanders-in-Chiefs in the past.  Are you hearing that this is in the pipeline?"

I mean look, President Obama had declared one over swine flu for Pete's sakes and I'm not saying that to diminish the seriousness of swine flu, but we have people crossing our border by the thousands.  We have no idea who they are.  We know that we're catching people who shouldn't be here in the sense that they are criminal illegal aliens.  We know people who are on terrorist watch lists are coming across and I find it hard to believe that that national security implication doesn't rise to the level of an emergency situation."

In my opinion, the Democrat policies of open borders, that's created the crisis because that's attracting them and because the legal loopholes, you can't hold people.  You've got to do catch and release and you can't keep people together, you can't separate them.  It's a mess.  Thirty seconds, go ahead."

So, yes, I think that's a tremendous incentive.  I think, believe it or not, there might be some political aspects to this where some of the political parties or maybe there's one particular political party that thinks they're going to get more votes that will vote for more welfare."

But this is a big problem because you know, the citizenship is very, very easy.  I've delivered women who just show up here and they can quickly -- because the child was born here, they can quickly get on welfare and I just don't think that should exist. The whole thing is the people who qualify for welfare and you say, well, if they think it's immoral to build a wall, what would people think if I say I wouldn't even give them any welfare benefit.  Of course, a good Libertarian - a great libertarian doesn't believe in the welfare redistribution anyway.

No, on my program, my little program that I have, I was excited about what was happening in Syria and I cheered him on, but I sort of kept my fingers crossed what would happen and lo and behold, you know, it's slowing up there.  It was not going as fast, but I'd do anything to encourage the President to do what's right.

And I was on my way to film a porn scene in Las Vegas, but I'd brought my Bible, so I had the Bible with me on the airplane and I was reading the Book of Revelation and I read the scripture that basically said you know I have this thing against you, you tolerate that woman named Jezebel.  She leads my people into sexual immorality.  I've given her time to repent and if she doesn't repent, I'll cast her and her children into a sickbed. That's not a very fun scripture to read when on your way to film a porn scene, but then God really started to bring grace to that scripture and he said Brittni, this isn't the life that I have for you.  The life that I have for you is going to overflow with so much peace and so much joy and if you'll just quit the industry today, I'll bless your life like no man ever could. And so I quit the porn industry, I started going to church.  God miraculously healed me from my drug addiction.  I've been sober for six years and now, I get to preach the gospel and I travel the world to evangelize and God has really blessed my life like no man ever could."

      "utterance": "Time now for \"Last Call.\"  We heard about this thing in California.  This guy gets intimate with a doorknob and a doorbell.  We'll show you the whole thing, look at this.  No joke.  Police say this guy, Roberto Arroyo spent three hours lurking around a home in Salinas last week licking the doorbell and even relieving himself in the front yard.  He's also accused of stealing a few extension cords that were used for Christmas decorations.  I wonder what he did with those? The homeowners were away during the incident, but have since spent hours sanitizing their doorbells.  I'm just going to use the knocker.  Wonder if the perp will get a major tongue lashing in court?  I apologize for that. That's all for us tonight.  Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and remember, I'm Watters, and this is my world. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
