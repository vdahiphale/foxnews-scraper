We're going to get exclusive reaction from the White House when Kellyanne Conway joins us live. Mary Matalin makes a rare television appearance and Matt Schlap will be along as well. And one week after his fiery defense of Judge Kavanaugh becoming the rallying cry for conservatives, Lindsey Graham joins me tonight on where things stand now and where they go from here. Plus, an \"Ingraham Angle\" investigation. We've been doing some digging into just how Christine Ford's name was leaked. Stay here for that. But first, the Democrats desperate salvage operation. That is the focus of tonight's ANGLE. After another week of delay in the Kavanaugh confirmation saga, the FBI supplemental report is in. And it appears the Democrats have lost another one. SEN.

But as we've come to expect, straightforward, factual revelations have zero influence on Democrats going wild across America. For instance, at the University of Vermont, they held a cancel class, cancel Kavanaugh rally. How clever. In Brooklyn, New York, in Bel Air, Maryland, there were similar calls to kill Kavanaugh's nomination. And here in Washington, D.C., the hate machine was ramped up to full throttle.",

Still, the Democrats will not give up. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D—CAL.: The most notable part of this report is what's not in it. As we noted by the White House, the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview Dr. Blasey Ford. SEN.

Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, said he wouldn't be available on Saturday at any point, even if there was a vote for Kavanaugh who he strongly supports. Daines was slated to be in Montana walking his daughter down the aisle. Originally his office told FOX News with the fluid timing of the FBI report release they couldn't avoid a potential schedule conflict. But FOX News can confirm he spoke tonight directly with Brett Kavanaugh. His office says he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed. Now, without Daines on the Hill for that vote, the math would have been critical for McConnell. He would have needed every single one and the 50 remaining Republicans to vote yes. That has been Flake, Murkowski, and Collins, or two of those three plus Manchin. Now the Senate is slated to convene tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m., and by rule this triggers the procedural vote at 10:30. If the Senate invokes cloture at 11:00, they then have 30 hours max until the confirmation vote. If they take all of that 30 hours, this puts us at about 5:00 p.m., Laura, on Saturday for the vote.",

We're going to get exclusive reaction from the White House when Kellyanne Conway joins us live. Mary Matalin makes a rare television appearance and Matt Schlap will be along as well. And one week after his fiery defense of Judge Kavanaugh becoming the rallying cry for conservatives, Lindsey Graham joins me tonight on where things stand now and where they go from here. Plus, an \"Ingraham Angle\" investigation. We've been doing some digging into just how Christine Ford's name was leaked. Stay here for that. But first, the Democrats desperate salvage operation. That is the focus of tonight's ANGLE. After another week of delay in the Kavanaugh confirmation saga, the FBI supplemental report is in. And it appears the Democrats have lost another one. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, D—K.Y.: What we know for sure is at the FBI report did not corroborate any of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh."

But as we've come to expect, straightforward, factual revelations have zero influence on Democrats going wild across America. For instance, at the University of Vermont, they held a cancel class, cancel Kavanaugh rally. How clever. In Brooklyn, New York, in Bel Air, Maryland, there were similar calls to kill Kavanaugh's nomination. And here in Washington, D.C., the hate machine was ramped up to full throttle."

Well, Rasmussen's daily tracking poll has the president's approval today at 50 percent, not bad. A new poll finds it at 40 percent, a four- point gain from last month. And even better, that same poll shows that the supercharged enthusiasm is on the Republican side. The Democrats advantage tanked from 11 points last month to just two points this month. Still, the Democrats will not give up. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, D—CAL.: The most notable part of this report is what's not in it. As we noted by the White House, the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh nor did the FBI interview Dr. Blasey Ford. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D—N.Y.: Given how limited these documents were and how limited the scope of this investigation was, we are reiterating our call that the documents with proper redaction be made public.

Jobless claims have dropped to a 49 year low. We now have 4.2 percent GDP growth with projections now to match or exceed that in the upcoming quarter. Manufacturing jobs -- remember President Obama said they were never coming back -- are growing at the fastest rate in 23 years. Trump's Republican Party is actually offering something called results.

And we feel pretty confident. I'm not going to go ahead of those who are still sitting on the fence, but I will tell you, Laura, that there are some red state Democrats who have a really terrible decision to make. They either have to exceed to the role of their voters who want Judge Kavanaugh confirmed, want that ninth seat filled in the United States Supreme Court, which just started it's new session. Or, they can go and be complacent with the process that has been fraught with hysterics and hyperbole and hyper-partisanship and hapless Democrats trying to undo election results from two years ago, trying to slow down this nomination to get ahead of the midterms elections this year and they have to decide whether they are going to be a part of that leftward drift. They own all of those protesters if they vote against Judge Kavanaugh. They own all the hysterics, all the craziness that you see there.

He should definitely stop lying about the FBI and this investigation and what the White House did or didn't do. The people that Dr. Ford herself claims couldn't corroborate her allegations were part of the FBI supplemental investigation. And guess what? They couldn't corroborate her allegation it turns out. You have these 10 sitting senators who have very respectfully come forward and said they think this is a thorough investigation. One of them said there is not a hint of any misconduct and that the allegations have not been corroborated. The point is this.

Either Dr. Ford is a terrible victim in all of this because she did want to stay confidential or Dr. Ford, in combination with these Democrat staffers and members or may be Anna Eshoo, the Democrat that started this whole thing, and maybe with the lawyers who they found for here, they were trying aggressively to push Dr. Ford to be public.

A source tells one reporter, may be a source tells two reporters. Reporters talk to each other. Nobody quite wants to go with it because it's an explosive allegation. They don't have the complainant on the record, but eventually it gets out there and somebody goes and tries to ambush the person or hang out or stalk them. And that is how it eventually gets printed.

To the three Republicans, you're all friends of mine, if you were a yes before this debacle, please be a yes now because everything they said about him, Judge Kavanaugh, has fallen apart. He is a good man. Seven FBI investigations, 156 people interviewed or a 26 year period. All this stuff is garbage."

And Democrats are pledging, some, that if they take the House they could very well move to impeach Brett Kavanaugh. Getting him convicted will be very difficult to do.

And I can't believe in America you have to prove yourself innocent. You're guilty just by the accusation, that there's no requirement to corroborate because you're a Republican. If a Democratic male nominee were treated by the Republicans as Kavanaugh was treated by the Democrats, every media outlet in the country would be up in arms."

So what happens in an FBI investigation like this anyway? We wanted to hear from two men, decades of experience in background checks between them. Here is studio with me is Steve Pomerantz. He's a former FBI assistant director. And from Phoenix, John Iannarelli. He's a former FBI national spokesperson and special agent. Gentlemen, great to have you both with us. Steve, I want to start with you. What do you make of the Democrats complaint that this couldn't be an investigation question, only five days, and given the timeline?"

      "utterance": "Let's start with the reality here. There's not a one of them who was ever interested in the truth to begin with. If the FBI would've spent two weeks, they would've wanted seven weeks. If the FBI would have interviewed 1,000 people they would have wanted 2,000. If they went back to grade school, they would want the FBI to go back to preschool to see what happened there. So let's start with that as a reality. They did a surgical investigation of focusing on some specific allegations that were made. And that is what they did. That is what they set out to do, and that is what they did. Kind of end of story, but it is not the end of the story, we both know that. And it is never going to end."

And that without that, what does this all mean? This is just a big rush job by the Republicans get this thing done. Is there any way, shape, or form that this could be reopened at this late date, or is this just a silly howling at the moon at this point?"

This case is not going to be reopened for the simple fact this is investigation number seven. It's not a lean report. There's 40 solid pages, single space type. A lot of information. Just like Steve said, every detail was narrowed down to what this very surgical investigation was. It is complete."

Actually, I was hoping they would interview her, because she has told her story more than once, but never been subject to a serious interview. I would want to say, but a penetrative, exhaustive, face to face, impartial investigation. And that would've happened had the FBI interviewed her. I know we are dealing in a very sensitive area when it comes to people who allege these kinds of activities, but nevertheless, I am sure the bureau would have done that, and I think it would've been a good thing to do. So it's a matter of --"

      "utterance": "But earlier tonight, a new wrench in the plan. Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, said he wouldn't be available on Saturday at any point, even if there was a vote for Kavanaugh who he strongly supports. Daines was slated to be in Montana walking his daughter down the aisle. Originally his office told FOX News with the fluid timing of the FBI report release they couldn't avoid a potential schedule conflict. But FOX News can confirm he spoke tonight directly with Brett Kavanaugh. His office says he has made arrangements to be there to get him across the finish line as needed. Now, without Daines on the Hill for that vote, the math would have been critical for McConnell. He would have needed every single one and the 50 remaining Republicans to vote yes. That has been Flake, Murkowski, and Collins, or two of those three plus Manchin. Now the Senate is slated to convene tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m., and by rule this triggers the procedural vote at 10:30. If the Senate invokes cloture at 11:00, they then have 30 hours max until the confirmation vote. If they take all of that 30 hours, this puts us at about 5:00 p.m., Laura, on Saturday for the vote."
