So, we all agree separation sucks, but when faced with child sex trafficking and a tripling of pretend families, where is your answer?

He doesn't like it because it just deals with this particular issue, but he might have to be for what's going to happen here. And get that, take that part, get that off the table.

Why don't the Democrats like crying Chuck just get on board to this piecemeal bill send it to the president's desk. They could do that right now but they don't want to do it because they want to exploit it.  Dianne Feinstein has legislation sign which is absolutely ridiculous. She says border patrol agents can't even arrest and detain an adult with a child, illegal, within 100 miles of the southern border. What's that going to do? That's just going to encourage more people for bringing in children into the southern hemisphere. So, you know, Kate Steinle was also separated by her family with a bullet fired by an illegal alien felon who was deported five times, and the Democrats didn't really say much about that. So, when they complain now, it's like hard to take seriously. No one wants to see family separated. I don't want to see families separated. But fix the law. Fix the law.

What we're at least trying to do here in a responsible way and in a careful way is identify who the child is, the minor, who is the adult accompanying the child, and make sure that in fact there is a match, and that they are a relative, and properly should be in that person's, you know, I guess like custody, so to speak.

Folks who stopped that are now shocked to see people fleeing those very countries. And now everyone is alive with condemnation, but pressed for an alternative, they've got nothing. And we're waiting for one. Something no White House before has actually produced. So, we all agree separation sucks, but when faced with child sex trafficking and a tripling of pretend families, where is your answer? Instead, the media uses children to maintain the narrative that Trump is evil, even as he reduces the threat of nuclear war, and with no memory of what they reported when their guy was president.

Everybody on the bus and you're across the border. You do it again, it's a felony and you will be separated. Something liked that. That would mean, OK, like, we don't want to do that. And I agree like -- the people who are being tasked with carrying out this six week old policy, they don't want to have to do it, but they're carrying out the request of the president and the policy. And then, also, I do think that there's this narrow path. So, Ted Cruz has an option, I guess the president will probably talk about it. He doesn't like it because it just deals with this particular issue, but he might have to be for what's going to happen here. And get that, take that part, get that off the table. Maybe get some additional judges because I think the other thing is that we should talk about and it's difficult to talk about for me, I think, is the -- what's the asylum process? What's the bar?"

I also think that if you're going to have this policy and you want to own it, then plan ahead and figure out what's the process of getting the children back in touch with their families because the reports of them not being able to do so is difficult. The last thing I would say is we have to figure out a way to collectively go after the drug cartels and not each other, because it's actually the drug cartels that are stealing a lot of this."

    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Whether the Democrats realize it or not, doing what they want to do actually helps the child smugglers. And no one wants that. And Ted Cruz has a bill. It's right here. It's piecemeal. He says families get united. We doubled the number of immigration judges. And asylum case takes 14 days. That keeps everything together. Why don't the Democrats like crying Chuck just get on board to this piecemeal bill send it to the president's desk. They could do that right now but they don't want to do it because they want to exploit it. Dianne Feinstein has legislation sign which is absolutely ridiculous. She says border patrol agents can't even arrest and detain an adult with a child, illegal, within 100 miles of the southern border. What's that going to do? That's just going to encourage more people for bringing in children into the southern hemisphere. So, you know, Kate Steinle was also separated by her family with a bullet fired by an illegal alien felon who was deported five times, and the Democrats didn't really say much about that. So, when they complain now, it's like hard to take seriously. No one wants to see family separated. I don't want to see families separated. But fix the law. Fix the law. He's not going to end catch and release. That's not happening."

I mean, at the heart of it, people do care about children and we care about families, but you have to understand how we arrived in this position which is people breaking the law. And even if we put them on the bus back, who's to say that they're not with the sex trafficker and you return them back with that person. What we're at least trying to do here in a responsible way and in a careful way is identify who the child is, the minor, who is the adult accompanying the child, and make sure that in fact there is a match, and that they are a relative, and properly should be in that person's, you know, I guess like custody, so to speak. And, you know, a parental right. This is very difficult. I have a hard time, though, accepting that it's OK to demonize ICE agents, and border patrol, and the president, and the administration, all saying that they're mean-spirited and they want children abused."

But, again, the laws must be upheld, and there must be some procedure by which they are identified properly so as to not make mistake. Can you imagine the outrage if we went ahead and let somebody go with a sex offender and really encouraged and were acting essentially in concert aiding and abetting sex trafficking.

And whether you focus on those emails, texts, disgusting. I'm a former federal employee. Disgusting. Let's just say. It's disgusting whether it's saying those things about Mr. Trump, or saying those things about Mrs. Clinton. They are not hired to text each other about their personal dislike of a particular candidate, blah, blah, blah. That being said, the office of professional responsibility must now do their job and remove those who are still in the employment of the federal government. Beyond that, I think this report tells us a lot about Mr. Comey's state of mind, the fact that he was insubordinate. The fact that he believed that he alone could deliver the so-called message to the American people, didn't have to check with his boss. So, there's a lot to learn in this. I haven't read all of it because as you know there are no pictures. I read faster when I see pictures. But it is a story that we need to know.

They stopped, because they got so tired. Cruz ended up winning and beating him 11-9, I believe. And it was just a pathetic display. I'm going to suspend \"The View\" strategy. I'm going to criticize Jimmy Kimmel here, even though I might appear on his show at some point down the line. That was not good basketball. And you challenged Cruz, and you lost to Ted Cruz in basketball."
