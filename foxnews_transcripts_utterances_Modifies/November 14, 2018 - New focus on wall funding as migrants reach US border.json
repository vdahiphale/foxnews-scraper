It's like driving to the second hospital you see when you're shot, not the first one. It doesn't make any sense. So that's a contradiction. But the problem here is that Americans are good people. We like immigrants. We are immigrants. But this politically motivated phenomenon triggered our sense of unfairness and line cutting. So you see people get upset about it because they feel that America is being taken advantage of. If we just -- and by the way, the reason why they're getting there faster is there are buses now. So there's always questions that nobody answered. For example, how did this start? Who started it? How are these people being fed and clothed and where are the bathrooms? And then, how can they go so far so quickly? And we're seeing now that they're using transportation.

So, although a lot of people may not like the president's rhetoric or make fun of him talking about the wall, I think what's important to note is that his strong action on this and his strong words on that, I think are really preventing people from getting even closer. But the most important thing I think is what Geraldo said, that the true people that we have to look at from a national security perspective are not the economic migrants or the refugees. The real problem are the gangs and the MS-13, and that's why you need the military and that's why you need to beef up ICE. And that's why Mattis is down there because this is about national security.

The Democrats have already said they would fund the wall. Make them stand up.  Make them do that. The elections have consequences. He's earned his wall, just as the dreamers have earned their path to citizenship. But I have to say you referenced something that Secretary Mattis said about 100 years ago, 150 years ago Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, California, and all these other states belonged to Mexico. So there's a special relationship that has to be recognized. We have 7 million unfilled jobs in this country. We have fruit and vegetables dying on the vine. I think we have to get off the dime. We have to force our political leaders, right and left, red, blue, Republican and Democrat to fix this problem. Enough already. Enough grandstanding."

The one thing that drives me crazy about this is that whenever you are for the law and order process, whether it is for prisons, strong borders or terror, the opposing side is always going to say that you're against a certain group of people. You're always going to be painted as mean. So if you have a strong border, you don't like brown people. If you're -- if you want -- if you're strong on terror, you're Islamophobic. If you're for a strong criminal justice system, you just want to incarcerate more blacks, which, actually, President Trump show today he's not. But the point is, if you're a law and order person, the only argument that you're going to get in response is that you're just a mean bigots, and I think that really diminishes the debate."

So now you have machines that need WD-40 and mechanic flown in from the Midwest who can ram a horn under it and basically get things working again because there's smoke coming out.

A lot of them are coming back to outer heartbreak, such as the owner of this property, completely destroyed. And take a look down here at my feet, Kennedy, this is about 6 inches to a foot of pure ash. Imagine the amount of material that has to burn for there to be that much ash over such a wide area. And I can tell you a little bit about this neighborhood, Kennedy. This is a street I used to live on. This is not a street of millionaires. It's not a street of mansions. It's ordinary, hardworking Americans. The gentleman, for instance, who own this property used to come out and encourage my then 5-year-old daughter when I was teaching her to ride a bike on this street right here. That's my old house up ahead of us. This guy who owns this property, John, he's lost absolutely everything he's ever worked for, everything he's ever had.

Once the winds blow, once the Santa Ana blows, it should be computable to say, OK, the wild brush has now not burned for two years. I'm making it up. Two and a half years, six months.  The humidity is below 25 percent, the wind is blowing above 12 percent.  You know this is going to happen. How is it that those people burned in their cars, not being able to escape? How is it that they weren't evacuated earlier? How is it that those -- they didn't block those roads, those canyon roads?

It's like when you leave your house with the door unlocked, you may get away with it but everybody knows you're leaving during this. So the thing is, the problem with looting isn't theft.

I mean, there has to be some consequences for this. To which we say you know what? We know that there's a five-year drought.  We know how high-risk it is right now. And it's just -- I think it's simply unacceptable in America today to have this many people burned to death in their cars, as you said. It's really tragic. It's really sad. But I would say, for every negative story, I was looking at a wonderful story earlier today about Lady Gaga delivering pizza to many of the -- to many of the firefighters and aid workers.
