Maybe tonight would be a good time for a chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot.\"  Here on THE STORY, the former chair of the House Oversight Committee, said this about Gaetz's tweet about Cohen when asked if that was a mistake.",

A friend of mine named, Randall Hunt. And -- you know, Governor DeSantis said, \"Well, you know, I appreciate you doing that for me.\" I said, \"Hey Governor, I was happy to do it for you. You just keep killing it.\"   And what's crazy is that even though Governor DeSantis told The Atlantic that he and I were on the phone, that we had that discussion, they still haven't issued a retraction or taken down their allegation. And it continues to be repeated across the mainstream media, in the Washington Examiner, in the Miami Herald.  And so, look, what -- I made a mistake. I should not have invoked someone's family.

KAYLEIGH MCENANY, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 2020 CAMPAIGN: No, there's zero chance of that happening. I can tell you the President is excited for this campaign. He's geared up. He's ready. And I'm sure Nancy Pelosi does not want him to run because how can you argue against results, a soaring economy, wages growing at the fastest pace in ten years, remedying our trade imbalances across the world. You can't argue against success. So that's a pretty pathetic message from Nancy Pelosi.

He used the paychecks of federal workers as a hostage because he didn't get his wall. So yes, he's had some accomplishments but at the same times he's had a lot of failures. I mean, he costs millions of people off of -- off of health care alone, prescription drugs were supposed to go down under this president. That hasn't happened.

The Democratic Party, their leaders today are not creating space for that kind of conversation. It's all about what's being done to people and in this case two young men of color. And it's about clinging on to narratives where young men of color are not the moral agents that we're focused on. We are focused on when they are victims like in the hoax case of Jussie Smollett but not focused on situations where they are both victims and perpetrators. Where they are the moral agents determining what the outcomes are for their families, for their communities, for their neighborhoods, their cities and that's why there is no space for that conversation in the Democratic Party today as I see it.

And he was calling to thank me not about Michael Cohen or payoffs to porn stars, but because I had made a recommendation to him for someone to serve on the Orlando Airport board. A friend of mine named, Randall Hunt. And -- you know, Governor DeSantis said, \"Well, you know, I appreciate you doing that for me.\" I said, \"Hey Governor, I was happy to do it for you. You just keep killing it.\" And what's crazy is that even though Governor DeSantis told The Atlantic that he and I were on the phone, that we had that discussion, they still haven't issued a retraction or taken down their allegation. And it continues to be repeated across the mainstream media, in the Washington Examiner, in the Miami Herald. And so, look, what -- I made a mistake. I should not have invoked someone's family. And I am here to take responsibility and to say that I'm sorry. But when the media goes after President Trump when they tell lies about me, about when they repeat the lies that Jussie Smollett showed, like it really enrages a lot of forgotten men and women in this country who are tired of the media's all-out attack in the absence of facts, and we saw that again today. So, I hope that Isaac Dovere in The Atlantic will retract something that Governor De Santis has already told them was false."

Now, I'm not going to get in the business of talking to the media about every time I chat with my friend, the president or every time we discuss advice or an issue before the country. But I certainly could tell you that there is false reporting about me, there is -- there is no proof like we live in a world now, Martha, where the media can report something that I was on the phone with the president. They can have no source, no witness, no identifiable person. And then, in the echo chamber of the media, they just continue to report it despite the fact that it is a lie.

And I am grateful that he accepted my apology and the spirit that it was intended in a raucous political discourse, and an investigations. We can disagree about substance, we can look for ways to expose inconsistent statements, but we can do that with -- without invoking family. And look, Martha, the reason your network has me on a lot is because I'm one of the leading voices defending the president. This was an error on my part, but my errors are not errors of omission, they're errors of commission where I do a little too much, fight a little too hard, and this time I cross the line and I hope that it's a better sign of valor that I'm willing to admit that."

What about the Florida Bar Association, they say that if the rules were violated because obviously, you are well aware of the rules of witness intimidation and how it works in the law.

I mean, like when Kamala Harris was saying terrible things about Brett Kavanaugh, both inside and outside the halls of Congress, like should the California Bar investigate her for conduct that brings disfavor or puts the profession of the practice of law in a bad light? They didn't do that, they shouldn't do that. And so, look, I'll deal with the Florida Bar if they -- if they send me a notification.

Now, he was vilified in the media for allegedly taunting a Native American man you can see right there. The Washington Post reported extensively on this. Sandman's attorney announced they would actually sue the Post for defamation for $250 million. But as you say, the Washington Post, they have issued this editor's note, they say \"Subsequent reporting, a student statement and additional video allow for a more complete assessment of what occurred either contradicting or failing to confirm accounts provided in that story.\" Now we do know that the Washington Post says including that Native American activist Nathan Phillips was prevented by one student from moving on and that his group has been taunted by the students in the lead-up to the encounter nd the students were trying to investigate a conflict. Now, that is coming from the Washington Post tonight, a rare editor's note from them.

He's ready. And I'm sure Nancy Pelosi does not want him to run because how can you argue against results, a soaring economy, wages growing at the fastest pace in ten years, remedying our trade imbalances across the world.

But what I will say about Pelosi is that maybe is she thinking that the president shouldn't run considering that he's imploded the deficit. It's risen by 40 percent. He used the paychecks of federal workers as a hostage because he didn't get his wall. So yes, he's had some accomplishments but at the same times he's had a lot of failures. I mean, he costs millions of people off of -- off of health care alone, prescription drugs were supposed to go down under this president. That hasn't happened. Instead he's given tax cuts to pharmaceutical companies. So maybe that's the reason why she's saying he shouldn't run.

      "utterance": "Well, what President Obama is doing is reminding young men that would believe in them and we high expectations of them. And just because they encounter unfairness in the world doesn't mean they have to lower their own expectations of themselves and their own behavior. The Democratic Party, their leaders today are not creating space for that kind of conversation. It's all about what's being done to people and in this case two young men of color. And it's about clinging on to narratives where young men of color are not the moral agents that we're focused on. We are focused on when they are victims like in the hoax case of Jussie Smollett but not focused on situations where they are both victims and perpetrators. Where they are the moral agents determining what the outcomes are for their families, for their communities, for their neighborhoods, their cities and that's why there is no space for that conversation in the Democratic Party today as I see it. So, when President Obama is reminding young men, we expect big things from you. We don't expect to you lower yourself because of what other people think of you or do to you, that is a message that doesn't seem to have a home in the Democratic Party today."

With that being said, when the odds are stacked against them, when you have you public schools that are falling apart, when you have teachers that aren't properly funded, when you have lack of opportunity in their community, it's hard for you to overcome all of those things, right? And I think that is the debate that we really need to be having in this country. How do we create a system where no matter what zip code you live in you have access to a high-quality public education? And if we could fix that problem where Democrats and Republicans could work together on that, then maybe, just maybe, we could have a conversation to ensure that black men can achieve at the same rate that white men do."

But when you peal back that onion what you find is that in some people are getting all the benefits and some people aren't. And what you have created is an unbalanced play -- of level -- you've created unleveled playing field. And what we have got to do if we really believe in one America and I believe in it, we've got to fight to ensure that we have a balanced playing field for everybody. And this goes beyond race.

Both were befriended by Jackson when they were young boys and both were brought to his Neverland ranch where they claim the abuse began first with light touching, then with kissing and then with Jackson performing oral sex on them and vice versa. Wade Robson claims his abuse went on for seven years. But the men now say they were never frightened because Michael Jackson convinced them what they were doing was in the context of a close, loving relationship. Robson says he eventually pushed the memories away until he imagined Michael Jackson abusing his own son. Watch."

Both Robson and Safechuck denied that they had been molested. In fact, during Michael Jackson's 2005 criminal trial for sexual abuse which I covered gavel to gavel, the testimony given by Wade Robson denying abuse was largely credited for Michael Jackson's acquittal.

So, is he lying now or was he lying then? I cannot credit this and I have to recall also the judge and his 2005 case which I also covered remarking how all of these victims, you know, told their stories to the tabloids rather than to investigators. So, to me, there is nothing new it is graphic, the detail is very vivid, but it would also seem to me to be in their best interest to tell the most dramatic story possible. I would like to know the financial arrangements between these two young men and HBO, Martha."

And you know, he was always surrounding himself with children everywhere he went. And when you look at the way that people who do abuse children, and you know, I'm just observing all of this as we watch this documentary and I listen to you, you know, it was like grooming on steroids at Neverland. Candy, free candy, animals, your birthday party. The sleepover parties. He, you know, I mean, it is so hard to not -- to discount their stories given everything that we've all seen over the years."

But I have spent quite a bit, I did spend quite a bit of time with Michael Jackson in Neverland and also when he was in exile in the days leading up to that trial. He was frightened. He was paranoid he didn't know who to trust. He had just been burned by Martin Bashir, the British journalist who ingratiated himself with Michael for eight months and devastated him with an expose that I thought was grotesquely unfair, you know. Just because Michael Jackson is weird and just because Neverland was this creation, this Disneyland-like creation doesn't make him a molester. I don't know. All I know is that Robson told a very vivid story in 2005 very convincing, it was because of his exculpatory testimony I think that Michael Jackson beat the 2005 rap --"

But there are so much commentary about pants suits versus dresses and striking what kind of colors pop. We think about this kind of stuff all the time being on television, you know, a visual medium when you go to the debates. And to Deirdre, to your point about people not liking the Clintons, that's absolutely correct. But Hillary Clinton was bearing the brunt of a lot of damage that her husband did.
