Vice President Biden's children will not sit in nor his family members will sit in -- well, they won't sit in on Cabinet meetings as though they are high- ranking government officials. And they will not have any foreign business dealings. So, that is the commitment that Vice President Biden has made. That's frankly a commitment that was upheld in the Obama-Biden White House, and that's what we continue to do if elected president.  That's more than -- way more than we can say for Donald Trump and how he's running his administration. And if we really want to talk about corruption, Martha, if you really want to talk about the swamp, look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to the Trump administration.  Right now, I think, Nancy Pelosi -- Speaker Pelosi is going to a podium somewhere to speak from the House about what the House Democrats and the House across the board is planning to do in terms of this impeachment inquiry.

On the other side, you have Kurdish fighters and their U.S. allies, the U.S. is pulling out and now the Kurds have invited in Syrian government forces and their allies, the Russians. So, you have the U.S. leaving and the Russians coming in on the surface, in the short term, it looks like a loss for the U.S. a gain in prestige, influence, power for the Russians. If you look at a strategic city right now along the border, you have Russian forces playing the role that the U.S. used to play. As the mediator in the middle. On the one side, Syrian government forces, on the other side Turkish government forces right in the middle of the Russians negotiating, being the dealmaker between both sides. They may be trying to pull off a ceasefire before the U.S. does. So, it certainly looks like a win for Russia at least in the short term but keep in mind, you know, this is just the start of what could be a very ugly war. Turkey is trying to do very grand things, it's trying to push in along a 200-mile border, 20 miles deep into Syria. It wants to resettle two million Syrian refugees, to take two million people from Turkey, move them back into Syria, and to do all this while fighting the Kurds. Turkey has a modern powerful military but we've seen less modern militaries do quite well in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Kurds could be fighting Turkey for a long time. So, in the short term, is Russia a winner? Many people are saying yes. But check back in five years and see how this fight could be going. Martha, back to you.",

But her accounts are being met with a little bit of pushback from some CIA officers. Amaryllis Fox is the author of \"Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA\" is here in moments. But first, chief breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher with the back story here tonight. TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Martha, Amaryllis Fox claims current and former CIA officials confirmed that she worked for the agency from roughly 2002 to 2010, first as an analyst in CIA headquarters then in the National Clandestine Service. That's the arm of the CIA that spies overseas. The book is replete with fascinating details and harrowing accounts, it is also surrounded by controversy because she submitted the book for publication without approval from the CIA's publication review board. The board is there to make sure no secrets are being revealed or lives put in danger. Fox said she gave the CIA a manuscript more than a year ago corrected a few minor suggestions made by the agency and hasn't heard back. But the book reportedly includes the sort of details that the CIA has censored from other books like when Amaryllis Fox pose as an art dealer in China seeking to infiltrate nefarious networks that acquire nuclear weapons. And because Fox claims she operated under the non-official cover or NOC, the details are especially sensitive because that means she pose as a private citizen, not a diplomat leaving her without diplomatic protections. And in the book, she talks about things like the CIA, obtaining false I.D.'s for motor vehicles and passport agencies, information many believe the nation's top spies are not eager to share. Fox acknowledges changing certain facts and names to protect national security but says any fictionalization is inconsequential. But some former CIA agents think much of the book might be fiction and they point to the climactic scene where Fox claims she met alone with Al Qaeda terrorists in an effort to stop them from setting off a radiation bomb in Pakistan. She says the meeting was successful. Her critics say the agency would never would have sent an American case officer alone to meet with dangerous extremists. Fox maintains the book is absolutely true even if every detail is not. Martha.",

I'll say this. In a Biden White House, unlike in a Trump White House, Vice President Biden's children will not have offices in the West Wing. Vice President Biden's children will not sit in nor his family members will sit in -- well, they won't sit in on Cabinet meetings as though they are high- ranking government officials. And they will not have any foreign business dealings. So, that is the commitment that Vice President Biden has made. That's frankly a commitment that was upheld in the Obama-Biden White House, and that's what we continue to do if elected president. That's more than -- way more than we can say for Donald Trump and how he's running his administration. And if we really want to talk about corruption, Martha, if you really want to talk about the swamp, look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to the Trump administration. Right now, I think, Nancy Pelosi -- Speaker Pelosi is going to a podium somewhere to speak from the House about what the House Democrats and the House across the board is planning to do in terms of this impeachment inquiry. And Donald Trump is engulfed in the scandal of his own making, Martha because he stood on the White House lawn and asked foreign governments to interfere in our election. That's what this has talked about."

But I'll let them take that on themselves, and we're going to talk about some of that in the next block as I said. With regard to this coming from the Biden campaign, a story in Bloomberg, Biden camp warns rivals off attacks on his family in the Ohio debate. Saying that no one who calls themselves a Democrat should bring up these discredited lies about Biden and his son, they would be making a profound statement about themselves. Have you guys passed that message along because, you know, three of the opponents who are going to be up there tonight, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Beto O'Rourke have all said that they would never allow a family member to have the kind of arrangement sitting on boards with -- in Ukraine and China, two countries that the vice president was in charge of overseeing relationships with.

Cory Booker, who Senator Booker who noted, if you're going to -- if you want to get to Joe Biden on this, you're going to have to come through me.

Joe Biden the other day was asked, what did you have a conflict of interest? And he said I'm not going to answer that. Let's talk about Donald Trump. That's what they're trying to do and what the problem of that is, it's possible that Donald Trump did something wrong in that phone call with Ukraine, and Joe Biden did something wrong in how he dealt with these -- with these issues with Hunter Biden's foreign business dealings. The two things are not -- you know, incompatible. And so, they can't just push this off and say, look at Donald Trump and what he's doing and not address the fact that they had -- that Joe Biden had a major conflict of interest created by his son's business dealings in Ukraine and China when he was leading U.S. policy in both country."

If those -- if that would be a problem for him if you're president, why wasn't a problem when you were vice president?

Bolton said to Hill, according to her testimony, \"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\" He also reportedly described Rudy Giuliani as a \"hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.\" Giuliani is saying today that he is disappointed in John Bolton as tensions between those and current past ties to the president appear to boil over.

What I can tell you is the conversations the President and I have about this center around a much broader problem and that is the fact that there are several people in the federal government who consistently and dangerously leaked information about our national security to the press. It puts -- it puts people's lives at risk. It's got to stop. And it happens all too often. We've seen so many of the President's calls leak, whether it was with Mexico, or with Australia, obviously, Ukraine was an issue. But it isn't just these shadowy people in the federal government, it's also members of Congress. Adam Schiff lied to the American people and he lied directly to members of Congress when he tried to pass off his own deranged demented words as that of the President. In fact, if the call between President Zelensky and President Trump was so damning and damaging, why didn't he just read the text of the call? It wasn't, so he didn't."

Maybe he -- I don't know. You know, he may regret that he did that freelancing on that. But do you talk about people who the President is concerned about when you talk to him, and there is a story tonight that says that the White House believes that John Bolton may be the source of these leaks, that the President said that.

And what he's upset about is the fact that the media and the Democrats continue to focus on nonsense. They're holding secret meetings, secret witnesses. We can't see them, we can't talk to them. It's tough to get questions out. And then they turn around and leak selective pieces of testimony --"

This man lied about the President on multiple occasions. He said he had stone-cold evidence about collusion with Russia. He didn't. He said he had -- he didn't have any information about the whistleblower. He did. He lied about Kavanaugh. This is what Democrats have done repeatedly.

Interestingly, Sam Donaldson, you know, thinks that a good chunk of Trump supporters have no idea what's going on and don't know the details of any of this anyway. Watch this. Because remember, Trump has 30, 31 percent of hardcore. They'll follow him to hell or wherever he's going. They don't care about the facts. They don't know about the facts. OK, they're fine people except they're ignorant about these things that we're talking about, and they will not budge on that."

I don't, I don't treat my fellow citizens like that and so I'll let Sam speak for himself. I do believe that tonight's debate, it's really about substance but it's also -- it's also going to be about character. And the Vice President should address these issues. He will have 90 minutes when this issue, the topic of his son comes up. And I hope that he's able to tell the American people directly what we all know to be the truth and get this behind him because Hunter Biden is a private citizen. He's not the one that is facing an impeachment inquiry. It is the President of the United States who was facing it over his call to another foreign leader to investigate or fine dirt.

Well, speaking of the impeachment situation, Corey, we just got word that Nancy Pelosi has announced as we had been hearing that she is not going to call for a vote right now in the House of Representatives in order to move forward with an official inquiry here. What do you say to that? COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER CHAIRMAN, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: Well, the reason Nancy isn't going to call for a vote is because she knows that there are a number of Democrats in congressional districts that our first termers that were carried by Donald Trump in 2016, and she knows that this is going to divide her caucus. It's going to ensure that those democrats who are sitting in congressional districts that Donald Trump won just four years ago are going to lose their election and she will become the first Speaker of the House to lose the majority on two separate occasions. So she doesn't want to call for this vote, because she knows that it's going to hurt her caucus and she knows that it also gives the privileges to the minority members of the caucus, meaning the Republicans, the opportunity to actually have subpoena power."

They owe their allegiance to the American people in the Constitution so I hope that they put that first and foremost and that their regulation.

If you think about it, on the one side you have Turkish government forces, you have Turkish backed Arab militias. On the other side, you have Kurdish fighters and their U.S. allies, the U.S. is pulling out and now the Kurds have invited in Syrian government forces and their allies, the Russians. So, you have the U.S. leaving and the Russians coming in on the surface, in the short term, it looks like a loss for the U.S. a gain in prestige, influence, power for the Russians. If you look at a strategic city right now along the border, you have Russian forces playing the role that the U.S. used to play. As the mediator in the middle. On the one side, Syrian government forces, on the other side Turkish government forces right in the middle of the Russians negotiating, being the dealmaker between both sides. They may be trying to pull off a ceasefire before the U.S. does. So, it certainly looks like a win for Russia at least in the short term but keep in mind, you know, this is just the start of what could be a very ugly war. Turkey is trying to do very grand things, it's trying to push in along a 200-mile border, 20 miles deep into Syria. It wants to resettle two million Syrian refugees, to take two million people from Turkey, move them back into Syria, and to do all this while fighting the Kurds. Turkey has a modern powerful military but we've seen less modern militaries do quite well in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Kurds could be fighting Turkey for a long time. So, in the short term, is Russia a winner? Many people are saying yes. But check back in five years and see how this fight could be going. Martha, back to you."

This was a broad-based movement that includes people from all classes and all walks of life. It's not just something that is for the young. Some of the people who I saw who are boldest on the street were actually the adults who feel like they are seeing the autonomy that they have appreciated as members of the Hong Kong society for years being pulled away from their kids and from those who are going to follow behind them. That's something that makes this very unique. You don't have a population of seven million people in Hong Kong and then have 1.5 to two million people in the streets without having a real basis for something beyond just -- we don't want to be extradited, instead, they want their autonomy to be protected and enshrined, they are worried that Beijing is going to pull it away from them."

But her accounts are being met with a little bit of pushback from some CIA officers. Amaryllis Fox is the author of \"Life Undercover: Coming of Age in the CIA\" is here in moments. But first, chief breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher with the back story here tonight. TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Martha, Amaryllis Fox claims current and former CIA officials confirmed that she worked for the agency from roughly 2002 to 2010, first as an analyst in CIA headquarters then in the National Clandestine Service. That's the arm of the CIA that spies overseas. The book is replete with fascinating details and harrowing accounts, it is also surrounded by controversy because she submitted the book for publication without approval from the CIA's publication review board. The board is there to make sure no secrets are being revealed or lives put in danger. Fox said she gave the CIA a manuscript more than a year ago corrected a few minor suggestions made by the agency and hasn't heard back. But the book reportedly includes the sort of details that the CIA has censored from other books like when Amaryllis Fox pose as an art dealer in China seeking to infiltrate nefarious networks that acquire nuclear weapons. And because Fox claims she operated under the non-official cover or NOC, the details are especially sensitive because that means she pose as a private citizen, not a diplomat leaving her without diplomatic protections. And in the book, she talks about things like the CIA, obtaining false I.D.'s for motor vehicles and passport agencies, information many believe the nation's top spies are not eager to share. Fox acknowledges changing certain facts and names to protect national security but says any fictionalization is inconsequential. But some former CIA agents think much of the book might be fiction and they point to the climactic scene where Fox claims she met alone with Al Qaeda terrorists in an effort to stop them from setting off a radiation bomb in Pakistan. She says the meeting was successful. Her critics say the agency would never would have sent an American case officer alone to meet with dangerous extremists. Fox maintains the book is absolutely true even if every detail is not. Martha."

And so, for me, the details operationally and in terms of identification that I got guidance needed to not to be in the piece, gave me a moment to say OK, well, does the story even make sense without them? Is this still a useful thing to share? And in my case, because this isn't a book about one particular operation, this is a coming of age journey of understanding what it was to be an American, to be a human in the days of the war on terror and what are called the services each and every one of us as Americans.

And one of the things that I hope that people take away from this book is that from many young people and especially young women, this is a form of service that can be incredibly rewarding, and that many people who don't necessarily feel as though it would be for them based on the movies could be extraordinarily valuable to their country in doing this kind of work. And that is something that I think some of the Hollywood portrayals and other things that are out there don't really give a sense of, the fact that it's actually very soulful.
