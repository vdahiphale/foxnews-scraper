And you know what happened when George Bush pulled out of the Kyoto treaty? In the next 14 years, we reduced our emissions by 18 percent. We reduced our emissions faster than the European countries that are now criticizing Donald Trump. Our emissions right now are at 1992 levels. And it's not because of a treaty, it's not because there's some piece of parchment signed in Paris in Kyoto, it's because of the free market economy, innovation, and technology. It's hydraulic tracking; it's all of these clean coal technologies that are reducing out emissions. That is going to continue regardless of this Paris agreement. And by the way, we did it while keeping our energy prices half of those in Europe. We reduced our emissions faster than Europe and kept our - our energy prices half of the European Union average: one-third of Germany, which is increasing its emissions at an amazing rate, so we're doing better than all these people who are criticizing Donald Trump today and will continue regardless of this treaty.",

Even though, remember, the DNC had actually worked to help her defeat Bernie Sanders much to his chagrin. Watch.",

House Investigators believe they may have sought the identification of the Trump campaign team and then encoded in intelligence reports for political rather than national security reasons. Congressional source says Democrats were not blindsided but were told in advance by an email and in person the subpoenas for the CIA, FBI, and National Security Agency were ruling out. And the significant buzz here in Washington tonight about the prospect of former FBI chief James Comey telling his side of the story to a congressional panel one week from today, at issue, will Comey say that President Trump tried to get him to drop his investigation of former national security advisor Michael Flynn who resigned in February. Legal experts say the wild card is whether the Trump White House takes the unusual step of invoking executive privilege to block him at a testimony about their conversations.

I'm experiencing all the same outrage, and all the same predictions of apocalypse and the world is coming to an end and all the rest of it. And you know what happened when George Bush pulled out of the Kyoto treaty? In the next 14 years, we reduced our emissions by 18 percent. We reduced our emissions faster than the European countries that are now criticizing Donald Trump. Our emissions right now are at 1992 levels. And it's not because of a treaty, it's not because there's some piece of parchment signed in Paris in Kyoto, it's because of the free market economy, innovation, and technology. It's hydraulic tracking; it's all of these clean coal technologies that are reducing out emissions. That is going to continue regardless of this Paris agreement. And by the way, we did it while keeping our energy prices half of those in Europe. We reduced our emissions faster than Europe and kept our - our energy prices half of the European Union average: one-third of Germany, which is increasing its emissions at an amazing rate, so we're doing better than all these people who are criticizing Donald Trump today and will continue regardless of this treaty."

And for him to say that we're going to back out and possibly renegotiate the way the way they end our end that would benefit us better in the long run.

In fact, we've added it up; we've made this special graphic for you about 40 different excuses she has come up with in what we call: the Clinton Blame Game, starting with the FBI, and James Comey, to the Russians, and yes, even Netflix, somehow. But now the very Democrats who were crying on election night after pouring their hearts and souls into the campaign are irate because she has inexplicably decided to shift some of that blame game too, yes, the Democratic National Committee.

Another top Democrat told me, \"We didn't tell her to hide her Pneumonia; we didn't suggest she insult the core of Trump's face calling them a basket of deplorable.

So, I think the party definitely needs to figure out what its direction is. But look, as someone who's worked on campaigns, I also just find her remarks offensive. How rude is it to blame the people who worked countless hours trying to get her elected? Maybe she should have visited Wisconsin once, maybe she should have spent more money in Wisconsin and Michigan in the final weeks heading into the campaigns, then she did pursue one electoral college vote in Omaha, Nebraska, So, it's just - you know, it's so arrogant and it's really wrong to the staffers who worked so hard for her."

There's more fallout tonight over subpoenas targeting the Obama White House, bringing former National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, who was at the center of Bengasi scandal; former CIA Director, John Brenna; as well as U.N. Ambassador, Samantha Power. House Investigators believe they may have sought the identification of the Trump campaign team and then encoded in intelligence reports for political rather than national security reasons. Congressional source says Democrats were not blindsided but were told in advance by an email and in person the subpoenas for the CIA, FBI, and National Security Agency were ruling out. And the significant buzz here in Washington tonight about the prospect of former FBI chief James Comey telling his side of the story to a congressional panel one week from today, at issue, will Comey say that President Trump tried to get him to drop his investigation of former national security advisor Michael Flynn who resigned in February. Legal experts say the wild card is whether the Trump White House takes the unusual step of invoking executive privilege to block him at a testimony about their conversations. And the administration may be in a weak position because Mr. Trump has been so public about the Russia case from his tweets to this termination letter for Comey where the president cited their private discussions."

      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, FORMER DNC SPOKESPERSON",
      "utterance": "Sure, hear what they have to say. I think the way this is playing out though is a little concerning to some Democrats. If you look at the way the senate has been doing everything, the senate intelligence committee, it has been incredibly bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans on the committee working together. Nunes sent these subpoenas out there without even talking to the Democrats on the committee. It's hard to make an argument that this isn't a political move if you're acting all by yourself. Remember, he's already had to recuse himself for his improprieties."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I think that story kind of change, and it turn out that they did get a heads up on Tuesday. But David, I'll go to you and just carry on what's Mo is saying here, and do you think Chairman Nunez overstepped his bounds?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely not. He said he was going to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. This is nothing to do with the Russian investigation. So he's the chairman of the committee, he's an active chairman, and he told the Democrats, I think, that was misinformation that was reported earlier today that the Democrats didn't know. Chairman Nunez clearly told them. And so, this is an important step for the American people to get to the bottom of the unmasking. This is very troubling for the Trump campaign obviously because these are people -- their names were released, and what the political actions by the CIA director or these ambassadors, whatever they were doing, very untoward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "All right. And so, it does appear that the story continues to be -- for Republicans, Mo, unmasking, and for Democrats it's collusion, Russia, Russia, Russia. I want to get to what Nunez tweeted today. He said, quote, seeing a lot of fake news for media elites and others who have no interest in violations of Americans civil liberties via unmasking. You heard an anchor a few minutes ago there, Catherine reports, the White House wants to make hay over this? What about what's going-on on the other side of the aisle, Mo?"

There is whether or not Trump campaign officials or Trump associates -- what the relationships were with the Russians. That is a legitimate investigation in everyone's mind except for the president. The second is this unmasking issue which is a pretty standard intelligence tool that is used by Democratic and Republican administrations alike. Now."

David, is that a good idea?"

They also host weddings on their property. Last August, Mr. Tennes got a Facebook inquiry asking if he consider hosting a same-sex marriage, and he replied that because of his strong religious beliefs, he would refer them to neighboring farms. When East Lansing city officials found out about the post, they recommended that Tennes not attend that weekend farmers' market because there might be protests. Tennes showed up anyway, sold produce, and there were no protesters. But when Country Mill Farm applied for a 2017 permit to sell at the market, the city had amended its civil rights ordinance. And based on that, Country Mills 2017 permit was denied. So the Tennes family decided to fight back, listen."

Kristen Waggoner is the attorney representing the Tennes family from the Alliance Defending Freedom. All right. So, Steve, can you start off by just telling us what happened first, why was your family band -- your farm I should say banned from selling at this farmers' market?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEVE TENNES, COUNTRY MILL FARMS OWNER",
      "utterance": "Well, as you said, it started in August 2016, when we responded to that inquiry about our beliefs and we stated honestly the Catholic teaching on marriage between a man and woman."

      "speaker": "SMITH",

    {
      "speaker": "TENNES",
      "utterance": "It was by somebody we didn't know. It was in response to an event that happened two years prior, almost three years ago where a couple had asked us if we would perform in our backyard in our home, participate in their same-sex ceremony. And at that time, we refer them to a neighboring orchard, and we left that conversation civilly -- again, start from the person who asked the question on Facebook, we responded on Facebook, and that's when immediately the city of East Lansing officials wanted us, pressured us not come back to the farmers' market that very weekend. And ultimately, they developed this new policy specifically to bar our farm."

      "utterance": "Well, it's a violation of their constitutional rights for the city government to force them to give up their ability to make a livelihood and give up their religious beliefs if they don't agree with what the city says. And what's important here is that they serve everyone, it's the city of East Lansing here that is engaging in the discrimination and telling them that they can't serve everyone at that farmers' market."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Steve, can you tell me what's at stake here? Obviously, you're saying you're fighting for your family's religious freedoms. What is at stake economically for you as well because you have since stopped performing weddings in general on your property?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TENNES",
      "utterance": "Well, actually, in December of last year when we realize the city of East Lansing wasn't satisfied that we had temporarily stopped booking future weddings, we ended up -- we are continuing to practice our faith, and we are hosting a wedding ceremony in our backyard at our home orchard. And that's based off our faith, it's our faith that inspired my wife and I to lovingly serve all the people at our farm, and the farmers' market, whether they are employees or customers, we treat everyone with respect, including those of the LGBT community. That is specifically why the city of East Lansing posted last year on their Facebook account, and I quote, we love the Country Mill. We've served everyone, we always open to that, our faith teaches us."

      "speaker": "TENNES",
      "utterance": "We're actually getting overwhelmingly strong support right now. We realize tolerance needs to be a two-way street, and that's why we've always serve people of all backgrounds and all beliefs. One of the reasons my wife and I both volunteered to go serve our country in the military was because of freedom of religion, freedom of speech is dear to our hearts. Whether you're a Jew, a Muslim, or a Christian, as a farmer you should be able to sell your produce to the people in need."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WAGGONER",
      "utterance": "Well, it will go through the court system and we believe they will be vindicated. Because truly the right to believe is meaningless if it doesn't come with the right to act to live out those beliefs, and that's what's at stake here is whether government can go outside its own city borders, enforce an extreme view on other people, and threaten them with punishment and giving up their rights to participate in community life. The Supreme Court has said no, that's unconstitutional."

He's playing tonight in his 8th NBA -- his 8th NBA final which will start in just a couple of hours. It's inexplicable really how something like this can happen, and I agree with what he just said, we have a long, long way to go here. And the money doesn't matter, the adulation, the fame, none of that seem to matter because if you're in those shoes, and I'm not African- American, so I'm not in those shoes, but he has earned the benefit of the doubt. So if he says it and feels it, I truly believe it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's all wrong on all levels that he has to address this now on the eve of the NBA finals, that this is where any focus or any concentration may have to go. It's horrible, it's awful. But let's know one thing about LeBron James, he can compartmentalize very, very well. I'm sure he will go out there on the court tonight, and once the ball is tipped up against the Golden State Warriors, he will defend his championship and he will do everything he possibly can to have to win. However, there is now a lot of social conscience now that is going on. And for this too happened to LeBron James in these times with what has happened throughout our country for the past year is just going to highlight it and exemplify it, and this should not be where the NBA focus of the final is because some idiots, jerks, horrible human beings did this to his home but that's where we're at."

Tiger Woods has done a lot for the game of golf. He has a lot of fans. A lot of us had enjoyed watching him play over the years. And to see this now it's very disheartening and it's upsetting."
