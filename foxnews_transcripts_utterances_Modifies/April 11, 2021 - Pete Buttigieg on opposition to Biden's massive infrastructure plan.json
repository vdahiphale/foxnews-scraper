You talked about the conservative critics of the Biden administration. This is a bipartisan response to the Biden administration because you have Democrat members of the United States Congress, you have Democrat members of the state legislature, as well as Democrat local officials who are pushing back against the Biden demonstration as much as conservatives in the state of Texas. But, Chris, this problem will continue to get worse because of the policies that have been adopted by the Biden administration. What the president could do is to immediately put back in place the \"remain in Mexico\" protocols that were established in the prior administration. He could continue to build the wall along the border in South Texas. He could send a stronger message that these people should not be coming here. Remember this, and that is one of the reasons why there are so my people coming here is if you go back to the Democrat presidential debates, every single one of the Democrat candidates said if they are elected, they will have open borders and they will be giving things for free to anybody coming across the board. They were doing exactly what they promised during the course of the campaign and this is exactly why we're seeing the flood and the Biden administration was simply unprepared to deal with the massive in flood that were coming in, which is why they have so haphazardly responded to it, and that's why we've seen the dire consequences for these kids, for the adults, and especially for the state of Texas, and it will only get worse, Chris.",

The one that I talked about earlier this past week were reports that were filed with state agencies, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Department of Protective and Child Services, which is basically Child Protective Services. And so, we had a duty to respond to any complaint about child sexual abuse in Texas as well as to investigate it, and that's exactly what I did to make sure it was addressed. Chris, also, however, I must make clear that in addition to the complaints that we received, also the Bexar County sheriff's office, Bexar County is where San Antonio and the Freeman Coliseum is, they have already responded to at least three complaints of sexual abuse taking place there in San Antonio.

They said the Second Amendment is there for the purpose of self-defense and we need that self- defense now more than ever because of the cartels coming into our state, because of gangs that are operating in neighborhoods, because of the defunding the police that made communities more vulnerable and because of failed policies that were leased people who are very dangerous criminals back out on the streets.

If they're interested in roads and bridges and highways and perhaps broadband, there is a deal to be had there. But I think what we ought to be looking at this in terms of is having a, let's do an infrastructure bill, the president wants to do in infrastructure bill. The sort of big, bold, utopian European-style socialism proposal that they've laid out there is something they can try and do another time. But if they're sincere about doing something on infrastructure I think there are Republicans who would vote for it.

And we would welcome, as I said before, an infrastructure bill, which we do about every five years. I think that the tax increases that are included in here are something that would be very crushing to the economy. You're talking about increasing the rate from 21 percent to 28 percent or 33 percent tax increase on businesses in this country who are looking to create jobs. It doesn't make sense after we just reformed the tax code in 2017 and tried to make our tax code more competitive in the global marketplace to then raise taxes and make the United States the highest taxed place to do business in the world. I don't think that's a good way to grow our economy. It's not a good way to create jobs. And the Democrat idea always includes increasing taxes. There aren't very many times in history where I think you would look at and say, let's raise taxes to grow the economy and create jobs. If we want to do that, Chris, we want to keep taxes low so our businesses can compete globally.

Now we are bringing everybody into the United States. We don't -- you know, we don't have the capacity to hear those cases and so they're being released and told to come back at a later time and most don't. So, I mean, there were policies in place under the previous administration, Trump policies, that were effective and that were working. This administration made a decision early on, we want to do opposite of what President Trump did. They were warned by the Border Patrol in advance that if you do these things, this is what's going to happen. This is now what has happened.

So I think it reflects Joe Biden's sort of thoughtful approach to handling some of these big questions.

And there is a report of \"The New York Times,\" Governor, that the government now projects more than 35,000 unaccompanied minors in federal custody by June. One, could it get that bad?

    {
      "speaker": "ABBOTT",

You talked about the conservative critics of the Biden administration. This is a bipartisan response to the Biden administration because you have Democrat members of the United States Congress, you have Democrat members of the state legislature, as well as Democrat local officials who are pushing back against the Biden demonstration as much as conservatives in the state of Texas. But, Chris, this problem will continue to get worse because of the policies that have been adopted by the Biden administration. What the president could do is to immediately put back in place the \"remain in Mexico\" protocols that were established in the prior administration. He could continue to build the wall along the border in South Texas. He could send a stronger message that these people should not be coming here. Remember this, and that is one of the reasons why there are so my people coming here is if you go back to the Democrat presidential debates, every single one of the Democrat candidates said if they are elected, they will have open borders and they will be giving things for free to anybody coming across the board. They were doing exactly what they promised during the course of the campaign and this is exactly why we're seeing the flood and the Biden administration was simply unprepared to deal with the massive in flood that were coming in, which is why they have so haphazardly responded to it, and that's why we've seen the dire consequences for these kids, for the adults, and especially for the state of Texas, and it will only get worse, Chris."
    },

You made news this week reporting that there are cases of sexual abuse at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas, that houses right now more than 1,600 children. But the head of a nonprofit that provides legal services to immigrants said this: The only reason why Abbott is now acting like he cares about the children in these facilities is for political reasons. Governor, there were thousands of complaints of sexual abuse at migrant shelters during the Trump years, not to say that what's going on now is right, but we couldn't find one instance of you complaining and calling that out when President Trump was president."

    {
      "speaker": "ABBOTT",

First, the Trump administration remained in constant communication with me and with my office and let us know what was going on. Second, I saw reports about exactly what you're talking about and saw that those reports were filed with federal agencies. The one that I talked about earlier this past week were reports that were filed with state agencies, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission and the Department of Protective and Child Services, which is basically Child Protective Services. And so, we had a duty to respond to any complaint about child sexual abuse in Texas as well as to investigate it, and that's exactly what I did to make sure it was addressed. Chris, also, however, I must make clear that in addition to the complaints that we received, also the Bexar County sheriff's office, Bexar County is where San Antonio and the Freeman Coliseum is, they have already responded to at least three complaints of sexual abuse taking place there in San Antonio.

Now, second, if the president wanted to do something more than show -- if the president really wanted to do something substantively, what he really could do by executive order is to eliminate the backlog of complaints that have already been filed about gun crimes that have taken place. You probably know what NICS is, which is the background check organization. Back in 2018, NICS received 122,000 complaints about people providing false information when they tried to buy a gun. They sent those to the ATF. The ATF sent 12,000 --"

In each of those cases, at least four victims died. Just this week in your state, of Bryan, Texas, a gunman killed one person and wounded at least five others. Let's not talk about executive action. Whether it's expanding background checks, whether it is passing red flag laws, is there anything that you would accept?"

The shooting in Bryan, Texas, I went to the hospital where victims and their families were the night of the shooting, and we hugged and we cried and we talked to them about it. As I was talking to family members of one of the victims, they said, Governor, please, do not allow this shooting to strip us of our Second Amendment rights and they explained exactly why. They said the Second Amendment is there for the purpose of self-defense and we need that self- defense now more than ever because of the cartels coming into our state, because of gangs that are operating in neighborhoods, because of the defunding the police that made communities more vulnerable and because of failed policies that were leased people who are very dangerous criminals back out on the streets. Texans and Americans know they need their Second Amendment rights to defend themselves at a time when the United States government and other governments are doing less to defend our fellow Americans, and that is exactly why we should not have any further limitations of our Second Amendment rights."

You all like to say that U.S. infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world, but our colleague Chuck Lane of \"The Washington Post\" did some interesting research. Three of the nations ahead of us on that list are Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United Arab Emirates, which are tiny states and hardly comparable. Of the 10 largest countries geographically, including China and Russia, the U.S. actually ranks first. So, Secretary, not to say that everything is fine, but why not be straight about the actual conditions here in the U.S. to the American people?"

That's one of the reasons why there's such strong support for the president's American Jobs Plan. Look, the American Society of Civil Engineers rates our infrastructure, we've been getting a lot of Cs and Ds. But you know don't need an engineering report to know that driving on American roads, they're not the way they should be. Our bridges need work. We've got thousands upon thousands that are either in poor condition or even structurally deficient. If you go to U.S. airports and you compare them to airports in other countries, other developed countries, you know that the U.S. is not at a high standard. We don't have a lot of work to do to persuade the American people that U.S. infrastructure needs major improvement. The American people already know it. And that's one of the reasons why there's such extraordinary Republican and independent and Democratic support for this package among the American people."

So it doesn't, as you said last Sunday, create 19 million jobs. Again, Secretary Buttigieg, why misled folks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUTTIGIEG",
      "utterance": "Well, you're right, I should have been more precise. The 19 million jobs that will be created are more than the jobs that will be created if we don't do the plan. And it's very important to make this point, as you've just showed us."

And that's very important, because there are people on this network and others saying with a straight face that this would somehow reduce the number of jobs. In fact, at least according to that Moody's analysis, 2.7 million additional jobs if we pass this package, just further proof that it's good for the economy, and taken as a whole, it's going to add jobs compared to doing nothing."

And this is a direct refutation of people who are saying otherwise. So, yes, you're right, I should be very precise. The difference in jobs that that particular analysis suggests is 2.7 million more. That is a great place to be, why wouldn't we want America to create 2.7 million more jobs? And I want to say something else about the jobs that's very important. The majority of them, according to a lot of the studies we've seen, will be for people who don't necessarily have college degrees. So there's a time when you've got a blue collar communities that are hurting, a lot of questions about the future of union jobs, construction jobs, manufacturing jobs. These are exactly the kind of jobs we need to be creating. And it's part of why, again, the American Jobs Plan has such remarkable support among Republicans, independents, and Democrats across the country, maybe not yet in the Republican establishment here in Washington, but around the country, this bill is already enormously popular."

But the president seems to recognize that. He has said that he's going to meet tomorrow with a number of members of Congress, both parties, both houses in the Oval Office. Question, are the size of the package, $2.25 trillion, or the way to pay for it, raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent to raise $2 trillion in taxes over 15 years, are all of those negotiable?"

And we also can't wait too long. So he's got an expectation of major progress in Congress by Memorial Day. But, of course, a plan gets better when you take input on board from our party, from the other party, from both Houses, and that's the process that's underway right now."

Democratic Senator Joe Manchin says he's not willing to go to 28 percent tax increase. He wants to go to only 25 percent, which means you wouldn't raise nearly as much money. He also says he opposes the idea of reconciliation, jamming this through on a straight party line vote.

      "speaker": "BUTTIGIEG",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly don't think we have to go back to the drawing board given that the American people want this to happen. I mean, we got two-thirds of the American people, often Republicans, supporting the provisions in this plan, when you break them down. That tells us we're on the right track. Of course there are different ways -- shapes this could take in terms of the legislative packages. Of course there are different ideas about exactly how to target the programming or exactly how to fund it. And that's the conversation that's underway right now. It's what a negotiation is. But there's certainly -- I've got tons of respect for Senator Manchin, Senator Coons, others who are bringing forward ideas in the Senate. We got some fellow Democrats in the House who are saying this isn't big enough, you got to do more. We're going to find the right path but I think what the president has laid out, and so far, it's still the most specific proposal that we've seen here in Washington, is a really, really well thought out proposal and that's why American wants it done. I mean, it's very rare to find any legislation that this high of a proportion of Republicans, independents, and Democrats across the country believe we ought to pass. So that tells us we've got to be on the right track here."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), MINORITY WHIP",
      "utterance": "Well, good morning, Chris. There are Republicans were interested in an infrastructure plan, infrastructure in the past has always been bipartisan when it's confined to infrastructure. The plan that you heard Secretary Buttigieg talk about is a massive expansion of the government, only about 6 percent of the president's proposal actually goes to what the American people, I think everyday Americans, would describe as infrastructure. If they're interested in roads and bridges and highways and perhaps broadband, there is a deal to be had there. But I think what we ought to be looking at this in terms of is having a, let's do an infrastructure bill, the president wants to do in infrastructure bill. The sort of big, bold, utopian European-style socialism proposal that they've laid out there is something they can try and do another time. But if they're sincere about doing something on infrastructure I think there are Republicans who would vote for it. And how we pay for it, I think we ought to re-purpose some of the money that has already been spent or appropriate it at least and hasn't been spent in all of these previous COVID bills. We just did $350 billion to a lot of states out there and this would be a good use for those funds."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, let's look at the state of infrastructure, traditional infrastructure in your state. According to studies, South Dakota has the fourth-highest rate of structurally deficient bridges in the country, clean drinking water needs are $730 million. You say 6 percent of this bill is infrastructure, we had Senator Roy Blunt, another member of Republican leadership, on last Sunday, he said about a third of the bill he thinks is infrastructure and talked about $600-700 billion of the 2.25 trillion. Is there something in that neighborhood or even higher that you would be willing to go for? And why are raising taxes on corporations, why is that just off the table as a way to pay for this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "Well, first off, in terms of the actual components of a bill, yes, I think water, wastewater, I said highways, roads, bridges, perhaps broadband can all be included in that category. You know, our state of South Dakota obviously depends upon the highway bill funding in order to upkeep and maintain a lot of the roads and bridges in our state. And we would welcome, as I said before, an infrastructure bill, which we do about every five years. I think that the tax increases that are included in here are something that would be very crushing to the economy. You're talking about increasing the rate from 21 percent to 28 percent or 33 percent tax increase on businesses in this country who are looking to create jobs. It doesn't make sense after we just reformed the tax code in 2017 and tried to make our tax code more competitive in the global marketplace to then raise taxes and make the United States the highest taxed place to do business in the world. I don't think that's a good way to grow our economy. It's not a good way to create jobs. And the Democrat idea always includes increasing taxes. There aren't very many times in history where I think you would look at and say, let's raise taxes to grow the economy and create jobs. If we want to do that, Chris, we want to keep taxes low so our businesses can compete globally. And there is certainly no need to -- for a big fat tax increase on businesses either on the publicly held corporations or the pass-throughs, which would also be hit by the increase in individual income rates."

I think restoring the MPP, the Migrant Protection Plan, which was essentially a program which was essentially keeping those who were seeking asylum in Mexico until such time as their cases can be heard and adjudicated. Now we are bringing everybody into the United States. We don't -- you know, we don't have the capacity to hear those cases and so they're being released and told to come back at a later time and most don't. So, I mean, there were policies in place under the previous administration, Trump policies, that were effective and that were working. This administration made a decision early on, we want to do opposite of what President Trump did. They were warned by the Border Patrol in advance that if you do these things, this is what's going to happen. This is now what has happened. We've got the highest number of people coming illegally across the border that we've seen in 15 years. So they can fix this, Chris. They've got to fix it. And it's going to take willingness on the part of the current of administration probably to eat a little crow and say that all of these abrupt changes from existing policies were wrong. But we have a major crisis down there and it's worsening by the day."

Back in 2013, after the tragedy at Sandy Hook, you voted against the Toomey-Manchin backgrounds checks compromise, and in 2019, after another one of these mass shootings, you said you were confident that Congress would do something about red flag laws. Nothing happened. Isn't the argument that you hear, we heard earlier from Governor Abbott, you hear it from a lot of Republicans in the Senate, they're coming after our guns, they're going to end the Second Amendment, isn't that an excuse for doing nothing?"

I do think there the perception, I can tell you out here in South Dakota and other places around the country where the Second Amendment is something that's deeply cherished and valued, is that the government is coming after people's firearms. And that's the reason you can't find any ammo or any firearms in a lot of our sporting goods stores here in South Dakota. But to your point, Chris, there were some things that we did do in 2018 to strengthen the background check system. I don't think Republicans are averse to doing smart things, reasonable things if they are actually addressing the issue. What Republicans don't want to do is, you know, adopt policies that have nothing to do with solving the problem but put additional burdens on law-abiding citizens who are trying to exercise their Second Amendment rights. And this administration, and, frankly, to be fair and to be honest, people on the far left for a long time have been very hostile to the Second Amendment, to people in this country who are gun owners and have been looking for every opportunity to get their guns."

He will be primaried in 2022. Political career over.\" And last night, speaking to a reception of big Republican donors at Mar-a- Lago, President Trump called Republican leader McConnell a \"dumb SOB,\" except he didn't say SOB. A couple of questions, first of all, your reaction to the president's attacks on you and other Republican leaders as recently as last night?

So I'm going to focus on doing the job, which I think is the best way to run for re- election in any election cycle. And the -- you know, who gets in against me is not going to be a factor in that decision. Chris, I've been through wars in South Dakota, political wars with my own party when I ran the first time, with the Democrats in a couple of hotly contested Senate races, so being afraid of a fight or somebody coming after me is not something that's going to influence that decision. But I do think that Republicans are much better off when we're united and working to defeat Democrats. And I think the one thing that should unite President Trump, Mitch McConnell, myself, others were running for reelection this year, is getting candidates on the field who are electable in a general election. That should unite us because the best thing we can do to save this country is to get the majority back in the United States Senate in 2022. I think -- I hope in the end, all of the rhetoric aside right now and some of the things flying back and forth, that that's the thing that we'll be focused on and I believe that will unite the president and -- former president at least in the rest of Republicans in the United States Senate."

And it's time now for our Sunday group. GOP strategist Karl Rove, FOX News correspondent Gillian Turner, and Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. Mo, the commission the president is talking about has 180 days to study the structure of the Supreme Court, how many justices, how long they should serve, maybe not a full lifetime appointment. Given the fact that Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has already said he is not going to vote to pack the court, is this really a serious effort or just a political ploy to satisfy the left wing of the Democratic base?

      "speaker": "SERVICE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, look, if this was only about satisfying the left wing of the Democratic base, I doubt he would have as many conservative jurists and scholars on the commission as he did. It's a very balanced commission that has got folks from both sides of the aisle. And I think you make the point, Chris, that it's not just looking at the size of the court, but it is looking at some other structural issues, like whether or not there should be an 18-year term limit on the court, which would allow both parties more opportunities to appoint people over time. So I think it reflects Joe Biden's sort of thoughtful approach to handling some of these big questions. I think it is unlikely that you'll see under the current composition of Congress a huge growth in the court, but they're going to look at some other things and we will see what comes of it."

So two questions for you, first of all, what you think of the Biden commission? And, secondly, as somebody who worked on this when you were in the Bush 43 White House, how delicate is it to usher out a retiring Supreme Court justice and to usher in a new one?"

    {
      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, GOP STRATEGIST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the idea that this is a balanced commission is laughable. There are 36 members. I've identified four conservatives or libertarians, and the rest are Democrats. The co-chairman of the committee, one of them signed an inflammatory letter calling for the defeat of Justice Kavanaugh, the other has served twice as the Democratic National Committee's general counsel and general counsel to the Obama campaign in 2008 and '12, and played Donald Trump and Joe Biden's debate prep last year. I did a cursory check of the members and their contribution patterns in the last two election cycles, 16 Democrats on the commission gave 110 gifts in the last two election cycles totaling $112,000."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "I think that's completely inappropriate. I mean, this is an independent branch of the government and an attempt by the executive to sort of usher somebody out, please leave now, I think breaks the decorum and undermines the independence of the court. The court must be outside of politics to the degree that we can allow it to be outside of politics. And that would be plunging it into partisan politics. And I think that's why Justice Breyer's two hour-long address, well worth watching, is a warning that this is a bad road to go down. Now, of course, the Justice Democrats, the left-wing Democrats, they're going to want that and they're going to keep pressuring. I hope the White House doesn't make an attempt to because I think, frankly, it's not going to work with Justice Breyer. He was sending down a signal, I will make a decision when I want to leave when I want to leave, and this should not be about politics."

The justices maintain, very insistent they are not Bush justices and Obama justices and Trump justices, they are all justices of the Supreme Court.

Who would want their career and their legacy to be undone the moment they walk out the door? But that's, to a point, what made Justice Breyer's message so powerful this week and I think ultimately what's going to make it his word, his message carry more weight than anything this presidential commission is going to be -- is going to put forward mainly because Breyer himself has served on the bench for 25 years, also because he is very highly regarded on both sides of the aisle. His message, Chris, if we pick it apart for a second, to Democrats and Republicans this week, was stop trying to gunk up this bench with your political agenda. But more interestingly than that, if you kind of read the subtext, what he was telling Democrats was, if you want my seat for a young whippersnapper diversity pick, you better not be trying to pack this court because I'm not going to allow you to do it and I'm, right now, the bastion that stands between you and the ability to get that done. That's the reality, it's the political reality."
