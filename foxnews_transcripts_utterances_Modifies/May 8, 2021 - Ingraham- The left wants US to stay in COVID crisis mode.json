Also, a New Jersey Police officer was fired for equating BLM to terrorists. She's also here to tell her story.  But first, why they won't quit COVID? That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. It was nearly a year ago when THE ANGLE warned you about the forever COVID cabal.",

Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan, Andrew Cuomo in New York, Tim Walz in Minnesota, all of them opted for lockdowns over liberty, controls over common sense. Now for most of these state and county public health officials, their big excitement every year is maybe recording, I don't know, a PSA for hand washing during the flu season. Well, for more than a year, they've been sealless celebrities and people's lives rise or fall on their every word. That's real power, and they got drunk on it.  Last summer, we told you about Dr. Travis Gayles, the Health Officer of Montgomery County, Maryland, a wealthy DC suburb. Now without any warning he issued a blanket order last July closing all private and independent schools for in-person learning starting in the fall. The positivity rate for COVID at the time was a paltry 2.3 percent in that county. Well, THE ANGLE and others jumped on the issue. Lawsuits were prepared, and ultimately Gayles had to back down. Just another so-called expert issuing arbitrary orders to keep themselves relevant and to protect his public school allies.   Well, now courtesy of a public records request from the \"Washington Examiner\", we have the emails between Gayles and his band of liberal county control freaks, which shows their utter contempt for the people who pay their salaries. Now, when a taxpayer and a mother of a child at a private school wrote to him requesting specific benchmarks for schools to reopen, he forward her email to colleagues writing only \"The arrogance\". Then his deputy health officer James Bridgers echoed back absolute arrogance and privilege. Now he left out the word white, but the sentiment was clear. The privileged class of the county is showing their behinds, wrote Gayles in yet another exchange. Again, he's talking about parents who just want kids in school. During a virtual press conference, \"Washington Examiner\" reporter Tim Carney press Gayles about his nasty comments. Watch the good doctor squirm.",

Now the lockdowns that Fauci and friends supported, severely compromised the education of American children coast-to-coast. Of course, they're just proxies for the Democrats, though people like Fauci and the globalists, who long ago revealed their desire to use COVID to build back better for the great reset of capitalism to occur. Of course, the pandemic has to roll on just into the next emergency and the next and the next.  If we truly recover from COVID by simply going on with our lives, then the reset won't ever be complete. Plus, the vaccine makers would need to go back to doing meaningful long-term testing and actually be liable for any harm they cause. The COVID cleaners may prefer the new normal, the new COVID normal to what came before, but they didn't anticipate the red state revival that would reveal how idiotic and damaging their rigid rules are. Florida, Georgia, South Dakota and Texas, they've led the way. And today on the issue of sports attendance rules, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee took another stand and he took it for common sense saying, \"The government needs to get out of the way because the time for health intervention is over\".   If Democrats don't quit COVID and keep using and abusing, the voters will have to do an intervention of their own. And that's THE ANGLE.  Joining me now is Dr. Peter McCullough, a turn internist and cardiologist. Doctor, another benefit to keeping this crisis going, the hundreds of billions of dollars set to be made on the continued production of these vaccines and then booster vaccine shots to follow.

We're using multiple drugs in combination to reduce the spread of illness and reduce hospitalizations and deaths. So that's changed everything. As you imply, Texas has been an early treatment state all the way through. We never closed down. We're in the middle of the pack in terms of cases and mortality and we've moved on.   Now, the overall approach to the pandemic, I think, has been way too much focused on masks and vaccines. Neither one of those help sick patients with COVID-19.

But keep in mind, it's T-cell, it's a natural killer cell in innate immunity that gives that full library of defense mechanisms in addition to antibodies. So the natural immunity is far more broad, durable and complete than the vaccine immunity.   We recommend vaccines and I'm very pro-vaccine and have taken all the vaccines that are safe and effective myself and my patients and my family members have taken the COVID-19 vaccine, where appropriate. But it provides a narrow base of immunity that protects those most vulnerable.

Now in it, author Nicholas Wade posits that COVID not only escaped from a Wuhan lab, but was made more dangerous on purpose. The virus was already well adapted to humans. It possessed an unusual enhancement, a furin cleavage site, proponents of natural emergence have a rather harder story to tell.  Here now is the author of that piece, Nicholas Wade, former science writer for nature, science in the New York Times. Nicholas, great to see you tonight.

We have no direct evidence for natural emergence, even though we expect you to get quite a lot by now. We have no direct evidence for lab escape. And this is because the Chinese authorities have sealed all the records of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And until we get those records, if we ever do, I don't think we're ever going to have proof. So my suggestion is lacking that proof, the next best thing we can do is to take four or five salient facts about the virus and ask which of these two scenarios explains them better. So I can briefly go through those if you like. The first is a matter of geography, if you look where the pandemic broke out, if it broke out naturally, you'd expect it to be around the caves in Yunnan in southern China, where these bats hang out, the bats that harbor the virus. But no, it broke out 1500 kilometers away in Wuhan, where there are no bats. So that's easy for the lab escape scenario to explain. The Institute of Virology is right there.  We know they were doing this, the very kind of experiment that would have produced this kind of virus. We know they were working in relatively unsafe safety conditions or a low level of safety though it was probably not appropriate for this virus. And so, it's very easy to expand on that way. On natural emergence it's much harder. You've got to get the pandemic to growing, somewhere outside of Wuhan and then you've got to get an infected person who somehow without infecting any member of his family jumps on a train to Wuhan and then starts spreading the virus. It's just a bit stream.",

Now for most of these state and county public health officials, their big excitement every year is maybe recording, I don't know, a PSA for hand washing during the flu season. Well, for more than a year, they've been sealless celebrities and people's lives rise or fall on their every word. That's real power, and they got drunk on it. Last summer, we told you about Dr. Travis Gayles, the Health Officer of Montgomery County, Maryland, a wealthy DC suburb. Now without any warning he issued a blanket order last July closing all private and independent schools for in-person learning starting in the fall. The positivity rate for COVID at the time was a paltry 2.3 percent in that county. Well, THE ANGLE and others jumped on the issue. Lawsuits were prepared, and ultimately Gayles had to back down. Just another so-called expert issuing arbitrary orders to keep themselves relevant and to protect his public school allies. Well, now courtesy of a public records request from the \"Washington Examiner\", we have the emails between Gayles and his band of liberal county control freaks, which shows their utter contempt for the people who pay their salaries. Now, when a taxpayer and a mother of a child at a private school wrote to him requesting specific benchmarks for schools to reopen, he forward her email to colleagues writing only \"The arrogance\". Then his deputy health officer James Bridgers echoed back absolute arrogance and privilege. Now he left out the word white, but the sentiment was clear. The privileged class of the county is showing their behinds, wrote Gayles in yet another exchange. Again, he's talking about parents who just want kids in school.

Now the lockdowns that Fauci and friends supported, severely compromised the education of American children coast-to-coast. Of course, they're just proxies for the Democrats, though people like Fauci and the globalists, who long ago revealed their desire to use COVID to build back better for the great reset of capitalism to occur. Of course, the pandemic has to roll on just into the next emergency and the next and the next. If we truly recover from COVID by simply going on with our lives, then the reset won't ever be complete. Plus, the vaccine makers would need to go back to doing meaningful long-term testing and actually be liable for any harm they cause. The COVID cleaners may prefer the new normal, the new COVID normal to what came before, but they didn't anticipate the red state revival that would reveal how idiotic and damaging their rigid rules are. Florida, Georgia, South Dakota and Texas, they've led the way. And today on the issue of sports attendance rules, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee took another stand and he took it for common sense saying, \"The government needs to get out of the way because the time for health intervention is over\". If Democrats don't quit COVID and keep using and abusing, the voters will have to do an intervention of their own. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Dr. Peter McCullough, a turn internist and cardiologist. Doctor, another benefit to keeping this crisis going, the hundreds of billions of dollars set to be made on the continued production of these vaccines and then booster vaccine shots to follow. Now you actually think the whole response has been too narrowly focused on the vaccines. Explain."

      "speaker": "PETER MCCULLOUGH, CARDIOLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, what's really changed the calculus in the whole Pandemic is early treatment for COVID-19. There's now 10 national telemedicine services, 15 regional services, 250 treating doctors across the United States. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons has a home treatment guide. We're using multiple drugs in combination to reduce the spread of illness and reduce hospitalizations and deaths. So that's changed everything. As you imply, Texas has been an early treatment state all the way through. We never closed down. We're in the middle of the pack in terms of cases and mortality and we've moved on. Now, the overall approach to the pandemic, I think, has been way too much focused on masks and vaccines. Neither one of those help sick patients with COVID-19. That's plain defense and in my view the big change was when we had the Senate hearings in November, we started playing offense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, doctor, that also brings up this issue of vaccine mandates or passports or certificates. And the issue of T-cell immunity, which doesn't get enough attention, but that is basically the natural immunity people get if they're exposed to the virus and a lot of people don't have any symptoms and whatsoever, but they're T-cell positive. How important is that factor to measuring the severity of any ongoing crisis?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCULLOUGH",
      "utterance": "Well, the T-cell technologies have dramatically improved. There's an FDA cleared test now that one can actually have their DNA from their T-cells extracted and tested to see if, in fact, there has been prior exposure to COVID-19 and inferred immunity. But keep in mind, it's T-cell, it's a natural killer cell in innate immunity that gives that full library of defense mechanisms in addition to antibodies. So the natural immunity is far more broad, durable and complete than the vaccine immunity. We recommend vaccines and I'm very pro-vaccine and have taken all the vaccines that are safe and effective myself and my patients and my family members have taken the COVID-19 vaccine, where appropriate. But it provides a narrow base of immunity that protects those most vulnerable. In my view, it should not be widely applied to individuals who have a very low risk for COVID-19 and a near zero risk for hospitalization and death."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

But if they're crowded on a soccer field, they're on top of each other, they're heavily breathing, we don't really think that's a good idea right now. These are kids who likely will not be vaccinated. We've seen a lot of outbreaks associated with used sports."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now there was actually a study done on that in September. Out of 282 positive cases reported among players, only one was attributed to transmission while playing soccer. Doctor, masks on athletes, or someone who was an athlete in high school, that's just insane."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCULLOUGH",
      "utterance": "It is insane. And I can tell you, there's no scientific support for masking athletes. It's going to do more harm than good. And our kids can go out and play freely. Communicability is so sufficiently low. And keep in mind, kids get through this illness with really no problems and severe cases are easily treatable. Pediatricians treat this with some mild inhalers and oral drugs. We always get the kids through the infection. So I say, leave the masks off the kids, leave them out of the vaccination discussion and let's go on with life."

And we know the virus first emerged in China, but the key question has always been nagging us and of course, a lot of the researchers. How did it start? What's the origin of this virus? Now just today, a renowned journalist published one of the most convincing pieces ever regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2. Now in it, author Nicholas Wade posits that COVID not only escaped from a Wuhan lab, but was made more dangerous on purpose. The virus was already well adapted to humans. It possessed an unusual enhancement, a furin cleavage site, proponents of natural emergence have a rather harder story to tell. Here now is the author of that piece, Nicholas Wade, former science writer for nature, science in the New York Times. Nicholas, great to see you tonight. Now, this is the gain of function research we've been talking about for some time on this show. Explain it to our viewers very clearly and how this connects the origins of the virus back to the Wuhan lab."

But their rationale is that if they can find those one or two or more changes, then they will be able to sort of get ahead of nature and prevent the next pandemic."

    {
      "speaker": "PETER DASZAK, ECOHEALTH ALLIANCE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "One group of experts from the National Academies from other scientists around the world have refuted those ideas that put them to bed. There is no evidence that this was a virus that was created in the lab. There is no evidence at all that it ever was in the lab."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Peter, no evidence at all that this was the result of any gain of function research at the Wuhan lab. That's his argument."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WADE",
      "utterance": "Well, that's only correct. I think what one has to keep firmly in mind at least at this stage, is there's no direct evidence for either of these two scenarios. We have no direct evidence for natural emergence, even though we expect you to get quite a lot by now. We have no direct evidence for lab escape. And this is because the Chinese authorities have sealed all the records of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. And until we get those records, if we ever do, I don't think we're ever going to have proof. So my suggestion is lacking that proof, the next best thing we can do is to take four or five salient facts about the virus and ask which of these two scenarios explains them better. So I can briefly go through those if you like. The first is a matter of geography, if you look where the pandemic broke out, if it broke out naturally, you'd expect it to be around the caves in Yunnan in southern China, where these bats hang out, the bats that harbor the virus. But no, it broke out 1500 kilometers away in Wuhan, where there are no bats. So that's easy for the lab escape scenario to explain. The Institute of Virology is right there. We know they were doing this, the very kind of experiment that would have produced this kind of virus. We know they were working in relatively unsafe safety conditions or a low level of safety though it was probably not appropriate for this virus. And so, it's very easy to expand on that way. On natural emergence it's much harder. You've got to get the pandemic to growing, somewhere outside of Wuhan and then you've got to get an infected person who somehow without infecting any member of his family jumps on a train to Wuhan and then starts spreading the virus. It's just a bit stream."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, and of course, that begs the question as to why this China has not been forthcoming on this question. The WHO just kind of whitewashed this and said there's no evidence, but we've never gotten unfettered access to the records, or to the understanding of who patient zero really was. Is that correct?"

    {
      "speaker": "WADE",
      "utterance": "Because you have to be careful interpreting the actions of authoritarian governments. I mean, they cover up things as bad as a reflex action. So it doesn't necessarily mean they're hiding a guilty secret. But I agree, it certainly points in that direction."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WADE",
      "utterance": "Yes. This is the third of the tests you can apply to us, which explains the best. There is a very odd piece of the virus called as you say, the furin cleavage site. It doesn't exist in any other known virus of this viral family. So, SARS-CoV-2 could not have obtained this furin cleavage site by swapping it with another virus, which is generally the typical way in which viruses gain new material. On the other hand, if you are going to insert the screenshot in a lab, which is well-known, this is the way you soup up the infectivity of viruses. You would take a particular sequence of nucleotide units, you'd put it in the virus, and that explains - this is far easier explanation of how the furin site came to be there."

And in this case, you had at least one juror who seemed to have an agenda, and you have many, many other issues in the case as well. I think this case calls for a reversal and a new trial outside of Minneapolis in a small rural area, months, maybe a year after the trial after the events at issue, so that kind of objective neutral, non political justice. Also you have Maxine Waters, and you have other kinds of issues that are external, seeming to influence the jury deliberations, threats of violence, which they had to know about because they weren't sequestered."

So when you have the combination of an anonymous jury, a failure to move the trial out of Minneapolis, threats on the jury, we have to err on the side of making sure that every defendant and I have no brief for this police officer. What he did was reprehensible by any standards. But the most reprehensible people doing the most reprehensible things deserve a fair trial from 12 objective neutral jurors, and people who are wearing sweatshirts, not people who are rooting for one side or the other.

Now, this is a crisis for KFC connoisseurs. But big business sees this as an opportunity to undermine workers. Companies across other industries have also noted the difficulty of recruiting new workers. With some business owners attributing the problem to increased unemployment benefits that make it more attractive to remain on government assistance. In other words, they don't want to raise wages and instead hope for more cheap foreign labor. As Americans can collect unemployment. Biden, of course will oblige, and the Americans will stay at work with just these juiced up welfare benefits. Here now Stephen Miller, former senior adviser to President Trump, founder of \"America First\" legal.

That executive order was based on a Department of Labor analysis which found that a historic number of American workers were sidelined and out of work because of the pandemic and pandemic related closures, the largest labor surplus anyone has ever seen. Joe Biden came into office. He terminated that executive order. It got very little attention. Allowing for the unrestricted entry of foreign workers whose sole reason, sole reason for entering the country is to fill U.S. jobs. These companies are simply addicted to cheap labor. It's just that simple, Laura. You've been talking about this for years."

I don't want to begrudge anybody who is here as an immigrant who is working. I begrudge U.S. policy that brings in such a large number of workers that it displaces U.S. workers and recently arrived immigrants. You can go into states that have lower rates of immigration, and you'll see high schoolers jobs. You will see people in summer doing jobs, working on golf courses, whatever it may be that in other states they say, oh, no, only immigrants can do these jobs.

And he is doing it for lobbyists and big corporations who just want to make extra money at the expense of American workers. These government policies distort markets. They push workers out of industries. They push U.S. workers out of entire lines of work. And then those same companies come back and they say, it is still not enough. We need even more immigration, we need even more foreign workers. It hurts immigrants. It hurts U.S. workers. It only helps Joe Biden's donors. And I hope the GOP won't just talk about the southern border, but they will also talk about the importation of cheap visa workers, they will talk about interior enforcement, they'll talk about refugee policy, the whole panoply of Biden policies that are undermining the U.S. workforce in extremely corporatist, anti-progressive ways."
