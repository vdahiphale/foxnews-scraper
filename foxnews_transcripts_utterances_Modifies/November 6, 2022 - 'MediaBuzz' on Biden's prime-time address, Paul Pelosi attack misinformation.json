Biden has made a version of the recent remarks many times, and most Democrats wanted him to talk about the economy or inflation or crime. Now the address began as a high-minded appeal to preserve American democracy, but very quickly became a blatantly partisan speech, an attack on Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans for allegedly trying to suppress voting rights and condoning political violence, and threatening the fairness of this election. Not much of a stretch to conclude the president was saying the only way to protect democracy is to vote Democratic. And as some Democrats privately confided to journalists, Joe Biden missed an opportunity to connect with swing voters who were mainly worried about paying their bills. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is Media Buzz.   The media are belatedly, reluctantly, and in many cases sadly acknowledging that the Republicans are virtually certain to take over the House and have an increasingly good shot at ceasing control of the Senate. A Washington Post story actually saying the Democrats are in a panic.",

So, I think there things are working. These are familiar people that, gradually gotten their stride. You know, Ryan was competitive here in Ohio.

Not much of a stretch to conclude the president was saying the only way to protect democracy is to vote Democratic. And as some Democrats privately confided to journalists, Joe Biden missed an opportunity to connect with swing voters who were mainly worried about paying their bills. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is Media Buzz. The media are belatedly, reluctantly, and in many cases sadly acknowledging that the Republicans are virtually certain to take over the House and have an increasingly good shot at ceasing control of the Senate.

Well, the media back during the primaries wrote off many of the Trump backed MAGA candidates as no way they could win a general election. They're too extreme. This is great for the Democrats. And now, many of these people, Kari Lake, Blake Masters, Herschel Walker, are at least tied a lot. When we say they're ahead, sometimes it's one or two points. And so, was this a tremendous mistake on the part of the press?"

      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And but it a predictable mistake, Howard. Look OK. For the better part of seven to eight years, the Democratic Party, and by extension the media's focus has been exclusively on Donald Trump. As a result, all these issues that are now so important to the American people existed uncovered underneath the surface. The economy, inflation crime and so forth. But their focus had only and always been on Donald Trump. They thought by making all of these individuals, Kari Lake, Dr. Oz, surrogates for Donald Trump, they could stay on the same themes. And what they didn't realize was that those candidates, not only the policies, but those candidates themselves are very popular. And by the way, they're rating -- they're riding a wave of popularity attributable to Donald Trump."

Well, what's amazing is that it's for the last two years when Donald Trump hasn't been president, obviously he still kits a lot of coverage and part of that is the former president's doing. Geraldo, was this case of journalists on the coast living in a bubble and the country maybe is a bit more conservative or more fed up than the pundits and with their media myopia were willing to believe."

The president, the former president, President Trump endorsing them really, you know, in many ways, fathering their candidacy was out of the mainstream. But you know, these are quality people. I was in the talk show business with Mehmet Oz. He's a great guy. I think that he might have been stunned by Oprah's endorsement of John Fetterman. But I also think that he has -- he has surgically, if I may use his profession, his former profession, worked his way back. And I think that Herschel Walker similarly, and he was helped I think by Georgia crushing Tennessee yesterday and to be probably number one in the nation in NCAA football. So, I think there things are working. These are familiar people that, gradually gotten their stride. You know, Ryan was competitive here in Ohio. I thought that he was going to do it but he is, he had that great line that Ohio needs ass kickers, not ass kissers. But Vance has, you know, he's a quality guy, Hillbilly Elegy."

I think that, you know, there is an essential social conservatism in America. People settle down. We can have opposite points of view. I certainly, disagree with most of my colleagues at The Five certainly, and Fox News generally. But we get along, we can talk about things. I really think that what happened is that Biden gave a speech, maybe Obama should have given it. He's much more, you know, smoothly or much more articulate, I think. He's more personable in many, many. He had, it would've seemed less partisan. I think if the former president that President Obama had given the speech rather than President Biden. What President Biden did, it's like your best pal who never picked a fight with anybody all of a sudden, pretending that he's the tough guy going to take you in the backyard and beat the hell out of you. I just think that it was -- it was ill advised, and as I said earlier, I don't think he's ever given a great speech. And that was probably the most ill-timed, partisan attack ever."

I mean, he's got a financial problem, and there's no doubt that he's getting desperate. But the free speech implications here are absurd. I mean, think about it. The worst free speech sort of violation that we have here is a bunch of lefty, progressive activist groups calling on advertisers to boycott Twitter.

Kristen, I've always felt that if Herschel Walker had apologized and said he's grown, and he wouldn't make the same decision today, that the people of Georgia would've forgiven him.

Look, we have highly qualified people. Think of Tammy Duckworth, the Democrat senator in Illinois. Think of Brian Mast, the congressman in Florida who are injured and severely injured serving our country. Of course, they can serve. But having a stroke and not being able to comprehend and do the analytics and having the cognitive capability challenges that Fetterman is having, I think disqualifies him and I think the people of Pennsylvania will figure that out."

And so, because I am often critical of the left, the left is my home. I have a lot of progressive views.
