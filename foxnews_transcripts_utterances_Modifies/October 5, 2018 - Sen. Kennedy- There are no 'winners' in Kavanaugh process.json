But they are feeling pretty good tonight.  They knew this morning that there was a good likelihood that he was going to be confirmed because sources tell Fox News that West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin called the White House this morning to tell them that he would be a yes on Kavanaugh in making his position known to the White House, at least, before Senator Flake or Senator Collins declared.  But he waited until after Senator Collins made her declaration to go public with it.  Maine Senator Susan Collins did not call the White House this morning to indicate one way or another how she was going to vote.  The White House wasn't worried about that, figuring that she would have only called them if she was a no.   But the White House sort of breathlessly watching as she made that impassioned statement on the Senate floor this afternoon when she led up to her decision.  And with or the decision that she had made at least on Judge Kavanaugh.  And you can bet that there were some tense moments here at the White House as she laid out her thinking. Certainly, didn't take long as you pointed out the top, Ed, for protestors to go after both Collins and Manchin speaking to reporters outside of his office, you could barely hear with what Manchin was saying above the cacophony.  Listen, here.",

      "sentences": "Been damaged, been damaged terribly. And as both of these individuals, Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have been harmed, their families have, too. And we need to, we must do better by them. We must do better as a legislative branch. We have an obligation, a moral obligation to do better than this. I spent more time evaluating and considering the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh than I have with any of the previous nominations to the United States Supreme Court that I've had the privilege to review. I've had the opportunity to vote on five justices prior to this. And I took my time. I was deliberate. I was thoughtful. Some accused me of being too deliberate, too thoughtful. Taking too much time. But this is important to me. It should be important to all of us. And I know that it is important to all of us. And so I studied the record. I sat with Judge Kavanaugh for a lengthy period of time. About an hour and a half and asked the questions that I had and did more due diligence. Reviewed the cases and did my homework. Listened to the concerns that were raised by many in my state on issues that were all over the board, whether it was women's right to choose, whether it was the Affordable Care Act, whether it was executive authority, deference to the agencies native issues. I took considerable time. And when the hearings came, not being on the judiciary committee, I paid attention. I followed the testimony of the judge, the very critical questioning from many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. And then when the end of the process or so seemingly what we believed to be the end of the process, there were more questions. I went back to Judge Kavanaugh. Had a good conversation with him. And then the allegations that we have been discussing and trying to understand more about came forward and we all moved from focusing on the issues to truly a discussion that none of us ever thought that we would be having when it came to confirmation process for someone to the highest court in the land. And so there was more work to be done. I was one who wanted to make sure that there was a process going forward. And when there were more questions that were raised after the initial process, was one who joined in asking that the FBI step in and do further reviews. So I have been engaged in this lengthy and deliberative process for months now. And I was truly leaning toward supporting Judge Kavanaugh in his nomination as I looked to that record. But we know that in our rule of advice and consent, it's not just -- it is not the record itself. There is more that is attached to it. It is way when in the State of Alaska a nomination for a judge goes forward, you rate them not only on their professional competence, what they have demonstrated through their record, but also matters of temperament and just demeanor, which are very important. So we moved, we shifted that conversation from so many of the issues that I had been focused on to two other areas that are also important in evaluating a nominee for the court. But I listened, I listened very carefully to the remarks, the strong well articulated remarks of my colleague, and my friend that sits next to my here, Senator Collins. And I found that I agreed with many of the points that she raised on the floor earlier. I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh will be a vote to overturn Roe versus Wade. And I also join with her in saying that I do not think that protections for those with pre-existing conditions will be at risk. And I also do not think that he will be a threat to Alaska Natives. That was an issue that certainly had been raised. But I had extended conversation with the judge on just these issues. And I believe that he recognizes as he told me that Alaska Natives are not in that identical place as Native Hawaiians. Alaskan tribes are included on the list of a federally recognized tribes and the fact remains that Native Hawaiians are not, this is a distinction, a difference. I am one who in this body have said I would like to see Native Hawaiians there. And I worked with my friend Senator Akaka when he was in this body to help advance that. I supported those. But the fact remains that the constitutional status of Alaska Natives and the Indian commerce clause are simply not at play with this nomination. I don't believe that. So the question fairly asked, say that you think he's going to be there on issues that matter to Alaskans? That you have taken strong positions on. The reason that I could not support Judge Kavanaugh in this cloture motion this afternoon is that in my role, my responsibility as one senator on this floor, I take this obligation that we have in the role of advice and consent as seriously as anything that I am obligated or privileged to be able to vote on. And so, I have a very high standard. I have a very high bar for any nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. The code of judicial conduct rule, 1.2, this is one that many, many people in this body know. But it states that, quote, \"A judge act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\" I go back. I look to that. It is pretty high. It is really high. That a judge shall act at all times. Not just sometimes when you're wearing your robe, but a judge should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence. Public confidence. Where is the public confidence? So it is high. And even -- even in the face of the worst thing that could happen, a sexual assault allegation, even in the face of an overly and overtly, overtly political process, a politicized process and even when one side of this chamber is absolutely dead set on defeating his nomination from the very get-go, before he was even named, even -- even in these situations, the standard is that a judge must act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence and the independence, integrity and partiality of the judiciary and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. And after the hearing that we all watched last week, last Thursday, it became clear to me or was becoming clearer that that appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable. And I've been deliberating, agonizing about what is fair. Is this too unfair a burden to place on somebody that is dealing with the worst -- the most horrific allegations that go to your integrity, that go to everything that you are. I think we all struggle with how we would respond. But I am reminded there are only -- there are only nine seats on the bench of the highest court in the land. And these seats are occupied by these men and women for their lifetime. And so those who seek one of these seats must meet the highest standards in all respects at all times. And that is hard. Mr. President, we are at a time when many in this country have lost faith in the executive branch. And it's not -- it's not just with this administration. We saw -- we saw much of that in the last as well. And here in Congress, many around the country have just given up on us. They've completely said we've had enough. But I maintain that the public still views, I still view that there is some small shred of hope that remains with our judiciary. This judiciary that must be perceived as independent as nonpartisan, as fair and balanced in order for our form of government to function. And it's that hope, it's that hope that I seek to maintain. I think that's why I have demanded such a high standard to maintain or regain that public confidence. Because it is so critical that we have that public confidence in at least one of our three branches of government. Mr. President, I think we saw from the vote earlier today, we've seen from statements from several of our colleagues that it does appear that Judge Kavanaugh will be seated on the Supreme Court without my vote. It is my hope, it is truly my hope that Judge Kavanaugh will share that same hope in rebuilding, maintaining a level of public confidence, that he will strive for that ideal every day. It's my hope that he will be that neutral arbiter, the umpire who only calls the balls and the strikes. That he will be that force for stability. I believe that Judge Kavanaugh is a good man. He's a good man. He's clearly a learned judge. But in my conscious, because that's how I have to vote, to end of the day, is with my conscious, I could not conclude that he is the right person for the court at this time. And this has been agonizing for me with this decision. It is a -- it is as hard a choice probably as close a call as any that I can ever remember. And I hope, I hope and I pray that we don't find ourselves in this situation again.",

Maine Senator Susan Collins did not call the White House this morning to indicate one way or another how she was going to vote.  The White House wasn't worried about that, figuring that she would have only called them if she was a no. But the White House sort of breathlessly watching as she made that impassioned statement on the Senate floor this afternoon when she led up to her decision.  And with or the decision that she had made at least on Judge Kavanaugh.  And you can bet that there were some tense moments here at the White House as she laid out her thinking.

A, he wants to prove the truth and B, I assume he thinks if you open this up to discovery, a justice on the Supreme Court does not want to go -- want to go through a discovery in that painful process."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOOD",
      "utterance": "Well, Michael Avenatti probably wants to be sued because he wants some excuse to try to remain relevant in the public eye as he apparently now campaigns for presidency of the United States.  Yes -- and look, the burden of proof is it does flip the system on its head not unlike what they tried to do to Judge Kavanaugh in the hearing.  When you file a libel lawsuit, you have the burden of proof, but in an accusation so heinous as to accuse this good man of being involved or complicit in gang rape indecent exposure and sexual assault, sometimes the decision has to be that doing nothing is unacceptable. I don't expect Judge Kavanaugh will file a lawsuit.  He's going to spend the next few years hopefully writing some incredible decisions on the United States Supreme Court.  He's supposed to be a litigant in civil lawsuits but that doesn't change my advice.  The message should be sent. People should know there needs to be accountability."

On one hand, I hear you and I think this man says his reputation was unfairly destroyed.  He should stand up.  On the other hand, as you just said, if he is in fact confirmed tomorrow as we expect and we'll see if there's a last-minute snag, he's got a lot more important business to do. Should he be spending -- I want to say wasting time because it wouldn't be seen as a waste by you and others -- but should he spend time when he's on the high court dealing with Michael Avenatti and the rest or should he just move on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOOD",

Brett Kavanaugh though bloodied, unbeaten and prevailed.  Mitch McConnell did an excellent job.  The star of the show I think was Susan Collins and that needs to be considered for a minute because although a lot of conservatives don't like her, I've known her for a long time and liked her. She is not ideological but she is principled and she is thorough and she's a procedural regular and she was a winner.  Most important, the American people were winners.  If this had prevailed the other way, if this had gone the other way, we would have exalted some notions like if you disagree with someone you can destroy them and you should assume the worst of a person if an accusation comes up --"

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "OK. We want to go straight to a Fox News alert. Republicans Senator Lisa Murkowski, you see her there, she's from Alaska, she's speaking out on the Senate floor. We want to dip in real quick."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI, R-ALASKA",
      "utterance": "Been damaged, been damaged terribly. And as both of these individuals, Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have been harmed, their families have, too. And we need to, we must do better by them. We must do better as a legislative branch. We have an obligation, a moral obligation to do better than this. I spent more time evaluating and considering the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh than I have with any of the previous nominations to the United States Supreme Court that I've had the privilege to review. I've had the opportunity to vote on five justices prior to this. And I took my time. I was deliberate. I was thoughtful. Some accused me of being too deliberate, too thoughtful. Taking too much time. But this is important to me. It should be important to all of us. And I know that it is important to all of us. And so I studied the record. I sat with Judge Kavanaugh for a lengthy period of time. About an hour and a half and asked the questions that I had and did more due diligence. Reviewed the cases and did my homework. Listened to the concerns that were raised by many in my state on issues that were all over the board, whether it was women's right to choose, whether it was the Affordable Care Act, whether it was executive authority, deference to the agencies native issues. I took considerable time. And when the hearings came, not being on the judiciary committee, I paid attention. I followed the testimony of the judge, the very critical questioning from many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. And then when the end of the process or so seemingly what we believed to be the end of the process, there were more questions. I went back to Judge Kavanaugh. Had a good conversation with him. And then the allegations that we have been discussing and trying to understand more about came forward and we all moved from focusing on the issues to truly a discussion that none of us ever thought that we would be having when it came to confirmation process for someone to the highest court in the land. And so there was more work to be done. I was one who wanted to make sure that there was a process going forward. And when there were more questions that were raised after the initial process, was one who joined in asking that the FBI step in and do further reviews. So I have been engaged in this lengthy and deliberative process for months now. And I was truly leaning toward supporting Judge Kavanaugh in his nomination as I looked to that record. But we know that in our rule of advice and consent, it's not just -- it is not the record itself. There is more that is attached to it. It is way when in the State of Alaska a nomination for a judge goes forward, you rate them not only on their professional competence, what they have demonstrated through their record, but also matters of temperament and just demeanor, which are very important. So we moved, we shifted that conversation from so many of the issues that I had been focused on to two other areas that are also important in evaluating a nominee for the court. But I listened, I listened very carefully to the remarks, the strong well articulated remarks of my colleague, and my friend that sits next to my here, Senator Collins. And I found that I agreed with many of the points that she raised on the floor earlier. I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh will be a vote to overturn Roe versus Wade. And I also join with her in saying that I do not think that protections for those with pre-existing conditions will be at risk. And I also do not think that he will be a threat to Alaska Natives. That was an issue that certainly had been raised. But I had extended conversation with the judge on just these issues. And I believe that he recognizes as he told me that Alaska Natives are not in that identical place as Native Hawaiians. Alaskan tribes are included on the list of a federally recognized tribes and the fact remains that Native Hawaiians are not, this is a distinction, a difference. I am one who in this body have said I would like to see Native Hawaiians there. And I worked with my friend Senator Akaka when he was in this body to help advance that. I supported those. But the fact remains that the constitutional status of Alaska Natives and the Indian commerce clause are simply not at play with this nomination. I don't believe that. So the question fairly asked, say that you think he's going to be there on issues that matter to Alaskans? That you have taken strong positions on. The reason that I could not support Judge Kavanaugh in this cloture motion this afternoon is that in my role, my responsibility as one senator on this floor, I take this obligation that we have in the role of advice and consent as seriously as anything that I am obligated or privileged to be able to vote on. And so, I have a very high standard. I have a very high bar for any nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. The code of judicial conduct rule, 1.2, this is one that many, many people in this body know. But it states that, quote, \"A judge act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.\" I go back. I look to that. It is pretty high. It is really high. That a judge shall act at all times. Not just sometimes when you're wearing your robe, but a judge should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence. Public confidence. Where is the public confidence? So it is high. And even -- even in the face of the worst thing that could happen, a sexual assault allegation, even in the face of an overly and overtly, overtly political process, a politicized process and even when one side of this chamber is absolutely dead set on defeating his nomination from the very get-go, before he was even named, even -- even in these situations, the standard is that a judge must act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence and the independence, integrity and partiality of the judiciary and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. And after the hearing that we all watched last week, last Thursday, it became clear to me or was becoming clearer that that appearance of impropriety has become unavoidable. And I've been deliberating, agonizing about what is fair. Is this too unfair a burden to place on somebody that is dealing with the worst -- the most horrific allegations that go to your integrity, that go to everything that you are. I think we all struggle with how we would respond. But I am reminded there are only -- there are only nine seats on the bench of the highest court in the land. And these seats are occupied by these men and women for their lifetime. And so those who seek one of these seats must meet the highest standards in all respects at all times. And that is hard. Mr. President, we are at a time when many in this country have lost faith in the executive branch. And it's not -- it's not just with this administration. We saw -- we saw much of that in the last as well. And here in Congress, many around the country have just given up on us. They've completely said we've had enough. But I maintain that the public still views, I still view that there is some small shred of hope that remains with our judiciary. This judiciary that must be perceived as independent as nonpartisan, as fair and balanced in order for our form of government to function. And it's that hope, it's that hope that I seek to maintain. I think that's why I have demanded such a high standard to maintain or regain that public confidence. Because it is so critical that we have that public confidence in at least one of our three branches of government. Mr. President, I think we saw from the vote earlier today, we've seen from statements from several of our colleagues that it does appear that Judge Kavanaugh will be seated on the Supreme Court without my vote. It is my hope, it is truly my hope that Judge Kavanaugh will share that same hope in rebuilding, maintaining a level of public confidence, that he will strive for that ideal every day. It's my hope that he will be that neutral arbiter, the umpire who only calls the balls and the strikes. That he will be that force for stability. I believe that Judge Kavanaugh is a good man. He's a good man. He's clearly a learned judge. But in my conscious, because that's how I have to vote, to end of the day, is with my conscious, I could not conclude that he is the right person for the court at this time. And this has been agonizing for me with this decision. It is a -- it is as hard a choice probably as close a call as any that I can ever remember. And I hope, I hope and I pray that we don't find ourselves in this situation again."
