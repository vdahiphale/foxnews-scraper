With us right now, one of the Republican leaders, South Dakota Republican John Thune. Of course, he is part of that leadership, working very closely behind the scenes to get us to where we are.  Senator, is that right that this is looking dicey?",

I think, honestly, if I look at the policy, and I have listened to in over 30 meetings to members on both sides of this, I think we have sort of found the right balance. And this is a huge, consequential reform of an entitlement program. It is -- we are doing away with mandates. We're reducing taxes that were raised under Obamacare.
