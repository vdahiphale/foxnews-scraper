But I disagree with the fact that they're taking half the cuts out of 16 percent of the budget, which is the Defense Department, which has already had a half a trillion dollars in cuts taken from it just a couple of years ago through this president and the Democratic Congress.  And so for that piece of the budget, which I think in most Americans's mind is the most important thing that the federal government does -- it's the indispensable thing. Nobody else can do national security except the federal government. And it leaves two thirds of the budget, entitlements alone. And for the president to go out and to, as I said, manipulate the American public by, you know, conjuring up all of these horrific images -- I'm -- you know, given the president's rhetoric, I'm surprised the lights are still on in this studio compared to what the president was suggesting was going to happen.",

And this is the other thing that's so -- so disheartening about this president's leadership. He could avoid really all of the painful things by working with Congress and simply allocating resources and agree to allocate resources in places where we don't need to spend this money. That's just -- you know, that's just common sense leadership. That's working together with people. This president has shown no indication of doing so. He seems to be fixated on an agenda to demonize Republicans so he can get a stronger political hand and force through more of his policies that are destroying our economy.",

And I think, you know, the average American is seeing it and seeing him over the top and really beginning to discount him a little bit in his rhetoric.  But let's be honest, they do see the Congress as incompetent and not able to get their act together and put forth anything that looks like a plan. And they blame both parties.
