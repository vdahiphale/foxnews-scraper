      "sentences": "All right. All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from New York tonight on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. We take a closer look at Pete Buttigieg. So, I have a question and we've been just itching to get at this subject for a while now. Is the media lying to you when they say the former South Bend Mayor, he's a moderate? Also, we have been on the front lines of calling for a housecleaning inside Trump's National Security Council. We'll tell you why the dismissal of the Vindman brothers was just the beginning and long overdue.   Plus, unhinged celebrities, their latest political ramblings are the most hilarious things you'll see in any comedic interlude that Hollywood can offer. But it was at the Oscars last night. Raymond Arroyo, Tom Shillue, they break all the theatrics down a little later on the show. But first, this is good. The Left's rage and chaos campaign. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now imagine if the Democratic Party of let's say Georgia had sponsored a voter registration drive with balloons and posters that have a sign-up station. It'd be manned by eager party volunteers on the sidewalk. Let's say outside of shopping mall. Then a van pulls up and a driver rolls down the window. But then he hits the gas and he plow through the tent. Luckily, no injuries. Well, this story of course would lead every major newscast and regardless of the facts Trump hating reporters would jump to the conclusion that he was at least partly the impetus for such a heinous act.  Well on Saturday, 27-year-old Gregory Timm was arrested in Jacksonville Florida for plowing into a Republican get out the vote tent outside of Wal- Mart. The GOP of Duval County said that six volunteers were targeted.   Now this assailant wasn't registered to vote. He didn't have much of a social media presence. And the Duval County Democrats released a statement saying we're thankful that the perpetrator of this cowardly act has been apprehended by police and continue to call for civility during this election cycle. Well good for them for condemning but that sentiment wouldn't have been enough had the shoe been on the other foot. Now it's important to note that there has essentially been no response from the Democrat 2020 candidates about this who claim to care so deeply about such issues.",

But predictably, the media has barely covered this story at all. Think about this. The attack happened on Saturday.

Or are they just the deplorable as Hillary described, or are they just stupid or are they just racist?  This whole thing is getting out of hand and it smacks of total desperation on the part of the Democrats. Now, we still don't know which ANTIFA thugs are responsible for citizen journalists Andy Ngo's brain bleed last year, of the Democrats running for President at the time, only Andrew Yang and Joe Biden even condemn that attack.  Political leadership in cities such as Portland, Oregon, Berkeley, you've seen this kind of craziness a lot on the Left coast where the rampage took place. They've largely turned a blind eye to Leftist violence. Police are given stand down orders and masked ANTIFA radicals have been allowed to wail on anyone who gets in their way with impunity, especially Trump supporters. No consequences. Few, if any arrests. And these people claim Trump's the ones stoking hatred. Are you kidding me? The nonstop, most cruel demonization of the President and anyone who works for him or supports him occurs 24/7. And it's not just by knit cap wearing basement dwellers on social media.

So, I have a question and we've been just itching to get at this subject for a while now. Is the media lying to you when they say the former South Bend Mayor, he's a moderate? Also, we have been on the front lines of calling for a housecleaning inside Trump's National Security Council. We'll tell you why the dismissal of the Vindman brothers was just the beginning and long overdue. Plus, unhinged celebrities, their latest political ramblings are the most hilarious things you'll see in any comedic interlude that Hollywood can offer. But it was at the Oscars last night. Raymond Arroyo, Tom Shillue, they break all the theatrics down a little later on the show. But first, this is good. The Left's rage and chaos campaign. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now imagine if the Democratic Party of let's say Georgia had sponsored a voter registration drive with balloons and posters that have a sign-up station. It'd be manned by eager party volunteers on the sidewalk. Let's say outside of shopping mall. Then a van pulls up and a driver rolls down the window. But then he hits the gas and he plow through the tent. Luckily, no injuries. Well, this story of course would lead every major newscast and regardless of the facts Trump hating reporters would jump to the conclusion that he was at least partly the impetus for such a heinous act. Well on Saturday, 27-year-old Gregory Timm was arrested in Jacksonville Florida for plowing into a Republican get out the vote tent outside of Wal- Mart. The GOP of Duval County said that six volunteers were targeted. Now this assailant wasn't registered to vote. He didn't have much of a social media presence. And the Duval County Democrats released a statement saying we're thankful that the perpetrator of this cowardly act has been apprehended by police and continue to call for civility during this election cycle. Well good for them for condemning but that sentiment wouldn't have been enough had the shoe been on the other foot. Now it's important to note that there has essentially been no response from the Democrat 2020 candidates about this who claim to care so deeply about such issues."

But predictably, the media has barely covered this story at all. Think about this. The attack happened on Saturday. And as of Sunday morning, only NBC Sunday today covered it and only for 25 seconds. Now remember what preceded this Florida attack, think about the dark and sinister way prominent people are talking about the President. The outcome of his impeachment trial and America in general."

Or are they just the deplorable as Hillary described, or are they just stupid or are they just racist? This whole thing is getting out of hand and it smacks of total desperation on the part of the Democrats. Now, we still don't know which ANTIFA thugs are responsible for citizen journalists Andy Ngo's brain bleed last year, of the Democrats running for President at the time, only Andrew Yang and Joe Biden even condemn that attack. Political leadership in cities such as Portland, Oregon, Berkeley, you've seen this kind of craziness a lot on the Left coast where the rampage took place. They've largely turned a blind eye to Leftist violence. Police are given stand down orders and masked ANTIFA radicals have been allowed to wail on anyone who gets in their way with impunity, especially Trump supporters. No consequences. Few, if any arrests. And these people claim Trump's the ones stoking hatred. Are you kidding me? The nonstop, most cruel demonization of the President and anyone who works for him or supports him occurs 24/7. And it's not just by knit cap wearing basement dwellers on social media.

One of the busiest train stations in the United States. This was even about wanting free stuff. They were testing de Blasio and Cuomo. So, will there be any repercussions for this, of course not. There never is. De Blasio is hated by the police for good reason. He doesn't have their backs and they know it. This has created a poisonous and frankly, it's created a dangerous dynamic for the people of this city. And it's not going to end until once again they elect someone like Rudy Giuliani, who was tough, but fair. And things are now even worse.

We had riots in different cities, and it was a lot of social justice, angst and outrage. Obviously, the killing of Martin Luther King, which was horrific. The country was going through a lot. But we need things to calm down, not ramp up, especially at a time when the economy is doing so well for so many people. You can debate the policies, have a vigorous debate. You can be angry at Trump for anything you want. That's fine. That's the process. But what's happening here with it with a van plowing through a tent? I'm sorry. I'm not buying it. That this was just - we don't know what motivated this guy. But with all the hate and rage all over social media, 24/7, constantly.

He first gives them an obscene gesture and then he accelerates toward them as he's videotaping it. Our elderly volunteers barely get out of the way, he plows through the location, upending everything, and then he backs up and he videotapes it again. He was proud of his work.

I plead guilty and I've been sounding alarm about these disloyal holdovers from the very first weeks that we were on the air after the Vindman brothers were sent packing on Friday, reassigned. It looks like the Trump administration, under the leadership of National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien is finally cleaning house. Now we're learning from The Washington Examiner that the White House is in the process of cutting 70, 70 Obama era holdovers from the National Security Council. Boy, is that about time. Joining me now, Congressman Lee Zeldin and Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. Congressman, well, this is a welcome development. I almost choked in saying 70, OK. Why did it take so long and how many others are burrowed into other agencies? Also, the CIA, also the FBI are working against Trump in various different ways."

And every President from one after another, they had the prerogative to make changes as to what they want their NSC to look like. And for President Trump and you could argue that this should have happened a long time ago, maybe as soon as he even came into office. If he wants to have an NSC that has 80 staffers, 150, 200, that's his prerogative. And it's not just inside the NSC, but specifically as we're talking about here, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is the perfect example. Tim Morrison testified that he had a problem with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's judgment. Fiona Hill told Lieutenant Colonel, told Tim Morrison, that she had concerns about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's judgment. Fiona Hill's deputy, others in the NSC and then you have Lieutenant Colonel Vindman after the July 25th call, contacting a whistleblower before sharing any concerns with Tim Morrison and then lied about it when asked about it during the impeachment inquiry. Remember, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Adam Schiff said, they had no idea who the whistleblower was. However, if Lieutenant Colonel Vindman says the name of the one person other than George Kent spoke to outside the NSC, he would therefore, by saying that name, then be naming the whistleblower. Well, if you're honest, if you have integrity, how is it that you don't know who the whistleblower is, but naming that one person without it?"

Remember, two of them, Grace and Misko went right over work for Schiff, and they're on his staff right now. The whistleblower was in the NSC and the Vindman twins were in NSC. And Fiona Hill was in the NSC, who was at odds with Trump supporter, Patel. And remember, another thing that's very strange. Ben Rhodes was a Deputy National Security Adviser under Obama. And Jake Sullivan was the National Security Adviser for Joe Biden. In early 2018, they had a big press conference, say, where they were going to make an anti-Trump foreign policy conglomerate, National Security Agency and before they left, that National Security Council ballooned to 230 people. And they were in contact, obviously, with a lot of these people that were holdovers that were feeding them information all about what was going on, because we had leak after leak after leak coming out of the NSC. And I think another thing, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but we've had four national security advisors. And there was a reason why Michael Flynn was taken out very early, because of all the national security advisors, he was going to make it a point to clean house."

So they do not congratulate leeks that came out right before H.R. McMaster was fired. That memo, those leaks, those came right from the top.

But in reality, Buttigieg's agenda is in a lot of ways just as extreme as that of Bernie Sanders or even AOC. Let's take a look at down the list. Mayor Pete wants to abolish the Electoral College. He favors packing the Supreme Court. And last month, he declared his unwavering support for unrestricted abortions to a seven-year- old girl. On immigration, Buttigieg supports giving illegal aliens free health care plus college scholarships and easier access to welfare. Oh, and he wants to give citizenship and reparations for illegal immigrant families separated at the border. does any of that sound middle-of-the-road to you? Buttigieg has also positioned himself as a foe of Sanders' Medicare for all plan, but in practice his own plan is no less extreme. According to \"The Washington Post,\" the plan, quote, \"hinges on a supercharged version of the unpopular Obamacare mandate.\" And what is his plan for solving the opioid epidemic, for instance? Well, more drugs flooding your streets."

But what he has been saying in places like Iowa, New Hampshire, and across the country, are that there are some folks calling for complete revolution and other folks calling the status quo. And that leaves a lot of people in America without a political demarcation who feel frustrated as not being part of the process. And those are the folks that we are welcoming to support the Buttigieg campaign, because even if you don't agree with him 100 percent, he is looking for practical, pragmatic, progressive solutions to some of the problems facing the country right now."
