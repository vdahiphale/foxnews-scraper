We have got Lydia Hu in Asbury Park, New Jersey, with the latest on what beachgoers are doing there, preparing for rain, unfortunately, that is coming there, and Grady Trimble at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on how they're dealing with the surge that's on. But it's a good surge, a surge of people waiting to have fun. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And they call this the unofficial start of summer. But, for a lot of Americans, it could not come a moment too soon, even though it is technically not yet officially summer.

There might not be any available left this weekend if you haven't booked one already.

But over here at the White House, the argument that they are making is that the president's economic plan and economic vision is working, they believe, so they say more spending is needed down the line in terms of the American Families Plan, American Jobs Plan, which is a part of this budget as well. And there is certainly spending in the first proposed budget that the president will be sending up to Congress, the headline, $6 trillion for fiscal year 2022, which starts in October. They are also projecting a deficit of $1.8 trillion because of it. That would be about 7.8 percent of GDP. The acting OMB, Office of Management and Budget, the director, Shalanda Young, describes the White House thinking this way, saying -- quote -- \"The decades-long global trend of declining interest rates, even as publicly held debt has increased, gives us the fiscal space to make necessary up- front investments.\" So that's part of how the White House views this. But, Neil, they are also projecting huge deficits, about $7.5 trillion for the next five decades, double that, about $14.5 trillion, over the course of a decade. Should be no surprise Republicans here in Washington say this is a no-go. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, for example, saying in a statement -- quote -- \"Now we know why the administration tried to bury their budget announcement on the Friday before a holiday weekend. President Biden's proposal will drown American families and debt, deficits and inflation.\" Now just to give you an idea, Neil, as to how the White House views potential spending down the line, in 2031, a decade from now, it calls for a possible $8.2 trillion in government spending -- Neil.",

We need to stop spending money that we don't have. This budget is more of the same. And I think the interesting part about it is, this would have been the opportunity for the administration to pull up a little bit, with high inflation that those -- the skeptics are being proved right to some extent. We had the announcement today, the highest increase since 1992. We -- interest rates are going up on Treasury bills since -- over the last several months. So, to the acting director who's saying that this has given us a window of time, that window has vanished.

Now, after China announced it won't cooperate in any more probes about the pandemic origins, President Biden ordered the intelligence community to declassify its materials and also expand the probe for 90 days to include resources that weren't previously part of it, like national labs and health and medical experts. But this comes as Congress is also pushing to get to the bottom of this. House Republicans launched an investigation into a federal grant to EcoHealth Alliance, which awarded taxpayer money to the Wuhan lab to study coronaviruses in bats after SARS in the early 2000s. Now, the group is concerned that EcoHealth knew about the Chinese attempts to cover-up the pandemic and didn't inform the U.S. government. They also want to know whether the lab was conducting any research outside the grant that could make a virus deadlier. Also, two bipartisan bills were introduced in the House this morning. The first would strip China of sovereign immunity. Now, that would allow COVID victim families to directly sue the Chinese government for damages. That's similar to actions taken against Saudi Arabia after 9/11. And it would also review the actions of the World Health Organization. The second bill would establish a bipartisan commission modeled after the 9/11 Commission, which would focus on COVID origin response and also preparations for a future pandemic as it relates to supply inventory. Those goals were also mirrored in the Health and Human Services and DOD budget requests, which were also released today. And, meantime, another effort to establish a 9/11-style commission failed on Capitol Hill today after Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would investigate the January 6 insurrection. But the White House said today President Biden is committed to a full and independent probe -- Neil.",

No matter what the president's doing to get to the bottom of the beginning of COVID and its origins, Republican and Democratic congressmen leading an effort to get their own commission to look into the same thing. With us right now, Republican Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. We have got Josh Gottheimer, the Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair of New Jersey. So, they're both co-chairs, I should just stress there, and a bipartisan effort to get to the bottom of this. Gentlemen, thank you for taking the time. Congressman Fitzpatrick, if I can begin with you.

They have lied about the virus. They have lied about currency manipulation and intellectual property theft. That's what they do. And I think it's time. And this is a strong message, Neil. You have five Democrats and five Republicans that have forged together to pursue this, both on the sovereign immunity stripping, as well as the COVID origination investigation. We need our intelligence community to do their investigation, which they are. Congress has an oversight role to play. We got to do our job.

Two weeks earlier, the WHO was parroting CCP's talking point that there was no human-to-human spread of COVID-19. Let's just think about that, of all we have been through, of all we know, that the World Health Organization, whose sole responsibility it is to track pandemics and viral activity, is parroting the Chinese talking points. This is not hard to figure out, Neil. And a lot of people are asking for the smoking gun evidence. That's never going to come. It all exists in the Wuhan Institute of Virology that's on lockdown. They now have a military general overseeing it, when it was a civilian. They have military guards outside of it. We're not getting access to it. That's where the only direct evidence will exist.

It's going to keep things really cool, keep things really breezy. And it's going to keep, unfortunately, watching a lot of moisture. So, this is the future radar. Just take a look at what happens. By the time we get in towards all the day Saturday, into the day on Sunday, we have got this storm that is just plaguing areas of the Northeast, not going anywhere. And then along with that cold, with that rain, it's going to be some really significantly dropping temperatures. Rainfall over the weekend, that's -- there you go. It's areas of New England especially. There's a drought going on across New England. So you want to get that, but maybe not on Memorial Day weekend. We're also going to be watching those storms firing up. This is the time of year we start to see this dry line develop and storms firing up every afternoon, especially across parts of West Texas, West Oklahoma and Kansas. So we're going to see that continuing on throughout the weekend. But here at FOX Weather, I tell you what. We're watching really cool temperatures to start at the unofficial start of summer this Memorial Day weekend, not looking good, especially across parts of the Northeast -- Neil.",

But, to be clear, if there's an assault on either a TSA employee or a member of the flight crew, we really are taking a zero tolerance policy. Odds are, when that plane lands, you will be met by TSA and law enforcement, you will be placed under arrest. And, as you reported up front, you do face tens of thousands and fines. And so the message is very clear. Treat people with respect. Pack your patience this summer. We want to continue to see full planes and airports.

So, we will see what this weekend looks like. We are anticipating a very busy start of the travel season. But I also think that it's important to recognize that we're going to be busy through the summer and into the fall. TSA has really made a priority in getting our folks hired. We are averaging over 5,000 applicants a week for folks who want to come work for TSA. We have hired over 3,100 officers this year. Between now and Fourth of July, we expect to hire another 1,000 more. And as we get closer to Labor Day, we will be closer to 6,000 officers that we have hired this year.

But over here at the White House, the argument that they are making is that the president's economic plan and economic vision is working, they believe, so they say more spending is needed down the line in terms of the American Families Plan, American Jobs Plan, which is a part of this budget as well. And there is certainly spending in the first proposed budget that the president will be sending up to Congress, the headline, $6 trillion for fiscal year 2022, which starts in October. They are also projecting a deficit of $1.8 trillion because of it. That would be about 7.8 percent of GDP. The acting OMB, Office of Management and Budget, the director, Shalanda Young, describes the White House thinking this way, saying -- quote -- \"The decades-long global trend of declining interest rates, even as publicly held debt has increased, gives us the fiscal space to make necessary up- front investments.\" So that's part of how the White House views this. But, Neil, they are also projecting huge deficits, about $7.5 trillion for the next five decades, double that, about $14.5 trillion, over the course of a decade. Should be no surprise Republicans here in Washington say this is a no-go. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, for example, saying in a statement -- quote -- \"Now we know why the administration tried to bury their budget announcement on the Friday before a holiday weekend. President Biden's proposal will drown American families and debt, deficits and inflation.\" Now just to give you an idea, Neil, as to how the White House views potential spending down the line, in 2031, a decade from now, it calls for a possible $8.2 trillion in government spending -- Neil."

We're getting out of the response to COVID. COVID has been given everything it needs to be able to fight that battle, and then to just continue to grow government. Look, the answer is really easy. We need to stop spending money that we don't have. This budget is more of the same. And I think the interesting part about it is, this would have been the opportunity for the administration to pull up a little bit, with high inflation that those -- the skeptics are being proved right to some extent. We had the announcement today, the highest increase since 1992. We -- interest rates are going up on Treasury bills since -- over the last several months. So, to the acting director who's saying that this has given us a window of time, that window has vanished. And now we're looking -- we got to secure the country, and you give us a budget that is $6 trillion and underfunds defense, of all things. It's just -- it's fundamentally unserious.

But I think there's also increased concern about inflation and the economy. And to the extent that they don't have Democrat votes, and Republican votes are going to be vanishing at this point soon if they continue to negotiate in that direction, I think we have a shot to stop some of these bad bills from being tacked on to our debt and deficits."

Well, today, the White House refused to comment on intelligence after The New York Times reported intelligence officials have a batch of unexamined evidence that needs more computer analysis. Now, after China announced it won't cooperate in any more probes about the pandemic origins, President Biden ordered the intelligence community to declassify its materials and also expand the probe for 90 days to include resources that weren't previously part of it, like national labs and health and medical experts. But this comes as Congress is also pushing to get to the bottom of this. House Republicans launched an investigation into a federal grant to EcoHealth Alliance, which awarded taxpayer money to the Wuhan lab to study coronaviruses in bats after SARS in the early 2000s. Now, the group is concerned that EcoHealth knew about the Chinese attempts to cover-up the pandemic and didn't inform the U.S. government. They also want to know whether the lab was conducting any research outside the grant that could make a virus deadlier. Also, two bipartisan bills were introduced in the House this morning. The first would strip China of sovereign immunity. Now, that would allow COVID victim families to directly sue the Chinese government for damages. That's similar to actions taken against Saudi Arabia after 9/11. And it would also review the actions of the World Health Organization. The second bill would establish a bipartisan commission modeled after the 9/11 Commission, which would focus on COVID origin response and also preparations for a future pandemic as it relates to supply inventory. Those goals were also mirrored in the Health and Human Services and DOD budget requests, which were also released today. And, meantime, another effort to establish a 9/11-style commission failed on Capitol Hill today after Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would investigate the January 6 insurrection. But the White House said today President Biden is committed to a full and independent probe -- Neil."

With us right now, Republican Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. We have got Josh Gottheimer, the Problem Solvers Caucus co-chair of New Jersey. So, they're both co-chairs, I should just stress there, and a bipartisan effort to get to the bottom of this. Gentlemen, thank you for taking the time. Congressman Fitzpatrick, if I can begin with you. Is it that the reason for this and what you're doing with your colleague that you're not satisfied with the way the administration wants to look into this, or that this would be a better way to go about it?"

They have lied about the virus. They have lied about currency manipulation and intellectual property theft. That's what they do. And I think it's time. And this is a strong message, Neil. You have five Democrats and five Republicans that have forged together to pursue this, both on the sovereign immunity stripping, as well as the COVID origination investigation. We need our intelligence community to do their investigation, which they are. Congress has an oversight role to play. We got to do our job.

It's why, as the president said this week, we actually have to get all the intelligence and everything from the intelligence community, bring it to bear, so we can get to the facts. The reason we want this bipartisan commission to come together is, we want to keep the politics out of this. This shouldn't be a Democrat or Republican issue. This should just be about the United States of America and finding out where this came from, how it actually got to the United States, and obviously killed and hurt so many of our fellow citizens.

Two weeks earlier, the WHO was parroting CCP's talking point that there was no human-to-human spread of COVID-19. Let's just think about that, of all we have been through, of all we know, that the World Health Organization, whose sole responsibility it is to track pandemics and viral activity, is parroting the Chinese talking points. This is not hard to figure out, Neil. And a lot of people are asking for the smoking gun evidence. That's never going to come. It all exists in the Wuhan Institute of Virology that's on lockdown. They now have a military general overseeing it, when it was a civilian. They have military guards outside of it. We're not getting access to it. That's where the only direct evidence will exist.

And it's going to take us actually doing the work. Thinking that we're going to rely on other outside organizations has obviously not proven to be fruitful to date, and one we shouldn't -- and we shouldn't be -- we shouldn't expect that that's going to change. So, I'm in Northern New Jersey. We got hit here in early March very hard. We lost a lot of people. And so many people were sick, just like around the country.

One of the significant problem, we can't just put it all on the pandemic. But people are not handling conflict very well. They're escalating right into violence that causes death. We have seen more and more of that. We have seen multiple shooting situations. But the other thing that is not helping is this demonizing the police, the impact that's having on violent criminals are becoming aggressive towards our police officers. So there are a lot of dynamics. But I got to tell you, Neil, I was reading something. The Los Angeles chief had made comments about this violent crime is because of gang violence and some other thing. Well, let's talk about the elephant in the room. Let's talk about bail reform, the decisions that some of these judges are making to release violent predatory criminals back into neighborhoods. That's a big issue. When you see violence going up all over the country, what's the common denominator? Well, yes, we can talk about the pandemic, but what about what's happening in the courts? What about what's happening in some of the prosecutorial offices. Look at the L.A. prosecutor wanting to close, reform prisons.

But you want to end qualified immunity for police officers. They did it in New York. So what does that do to the psyche of a police officer? I am not supported. Why should I put myself at risk if nobody's going to stand up and protect us? Fortunately, here in Detroit, there's no defunding talk. I mean, there's a few that talk it, but the leaders, the people who sit in seats of leadership, don't want defunding. And who's talking to the people who live in vulnerable communities? They don't want defunding. And who does it mostly impact? People of color. And so it's shameful when these conversations are taking place and they're not taking in consideration of who's most impacted by that. And then the other thing, Neil, we shouldn't forget that, along with police officers not feeling supported, now what? Do they shut down? Do they do what's called de-policing. Not de-policing in Detroit. Some of these cities, because they don't feel supported, why take the risks? They're not out doing proactive policing. In fact, New York shut down in proactive policing."

So, it -- a reason we were successful, again, we went out and walked through the plants and talked to the people. And that still, I think, will always -- that will always be a very good strategy.

      "utterance": "All right, so this is maybe one of those times when we talk about summer starting on June 21, instead of Memorial Day. Sorry. I got some pretty bad news here, especially across a lot of the Eastern Seaboard, and especially really across parts of the Northeast. Take a look at these temperatures. This is right now. It is 48 degrees right now in Chicago, 62 in New York. Enjoy the 62, because it's about to plummet, and get a lot colder as we move forward into tomorrow and into the day on Sunday. Warm down across areas of Florida. We have a bit of a storm that's moving through. It's going to bring some pretty significant rain over about the next two-and-a-half days, especially to parts of the Northeast. Here's what we're looking at right now, some pretty big showers, thunderstorms, not that severe, not looking at any tornado activity yet today across parts of Texas, but some pretty big boomers going on right there, definitely some hail and some wind. And then kind of the bulk of this moisture pulls off towards the East Coast. Problem is, is, behind this really significant rain, another bit of a system is going to develop, and it's just going to linger there for a lot of the weekend, unfortunately, a bit of a kind of a coastal storm. It's going to keep things really cool, keep things really breezy. And it's going to keep, unfortunately, watching a lot of moisture. So, this is the future radar. Just take a look at what happens. By the time we get in towards all the day Saturday, into the day on Sunday, we have got this storm that is just plaguing areas of the Northeast, not going anywhere. And then along with that cold, with that rain, it's going to be some really significantly dropping temperatures. Rainfall over the weekend, that's -- there you go. It's areas of New England especially. There's a drought going on across New England. So you want to get that, but maybe not on Memorial Day weekend. We're also going to be watching those storms firing up. This is the time of year we start to see this dry line develop and storms firing up every afternoon, especially across parts of West Texas, West Oklahoma and Kansas. So we're going to see that continuing on throughout the weekend. But here at FOX Weather, I tell you what. We're watching really cool temperatures to start at the unofficial start of summer this Memorial Day weekend, not looking good, especially across parts of the Northeast -- Neil."
