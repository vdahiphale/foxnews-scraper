      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One thing we've learned about mass immigration over the past couple years is that all good people support it. Immigration is the ultimate moral litmus test. When a Caravan of poor migrants from the third-world shows up, uninvited on your doorstep, the decent among us step forward to welcome them in. That's commanded by the moral code of cable news and, more importantly, by the poem at the bottom of the Statue of Liberty.  Only bigots and haters slam the door. That's what  they've been telling us in the media now for years. CNN's Jim Acosta has made that point repeatedly.  Well, it has finally happened. The Caravan has arrived. But here's the funny part. It didn't arrive in our country. It arrived in Mexico, in the border city of Tijuana, just across the fence from San Diego. The people of Tijuana are Mexican citizens.  So, by definition, they are good people, much better than you are. They're more welcoming and compassionate, less selfish and less American. They must be thrilled by the new arrivals. As immigrants, their new Honduran neighbors will grow their economy and add rich new diversity to their culture. That's what low-skilled immigrants always do, again, a point that Jim Acosta frequently makes. So are the people of Tijuana grateful for this Caravan from Honduras? Fox's William La Jeunesse went there to find out firsthand. Here's what he discovered.",

He's the Mayor of Tijuana where people can still say what they think without fear of being denounced by Don Lemon on CNN as a White supremacist. So, they do say what they think. And in Tijuana, what they think is that a massive and abrupt demographic change is destabilizing to a society, no matter what the color of the people involved might be. It's particularly destabilizing if you're not rich, and most people in Tijuana are not rich.   Even in Mexico, they're wary of ignoring the law completely, and treating borders like they don't exist. They know that doesn't end well. Most people know that doesn't end well. The difference is in Mexico they can say that out loud. We could learn from that.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" One thing we've learned about mass immigration over the past couple years is that all good people support it. Immigration is the ultimate moral litmus test. When a Caravan of poor migrants from the third-world shows up, uninvited on your doorstep, the decent among us step forward to welcome them in. That's commanded by the moral code of cable news and, more importantly, by the poem at the bottom of the Statue of Liberty. Only bigots and haters slam the door. That's what  they've been telling us in the media now for years. CNN's Jim Acosta has made that point repeatedly. Well, it has finally happened. The Caravan has arrived. But here's the funny part. It didn't arrive in our country. It arrived in Mexico, in the border city of Tijuana, just across the fence from San Diego. The people of Tijuana are Mexican citizens. So, by definition, they are good people, much better than you are. They're more welcoming and compassionate, less selfish and less American. They must be thrilled by the new arrivals. As immigrants, their new Honduran neighbors will grow their economy and add rich new diversity to their culture. That's what low-skilled immigrants always do, again, a point that Jim Acosta frequently makes. So are the people of Tijuana grateful for this Caravan from Honduras? Fox's William La Jeunesse went there to find out firsthand. Here's what he discovered."

They're still talking about that line years later as evidence of Trump's White supremacy. And yet, here you have non-White people in Mexico saying pretty much exactly the same thing. How can that be? Let's check back with Tijuana to make sure we heard that right."

He'd definitely be in some kind of diversity re-education class by now. If he worked at Google, he'd be fired instantly. But he's not a student or a tech drone. He's the Mayor of Tijuana where people can still say what they think without fear of being denounced by Don Lemon on CNN as a White supremacist. So, they do say what they think. And in Tijuana, what they think is that a massive and abrupt demographic change is destabilizing to a society, no matter what the color of the people involved might be. It's particularly destabilizing if you're not rich, and most people in Tijuana are not rich. Even in Mexico, they're wary of ignoring the law completely, and treating borders like they don't exist. They know that doesn't end well. Most people know that doesn't end well. The difference is in Mexico they can say that out loud. We could learn from that.

We want our government to enforce our borders, which is what a lot of people, including me, say frequently in the United States. Maybe, has it occurred to you, maybe it's not just racism?

KATHLEEN MAURA RICE, UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE FOR NEW YORK'S 4TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEMOCRAT, FORMER PROSECUTOR: I think once we show that the leader can't get to 218, you're going to see other people throw their hat in the ring too."

They basically said we're going to put the sort of younger, vital, able, competent people in our leadership position at committee chairs and it -- Paul Ryan's a young guy.

This should not surprise us.
