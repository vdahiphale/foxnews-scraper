      "sentences": "It's so ironic since her ratings are in the crapper. So, as we turn a corner on COVID, what new crisis is the media consumed with? Shark attacks? Alien invasions, CNN's disastrous ratings which are now officially lower than the odds that Kat's marriage last a month? Yes. Oh, the New York Times dives headfirst into the evils of bathing. Yes, bathing. COVID they explain has shown that bathing daily is not only unnecessary, it's evil. Pigpen is finally vindicated. I'm old. No wonder the media adores Antifa, the filthy scum. Because it seems bathing harms the planet. So they could have said instead that bathing is racist because most bars of soap are white. It's called ivory, not Ebony and that is racist. We'll be right back. The article starts by offering anecdotal evidence that the pandemic is causing people to bathe less. There are proof parents complaining about their smelly teenage kids. Talk about hard hitting data. By that logic the pandemic also caused acne and terrible taste in music. By the way, teachers are -- teenagers are like cheese. They're supposed to smell. So I've been told. Thank you. Then they say the shabby British survey claiming 17 percent of Brits have stopped bathing. When looking at Boris Johnson's hair would tell you that. So Brits stop bathing and raises the question. How could you tell? Was that before or after they stopped brushing their teeth? Maybe they just want to be French. Anyway, like all lame stories meant to scold you for being normal, they relied on people in their own circle to interview. Like Heather, a writer, because who would a writer for The Times interview but another writer? God forbid they find a plumber or a stripper. Or a plumber who strips. That someone who appreciates a good shower. Heather claims her shower use has fallen off by 20 percent and her ability to find a date, 80 percent. I hope they fact check this by smelling her armpits. But that does explain the other article about a decline in birth rates. So the science is settled. Heather stinks. But then the times goes on to explain that daily showers are a new phenomenon growing out of the industrial age. Perhaps like penicillin, or indoor plumbing or missing fingers. They cite yet another writer. What's with the writers? Who's also an environmentalist. He baths once a week. His tub must have more rings than Saturn. This is all good since reducing the use of soap helps the environment as opposed to his underwear which are probably funkier than Rick James, currently. He explains how we would wash at the sink under our armpits and our privates. He's in his 60s which leaves me with quite a visual. Last night I had an -- I had a nightmare about Wolf Blitzer in front of a mirror using a toilet brush. The Times built an article around a writer interviewing other writers about how they've given up looking presentable. Do they plan to ever leave the house again? For our sake, let's hope they don't. That's one way to get us all wearing masks. Then they guilt us by telling us that a typical eight-minute shower uses up to 17 gallons of water. Is that supposed to be a lot? It takes 920 gallons of water to make one gallon of almond milk or to flush whatever Brian Stelter had for lunch. They also tried to shame us for using soap because it's made of petroleum. This is all coming from a newspaper which is made trees to produce each week Sunday paper alone. It's estimated that a half billion trees must be murdered. Slowly cut down, dismembered and turned into pulp by oil guzzling power tools. The Times has been doing that since 1851. If trees could talk, they'd call the Times Hitler. And they probably sound like John Kerry. But so once again, the superior minds at the Times tells us we're living selfishly. Don't bathe. They say, after screaming at us if we weren't constantly scrubbing up like we're doing surgery in a bus station restroom. But you just know not a single editor or writer ever complies with their own prescriptions. Just writing about it is their sacrifice. Do as I write, not as I do, they say. It's no wonder that while their editors claim not to take a bath, the paper actually is. It's elitist and without a width of irony. And that's why they're dirty drawers aren't the only thing that stinks.",

According to the FAA or FAA, the number of airline passengers ignoring COVID protocols is rising faster than Kat's husband's therapy bills. Incidents include customers not only refusing to wear masks, but shouting obscenities and even fighting crew members. So, when did airplanes become the bar from Roadhouse? As of February 1st, wearing a mask on commercial flights became federal law. The FAA has also considered finding the most unruly passengers anywhere from nine to $30,000. That's more than I make in a day, Pete. Meanwhile, the number of people flying commercially in the United States is still 40 percent lower than it was pre-pandemic. While I have no patience for people who throw tantrums, I get the frustration when people act like airborne idiots the airlines crack down on the rest of us. But FAA rules are arbitrary and constantly changing. Some airlines act like you're flying with a Luftwaffe. Travels stressful enough without flight attendants going code read because your toddler's fussy or you pull down your mask to pop in a peanut.

In every story, I might add, I insert dwarves into everything. Try it with every book or every story, just insert the dwarves. It makes everything better. Everything better. Yes, including the Godfather. Totally changed the ending. The problem? I don't know where I am, writes Katie down and Julie Tremaine, they took two writers is that, is that the kiss is without her consent. While she's asleep cannot possibly be true love if only one person knows it's happening, like they know. They continue, it's hard to understand why the Disneyland of 2021 would choose to add a scene with such old fashioned ideas of what a man is allowed to do to a woman. So, yes, it took two people to write that a double byline as we call it. Now, consent issues aside, it's still a very realistic story. You know, from the days when traveling royalty would kiss unconscious women and glass coffins while surrounded by a bunch of diamond mining dwarves.

      "utterance": "It's so ironic since her ratings are in the crapper. So, as we turn a corner on COVID, what new crisis is the media consumed with? Shark attacks? Alien invasions, CNN's disastrous ratings which are now officially lower than the odds that Kat's marriage last a month? Yes. Oh, the New York Times dives headfirst into the evils of bathing. Yes, bathing. COVID they explain has shown that bathing daily is not only unnecessary, it's evil. Pigpen is finally vindicated. I'm old. No wonder the media adores Antifa, the filthy scum. Because it seems bathing harms the planet. So they could have said instead that bathing is racist because most bars of soap are white. It's called ivory, not Ebony and that is racist. We'll be right back. The article starts by offering anecdotal evidence that the pandemic is causing people to bathe less. There are proof parents complaining about their smelly teenage kids. Talk about hard hitting data. By that logic the pandemic also caused acne and terrible taste in music. By the way, teachers are -- teenagers are like cheese. They're supposed to smell. So I've been told. Thank you. Then they say the shabby British survey claiming 17 percent of Brits have stopped bathing. When looking at Boris Johnson's hair would tell you that. So Brits stop bathing and raises the question. How could you tell? Was that before or after they stopped brushing their teeth? Maybe they just want to be French. Anyway, like all lame stories meant to scold you for being normal, they relied on people in their own circle to interview. Like Heather, a writer, because who would a writer for The Times interview but another writer? God forbid they find a plumber or a stripper. Or a plumber who strips. That someone who appreciates a good shower. Heather claims her shower use has fallen off by 20 percent and her ability to find a date, 80 percent. I hope they fact check this by smelling her armpits. But that does explain the other article about a decline in birth rates. So the science is settled. Heather stinks. But then the times goes on to explain that daily showers are a new phenomenon growing out of the industrial age. Perhaps like penicillin, or indoor plumbing or missing fingers. They cite yet another writer. What's with the writers? Who's also an environmentalist. He baths once a week. His tub must have more rings than Saturn. This is all good since reducing the use of soap helps the environment as opposed to his underwear which are probably funkier than Rick James, currently. He explains how we would wash at the sink under our armpits and our privates. He's in his 60s which leaves me with quite a visual. Last night I had an -- I had a nightmare about Wolf Blitzer in front of a mirror using a toilet brush. The Times built an article around a writer interviewing other writers about how they've given up looking presentable. Do they plan to ever leave the house again? For our sake, let's hope they don't. That's one way to get us all wearing masks. Then they guilt us by telling us that a typical eight-minute shower uses up to 17 gallons of water. Is that supposed to be a lot? It takes 920 gallons of water to make one gallon of almond milk or to flush whatever Brian Stelter had for lunch. They also tried to shame us for using soap because it's made of petroleum. This is all coming from a newspaper which is made trees to produce each week Sunday paper alone. It's estimated that a half billion trees must be murdered. Slowly cut down, dismembered and turned into pulp by oil guzzling power tools. The Times has been doing that since 1851. If trees could talk, they'd call the Times Hitler. And they probably sound like John Kerry. But so once again, the superior minds at the Times tells us we're living selfishly. Don't bathe. They say, after screaming at us if we weren't constantly scrubbing up like we're doing surgery in a bus station restroom. But you just know not a single editor or writer ever complies with their own prescriptions. Just writing about it is their sacrifice. Do as I write, not as I do, they say. It's no wonder that while their editors claim not to take a bath, the paper actually is. It's elitist and without a width of irony. And that's why they're dirty drawers aren't the only thing that stinks."

Incidents include customers not only refusing to wear masks, but shouting obscenities and even fighting crew members. So, when did airplanes become the bar from Roadhouse? As of February 1st, wearing a mask on commercial flights became federal law. The FAA has also considered finding the most unruly passengers anywhere from nine to $30,000. That's more than I make in a day, Pete. Meanwhile, the number of people flying commercially in the United States is still 40 percent lower than it was pre-pandemic. While I have no patience for people who throw tantrums, I get the frustration when people act like airborne idiots the airlines crack down on the rest of us. But FAA rules are arbitrary and constantly changing. Some airlines act like you're flying with a Luftwaffe. Travels stressful enough without flight attendants going code read because your toddler's fussy or you pull down your mask to pop in a peanut.

You know the story, Snow White is poisoned by the evil queen, falls asleep and true love's first kiss breaks the spell. Then, she's eaten by dwarves. That's in my version. The dwarves always prevail. In every story, I might add, I insert dwarves into everything. Try it with every book or every story, just insert the dwarves. It makes everything better. Everything better. Yes, including the Godfather. Totally changed the ending. The problem? I don't know where I am, writes Katie down and Julie Tremaine, they took two writers is that, is that the kiss is without her consent. While she's asleep cannot possibly be true love if only one person knows it's happening, like they know. They continue, it's hard to understand why the Disneyland of 2021 would choose to add a scene with such old fashioned ideas of what a man is allowed to do to a woman. So, yes, it took two people to write that a double byline as we call it. Now, consent issues aside, it's still a very realistic story. You know, from the days when traveling royalty would kiss unconscious women and glass coffins while surrounded by a bunch of diamond mining dwarves. That should be taken as literally as a talking mouse, or your rich dunk duck uncle who doesn't wear pants? I never liked that duck. Kind of perverted, Kat. I know that you're hot on the story. Yes.

If I would have watched this growing up, I would have thought there'd be no hope for a slob like me to find a husband at the ripe young age of 32 and a half. But I mean, I look I would watch these movies growing up and I, before, and I would say to my mom, like when the Prince and the fat you know, the princess and they find each other. I'd be like, what does she want to do? And I wasn't a gender studies professor, I was a four-year-old. So, I was able to look at this and be like, Huh, this doesn't seem like real life, let's say and then we'd have those conversations. So these stereotypes they come from somewhere. I think it's better to talk about them with kids watch the movies. And if I'm four and I can realize it's not real, then probably other four-year-olds can do the same."

Studies show that participating in sports gives girls' confidence and makes them feel better about themselves. Right now, half of all girls quit sports by the age of 17, according to an Australian study. So, your idea here would be to essentially eliminate girl sports and a pathway to self-esteem. And I know that your experience with women is limited to those with severe self-esteem issues. But just think about this, you are now on the side of the non-binary gender fluid people.

A teenager in Florida where most teens are located, who helped her mother rig an election so she would win homecoming queen is going to be charged as an adult even though she was just 17 at the time. Just 17 or in other words totally dateable by Leo DiCaprio. Prosecutors say that Emily Rose Grover's mother, Laura, used her position as an assistant principal, talk about power, to access the school's internal system and cast fraudulent votes for her daughter last year. And that students have reported that Emily helped her mother do it. And if there's ever been a crime you'd blame on an Emily, this is it. The parent now face multiple felony charges and a maximum of 16 years in prison. 16 years is a long time. To put that into perspective. If Kat went away for 16 years, she'd be 60 when she gets out. Were they too lenient? Pete? How do you set an example if you don't throw the book at her?"

It doesn't matter if it's for only for years. This mom said absolutely not, I will not have you spend three months having people think you're not the most popular girl in school. We will risk prison for this. I think that almost the prison is probably like just the tip of the iceberg in terms of issues that Emily's probably facing with her having her mother like that."
