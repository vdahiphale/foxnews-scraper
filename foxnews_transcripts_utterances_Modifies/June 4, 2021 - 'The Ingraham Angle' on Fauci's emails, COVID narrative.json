He's going to respond to the revelations that Fauci and his forces inside the State Department quashed a lab leak investigation. Plus, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis responds to Fauci lashing out at him in one of those uncovered emails.  Also, one father's TikTok video denouncing critical race theory and BLM.  This thing went viral. Tonight, Kory Yeshua tells us why he made those videos. But first, COVID collusion. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\".  You know the old saying, \"When you find yourself in a hole, got to stop digging.\" Well, today Dr. Anthony Fauci refused to put down his shovel. He made a few appearances on friendly morning shows, including MSNBC, where he was asked why it's been so hard to determine the origins of the virus?",

So instead of questioning why a deadly virus broke out in a city that has China's only level four virology lab, the WHO unquestioningly parroted the CCP's talking points and denied the rest of the world precious time to prepare. They even praised China's commitment and transparency. All the CCCP disposed of evidence and witnesses.

The WIV is a subrecipient on the grant.\"  Again, U.S. taxpayer dollars going to the Wuhan Lab, one of the few in the world where this gain-of-function research, extremely controversial and risky, was taking place, while it looks like there was a moratorium still in place.

And now all this time later, the media are scrambling to try to restore their credibility madly, suddenly reporting on what they failed to report on when Donald Trump was still in office. Their justification for their dereliction of duty is pathetic.  Now \"Vanity Fair\" was worried that only crackpots or political hacks wanting to hurt China believed the lab leak theory and they cited what they claimed is Trump's toxic racism, spurring anti-Asian violence as their reason to delay their own reporting on this. It's so disingenuous, crackpots?  Well, as \"Vanity Fair\" itself noted, a liberal and highly respected scientist named Richard Ebright said it took him a nanosecond to consider a link to Wuhan. So I guess that was another conspiracy, crackpot guy.  Now, with Donald Trump safely out of office, \"Vanity Fair\" felt liberated to provide key details that raise serious questions about Fauci, Francis Collins, and the whole NIH gang. \"In the first year of the Trump administration, the gain of function moratorium was lifted and replaced with a review system. Their framework was largely met with shrugs and eye rolls, said a long-time agency official. If you ban gain of function research, you ban all of virology. Ever since the moratorium, everyone's gone wink-wink, and just done gain of function research anyway.\" What? This is so huge. Now, I will say it again and again, the fact that so many have been unwilling to tell the whole truth on this matter, the fact that so many have been willing to protect China's role, and the fact that they all suppressed dissent here in the United States, it screams of the real need for a full accounting here.  Democrats made up the entire Russian collusion charge to hurt Trump. But the facts we've laid out now for more than a year, they weren't made up. So if COVID collusion isn't real, well, Tony and Francis better start talking. And that's the \"Angle\".

But I know he was very involved with a lot of Governors, every step of the way. I mean, certainly, unlike New York, and some of those states that had the nursing home policy.  He was intimately involved in things like that. He was a big believer in the hospital models that was funded by Bill Gates. Those models were grievously wrong. But I know he was a believer in that. He was also a believer in the Imperial College model that Neil Ferguson had done, which was disastrously wrong, but caused a lot of panic, both in the United Kingdom and the United States.",

This thing went viral. Tonight, Kory Yeshua tells us why he made those videos. But first, COVID collusion. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". You know the old saying, \"When you find yourself in a hole, got to stop digging.\" Well, today Dr. Anthony Fauci refused to put down his shovel.

He knows and we know that back in January of 2020, China used the WHO as kind of a block and tackle to force any real inquiry from going forward. So instead of questioning why a deadly virus broke out in a city that has China's only level four virology lab, the WHO unquestioningly parroted the CCP's talking points and denied the rest of the world precious time to prepare. They even praised China's commitment and transparency. All the CCCP disposed of evidence and witnesses. To be sure, Anthony Fauci wasn't demanding answers from the CCP either, he was busy covering for them then and he is doing the same now."

Since 2014, an NIH grant has funded EcoHealth's research in China, which involves collecting faeces and other samples from bats, and blood samples from people at risk of infection from bat-origin viruses. The WIV is a subrecipient on the grant.\" Again, U.S. taxpayer dollars going to the Wuhan Lab, one of the few in the world where this gain-of-function research, extremely controversial and risky, was taking place, while it looks like there was a moratorium still in place. The fact that U.S. tax dollars were floating around there is a scandal in and of itself, especially now that we know Fauci scrambled in those early days of the pandemic to downplay NIH's and China's culpability.

I expected it from politicians. I didn't expect it from science.\" Well, we did.

And now all this time later, the media are scrambling to try to restore their credibility madly, suddenly reporting on what they failed to report on when Donald Trump was still in office. Their justification for their dereliction of duty is pathetic. Now \"Vanity Fair\" was worried that only crackpots or political hacks wanting to hurt China believed the lab leak theory and they cited what they claimed is Trump's toxic racism, spurring anti-Asian violence as their reason to delay their own reporting on this. It's so disingenuous, crackpots? Well, as \"Vanity Fair\" itself noted, a liberal and highly respected scientist named Richard Ebright said it took him a nanosecond to consider a link to Wuhan. So I guess that was another conspiracy, crackpot guy. Now, with Donald Trump safely out of office, \"Vanity Fair\" felt liberated to provide key details that raise serious questions about Fauci, Francis Collins, and the whole NIH gang. \"In the first year of the Trump administration, the gain of function moratorium was lifted and replaced with a review system. Their framework was largely met with shrugs and eye rolls, said a long-time agency official. If you ban gain of function research, you ban all of virology. Ever since the moratorium, everyone's gone wink-wink, and just done gain of function research anyway.\" What? This is so huge. Now, I will say it again and again, the fact that so many have been unwilling to tell the whole truth on this matter, the fact that so many have been willing to protect China's role, and the fact that they all suppressed dissent here in the United States, it screams of the real need for a full accounting here. Democrats made up the entire Russian collusion charge to hurt Trump. But the facts we've laid out now for more than a year, they weren't made up. So if COVID collusion isn't real, well, Tony and Francis better start talking. And that's the \"Angle\". Joining me now is Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State and distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute. Secretary Pompeo, thank you for joining us. What we've learned over the past few weeks--"

That has no great surprise to hear Fauci this morning talk about how the Chinese have an interest in us discovering what happened is just crazy talk. The Chinese have a deep interest in covering it up and they've done so pretty darn effectively. In fact, it was the State Department that ultimately - we had big fights inside the organization. But it was us ultimately, who put out documents in January 15 that demonstrated some of the central facts we now know that lead to the overwhelming amount of efforts to demonstrate that this probably did come from this virology lab. It was good work by the State Department team. We overcame lots of internal bureaucracy to get there.

But then the Office of the Director of Intel later that month, released this statement saying, \"The Intel community also concurs with a wide scientific consensus that COVID-19 was not manmade or genetically modified.\" Mr. Secretary, why was the DNA downplaying what you are trying to uncover at the time?"

He's a professor at the Naval Academy that was working for me at the State Department. He speaks Mandarin. He was able to read lots of things others couldn't get their hands on, and it was pretty clear. It was April when I received that if I remember right, it was in early May. Just a few days after that I was on TV talking about what I could get declassified at that point. We worked diligently to get the Intelligence Community classified more. Director Ratcliffe was a great partner in trying to do that, but there were folks all over the community who just didn't want to talk about this. We wanted to stay focused on other things. They didn't want the world to know that the Chinese Communist Party was in the process of (inaudible) which turns out there have been several million losses of life. You know, I'll leave that to others to speculate. But when you heard Dr. Fauci this morning, Laura, those are the exact same words, the exact same excuses, the exact same theories that the Chinese Communist Party has presenting for over a year now. We can all draw our own conclusions. I know this. We had a group inside the State Department, Miles Yu, a handful of others working diligently to get this information out to the American people, so the world could see what the Chinese Communist Party had done to all of us."

For Dr. Fauci, go and think for a moment that the Chinese Communist Party cared that there were people in Wuhan that were dying, whether it was Chinese people or Americans, whoever else might be there, it's just naive beyond all possible imagination. The Chinese Communist Party doesn't care for a moment. They have no desire for the world to know what happened. They could clear this all up in a minute if they wanted to. They've chosen not to, I think that's another link in the chain that demonstrates that when we get to the end of this, we will have demonstrated that the Chinese knew what had happened and their virology lab was at the center of it."

We talk about gain of function research, the fact that this lab was level four and had security leaks before, that there were doctors who became ill and were hospitalized there in the fall of 2019. We have an awful lot of evidence pointing to what happened. What was the Chinese Communist Party's intention? We know there was military activity taking place in the same laboratory. We don't know exactly what they were doing. But we know this. We know that they don't want you to know.

In a March 2020 email, Fauci wrote, \"Regarding the bars and beaches, I've been screaming on TV 2 to 5 times per night to tell the younger generation to start taking this seriously. I'm very surprised that Governor DeSantis has not completely closed the bars, even if they serve food, takeout only. I will bring this up at the taskforce meeting tomorrow.\" Here with me now is Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

For example, he said New York has the best response to COVID. Obviously, in terms of the numbers, I don't see how you could possibly say that both for COVID and all the destruction that's happened. And so in Florida, we chose freedom over Fauci-ism, and we're much better off for doing that. I think his lockdown policies were not justified by the scientific data. He was somebody that fearmongered about schools, he did not support Florida when we had our kids in school in person. I think he was wrong about mass and asymptomatic spread. And then obviously he does so many interviews that it was pretty clear to me after a pretty short time, this was all about himself and his own image. And for me, you look at that magazine cover with him lounging by the pool with the sunglasses on right in the midst of the pandemic. I mean, it was almost like a let-them-eat-cake moment for all the people who were chafing under his lockdowns, and yet he seemed to be having the time of his life."

We listened to him, work with them. As we got into March, we were working with the task force. But I think it was pretty clear as the data started coming in April, in particular. I departed from what the task force was recommending and made sure that we were open, we work to get our schools open, all those other things. So then I think we had less interaction. But I know he was very involved with a lot of Governors, every step of the way. I mean, certainly, unlike New York, and some of those states that had the nursing home policy. He was intimately involved in things like that. He was a big believer in the hospital models that was funded by Bill Gates. Those models were grievously wrong. But I know he was a believer in that. He was also a believer in the Imperial College model that Neil Ferguson had done, which was disastrously wrong, but caused a lot of panic, both in the United Kingdom and the United States."

But particularly, when you have somebody that's going out and literally doing every interview under the sun, he ended up contradicting himself. He was indulging hypotheticals. He ended up having to do political commentary sometimes, because the media obviously wanted to use Fauci to attack people like me and other Republicans. And so, I think people are going to look back on this period, and say, if there's anything something like this, someone in Fauci's role, that's what you don't do time and time again. And so, I think he was way overexposed. And I think what he wants to do in these health situations, have one or two clear messages and just keep repeating that, but you don't got to indulge every left wing reporter in the United States every day."

      "utterance": "Governor, thank you. And the Fauci emails are not only troubling for what they reveal, but also for what they conceal. The 3200 page document is riddled with redactions, each citing legal exemptions, but what do they mean, and what might they be hiding? Joining me now is Phil Kerpen, President of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. Phil, I want to start with an email between Fauci and Peter Daszak, who funneled NIH funds to Wuhan and is a big advocate of this gain of function research. Now, a huge chunk of it is redacted citing exemption D7A. What does that refer to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHIL KERPEN, PRESIDENT OF THE COMMITTEE TO UNLEASH PROSPERITY",
      "utterance": "Well, Laura, it refers to a criminal investigation. And this is a very unusual exemption from an agency like the NIH. Usually this exemption shows up when you FOIA the FBI or ATF or some other enforcement agency, and they use it for information that could compromise a current ongoing investigation. So for this to show up in an NIH document production is extremely unusual."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So a criminal infestation into the ongoing gain of function research during a moratorium, or an individual who was doing that, or we just simply don't know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KERPEN",
      "utterance": "We really don't know. But it's interesting because this is not Fauci writing. This is Daszak writing. And so presumably, it's information that he had that is now relevant to some ongoing criminal investigation. I don't know who is under investigation or for what, but this is unusual and does indicate the existence of some investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "All this has to be unredacted. There's one concerning email between Fauci and Zuckerberg. Much of it is redacted citing B-4 exemption. Phil, what does that refer to, and why might they invoke to? It's after Zuckerberg says we'd like you do to a colloquy, a live Facebook interview, and talks about how they're going to have a coronavirus database. But then at the end of the interview, it says finally, comma, then the whole paragraph is x-ed out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KERPEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, and then in Fauci's response we have him saying it's very exciting and he's most excited about this -- redacted. And so we don't know what he's most excited about. That B-4 exemption refers to trade secrets. So commercially protected intellectual property, that kind of thing. It's very hard to figure out what trade secrets could have possibly been implicated in an offer like this. My conjecture is it was something along the lines of we'll give you the ability to decide what subject to fact checking or suppression our platform, something like that, that they would have found that embarrassing to disclose. I don't think that's a trade secret, so I think it would not be a legitimate reduction. But it's hard to see what they could have hiding behind there that really would qualify as a trade secret. So I hope we'll see an appeal of this, but I don't know what \"Buzzfeed\" is thinking in that regard."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

I guess that, but again, none of this stuff should be redacted, not with 550,000 people plus dead in the United States. Phil, we are still digging on this. Thank you so much. And it's time to call what the Biden demonstration is allowing at our border one thing -- criminal. Dan Patrick explains why. Plus, is the Biden administration looking to that squeeze the suburbs out of existence? It seems far-fetched, maybe, but it's happening already. We're going to explain, next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The border situation is now so catastrophic that even NBC News is forced to admit that Biden bears some of the blame, reporting \"In reality, the border is not close,\" duh. \"Under Biden, the determination of who stays and who goes has become a lottery with winners and losers. The merits of an asylum claim often beside the point.\" So who is trying to win that lottery? The other week, 10 convicted sex offenders including child rapists were arrested trying to cross into the Del Rio sector. We were there a few years ago. In fact, there's been more than 3,000 percent increase of sex offenders arrested in that sector. Those are just the ones caught, of course. Joining me now, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Dan, I've said this, and I'm going to say it again. I actually believe there are not only criminal issues with how this is being handled, but I think this at some point, when does this become an impeachable offense, to just allow the United States to be completely overrun, willfully overrun?"

      "speaker": "DAN PATRICK, (R) TEXAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR",

In one week in May, just one week, Laura, we apprehended 28,000 people just in Texas. Remember, we are about two-thirds of the border. That is just in Texas. And of those, people from all over the world, 100, almost 150 came from Romania. How did they get here? And this nonsense of, we are just letting unaccompanied children in, it is setting a record more than we've ever had in one week, close to 20,000 in one week, unaccompanied minors. But this idea that adult males, 21 and over, are coming across, that they are being turned, it is a lie. It is absolutely a lie. So it's not just an invasion of people that are going to impact our emergency rooms and our hospitals and our schools and our economy across the border. It's not just the fact that this is inhumane to many women and young girls that come here, put them into sex trafficking, or men who are enslaved and have to send part of their wages back to the cartels, new slavery. The real threat to America is the threat of thugs joining gangs. MS-13, this is just like the free agent draft in the NFL. They are just loading up their gangs and increasing their numbers."

His big infrastructure plan includes incentives for local governments to get rid of so-called exclusionary zoning laws that supposedly harm minorities. The goal is to coax localities into allowing high rise apartment buildings in neighborhoods that are zoned for single family houses. Joining me now is Congresswoman and former mayor Beth Van Duyne. Congresswoman, how will a plan like this destroy suburbs in this country?"

They want to be able to go into a neighborhood where their kids can play in their own yard and be able to go to the schools that they want to go to. They can have ownership and have that -- for their future. And what you're seeing is the Biden administration is coming in and they are saying, we are going to take that away from local municipalities.

There are zero low-income based apartments, and zero rent subsidized apartments. Are we supposed to believe that he's going to blow up his ritzy suburb by getting rid of all of those zoning laws?"

I ran against an incumbent who had got a lot of support from developers and from others. And I got elected because what I heard overwhelmingly from constituents is they did not want these monstrous apartment complexes. They wanted to be able to have neighborhoods. And by the way, once you build a neighborhood, we were selling them like hot cakes. There's not enough homes to be able to buy.

And so the white kids have to separate into one group, and then the black kids, or the people of color separate into another group. And they have to do different workshops.
