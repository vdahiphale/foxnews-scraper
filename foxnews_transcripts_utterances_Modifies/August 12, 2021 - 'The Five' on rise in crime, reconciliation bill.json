And when I say Joe Biden is kind of gasping and grasping, he spent all of last year blaming Trump for the highest death rates in the country here in New York and in New Jersey. And now it was -- he said he is going to come in and fix everything while he couldn't get his target on the vaccinations. So, he's kind of in no man's land, and notice he doesn't go after the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, because he is a Democrat. He has a mask mandate in the state, but the country is one of the lowest vaccination rates and one of the highest death rates in the nation. And Governor John Bel Edwards now is invoking the power of prayer and he is fasting trying to help cure his state. And wouldn't that be the target of the left? If somebody -- if some Republican governor said I'm fasting and praying for you all?",

And it is amazing that Joe Biden is actually postulating whether he has legal authority to mandate or override governors? I have retained a special lawyer Andy McCarthy, and I asked him legally does he have the ability to do this. And he writes, no. And I memorize that. He does not have the right to do this, why are we battling on this, since when do parents need permission to be parents? Parents went to pick up, went to put the kids in corduroys even though all the other kids are wearing jeans. Should they be fine for that? Parents are in charge, that's the way it should be. And give Broward County a little bit of credit, because they said, OK, let's try to broker this, let's have a hope scholarship.

Out of the gate it's another debate about another mandate, so how will it rate? Who will meet their fate? And who will take the bait, who will advocate, who will acclimate, who will constipate. President Biden signaling a federal crackdown could be coming for states that don't follow his COVID rules. That threat is the latest example in a major fight over mandate that is splitting the country apart, Dana. Biden and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have been going after each other for days over mandates like wearing masks in schools. DeSantis says it should be up to the parents to decide, but now the president is looking into ways to overrule states like Florida."

And when I say Joe Biden is kind of gasping and grasping, he spent all of last year blaming Trump for the highest death rates in the country here in New York and in New Jersey. And now it was -- he said he is going to come in and fix everything while he couldn't get his target on the vaccinations. So, he's kind of in no man's land, and notice he doesn't go after the governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, because he is a Democrat. He has a mask mandate in the state, but the country is one of the lowest vaccination rates and one of the highest death rates in the nation. And Governor John Bel Edwards now is invoking the power of prayer and he is fasting trying to help cure his state. And wouldn't that be the target of the left?

We are going to be on THE FIVE (Inaudible) to fill in when you turn an ankle or you run a fever at some point, and we are going to be having the same debate for years to come because there is going to be variant after variant. And how we handle it is going to be a little bit more mature. Are we going to have a national bedtime next? Where at nine o'clock Joe Biden proclaims by the power vested in him, same with the holy theme that we all have to go to bed at the same time? And it is amazing that Joe Biden is actually postulating whether he has legal authority to mandate or override governors? I have retained a special lawyer Andy McCarthy, and I asked him legally does he have the ability to do this. And he writes, no. And I memorize that. He does not have the right to do this, why are we battling on this, since when do parents need permission to be parents? Parents went to pick up, went to put the kids in corduroys even though all the other kids are wearing jeans. Should they be fine for that? Parents are in charge, that's the way it should be. And give Broward County a little bit of credit, because they said, OK, let's try to broker this, let's have a hope scholarship. Let's say kids who don't want to do a mask mandate will be able to go to a private school for where they can do masks at liberty for free. So at least they are trying to --"

This is part of that unstoppable march towards a reform that because we like the sound of the word reform, and all of the practices that smell of the past that stink of old white men are inherently evil. So, we get rid of, you know, cash bail, we get rid of -- we think prison is bad now. We let felons out of jail in California everywhere. No one is being arrested for grand larceny. So not only through the baby out with the bathwater, we threw the parents in the bathtub in the quest for reform. So, to use an analogy, you know, a semi-truck pulls into a dead-end alley it can't turn around, it can only go in reverse. There's no way forward for this country. We have to go backwards. We have to go in reverse and undo every one of these idiotic decisions ushered in under the lie of positive reform.

If somebody killed a police officer, absolutely they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. I think in Chicago as in much of the country the pandemic has led to an increase in both the violent crime and nonviolent crimes, and for some reasons we understand and some we don't. I think that that's a separate issue from one of the controversies in the city of Chicago is that the mayor has established kind of a civilian control of the police force that they can investigate, and that was because of some pretty public abuses on the part of the police department. I don't think there is anything wrong with the basic proposition which is let's go after criminals and let's not have police officers abusing their power, and I think we can do both of those things if we are getting to a situation where D.A.s are going to preannounce we will not prosecute you. We won't throw you in jail for committing a crime, I do think you are going to get more crime and so they better think that throughout."

And also, there is just a total disrespect for the rule of law, total disregard for it. If you look at what happened in the situation, they had expired tags. Expired tags are red flag for police officers that's why they got pulled over. And before they could even figure out what was going on in terms of in the car, that's when they shot them.

You have a parent instead of saying, my goodness, my 21-year- old and my 22-year-old are probably going to be in jail for life and they are involved in the murder of a cop. And may be a second who got shot in the head who stole a phone and got so upset that he was drinking and driving, and when he was told to put down the drink, he wouldn't do it. Instead of the mom showing up and say how can my kids do that? She comes up vilifying the police. It seems like on the surface this 21 and 22-year-old never had a shot. So, you have, how do we stop crime today, and then how do we stop another generation of killers and give them options before they become teens, before they realize that there is more to life than the life that they are seeing around them? Somehow, we got to get into the inner cities into the underprivilege communities and provide some of the guidance that the parents are not able to or are not just doing."

I would love to see it bring it to larger areas because I think there's a lot of people that want to solve this problem rather than vilifying today, they like to solve it within five years. Give us a five-year program to get in and spread the opportunity to people, not the money, not the free lunches, but the opportunity and hope. Some of them are born and they have no hope."

But I grew up in the Cold War, and Nike, and Apple, and the NBA, they were blowing tongue kisses to this - - to Moscow while we were awaiting our annihilation, while we were hiding under desks and doing nuclear -- you know, nuclear bomb testing. Our corporations weren't playing games with them. So, it's starting to look like China is responsible for all our kids. I don't have any masking up. Our relatives dying and our friends' businesses being ruined. You can point to China for that. But we don't want that to interfere with our cheap products and our -- and our profits. So, the reality is until we accept paying higher prices for labor material, we're going to be in bed with the nation responsible for the worst biological disaster in history.
