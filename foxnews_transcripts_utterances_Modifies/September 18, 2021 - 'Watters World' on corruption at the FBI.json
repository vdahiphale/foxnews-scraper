Edgar Hoover cut deals with the Kennedy's, the mob. They spied on politicians, tried to throw elections, we know that. But this week, we heard something even more disgraceful. U.S. gymnasts testifying in front of the Senate blasting the Bureau for covering up the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal. Remember, Nasser was the U.S.A. gymnastics doctor who sexually abused hundreds of gymnast -- hundreds. This week, these ladies rip the F.B.I. for ignoring their reports for months, even years, then lying and covering it up.",

The billionaire pedophile cut a sweetheart deal with the Feds then raped more teens under everybody's nose. This happened under Robert Mueller's watch, Jim Comey's watch. The F.B.I. seized surveillance footage from all of Epstein -- all of his homes. Where did all that go? Nobody knows. It's buried. After the deadly '96 Summer Olympics bombing in Atlanta, the F.B.I. tried to pin the crime on the wrong guy. Remember Richard Jewell? Investigators created a sketch of a man they thought planted the pipe bomb, but the F.B.I. refused to release it. Instead, an innocent man's life was ruined. The Feds painted him as a lone wolf, without any evidence.",

The father of the guy behind the Pulse Nightclub shooting that killed 49 people, he actually worked for the F.B.I. Siddique Mateen was the father of Omar Mateen that That terrorist who murdered dozens of people in 2016 at that Orlando nightclub. It turns out the dad was working with the F.B.I. as a confidential informant for over a decade leading right up to the massacre. The dad sent money transfers to Afghanistan and Turkey before the shooting, while at the same time working for the bureau. Multiple complaints were made against the son for being a terrorist sympathizer. He was connected to al-Qaeda, but the F.B.I. did nothing. The F.B.I. has had rotten people in their network for years. One of their own informants was living with two of the 9/11 hijackers, yet the two guys still managed to hit us on that terrible day. It gets worse. Remember the Parkland School shooting in Florida? Tips came in six weeks before the massacre alerting the FBI that Nikolas Cruz was an armed and dangerous likely school shooter ready to blow. The F.B.I. never even followed up on the tip, and over a dozen innocent children died. The F.B.I. basically dropped their investigation into the Las Vegas massacre after over a year of wasted time. Steven Paddock who shot and killed 60 people at a festival in Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, and the F.B.I. came up empty and we never hear about it. Something isn't right there. The F.B.I. was also heavily involved in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Whitmer. According to BuzzFeed, F.B.I. informants played a huge role in engineering that plan, and then the lead F.B.I. agent on the case, he was just popped for beating his wife after a swinger's party. And what really happened with Hunter Biden's laptop? The F.B.I. has had it for almost two years, sat on it, nothing. WATTERS' WORLD doesn't want to hear any more apologies, no more suspensions without pay. We need to audit the F.B.I. and clean house. You can't trust them. It has failed us, failed innocent women and children, costs lives and livelihoods and nobody pays a price. It's the most incompetent and corrupt part of the entire government, and that says a lot. And yet another story involving F.B.I. corruption, special prosecutor John Durham charged crooked Hillary's lawyer with lying to the F.B.I. The indictment is a window into how the Russia hoax got started. Basically, it started with Hillary. Hillary's paid political operative, a lawyer named Michael Sussman provided the F.B.I. with bogus material falsely tying Trump to Russia. Hillary's paid political operative, this lawyer, Michael Sussman, provided the F.B.I. with this BS basically, and then lied to the F.B.I. and said he wasn't a paid political op. He hid that he was doing this for Hillary, leading the F.B.I. to believe, you know, this guy was just a concerned citizen, not motivated by politics. And remember, when the D.N.C. server was hacked? Sussman is the same lawyer who handled that hack. He refused to turn the hacked server over to the F.B.I. for analysis, and then pinned the blame on Trump-Russia. Notice a trend? It gets deeper. Sussman is a lawyer at the firm Perkins Coie or he was anyway, he just resigned. Perkins Coie is the same firm that Hillary used to pay for the fake dossier. The dossier was given to the F.B.I., remember, who used it to get a warrant to spy on Trump? So back to Durham's indictment. All summer and fall of 2016, Sussman, his firm, his tech contact, the Clinton campaign leaked this bogus collusion material to the media ginning up the Trump Russia collusion hoax, claiming the Trump Organization had a secret server back channeling the Putin's favorite Russian bank.",

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "sentences": "Meanwhile, Hillary was the one with the secret server. This hoax was just a distraction from her own crime. This whole time, Sussman's firm was billing the Clinton campaign for all this dirty work. So the indictment describes efforts to find or create a quote \"narrative\" tying Trump to Russia. But the cyber guys working with crooked's lawyer knew the material didn't tie Trump to Russia. They admitted over e-mail, it was a red herring. It was spoofed, they said. But instead, the operatives spruced up the docs and the lawyer fed the fake material to the F.B.I. anyway. The F.B.I. opened one of several investigations into Trump because of this crap, wasted the F.B.I.'s valuable time, money and manpower and triggered a swirl of suspicion and investigative controversy surrounding Trump unfairly, which ultimately led to the Mueller investigation, which as we know found no collusion. And the F.B.I. knew early on the material they were being fed didn't add up, but they doctored evidence and kept using dirty informants to spy on the Trump campaign and undermine his presidency. That was the insurance policy in action. So the bottom line, Clinton's lawyer lied to the F.B.I. to cover up the fact that Clinton was the one cooking up the fake Trump-Russia collusion story. The C.I.A. knew it. Obama and Biden were briefed on it, but they all went along with the hoax. So what's next? Let's go to host of \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" The Great One, as they call him, Mark Levin. All right, Mark, your analysis of the Durham indictment. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN: My analysis of the Durham indictment is that Hillary Clinton is Mr. Big in the middle of all of this. And so my question would be for Mr. Durham, have you dragged Hillary Clinton in front of your grand jury yet or not? Because enough is enough. This Clinton campaign, through this law firm, was so thoroughly corrupt using its money to create false evidence against Donald Trump connecting him to Russia and then she would go out there and talk about how Donald Trump is bought and paid for by Russia. She had Pelosi do it. The Democrats are all tap dancing and pushing the same issue, their friends in the media. So, really what this has come down to? You hammered it well on the F.B.I. But Hillary Clinton has always been corrupt. She has always been a liar and she is still corrupt, and she is still a liar and she has never been held to account. She needs to be brought in front of the grand jury. That's number one. Number two, the media is corrupt and filled with liars. Virtually everybody today in Big Media pushed this story, and yet they continue to have their jobs. They should all be losing their jobs. And finally, this law firm. This law firm is detestable. It not only had Sussman as a partner who has now been scrubbed from the website, but has this guy Mark Elias, who was involved in the dossier, and now is involved in a massive dark money network, as FOX has reported with a bunch of front groups that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars to try to affect the next election the way he and they affected the prior election in 2020. And you know what, Jesse? We're not allowed to talk about it. We're told no, you're election deniers. We even have people like Chris Christie running around and talking about it. So here we have more than enough evidence to show what Hillary Clinton, the D.N.C., this law firm, and their favorite lawyer did with hundreds of millions of dollars, lied about Trump, lied about corruption, lied about Russia. For three years, this country was dragged to the toilet, and now we're not allowed to talk about it. And yet, there's an enormous evidence they're up to no good again, with these front groups' dark money, meaning no transparent money, billionaires pouring tens of millions of dollars into the effort in the next election. If we had an honest media, this wouldn't be going on. So, they are corrupt as the F.B.I. and Hillary Clinton. Period.",

We're going to investigate the dark money deal on the next WATTERS' WORLD. Again, Mark Levin still on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. Thank you, Mark. The Biden administration is still standing by Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, even after new reports says he contacted the Chinese military behind Donald Trump's back, back in January 2020. A new book being released called \"Peril,\" Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of \"The Washington Post\" wrote it claimed Milley promised his Chinese counterpart, a heads up if there was going to be an attack, quote, \"General Li, you and I have known each other now for five years. If we're going to attack, I'm going to call you ahead of time. It's not going to be a surprise.\" The book also claims Milley colluded with Nancy Pelosi to kneecap Donald Trump's authority to take military action. Now, Milley says everything is fine. I'm not going to resign, despite growing calls from Republicans. Joining me now to discuss his Lieutenant Colonel Ollie north and co-author of \"We Didn't Fight for Socialism.\" So, is this treason?",

But the phone call to the Communist Chinese counterpart is very, very problematic, if indeed, those words were actually said. The 30 October call and the one on the eighth right after the election, reassuring that the U.S. military is not going to attack or conduct any kinetic operations against you. That is very problematic. I look at those kinds of things and say, \"What was he thinking?\" And the good news for him is he's going to have a chance to talk about all of this. What was he talking about with the Speaker of the House? The whole idea of gathering the staff -- the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- which do not have an operational role. The important thing to note is, he doesn't have an operational role. None of the chairmen do -- none of the members of the Joint Staff do. They are in an advisory capacity only. And so he ought to be asked to release the transcripts. If not just redact, you know, one or two words somewhere. But those Joint Chiefs of Staff, if they did pledge allegiance to him instead of to the President, they've got problems. I mean, this whole thing stinks. And the bottom line of it is, they have no real authority over the combatant forces. If the President issues an edict, Jesse, of something of military necessity and let's go through the extreme, nuclear weapons. It goes straight from the President through the Secretary of Defense, directly to the combatant forces or the unified commands depending on who's got to do what. And so it would be nice if we learn from this some other things we need to know, because this crowd really screwed things up in Afghanistan, and he is going to be under oath. And it's -- I think, some questions -- who would recommended and directed abandoning Bagram Air Base on July 8th, well in advance of the August 31st deadline set by the Taliban? Who was assigned the mission of removing or destroying the weapons, equipment, aircraft, sensitive military material, and tens of millions of dollars in cash at Bagram? And why did they fail to do so? How about in July and August, the President promised to leave no Americans or allies behind and yet, hundreds, perhaps thousands of Americans, and tens of thousands of our Afghan allies, and their families are now left behind as hostages and there is no plan apparently to get them out. How about asking if he urged the Secretary of State to negotiate agreements with other nations to grant asylum to Afghan nationals? That's normally the process, it hasn't happened here.",

I go by the old saying, he's a suspect. There is no other person of interest. There is no other suspect. And I want to say one thing to his lawyer, this Steve Bertolino guy. Why don't you give him the good advice that if he has nothing over his head, that he didn't do anything, that you'll bring him in? But I believe the guy is a sociopath. I believe as much as the odds say she is probably dead, there is a very slim chance that she is alive. But why doesn't this lawyer say, I'll bring you in now. End all this family's and all the relatives' pain, and if you did this, we'll make a deal now, because they're going to go -- if she's out there, they're going to find her body. I've worked hundreds of these cases, they're going to get to it eventually and he won't be able to make a deal. So he should say, you know what, let's do the right thing. I've got two sons. If one of my sons were involved in something like this, I'd say I'm going to bring you in. Let's go in and they're all saying, the family is saying, his family and his sister and other people, they want -- they want to see an end to this. You know, I was involved in so many cases. Drew Peterson, the guy who murdered his wife, pregnant wife, Susan Smith with the two little children. She drowned in South Carolina and said it was a black guy. You know the carjacker. I know one thing, the first time they wouldn't do any media. The next day after they clammed up and lawyered up and didn't do any media that they were guilty.

While the F.B.I. turned a blind eye, the girls suffered a trauma that it's going to haunt them for the rest of their lives. The F.B.I. admitted it ignored and covered up a massive molestation scandal."

The billionaire pedophile cut a sweetheart deal with the Feds then raped more teens under everybody's nose. This happened under Robert Mueller's watch, Jim Comey's watch. The F.B.I. seized surveillance footage from all of Epstein -- all of his homes. Where did all that go? Nobody knows. It's buried. After the deadly '96 Summer Olympics bombing in Atlanta, the F.B.I. tried to pin the crime on the wrong guy. Remember Richard Jewell? Investigators created a sketch of a man they thought planted the pipe bomb, but the F.B.I. refused to release it. Instead, an innocent man's life was ruined. The Feds painted him as a lone wolf, without any evidence."

The father of the guy behind the Pulse Nightclub shooting that killed 49 people, he actually worked for the F.B.I. Siddique Mateen was the father of Omar Mateen that That terrorist who murdered dozens of people in 2016 at that Orlando nightclub. It turns out the dad was working with the F.B.I. as a confidential informant for over a decade leading right up to the massacre. The dad sent money transfers to Afghanistan and Turkey before the shooting, while at the same time working for the bureau. Multiple complaints were made against the son for being a terrorist sympathizer. He was connected to al-Qaeda, but the F.B.I. did nothing. The F.B.I. has had rotten people in their network for years. One of their own informants was living with two of the 9/11 hijackers, yet the two guys still managed to hit us on that terrible day. It gets worse. Remember the Parkland School shooting in Florida? Tips came in six weeks before the massacre alerting the FBI that Nikolas Cruz was an armed and dangerous likely school shooter ready to blow. The F.B.I. never even followed up on the tip, and over a dozen innocent children died. The F.B.I. basically dropped their investigation into the Las Vegas massacre after over a year of wasted time. Steven Paddock who shot and killed 60 people at a festival in Vegas, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, and the F.B.I. came up empty and we never hear about it. Something isn't right there. The F.B.I. was also heavily involved in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Whitmer. According to BuzzFeed, F.B.I. informants played a huge role in engineering that plan, and then the lead F.B.I. agent on the case, he was just popped for beating his wife after a swinger's party. And what really happened with Hunter Biden's laptop? The F.B.I. has had it for almost two years, sat on it, nothing. WATTERS' WORLD doesn't want to hear any more apologies, no more suspensions without pay. We need to audit the F.B.I. and clean house. You can't trust them. It has failed us, failed innocent women and children, costs lives and livelihoods and nobody pays a price. It's the most incompetent and corrupt part of the entire government, and that says a lot. And yet another story involving F.B.I. corruption, special prosecutor John Durham charged crooked Hillary's lawyer with lying to the F.B.I. The indictment is a window into how the Russia hoax got started. Basically, it started with Hillary. Hillary's paid political operative, a lawyer named Michael Sussman provided the F.B.I. with bogus material falsely tying Trump to Russia. Hillary's paid political operative, this lawyer, Michael Sussman, provided the F.B.I. with this BS basically, and then lied to the F.B.I. and said he wasn't a paid political op. He hid that he was doing this for Hillary, leading the F.B.I. to believe, you know, this guy was just a concerned citizen, not motivated by politics. And remember, when the D.N.C. server was hacked? Sussman is the same lawyer who handled that hack. He refused to turn the hacked server over to the F.B.I. for analysis, and then pinned the blame on Trump-Russia. Notice a trend? It gets deeper. Sussman is a lawyer at the firm Perkins Coie or he was anyway, he just resigned. Perkins Coie is the same firm that Hillary used to pay for the fake dossier. The dossier was given to the F.B.I., remember, who used it to get a warrant to spy on Trump? So back to Durham's indictment. All summer and fall of 2016, Sussman, his firm, his tech contact, the Clinton campaign leaked this bogus collusion material to the media ginning up the Trump Russia collusion hoax, claiming the Trump Organization had a secret server back channeling the Putin's favorite Russian bank."

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Meanwhile, Hillary was the one with the secret server. This hoax was just a distraction from her own crime. This whole time, Sussman's firm was billing the Clinton campaign for all this dirty work. So the indictment describes efforts to find or create a quote \"narrative\" tying Trump to Russia. But the cyber guys working with crooked's lawyer knew the material didn't tie Trump to Russia. They admitted over e-mail, it was a red herring. It was spoofed, they said. But instead, the operatives spruced up the docs and the lawyer fed the fake material to the F.B.I. anyway. The F.B.I. opened one of several investigations into Trump because of this crap, wasted the F.B.I.'s valuable time, money and manpower and triggered a swirl of suspicion and investigative controversy surrounding Trump unfairly, which ultimately led to the Mueller investigation, which as we know found no collusion. And the F.B.I. knew early on the material they were being fed didn't add up, but they doctored evidence and kept using dirty informants to spy on the Trump campaign and undermine his presidency. That was the insurance policy in action. So the bottom line, Clinton's lawyer lied to the F.B.I. to cover up the fact that Clinton was the one cooking up the fake Trump-Russia collusion story. The C.I.A. knew it. Obama and Biden were briefed on it, but they all went along with the hoax. So what's next? Let's go to host of \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" The Great One, as they call him, Mark Levin. All right, Mark, your analysis of the Durham indictment. MARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST, LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN: My analysis of the Durham indictment is that Hillary Clinton is Mr. Big in the middle of all of this. And so my question would be for Mr. Durham, have you dragged Hillary Clinton in front of your grand jury yet or not? Because enough is enough. This Clinton campaign, through this law firm, was so thoroughly corrupt using its money to create false evidence against Donald Trump connecting him to Russia and then she would go out there and talk about how Donald Trump is bought and paid for by Russia. She had Pelosi do it. The Democrats are all tap dancing and pushing the same issue, their friends in the media. So, really what this has come down to? You hammered it well on the F.B.I. But Hillary Clinton has always been corrupt. She has always been a liar and she is still corrupt, and she is still a liar and she has never been held to account. She needs to be brought in front of the grand jury. That's number one. Number two, the media is corrupt and filled with liars. Virtually everybody today in Big Media pushed this story, and yet they continue to have their jobs. They should all be losing their jobs. And finally, this law firm. This law firm is detestable. It not only had Sussman as a partner who has now been scrubbed from the website, but has this guy Mark Elias, who was involved in the dossier, and now is involved in a massive dark money network, as FOX has reported with a bunch of front groups that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars to try to affect the next election the way he and they affected the prior election in 2020. And you know what, Jesse? We're not allowed to talk about it. We're told no, you're election deniers. We even have people like Chris Christie running around and talking about it. So here we have more than enough evidence to show what Hillary Clinton, the D.N.C., this law firm, and their favorite lawyer did with hundreds of millions of dollars, lied about Trump, lied about corruption, lied about Russia. For three years, this country was dragged to the toilet, and now we're not allowed to talk about it. And yet, there's an enormous evidence they're up to no good again, with these front groups' dark money, meaning no transparent money, billionaires pouring tens of millions of dollars into the effort in the next election. If we had an honest media, this wouldn't be going on. So, they are corrupt as the F.B.I. and Hillary Clinton. Period."

The Biden administration is still standing by Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, even after new reports says he contacted the Chinese military behind Donald Trump's back, back in January 2020.

It's not going to be a surprise.\" The book also claims Milley colluded with Nancy Pelosi to kneecap Donald Trump's authority to take military action. Now, Milley says everything is fine.

But the phone call to the Communist Chinese counterpart is very, very problematic, if indeed, those words were actually said. The 30 October call and the one on the eighth right after the election, reassuring that the U.S. military is not going to attack or conduct any kinetic operations against you. That is very problematic. I look at those kinds of things and say, \"What was he thinking?\" And the good news for him is he's going to have a chance to talk about all of this. What was he talking about with the Speaker of the House? The whole idea of gathering the staff -- the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- which do not have an operational role. The important thing to note is, he doesn't have an operational role. None of the chairmen do -- none of the members of the Joint Staff do. They are in an advisory capacity only. And so he ought to be asked to release the transcripts. If not just redact, you know, one or two words somewhere. But those Joint Chiefs of Staff, if they did pledge allegiance to him instead of to the President, they've got problems. I mean, this whole thing stinks. And the bottom line of it is, they have no real authority over the combatant forces. If the President issues an edict, Jesse, of something of military necessity and let's go through the extreme, nuclear weapons. It goes straight from the President through the Secretary of Defense, directly to the combatant forces or the unified commands depending on who's got to do what. And so it would be nice if we learn from this some other things we need to know, because this crowd really screwed things up in Afghanistan, and he is going to be under oath. And it's -- I think, some questions -- who would recommended and directed abandoning Bagram Air Base on July 8th, well in advance of the August 31st deadline set by the Taliban? Who was assigned the mission of removing or destroying the weapons, equipment, aircraft, sensitive military material, and tens of millions of dollars in cash at Bagram? And why did they fail to do so? How about in July and August, the President promised to leave no Americans or allies behind and yet, hundreds, perhaps thousands of Americans, and tens of thousands of our Afghan allies, and their families are now left behind as hostages and there is no plan apparently to get them out. How about asking if he urged the Secretary of State to negotiate agreements with other nations to grant asylum to Afghan nationals? That's normally the process, it hasn't happened here."

Drew Peterson, the guy who murdered his wife, pregnant wife, Susan Smith with the two little children. She drowned in South Carolina and said it was a black guy. You know the carjacker. I know one thing, the first time they wouldn't do any media. The next day after they clammed up and lawyered up and didn't do any media that they were guilty. I would have taken a bullet in the two weeks I was looking for my son, Adam, I would have stood in New York Times Square naked and took a bullet and exchange myself for him. This guy is dirt. He is turd."

MacDonald was famous for his deadpan style of comedy, a \"Saturday Night Live\" alum who in the late 90s became famous for hosting those weekend updates and he was eventually fired after one too many OJ jokes during the murder trial. The rumor was that Simpson was good friends with some NBC network guys. So MacDonald's delivery was dry, it was edgy, witty, and it was one of a kind.

I ended up spending an evening with him on a train going to see him perform and then hanging out with him before the show, after the show, and then we went back together on the train. And all he did was bet. He had this betting app and we were -- all we did was sit there and bet while the other passengers on the train were yelling at him to be quiet. And we were all drinking roadies. I don't think he was drinking, but everybody else was. But everybody who heard this news was equally heartbroken. Whether they agreed politically or not with him, it was just devastating. I think there are people that don't even like him that were distraught over this. But everything you said is right.
