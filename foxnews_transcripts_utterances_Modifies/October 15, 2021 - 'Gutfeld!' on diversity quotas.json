That's when they shove a tiny camera down your throat to see how stuff's working. Everything seems OK. The best part is that videos ratings were still higher than CNN's. But thankfully, they didn't find anything scary except for Dana Perino's class ring. There's a few diamonds missing from it, but I'm hoping my proctologist will find those next week.  But in order to do that procedure, they put me on a drug that knocked me out. So, forgive me if I make less sense than Joe Biden, speaking without a teleprompter. But, at least I know what it's like to be Kat.   Anyway. Last night, a debate erupted over the Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving, who's refused the COVID vaccine. Now, I don't follow professional badminton. But this is now a big deal. Since New York City requires proof of the vax for entry into the arena where the Nets play. So, on Tuesday, the Nets said Irving won't play until he's vaxxed, but he isn't doing it. I mean, what would you do?",

I'm staying grounded in what I believe in. It's just as simple as that. It's not about being anti-vax, or about being, you know, on one side or the other. Like, it is just really about being true to what feels good for me. I chose to be unvaccinated. And that was my choice. And I would ask you all just to respect that choice.",

But if we all got along despite our political health or height differences, it makes it that much harder for the aristocracy to control you and for the media to make a buck.  The people in power lose power when we resist the traps that they set for us. We've seen now division is that gone through media narratives that aren't true, and politicians who need to target. CNN fostered the anti-police narrative and wove it into a racial conflict that is since mushrooms into a Stelter-sized monstrosity of lies and identity politics. Others who wish to pit the sexes against each other do so, because it makes careers in academia and jobs for people in human resources.  They do this with gays and straights, trans and gays, dogs and cats, \"FOX AND FRIENDS\".",

While we push each other around in the streets, they're raking it in with their click bait.  If only we got along, their jobs would vanish faster than a story on Hunter's laptop, and the people's power would grow. But now, we're being pulled into new conflicts: vaxxed versus unvaxxed, masked versus no mask.  Once you see how it's being ginned up though, you see it everywhere. Take the NBA player. Seriously, why get mad over someone you don't even know who is making a decision for himself. I mean, unless it's something like talking loudly on a cell phone in a movie theatre, in that case, stabbed the jerk.  Don't stab the jerk. That's a joke. But other than that, just realize, it's CNN and Biden administration trolling you and us. Right now it's kind of clear that someone who is young, lean, and incredibly fit such as Kyrie and myself, does not have the same risk profile as someone with a pre-existing condition. Unless, unbeknownst to me, Kyrie once dated Kat. He poses no threat to Geraldo, or me, or our families. I don't know what that means. But we're living in a time of conformity. And when you don't conform, you're shunned like Jerrold Nadler skinny dipping at a public pool. So, whenever you feel yourself getting angry at someone else, and you're only given two choices, it's a binary prison of ideas. Remember, that it's a desired phenomenon created by a third party. It creates content for T.V.  producers, and it distracts the populace from the real bad -- that's going on. Like crime, mental illness, and my relentless IBS caused by swallowing class rings.  If we fight amongst ourselves, we can't fight them, and they can continue ignoring real injustice, and get rich off you along the way. So, mandates became just another tool to split us apart. But the media's argument that there has to be a deep seated hatred amongst Americans is much like Al Capone's vault. Once you crack it open, there is nothing really there. And once you see it, you can't unsee it. Much like when you see Geraldo shirtless.",

I haven't seen this much bad acting since my honeymoon. It was filmed at the U.S. Naval Observatory, home of many giant telescopes, which officials hope will help her find a clue. Meanwhile, Joe Biden was so inspired by the video he pledged that within the next 10 years, the U.S. will put a man in space. According to Paul McCartney, it was John Lennon who initiated the breakup of the Beatles. Sir Paul's age is showing because he then claimed Yoko Ono broke up the monkeys. The Department of Transportation revealed that Secretary Pete Buttigieg hasn't worked in eight weeks due to paternity leave. OK, that's almost understandable. So, what's Kamala's excuse? When asked about it, Buttigieg said he wanted to lose the baby weight before being seen in public again. Although, you know you're an essential worker when no one notices you've been gone for two months. They would have released the info earlier except it was trapped in a shipping container off the coast of L.A. So, older New York mobsters are reportedly concerned their phone-obsessed millennial children are ruining the mafia. Even worse, they signed up for the friends and five family plan. America's Got Talent judge, Howie Mandel, explained that he fainted at a Starbucks due to dehydration after a colonoscopy. Well, that's what happens when you ask the doctor for a venti. I don't get it. I don't get it. Employees were concerned when they saw where he was pouring his cappuccino. I don't know where this is going. In an upcoming issue of D.C. Comics, the new Superman will be will come out as bisexual. But many saw this coming after Clark Kent was taken up the crime beat and assigned to the arts and leisure section. Terrible and Superman's new weakness will be changed from kryptonite to Brad Pitt. After spiking shootings, Chicago has installed 426 mounted bleeding control kits around the city. Officials say, that should be enough to get them through the weekend. Terrible, terrible. While promoting her new book, Hillary Clinton said she's never going to be out of the game of politics. It's the only game she still enjoys because it requires no physical exertion. And for a lot of her opponents, it's sudden death. That was good. She's like the Michael Myers and politics, except we wish she wore a mask. That is harsh. This is one, this is one book you can actually judge by its cover, what is going on? This week, William Shatner became the oldest man to travel to space. Though the flight only lasted three minutes, he did have sex with at least three hot alien chicks. Survey found that four in 10 parents would ditch their children and coach if they could upgrade to first class. Meanwhile, four in 10 children said they would kill their parents for chicken fingers. I'm with you. Seattle school cancelled its Halloween parade because it marginalized students of color. Sad news for parades Grand Marshal Justin Trudeau. That's a great joke. The Rolling Stones have dropped brown sugar from the setlist of their current tour, not because of the racial lyrics, it's just bad for their glucose levels. Finally, a loud prostitute was kicked out of public housing for being too loud while working from home during the pandemic. But she's still allowed to Zoom into meetings for CNN. That's it.

The people in power lose power when we resist the traps that they set for us. We've seen now division is that gone through media narratives that aren't true, and politicians who need to target. CNN fostered the anti-police narrative and wove it into a racial conflict that is since mushrooms into a Stelter-sized monstrosity of lies and identity politics. Others who wish to pit the sexes against each other do so, because it makes careers in academia and jobs for people in human resources.

Seriously, why get mad over someone you don't even know who is making a decision for himself. I mean, unless it's something like talking loudly on a cell phone in a movie theatre, in that case, stabbed the jerk. Don't stab the jerk. That's a joke. But other than that, just realize, it's CNN and Biden administration trolling you and us. Right now it's kind of clear that someone who is young, lean, and incredibly fit such as Kyrie and myself, does not have the same risk profile as someone with a pre-existing condition. Unless, unbeknownst to me, Kyrie once dated Kat. He poses no threat to Geraldo, or me, or our families. I don't know what that means. But we're living in a time of conformity. And when you don't conform, you're shunned like Jerrold Nadler skinny dipping at a public pool. So, whenever you feel yourself getting angry at someone else, and you're only given two choices, it's a binary prison of ideas. Remember, that it's a desired phenomenon created by a third party. It creates content for T.V. producers, and it distracts the populace from the real bad -- that's going on. Like crime, mental illness, and my relentless IBS caused by swallowing class rings. If we fight amongst ourselves, we can't fight them, and they can continue ignoring real injustice, and get rich off you along the way. So, mandates became just another tool to split us apart. But the media's argument that there has to be a deep seated hatred amongst Americans is much like Al Capone's vault. Once you crack it open, there is nothing really there. And once you see it, you can't unsee it. Much like when you see Geraldo shirtless."

Look at Andrew Wiggins from the warriors who applied for a religious exemption and he was denied. We were told that COVID negative tests would suffice for these athletes that chose not to get the vaccine. In fact, we were told that with the New York City, we were told that within the federal government, but that encroachment just keeps creeping. And so, Kyrie can stand to lose, yes, $15.5 million, which he will this season. That means he can stand to lose that if he is.

Wants to revamp math courses to focus on colonialism and privilege, but not the kind of privilege that lets you weigh $78,000 a year in tuition. Of course, according to the college fix, which obtained a copy of the proposed curriculum change, a group of professors and students suggests courses like calculus could situate race white supremacy, colonialism, power and privilege centrally throughout the course.

We have a TV -- we have a TV show on Netflix. I love Ted Turner. He's the man. And, and I do feel for them though, I know what it's like to have a walkout it happens every night when I do a comedy show. This is why I started doing Alaskan cruises, also people can't leave even if they want to. I'm done by the time they get to the exit."

As you know, this is the first time I'm reading these, let's do it. OK. Vice President Kamala Harris was roundly mocked over her science video for kids. I haven't seen this much bad acting since my honeymoon. It was filmed at the U.S. Naval Observatory, home of many giant telescopes, which officials hope will help her find a clue. Meanwhile, Joe Biden was so inspired by the video he pledged that within the next 10 years, the U.S. will put a man in space. According to Paul McCartney, it was John Lennon who initiated the breakup of the Beatles. Sir Paul's age is showing because he then claimed Yoko Ono broke up the monkeys. The Department of Transportation revealed that Secretary Pete Buttigieg hasn't worked in eight weeks due to paternity leave. OK, that's almost understandable. So, what's Kamala's excuse? When asked about it, Buttigieg said he wanted to lose the baby weight before being seen in public again. Although, you know you're an essential worker when no one notices you've been gone for two months. They would have released the info earlier except it was trapped in a shipping container off the coast of L.A. So, older New York mobsters are reportedly concerned their phone-obsessed millennial children are ruining the mafia. Even worse, they signed up for the friends and five family plan. America's Got Talent judge, Howie Mandel, explained that he fainted at a Starbucks due to dehydration after a colonoscopy. Well, that's what happens when you ask the doctor for a venti. I don't get it. I don't get it. Employees were concerned when they saw where he was pouring his cappuccino. I don't know where this is going. In an upcoming issue of D.C. Comics, the new Superman will be will come out as bisexual. But many saw this coming after Clark Kent was taken up the crime beat and assigned to the arts and leisure section. Terrible and Superman's new weakness will be changed from kryptonite to Brad Pitt. After spiking shootings, Chicago has installed 426 mounted bleeding control kits around the city. Officials say, that should be enough to get them through the weekend. Terrible, terrible. While promoting her new book, Hillary Clinton said she's never going to be out of the game of politics. It's the only game she still enjoys because it requires no physical exertion. And for a lot of her opponents, it's sudden death. That was good. She's like the Michael Myers and politics, except we wish she wore a mask. That is harsh. This is one, this is one book you can actually judge by its cover, what is going on? This week, William Shatner became the oldest man to travel to space. Though the flight only lasted three minutes, he did have sex with at least three hot alien chicks. Survey found that four in 10 parents would ditch their children and coach if they could upgrade to first class. Meanwhile, four in 10 children said they would kill their parents for chicken fingers. I'm with you. Seattle school cancelled its Halloween parade because it marginalized students of color. Sad news for parades Grand Marshal Justin Trudeau. That's a great joke. The Rolling Stones have dropped brown sugar from the setlist of their current tour, not because of the racial lyrics, it's just bad for their glucose levels. Finally, a loud prostitute was kicked out of public housing for being too loud while working from home during the pandemic. But she's still allowed to Zoom into meetings for CNN. That's it. Don't go away. We'll be right back."
