With just 19 days until the single most important midterm elections in our lifetime, the fate of the Senate, the House, all hangs in the balance.  So, it is up to you to send a message to the Democratic Party that mob rule is not acceptable in the U.S. And tonight, we'll set the stage. We'll break down multiple key races, preview what will happen. God forbid, if Pelosi's speaker, Schumer is the Senate majority leader, and they take the reins of government.  Now, my interview with Rush is coming up. You're not going to want to miss a second.  First, it's time for a special Florida edition of our opening monologue.",

Two local Republican candidates in Minnesota, a Democratic operative arrested in Nevada, for battery against a GOP campaign manager, that operative has now been fired.

There has never been a greater urgency to speak out collectively, to continue the agenda that has been working for two years, or reverse course.  Fundamental principles we believe in, due process, presumption of innocence, that's at play. The economy is in play. Peace and prosperity, national security is in play. The country is at a tipping point in more ways than we can even begin.  So, without further ado, we are in the studio of Rush Limbaugh. First, I want to congratulate you.

It wouldn't even be considered relevant. And the people of this country would want to get rid of that as quickly as they could.  But yet, it may be close to 50 percent of the country.

He said, what has happened, in his view -- I endorse this even more than he does. I think it is a bigger point than he made it. These people on the left that you've described, the mob behavior, is really a series of psychological disorders that have taken over politics. We have politicized psychological disorders to the pointing out that they have become the objective of the Democrat Party. Solving all of these disparate, separate psychological disorders, having the government do it, basically determine outcomes.   And get even with oppressors, the founding majority of the country. That's what we are dealing with. If we don't define this properly, we are never going to be able to oppose it. If we consider the stuff legit, which it isn't, that kind of behavior is not legitimate.  We do not want a country based on that kind -- we don't want people winning elections based on mobs and violence. Think if that happens. If they win the election based on this kind of behavior --",

A lot of people can't out to show and apologize for their mistake of voting for Trump.  They can't wait to go out there and apologize to the Democrat Party.  The fact of the matter is, since Barack Obama, the Democrat Party has been losing elections. Starting in 2010, midterm, state party, all the way up to 2016, the Democrat Party has lost 1,200 seats, national, state, local.  You have to count all the way down to the dog catcher, they have lost.  They have the least amount of electoral political power in Washington since the '20s. Where is this blue wave? Where's the evidence that people can't wait to vote Democrat? The evidence is they are doing the exact opposite. Trump is out there continuing to do the things he did that won him the election in 2016, all of these rallies. They have been unable to get rid of him. They have thrown everything at Trump that usually gets rid t of Republican opponents, and nothing has worked.  And they're just frustrated as they can be, and I think they are so overplaying this, and they are going way beyond the bounds of anywhere near propriety.

I thought -- my staff here will tell me that two days -- when I first saw the first polling after Trump and Melania went down the escalator, I said, he is the nominee. It is going to happen, I felt it.  You know why? Because I know the bond, I saw those rallies. I saw the bond that Trump had with his voters. The media didn't create that. He did. I did versions of that when my show started traveling around, 48 weekends a year for the first two years, trying to get my radio show established. And I saw similar a success track. And nobody can blow up that bond that Trump voters have, but Washington establishment, to this day, does not understand Donald Trump. They don't understand his voters, and they are not curious to find out why. They just resent it. And they are still operating under the same rules they operated under in 2016, and the parallels are identical here. They think in 2016, Hillary is going to win. Massive landslide, measuring the curtains, Hillary's planning all of these things. The deep state guys back then are confident nobody is going to ever know what they did, their jobs and careers will be safe. Strzok and all of these clowns, McCabe, safe. Then, Trump comes along and wins. They are shocked, they are stunned, they couldn't believe it. Same thing now, they think they have won the House a month ago. It's in the can.

Stop and think of that. There wouldn't be a roaring economy. There wouldn't have been any tax cuts, there would not have been rollback on regulations, no squaring of the deal with NATO. There wouldn't have been any read on trade deals. The Obama administration told the American people, get used to it, there is a new American economy, and it is flat line or in decline. America's past, we didn't really deserve that. America was founded by a white patriarchy set itself up for itself, people discriminated against, but those days are over. So, now, the days behind us, we didn't deserve those anyway. We don't deserve to be a superpower. We have a flat line economy. We were told -- Obama is out there in Indiana telling these people their jobs are never coming back. And some in the audience, \"Mr. Trump says\" and Obama says, what is he going to do, wave a magic wand? Look what happened, we got the jobs back. It can be done.

In my naive world, that behavior would secure the biggest landslide defeat a political party has ever had. In a sane world, where decent people are the majority, that would be rejected out of hand. It wouldn't even be considered relevant. And the people of this country would want to get rid of that as quickly as they could. But yet, it may be close to 50 percent of the country. I don't think it is, and I hope not. But the fact that it continues to survive, I have evolved a bunch of theories to explain it. And I really think -- by the way, interrupt any time with questions."

He said, what has happened, in his view -- I endorse this even more than he does. I think it is a bigger point than he made it. These people on the left that you've described, the mob behavior, is really a series of psychological disorders that have taken over politics. We have politicized psychological disorders to the pointing out that they have become the objective of the Democrat Party. Solving all of these disparate, separate psychological disorders, having the government do it, basically determine outcomes. And get even with oppressors, the founding majority of the country. That's what we are dealing with. If we don't define this properly, we are never going to be able to oppose it. If we consider the stuff legit, which it isn't, that kind of behavior is not legitimate.

A lot of people can't out to show and apologize for their mistake of voting for Trump.  They can't wait to go out there and apologize to the Democrat Party. The fact of the matter is, since Barack Obama, the Democrat Party has been losing elections. Starting in 2010, midterm, state party, all the way up to 2016, the Democrat Party has lost 1,200 seats, national, state, local.  You have to count all the way down to the dog catcher, they have lost.  They have the least amount of electoral political power in Washington since the '20s. Where is this blue wave? Where's the evidence that people can't wait to vote Democrat? The evidence is they are doing the exact opposite. Trump is out there continuing to do the things he did that won him the election in 2016, all of these rallies. They have been unable to get rid of him. They have thrown everything at Trump that usually gets rid t of Republican opponents, and nothing has worked. And they're just frustrated as they can be, and I think they are so overplaying this, and they are going way beyond the bounds of anywhere near propriety.

I'm looking at let's -- Florida, they could pick up a Senate seat. I think you could pick one up in Missouri. I think you will hold Nevada.

Let's compare this -- you want to go to 2008 -- let's go back to 2016. I know you were, early on, very confident that Trump was going to win. I thought -- my staff here will tell me that two days -- when I first saw the first polling after Trump and Melania went down the escalator, I said, he is the nominee. It is going to happen, I felt it. You know why? Because I know the bond, I saw those rallies. I saw the bond that Trump had with his voters. The media didn't create that. He did. I did versions of that when my show started traveling around, 48 weekends a year for the first two years, trying to get my radio show established. And I saw similar a success track. And nobody can blow up that bond that Trump voters have, but Washington establishment, to this day, does not understand Donald Trump. They don't understand his voters, and they are not curious to find out why. They just resent it. And they are still operating under the same rules they operated under in 2016, and the parallels are identical here. They think in 2016, Hillary is going to win. Massive landslide, measuring the curtains, Hillary's planning all of these things. The deep state guys back then are confident nobody is going to ever know what they did, their jobs and careers will be safe. Strzok and all of these clowns, McCabe, safe. Then, Trump comes along and wins. They are shocked, they are stunned, they couldn't believe it. Same thing now, they think they have won the House a month ago. It's in the can. They are just waiting for the calendar and the days to go by, when all of their own point data shows the so-called generic ballot blue wave shrinking and shrinking."

Stop and think of that. There wouldn't be a roaring economy. There wouldn't have been any tax cuts, there would not have been rollback on regulations, no squaring of the deal with NATO. There wouldn't have been any read on trade deals. The Obama administration told the American people, get used to it, there is a new American economy, and it is flat line or in decline. America's past, we didn't really deserve that. America was founded by a white patriarchy set itself up for itself, people discriminated against, but those days are over. So, now, the days behind us, we didn't deserve those anyway. We don't deserve to be a superpower. We have a flat line economy. We were told -- Obama is out there in Indiana telling these people their jobs are never coming back. And some in the audience, \"Mr. Trump says\" and Obama says, what is he going to do, wave a magic wand? Look what happened, we got the jobs back. It can be done.

More people than ever can get the job they want, they are getting raises. There are being bonus. We have people free to start their own businesses. The economy in every other aspect of life in America is on the upswing, and a political party and its voters are mad about it. Why? Why couldn't you be happy? The answer is very simple. If it happens as a result of individual aptitude and application instead of government making it happen, they are going to oppose it. This the greatest threat, economic activity, economic growth, self-sufficiency, self- reliance, people learning that the old rules of working hard and applying yourself pay off, biggest threat to the American left in the Democrat Party that there could be."
