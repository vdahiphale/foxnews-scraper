So, all they saw when they look at this clown with somebody that could hurt so they're -- they are lined up to kiss his, you know, the bald bozos ring.

So, my big point is, for all those people that were in that montage, because I know they watch The Five, it's really a positive thing to admit that you're wrong, but it's even more positive to figure out why you were wrong. Because it's like opening a portal that you didn't know you had. It's a great thing to do. So, the media that are so wrong on this, you don't have to admit it, you don't have to admit, but you need to spend some time to figure out why you were wrong.

He also said that when trials are going on and there are judges being attacked, that hurts the prosecution. And so, what the attorney general was doing, he was defending his department but he was also defending the things that Democrats are criticizing the president of, which is independence. The attorney general said I am independent but I am also a political appointee. He also said, also, it's not all the tweets that I'm concerned about. The president can talk about politics, criticize his political opponents all day. It just when it go -- happens to be the Justice Department where it's an issue for him.

So, this actually might have a greater impact, and negative impact going forward. But I think that Elizabeth Warren and her comments about the regulations for the banking industry and what she's talking about with that has -- I think there are people who are quaking in their boots right now, that financial health and the camel system will be based in part on a diversity and inclusion rating that is totally separate from the value of a dollar I think will go so far behind closed doors. And the money that Bloomberg has will propel him past all of that because as Warren is essentially hemorrhaging out, Nevada also is Biden's last chance, and all of those monies are going to go anywhere but to him. That's his last chance to prove viability."

But you those clowns from the montage, they couldn't, because they had a derange filter. So, all they saw when they look at this clown with somebody that could hurt so they're -- they are lined up to kiss his, you know, the bald bozos ring. He -- Stelter who said he was a prime contender for the presidency. This is a piece of evidence that shows you that the corporate media cannot be trusted because there's -- these are -- these are people that consider themselves more sophisticated than all of us but they are credulous. They'll take in anybody. They're like a tribe looking for a savior and that's what they saw in this guy. So, my big point is, for all those people that were in that montage, because I know they watch The Five, it's really a positive thing to admit that you're wrong, but it's even more positive to figure out why you were wrong. Because it's like opening a portal that you didn't know you had. It's a great thing to do. So, the media that are so wrong on this, you don't have to admit it, you don't have to admit, but you need to spend some time to figure out why you were wrong. And why -- what flawed view cause you to see this guy, because you look at no street smarts, now Midwestern common sense, those were the things that could have helped you see this guy for what he is. And it's absent on CNN, in MSNBC, the Washington Post, they don't have one person on their staff that saw this for what it was.

I think he's ready to finish that term. He said that Don Jr. was going to be behind bars. Looks like you're going to be behind bars. So this is not a guy that was a smart person. He went after Nike.

That should be reserved for someone like this. That second trial that you just mentioned in the intro, that's a 36 count indictment. That -- this is not a small, low level, gray area situation. This human is despicable. He's a complete embarrassment to my profession. And I think the fact that he was given such a mouthpiece for so long without that vetting or without any -- I mean, he was like the Emperor's New Clothes living in this lavish palace. He was -- yes, he was thieving from a disabled people and -- to buy a private jet because he was in debt $15 million. And meanwhile, his defense attorney is literally part of their argument, part of their strategy and trial on which he was found guilty of all three counts in this one in New York was well he just did it. Nike, just do it. They literally were like, he just did it. So you of all people should appreciate that this is simply an aggressive attorney.
