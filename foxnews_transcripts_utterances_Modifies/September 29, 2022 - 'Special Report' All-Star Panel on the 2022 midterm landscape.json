Meantime, we are less than six weeks to the midterms, and political ads in Florida, there are a number of close races down there, are continuing, much to the chagrin of the former governor Jeb Bush, who was asked about it. He said, quote, \"I think campaigns should shift to helping what will be hundreds of thousands of Floridians that will need a lot of assistance,\" said former program governor Jeb Bush. He obviously saw Florida through a number of big hurricanes. Let's bring in our panel, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio, syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt, and Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for Reuters. Jeff, when one of these big disasters happens, usually politics is put on the back burner, at least for some time. We are closing in on the midterms, though, and it is always hanging above us. JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"REUTERS\": We are. What is interesting is the politics at the presidential level, which is not -- this is not a presidential year. But there is a possibility that Biden and DeSantis could potentially be rivals in the 2024 election. Today they both seemed to set that aside, and President Biden's remarks at FEMA, he talked about having spoken to the governor four or five times. He said the governor complemented him and the federal government response. And he also said this is not about politics. So it was interesting to see him setting that aside, and apparently the governor setting that aside, as well. But in the state, yes, those ads are still playing, and there's a lot riding on them.",

Russ Feingold was a mainstream Democrat. Mandela Barnes is way out there on the left, and that is beginning to tell. And Ron Johnson is a heck of a retail politician, so I think that one is in the bag. Dr. Oz is surging, Herschel is surging, pretty much Adam Laxalt in Nevada has got it in the bag. Blake Masters is behind but closing, and the Joe O'Dea and Tiffany Smiley in Colorado and Washington state respectively, it's a good map for the Republicans. If you offered the objective observer, which one do you want? Do you want the Republican chances in a 50/50 Senate or do you want the Democratic chances, I think four out of five people would take the Republican chances walking away.",

And Barnes, his record, there is a lot to go after there, and the Republicans are doing so. It's the governor's race in that state that they say is a total coin flip at this point and could go either way.

Add that in with the cost of food, as we've talked about on this show before, and inflation becomes the number one issue, and where it's not, it's crime.
