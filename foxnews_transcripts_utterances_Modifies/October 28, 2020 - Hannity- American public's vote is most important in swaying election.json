      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY.   Tonight, damning new details continue to emerge surrounding Joe Biden's family corruption scandals. Documents, text, emails, eyewitness accounts are now painting what is a very corrupt and a very ugly picture and, of course, it is well-documented the fact that Biden's son, zero experience Hunter, his brother Jim received millions and millions of dollars from sketchy foreign nationals cashing in on then Vice President Biden and that would be Ukrainian oligarchs, Russian oligarchs, Kazakh oligarchs, Chinese nationals, Bank of China, you name it, they were making money and all to buy influence. And now, thanks to what are troves of new evidence that is becoming increasingly clear, Joe Biden himself played a critical role in the sketchy payouts, offering special access in exchange for sweetheart business deals, millions for his family.  And according to a former by Biden business partner, Tony Bobulinski, Joe Biden not only knew about the pay-for-play schemes but was a integral part of the process.  And it's important to point out that, so far, no one has directly refuted Mr. Bobulinski's claims, not Joe Biden, not Hunter Biden, not Jim Biden.  This is what happened when Jim Biden was asked if he had any response to all the corruption allegations leveled against him and his family. Let's take a look.",

You wouldn't know it though if you watch fake news CNN or MSDNC, or you got your news from anyone in the media mob. They didn't cover Tucker's hour- long interview with Mr. Bobulinski. They're not investigating his claims. They're not verifying the evidence.  They are completely and totally ignoring all of it, which is in and of itself a scandal. By the way, as they ignored the Johnson and the Grassley report, you know about the oligarchs, about the wire transfers, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, China -- it's like an outright censorship of all of this by big tech companies, Twitter, Facebook, the media mob.  And tonight, it is more obvious than ever that very powerful forces -- the media mob, 99 percent, big tech companies, almost all of them. the Democratic socialist party, the establishment Never Trumpers, weak establishment Republicans and the deep state now are all aligned against this president and his reelection. Now, the only thing that can stop that from happening is you the American people. And with at least battleground states now in play, President Trump is taking nothing and nobody for granted. The president is traveling the country at a rapid pace.  Earlier today, he had two massive rallies in Arizona. Tomorrow, he will be in Florida, he will be in North Carolina.   And in six days, let me tell you one thing that nobody is telling you. Anybody that is out there making predictions, they don't know what the hell they're talking about. Nobody has a crystal ball and by the way, don't believe anyone that is telling you they know how this election will turn out, or Donald Trump only has a five percent chance. You know what? That is an effort to deflate conservative and Republican votes. Your vote, if you believe this, is critical and everybody takes it seriously. Yes, you can shock the world again and the media mob will have to utter the words, choke on them, \"we can now project that Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States.\"  That can happen. That is your power. You get to decide. You are the ultimate jury. and by the way, you are the only thing that is standing in the way of the single most radical extreme socialist agenda and what would be an administration in American history.  Joe Biden may be at the top of the Democratic ticket, but let's be honest here, he's not exactly steering the ship. He is weak, he is frail, he is cognitively struggling, he can barely get his words together. He seems totally at times completely out of it like a half a corpse that's being manipulated by the radical socialists that are in charge. And there's geriatric Joe long for the ride. In fact, today was a big day for Joe Biden. This morning, he was driven to a local polling site near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he voted early delivered a couple of remarks and spent the rest of the afternoon hiding again in his basement bunker, resting comfortably.   Here we are six days until an all-important presidential election, Joe Biden took the day off again. He's not holding rallies. He's not visiting battleground states. You know, Barack Obama is doing more campaigning for Joe Biden and Joe Biden's doing for Joe Biden. Instead, you got Kamala Harris. She was out on the campaign trail -- rarely for her too.  And today, while he was taking his nap time in Delaware, she was in the state of Arizona hosting a few events, with tiny little baby crowds. Very few people.  At this point, even Joe Biden himself is stating the obvious. Take a look.",

And according to the nonpartisan study, she was ranked the most liberal senator in 2019. That's right, to the left of Bernie, a devout socialist.  She co-sponsored the Green New Deal. She also called for a ban on fracking, and fossil fuels. She wants to put a ban on plastic straws. She would like to limit the amount of red meat that Americans are allowed to consume.   And she is in favor of Medicare-for-All. She co-sponsored that including taxpayer-funded health insurance for illegal immigrants. And by the way, she is against private health insurance plans.  She supports, of course, packing the court. She promised to confiscate guns via executive order, bypassing, usurping the power of the legislative branch of government. These are radical beliefs out of the mainstream, but that is your new Democratic socialist party. And pay attention because if some of the polls are right, most people don't think Joe Biden can even finish a first term, watch Kamala Harris more carefully. For example, Joe Biden's own website praises the Green New Deal as the crucial framework for battling climate change.   Yesterday, Biden's own climate czar, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, had this to say about the increasingly radical Democratic Party. Take a look.",

And, of course, to accomplish this radical agenda, Democrats could need to seize control of the U.S. Supreme Court, and during the Democratic primary, even Kamala Harris said that the Democrats should be willing to pack the courts. That would be the biggest power grab in 150 years in this country.  Multiple, high-profile Democrats are all threatening to do that or it's on the table, including Rahm \"Dead Fish\" Emanuel.

They amplify fake stories about President Trump like the dirty dossier and Russia collusion. They did that for years. They never suppressed that. But they suppressed true ones like the corrupt Biden business bureau, and the new revelations by Tony Bobulinski, for example, about how Joe Biden was deeply involved in his son's dealings with China. We need bold action, bold reform, certainly, we need to take away their liability protection. Now, in a new letter to Congress, the DOJ is supporting changes to what is called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, in an effort to hold big tech more accountable for the censorship that they're involved in, and it's only one of many reasons that this election is more important than ever before.

Documents, text, emails, eyewitness accounts are now painting what is a very corrupt and a very ugly picture and, of course, it is well-documented the fact that Biden's son, zero experience Hunter, his brother Jim received millions and millions of dollars from sketchy foreign nationals cashing in on then Vice President Biden and that would be Ukrainian oligarchs, Russian oligarchs, Kazakh oligarchs, Chinese nationals, Bank of China, you name it, they were making money and all to buy influence. And now, thanks to what are troves of new evidence that is becoming increasingly clear, Joe Biden himself played a critical role in the sketchy payouts, offering special access in exchange for sweetheart business deals, millions for his family. And according to a former by Biden business partner, Tony Bobulinski, Joe Biden not only knew about the pay-for-play schemes but was a integral part of the process. And it's important to point out that, so far, no one has directly refuted Mr. Bobulinski's claims, not Joe Biden, not Hunter Biden, not Jim Biden. This is what happened when Jim Biden was asked if he had any response to all the corruption allegations leveled against him and his family. Let's take a look."

You wouldn't know it though if you watch fake news CNN or MSDNC, or you got your news from anyone in the media mob. They didn't cover Tucker's hour- long interview with Mr. Bobulinski. They're not investigating his claims. They're not verifying the evidence. They are completely and totally ignoring all of it, which is in and of itself a scandal. By the way, as they ignored the Johnson and the Grassley report, you know about the oligarchs, about the wire transfers, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, China -- it's like an outright censorship of all of this by big tech companies, Twitter, Facebook, the media mob. And tonight, it is more obvious than ever that very powerful forces -- the media mob, 99 percent, big tech companies, almost all of them. the Democratic socialist party, the establishment Never Trumpers, weak establishment Republicans and the deep state now are all aligned against this president and his reelection. Now, the only thing that can stop that from happening is you the American people. And with at least battleground states now in play, President Trump is taking nothing and nobody for granted. The president is traveling the country at a rapid pace. Earlier today, he had two massive rallies in Arizona. Tomorrow, he will be in Florida, he will be in North Carolina. And in six days, let me tell you one thing that nobody is telling you. Anybody that is out there making predictions, they don't know what the hell they're talking about. Nobody has a crystal ball and by the way, don't believe anyone that is telling you they know how this election will turn out, or Donald Trump only has a five percent chance. You know what? That is an effort to deflate conservative and Republican votes. Your vote, if you believe this, is critical and everybody takes it seriously. Yes, you can shock the world again and the media mob will have to utter the words, choke on them, \"we can now project that Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States.\" That can happen. That is your power. You get to decide. You are the ultimate jury. and by the way, you are the only thing that is standing in the way of the single most radical extreme socialist agenda and what would be an administration in American history. Joe Biden may be at the top of the Democratic ticket, but let's be honest here, he's not exactly steering the ship. He is weak, he is frail, he is cognitively struggling, he can barely get his words together. He seems totally at times completely out of it like a half a corpse that's being manipulated by the radical socialists that are in charge. And there's geriatric Joe long for the ride. In fact, today was a big day for Joe Biden. This morning, he was driven to a local polling site near his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he voted early delivered a couple of remarks and spent the rest of the afternoon hiding again in his basement bunker, resting comfortably. Here we are six days until an all-important presidential election, Joe Biden took the day off again. He's not holding rallies. He's not visiting battleground states. You know, Barack Obama is doing more campaigning for Joe Biden and Joe Biden's doing for Joe Biden. Instead, you got Kamala Harris. She was out on the campaign trail -- rarely for her too. And today, while he was taking his nap time in Delaware, she was in the state of Arizona hosting a few events, with tiny little baby crowds. Very few people. At this point, even Joe Biden himself is stating the obvious. Take a look."

She also called for a ban on fracking, and fossil fuels. She wants to put a ban on plastic straws. She would like to limit the amount of red meat that Americans are allowed to consume. And she is in favor of Medicare-for-All. She co-sponsored that including taxpayer-funded health insurance for illegal immigrants. And by the way, she is against private health insurance plans. She supports, of course, packing the court. She promised to confiscate guns via executive order, bypassing, usurping the power of the legislative branch of government. These are radical beliefs out of the mainstream, but that is your new Democratic socialist party. And pay attention because if some of the polls are right, most people don't think Joe Biden can even finish a first term, watch Kamala Harris more carefully. For example, Joe Biden's own website praises the Green New Deal as the crucial framework for battling climate change. Yesterday, Biden's own climate czar, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, had this to say about the increasingly radical Democratic Party. Take a look."

They filled up an airport hangar, Sean, and they had to have 1,500 people that sat outside in degree freezing rain to listen to me speak and, you know, to talk about a president who's willing to fight for them, who's going to bat against the deep state, who's going to bat against the establishment. And when you compare and contrast that to Joe Biden's half a century of failure, where literally not one of these people can name a single one of Joe Biden's accomplishments because there are none, it's just amazing. And so, these guys are excited. They're excited to vote. They're excited to fight for their country, for their freedoms, and if you've been watching as we all have for the last 10 days, you know, it's not just the Second Amendment that's at risk this election. It's our First Amendment. I mean, between big tech and mainstream media and the social media masters -- I mean, they're trying to eliminate freedom of speech.

They don't care if they shut down your business, your livelihood forever. Guess what? We'll put you on a government program. You'll be a Democrat voter for life.

Remember, these very same companies are overwhelmingly staffed by Democrats and people are policy a wired analysis found that roughly 95 percent of contributions by six and -- by employees of the big -- six of the big tech firms have gone to Joe Biden, shocker. Big tech and the media mob are all in for the ever weak, frail, cognitively challenged, half a corpse Joe Biden. They amplify fake stories about President Trump like the dirty dossier and Russia collusion. They did that for years. They never suppressed that. But they suppressed true ones like the corrupt Biden business bureau, and the new revelations by Tony Bobulinski, for example, about how Joe Biden was deeply involved in his son's dealings with China. We need bold action, bold reform, certainly, we need to take away their liability protection. Now, in a new letter to Congress, the DOJ is supporting changes to what is called Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, in an effort to hold big tech more accountable for the censorship that they're involved in, and it's only one of many reasons that this election is more important than ever before. Here with reaction, the author of \"Trump and the American Future\", FOX News contributor, Newt Gingrich. It is incalculable to me, Mr. Speaker, how much this -- if we could -- if we could somehow put a monetary value on the suppression of conservative ideas and the promotion of Joe Biden's agenda.

These people have crossed a line. They have no right to censor what people want to put on there if, in fact, they're going to remain a common carrier. And I think one step may be to allow people like \"The New York Post\", the oldest newspaper the United States, fourth largest newspaper of United States, that have the right to sue them for economic damages every time they get censored. And you'd pretty rapidly find these guys backing off and deciding that maybe they don't want to try to render censorship. But I find it very chilling that Facebook now has 12 Chinese communists working for them in Seattle, applying the algorithms of censorship which are so common in China.

All the polls said he was never going to win, the odds were low, you and I were out there saying, no, he can win this. As I look very closely at Florida, as I look at Georgia, as I look at North Carolina, as I look at Ohio and Iowa and Arizona, Nevada, and then, of course, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and I would even add Minnesota, I see that Donald J.

I think the left is going to be terribly shocked and I actually think, Sean, it comes down to something which is psychological not ideological. In the end, as you watch these two candidates campaigning, I think it's coming down to sort of a bunny rabbit hiding in a basement protected by the news media and a bear who is wandering around on the stage courageously without fear. And if you think the world's dangerous, whether the dangers are riots in Philadelphia or the dangers of the Chinese communists, you probably want to have a bear that's strong enough to defend you not a bunny rabbit that has to be protected by the news media."

The other guy is hiding, frightened, hoping the news media will save him because he can't possibly save himself. And I think that that sinks in and I think that's why you're seeing in virtually every poll that I trust, you're seeing a steady drift towards Trump and away from undecided and away from being sort of leaning towards Biden but not sold."

Let's take a look around west Philadelphia here. This is the main drag, 52nd and Market here. And what you're looking at is a pretty heavy police presence. This is about 100 police officers at this intersection. They got riot gear ready too go. The batons, the shields, the helmets, and they are here ready to prevent any riots or looting that might happen because this area as you remember, Sean, was ripped apart by looters on Monday. We're talking about local, minority owned businesses, just ransacked and destroyed. And keep in mind, this is Walter Wallace's neighborhood. So, it's really hard to understand why these people, these looters are attacking their own. Now, we have seen violent clashes with police. More than 30 cops injured in the last two days. The governor, as you know, has called out the Army National Guard. They are supposed to arrive sometime Friday or Saturday. Hundreds of soldiers getting ready to be deployed to help the local police here to protect property and to prevent any looting from happening. They will provide assistance with that because, really, the police here, Sean, have been the target of a lot of violence. As of right now, nothing like what we have seen in the last two days.

If you broke the law, you went to jail. I know that's tough for the liberals watching. I know this is like a big moment for you. This just, like holy crap, break the law and go to jail, yes, that's how this works. Now, listen, to be clear, when civil unrest breaks out, you're not going to get everyone. You're not going to get every looter, but a looter figures out there's a 10 percent chance he can go to chain, Sean, this is a crazy. And the liberals are going to have tough time with this, there's less likely a chance he's going to loot.

Because Laura Ingraham has been killing it right after this show, and she's got another great show tonight. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
