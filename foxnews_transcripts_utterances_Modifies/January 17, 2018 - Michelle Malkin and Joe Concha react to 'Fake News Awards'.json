      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" We have breaking news at this hour: President Trump has now released his highly anticipated fake news awards. It crashed the GOP.com site in seconds that most traffic they've ever had. We have the report coming up.  Also tonight, the Trump-hating liberal media, they are just refusing to accept the fact that your president is in excellent health and more than fit to serve maybe for two terms. Now, the partisan press, they're going down the conspiratorial rabbit hole and they're now Trump health truthers. I'll explain that and we have all the video proving this insanity.  And CNN use the word hole hundreds of times last week. Tonight, we will unveil our name for that fake news network. Plus, brand new stunning developments about the Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dossier, the anti-Trump dossier. According to \"The Washington Post\" tonight, the FBI shared information with the dossier creator. This is the guy that lied to us, using Russians, Christopher Steele. This is so corrupt.  And Sara Carter reporting that close Clinton advisers Sid Vicious Blumenthal, he was interviewed by the FBI about that phony dossier. But before we get to our opening monologue, Ed Henry is at the White House. He has more on the president's fake news awards.  I literally burst out laughing.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sean, as you noted, there's a lot of interest in this, especially among the president's allies. The website GOP.com crashed when the president tweeted out that this was here. We should know today, Senator Jeff Flake attacked the president for attacking the media, compared him to Stalin. He got strong pushback here from the White House number one and number two the president went right ahead and said, here you go, here are what he's calling the fake news awards.  Number 11, by the way, was Russia collusion. The president says there's no collusion.   Number 10 on that list, as you go through the top 10, \"The New York Times\" falsely claiming on its front page that this White House had hidden a climate change report. That was not true. Number nine: CNN falsely reporting that the former FBI Director James Comey would dispute the president's claim that he had not been told -- his claim that he was told he was under investigation, when, in fact, James Comey had told him that. CNN reported the opposite and had to correct it. Number eight: \"Newsweek\" falsely reporting that the first lady of Poland did not shake the president's hand. There was video proving that that was simply not true. They had taken a screen grab that that showed right before the handshake.   Number seven: CNN making the list again, falsely reporting about Anthony's Scaramucci's meeting with the Russian, retracting it because of what they called a, quote, significant breakdown in the reporting process. Number six: CNN hit by the president again for falsely editing a video to make it appear as you see there that the president had to finally over fed fish during a visit to Japan with their prime minister. Actually, the prime minister had led the way with the feeding and had suggested the president do it. That video was also attacked. Number five is interesting. It was about a rally a political rally the president had in Florida. He's attacking the fact that a reporter, you see him, Dave Weigel, there, had suggested it was not a large crowd. He was using a photograph that was taken that apparently hours before the event.  Number four is interesting because it was literally from day one of the administration. See the bust there of Dr. King. Time Magazine falsely reported that the president had removed that bust from the Oval Office after Barack Obama had put it in the Oval Office. Simply not true. President Trump kept it there. Time Magazine falsely reported otherwise.   Number three: CNN makes another appearance. The president in his words says CNN falsely reported that candidate Donald Trump and his son Donald Trump Jr. had gotten special access to hacked documents from WikiLeaks before they were made public. That was not true. CNN had to walk that back. Now, number two is particularly interesting. It's ABC News's Brian Ross. Remember that he got suspended for this report.",

ABC had to retract it. The problem, of course, is that the stock market had had a bit of a crash after that news, suggesting that there was collusion in the campaign. That was fake.  And number one: this is interesting, The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman on the day of the president's election victory, you see him there, Paul Krugman always touting his economic credentials said that the economy would never recover from the Trump victory. The president cites that as number one in what he's calling the fake news awards, particularly fitting on a day perhaps, Sean, when you saw the stock market reached yet another record high.   But perhaps more importantly than that just that barometer, the fact you had a company like Apple saying that because of the Trump tax cut, they are going to repatriate billions, that's billions with a B, of dollars that they had parked overseas because of the previous tax laws that they're now going to bring back to America and invest here, jobs, build a factory in the United States, put a call center in the United States. Jobs, money pouring back in the United States, something the president touted earlier on Twitter, Sean.",

      "sentences": "All right. So, the sick, the twisted, the mentally unstable anti-Trump media again working itself into a new manufactured frenzy now we have been explaining how the biased press operates in this country for a while.  Here's how it works: they rush from one fabricated meltdown to another and in the process, these brain-dead so-called journalists, they bounce around the same talking points in their little fake news bubble echo-chamber and it becomes a competition to see well who can say the most outlandish the most offensive the most completely false thing about President Trump. It's like they're hypnotized, lobotomized robots that kind of programmed every, wake up, hey, Trump. It's really pathetic and it's sad and it's predictable and they are not serving you the American people. Now, members of the media, sadly, their sheep, they're closed-minded, they have actually convinced themselves, this is that psychotic part, through their own conspiracy theories, that president Trump is, oh, he's suffering from dementia. He has early onset Alzheimer's. He's deranged.   Now, the newest fake news fixation is all about the president's health. Think he'd be happy. And naturally, after the president's doctor told them that he was in excellent -- I repeat -- excellent physical condition, and the shock them, could easily serve for two full terms, the media could not believe it. It goes against everything they have all been telling themselves hour after hour, day after day, week after week, month after month. The press, they can't stand the fact that the president scored a perfect 30 for 30 on a cognitive exam, and my guess is most of the people in the media world would probably fail that test if they took it themselves. I'd love to test them.  Now, before we show you new examples, it's important to highlight just how utterly insane the media was yesterday at the press conference with the president's doctor.

This is important tonight about the phony fake news Hillary Clinton bought and paid for Russian propaganda document and dossier. Sara Carter reporting that longtime Clinton aide adviser Sid Vicious Blumenthal apparently was interviewed by the FBI in 2016 about this fake news anti-Trump dossier. And that's not all, according to The Washington Examiner's Byron York, congressional investigators are now working to determine whether or not the Obama State Department was involved in gathering and circulating fictitious and totally fake information that was found in that dossier. It's getting deeper every night. And according to another new report, an FBI agent exchanged information about the bureau's Russia investigation with the former spy that was getting the phony Russian information, Christopher Steele. He's the guy that put the dossier together. So, you have Steele being told by our FBI about their Russia investigation at the same time Steele is getting paid by Hillary Clinton to dig up phony Russian propaganda source dirt on Donald Trump. You can't make this up.  And we also know from Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, his testimony, that Steele briefed the FBI about the dossier before the election. This is corruption at the highest levels. We've got so much to get to tonight. Joining us with reaction: Fox News national security strategist, Sebastian Gorka, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. On top of the Sid Vicious Blumenthal things, so we now have our FBI, Sara Carter, literally telling. This is new to me. The guy that's paying for Russian lies, salacious details on a candidate to basically fix an election with phony Russian propaganda, they're giving him information?",

Also tonight, the Trump-hating liberal media, they are just refusing to accept the fact that your president is in excellent health and more than fit to serve maybe for two terms. Now, the partisan press, they're going down the conspiratorial rabbit hole and they're now Trump health truthers. I'll explain that and we have all the video proving this insanity. And CNN use the word hole hundreds of times last week. Tonight, we will unveil our name for that fake news network. Plus, brand new stunning developments about the Clinton bought and paid for phony Russian dossier, the anti-Trump dossier. According to \"The Washington Post\" tonight, the FBI shared information with the dossier creator. This is the guy that lied to us, using Russians, Christopher Steele. This is so corrupt. And Sara Carter reporting that close Clinton advisers Sid Vicious Blumenthal, he was interviewed by the FBI about that phony dossier. But before we get to our opening monologue, Ed Henry is at the White House. He has more on the president's fake news awards. I literally burst out laughing."

He got strong pushback here from the White House number one and number two the president went right ahead and said, here you go, here are what he's calling the fake news awards. Number 11, by the way, was Russia collusion. The president says there's no collusion. Number 10 on that list, as you go through the top 10, \"The New York Times\" falsely claiming on its front page that this White House had hidden a climate change report. That was not true."

Actually, the prime minister had led the way with the feeding and had suggested the president do it. That video was also attacked. Number five is interesting. It was about a rally a political rally the president had in Florida. He's attacking the fact that a reporter, you see him, Dave Weigel, there, had suggested it was not a large crowd. He was using a photograph that was taken that apparently hours before the event. Number four is interesting because it was literally from day one of the administration. See the bust there of Dr. King. Time Magazine falsely reported that the president had removed that bust from the Oval Office after Barack Obama had put it in the Oval Office. Simply not true.

The president cites that as number one in what he's calling the fake news awards, particularly fitting on a day perhaps, Sean, when you saw the stock market reached yet another record high. But perhaps more importantly than that just that barometer, the fact you had a company like Apple saying that because of the Trump tax cut, they are going to repatriate billions, that's billions with a B, of dollars that they had parked overseas because of the previous tax laws that they're now going to bring back to America and invest here, jobs, build a factory in the United States, put a call center in the United States.

      "utterance": "they rush from one fabricated meltdown to another and in the process, these brain-dead so-called journalists, they bounce around the same talking points in their little fake news bubble echo-chamber and it becomes a competition to see well who can say the most outlandish the most offensive the most completely false thing about President Trump. It's like they're hypnotized, lobotomized robots that kind of programmed every, wake up, hey, Trump. It's really pathetic and it's sad and it's predictable and they are not serving you the American people. Now, members of the media, sadly, their sheep, they're closed-minded, they have actually convinced themselves, this is that psychotic part, through their own conspiracy theories, that president Trump is, oh, he's suffering from dementia. He has early onset Alzheimer's. He's deranged. Now, the newest fake news fixation is all about the president's health. Think he'd be happy. And naturally, after the president's doctor told them that he was in excellent -- I repeat -- excellent physical condition, and the shock them, could easily serve for two full terms, the media could not believe it. It goes against everything they have all been telling themselves hour after hour, day after day, week after week, month after month. The press, they can't stand the fact that the president scored a perfect 30 for 30 on a cognitive exam, and my guess is most of the people in the media world would probably fail that test if they took it themselves. I'd love to test them. Now, before we show you new examples, it's important to highlight just how utterly insane the media was yesterday at the press conference with the president's doctor.

Sara Carter reporting that longtime Clinton aide adviser Sid Vicious Blumenthal apparently was interviewed by the FBI in 2016 about this fake news anti-Trump dossier. And that's not all, according to The Washington Examiner's Byron York, congressional investigators are now working to determine whether or not the Obama State Department was involved in gathering and circulating fictitious and totally fake information that was found in that dossier. It's getting deeper every night. And according to another new report, an FBI agent exchanged information about the bureau's Russia investigation with the former spy that was getting the phony Russian information, Christopher Steele. He's the guy that put the dossier together. So, you have Steele being told by our FBI about their Russia investigation at the same time Steele is getting paid by Hillary Clinton to dig up phony Russian propaganda source dirt on Donald Trump. You can't make this up. And we also know from Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, his testimony, that Steele briefed the FBI about the dossier before the election.

Sean, the FBI usually does not share information with people that they're interviewing and if you -- if Steele is delivering information to the FBI, it should be the FBI questioning Steele, not Steele questioning the FBI. I think what's interesting to me is after Steele got this information, where did Steele go with it? I mean, this is a question that needs to be answered. Did Steele approach Papadopoulos?

And I'm not talking about the all the spying the Obama administration did on journalists from Cheryl Atkinson to the Associated Press to Fox News.

A lot of progress had been made, we now found out the uranium one in fact has been the DOJ investigation, nobody knew for months. We have an 11 count indictment at the end of last week. Then we now know that the email server scandal were the fix was in with Comey and Strzok, that is now back before congress. Now the dossier is blowing up and next week I'm told we will have news to shock the conscious. Here's my question. You have Hillary and we now know rigged primary against Bernie we have no shot and Donna Brazile confirms it. Then we have her pay for Russian lies and propaganda to influence the American people and rig that election and then had Comey and Strzok, because they so wanted her they rigged investigation, and an exoneration before investigation. With all we talked about in the media, there's very few of us discussing this. And I don't mind being out on a limb. I have done it my whole career.

How can the \"Washington Post\", or \"New York Times\", gets up in the morning and look at themselves and not cover this? I mean, there is something really that is almost pathological, because as you're pointing out, week after week, more and more things are coming out and it's not just hearsay or investigative reporting, as you point out, an 11 count indictment and frankly, because I had talked to you earlier today I talked to business people a while ago that said to me oh, well, how do you think all this will play out and they clearly were thinking only of Trump. I think 11 count indictment on uranium one probably doesn't bode well for Hillary. They know nothing about her. They were shock that it occurred. And I think you begin to see the pieces come together in what I think will only be unbelievably big scandal and makes me feel that defeat of Hillary even more important than electing Trump, defeating Hillary so the corruption could not go on and not be noticed. All of this at the end of the road."
