Yesterday, President Biden signed four executive actions based on racial equity. Focusing on systemic race and private prisons, housing, COVID relief, and tribal relations. Apparently, systemic racism is like oxygen, it's everywhere you look. And the solution is equity not equality, equity.   Even Joe is using the word. Does he know what it means? Who knows? Which means it's time for --",

      "sentences": "Not crazy about the hair. Equality as you know, means you have the opportunity to try something even if you are bad at it. I could try to play basketball, I will suck. But in America I have an opportunity to try just like I have the opportunity to become an electrical engineer, a pipe fitter or a Peloton instructor.   I would suck at those too, but it's against the law to discriminate against me. It's about equality of opportunity not equality of outcome which is what equity promises, equality of outcomes. A reserved space based on the single variable of systemic discrimination. Your equity becomes an entitlement.  So, even though I suck at basketball there should be a place for me in the NBA. Equity not only ignores competence, it reduces the diversity of talent that comes from opportunity, as well as ignoring how people choose different things. Shall we create female quotas for loggers and loafers and garbage collectors and other male dominated jobs even if women don't want them.   You know, workplace death for men is 10 times higher than women. Do activists seek equity there or it's just the cush jobs they're after? And of course, with equity you will need someone to decide who gets what. And that's what this is really about power. The power to remake society, to placate the critical theorists who work with only one variable, revenge.  It's the furthest you can get from unity not that Joe would know or care.  All right. Juan, I hope you appreciated my essay. My question to you is if equity is about allocating resources to create equal outcomes how is that possible when every single person is different? You are going to need laws, quotas and force like you would have seen in USSR during the communist era.  If you want everybody to equal you need force.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST:  I will tell you how I see this, Greg, because it's really quite different. I mean, to me, to my mind. Let's just look at this this way. You know, if you look at where the cities in America put incinerators where they put dumps. You know, even when they build highway it always goes through minority neighborhoods, poor neighborhoods in case the highway is cutting them off from downtown and much of the economic activity of those places.   You think about things like government assistance for housing, mortgage assistance after World War II. Student aid programs after World War II. Even farm aid, farm bureau programs discriminated against black people in this country's history.   So, Biden, to my mind, Greg, it's not about guaranteeing any individual outcome. What it's really saying is, we need to make sure that the starting point for everyone is level, that we are on a level playing field. I mean, this extends to childhood, poor where quality schools are, higher levels of unemployment and scarcity of jobs.   Again, to me, this is really the problem that Joe Biden is talking about when he talks about equity. Making sure government is playing fair for all people. And you know, to me, it's a painful thing because it's plain for me to see in my life, I think it should be plain for everybody to see.  You know, and I think when you talk about like how police treat black people and stuff like that, it just, it burns and hurts deeply when others say there's nothing going on here and it's just so plain for me to see.",

I look at this across the country and think K through 12 education it is not up to speed, especially after the pandemic. But that's how you get to equality and equity. Last thing I would say is, if you believe that America is an exceptional nation as many people in America believe, but also so many people around the world. They believe America is an exceptional nation, and why? Because at least in America you would have a shot.

      "sentences": "Well, Juan made a very convincing case, Greg. But I think you made a better one. And here is why. If you read Biden's speech from yesterday in print what he says is exactly what you said. And it's very slick.  He says that all men are created equal. But because of slavery and historical injustices some of us are not equal, therefore we have to impose equity. We have to impose fair outcome in order to address these historical problems. And if you disagree with any of that, then you are discriminating against people. And he put Susan Rice on point for this. And he even spells out who he is talking about, racial minorities, religious minorities. Indians and people that are in protected classes. And he spells out how he is going to do it, Greg. He says housing is a right, free housing. He says he wants to have universal pre-K. He says he wants certain people to have access to certain loans, certain universities get special perks. He says he wants to federalize the voting system in this country. He wants to guarantee certain levels of health care. So, if you are looking at that, that looks like back door socialism. And kind of looks like to some people like, it's back door reparations. I don't think you can say that yet because it hasn't been implemented yet, but the way it's so vague, it leads you to believe, yes, I'm for this, I'm for that, I want everyone to be prosperous.  But when you see that Susan Rice is in charge and she's picking winners and losers with their lawyers and the bureaucrats and she's going to destroy you if you get in your way that doesn't sound very unifying. And the federal government is so big and so powerful and has the arm of the Department of Justice. This affects hiring. This affects firing. This affects buying, selling, contracts, admission. This affects everything. So, when you look back and you see this might destroy the dollar because it's going to spend trillions of dollars. Why are we doing this, Greg? Donald Trump's America first agenda lowered the black poverty rate to the first time under 20 percent, had the black jobless to the lowest level ever. Exploded wages to the highest levels in 60 years. Why wouldn't you want that capitalistic approach? Because they don't want capitalism, they want socialism. They want them to be in charge. And that's the problem. It's not going to work. It's going to make them feel better but it's not going to work.",

And for me when you look at it and break it down by population and where these problems are happening it looks more like a political class issue than it does a race issue. And there is no accountability for the federal government spending trillions of dollars throughout the decades on these issues with no real return on investments.

And the union is definitely not communicating well. And the Biden administration wants to get this COVID relief bill done. They have another, what, $160 billion in the hopper here for teachers unions. They need the teachers unions to be supportive of the effort. But I think that this is really going to cause a huge clash. It would be, to me, I think that teachers are essential workers. We're seeing other problems not just the fact that students can't learn.  I read a father said that his kids were completely zoomed out. Like that was it. Like there's nothing more. So they've lost a year the competitiveness that they will have to try -- I would call it a competitiveness gap because they've not been able to learn for a year, it's a competitive world. They are going to have to backtrack. The fact that the teachers union will not just allow their teachers to get back because the science says that we can't.

I mean, I actually have learned more in the pandemic from YouTube than from 12 years of school from eighth grade to high school. I mean, from first grade. I learned so much on my butt on watching YouTube. And I think I came to the conclusion that the real problem with the education system is the delivery system. You know, the teachers arguing, you know, for not teaching, they are actually arguing for their own extinction, their own irrelevance. So, I do think it could be an opportunity for people to seek an alternative. Never let a catastrophe go to waste. And you know my prescription is to adopt the Peloton model for presenting information in training can be a really good thing. I'm for education but I'm for, I believe we can do it more efficiently. Now the thing is, I just want to -- why aren't they following the science? Right? They know the facts that if the kids are in school, they are less likely to get sick if they are not in school. The reason is that they are scared. They are scared of the media. The leaders are scared of the media, they are scared of the unions. Which why, I think it was like 10 months ago I said that we needed a moratorium on finger pointing, because the fear of blame will keep leaders from leaders. And now you see a lot of people that are paralyzed by the fear of Twitter mobs and actual mobs for that matter. You end up in this prison of two ideas which is you either do school or you don't when in fact, as Jesse says, there is a million things in between. You can go to school and have only safety measures and they are actually safer there than they would be in a stuffy humid apartment like mine.",

Yesterday, President Biden signed four executive actions based on racial equity. Focusing on systemic race and private prisons, housing, COVID relief, and tribal relations. Apparently, systemic racism is like oxygen, it's everywhere you look. And the solution is equity not equality, equity. Even Joe is using the word. Does he know what it means? Who knows? Which means it's time for --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Not crazy about the hair. Equality as you know, means you have the opportunity to try something even if you are bad at it. I could try to play basketball, I will suck. But in America I have an opportunity to try just like I have the opportunity to become an electrical engineer, a pipe fitter or a Peloton instructor. I would suck at those too, but it's against the law to discriminate against me. It's about equality of opportunity not equality of outcome which is what equity promises, equality of outcomes. A reserved space based on the single variable of systemic discrimination. Your equity becomes an entitlement. So, even though I suck at basketball there should be a place for me in the NBA. Equity not only ignores competence, it reduces the diversity of talent that comes from opportunity, as well as ignoring how people choose different things. Shall we create female quotas for loggers and loafers and garbage collectors and other male dominated jobs even if women don't want them. You know, workplace death for men is 10 times higher than women. Do activists seek equity there or it's just the cush jobs they're after? And of course, with equity you will need someone to decide who gets what. And that's what this is really about power. The power to remake society, to placate the critical theorists who work with only one variable, revenge. It's the furthest you can get from unity not that Joe would know or care. All right. Juan, I hope you appreciated my essay. My question to you is if equity is about allocating resources to create equal outcomes how is that possible when every single person is different? You are going to need laws, quotas and force like you would have seen in USSR during the communist era. If you want everybody to equal you need force. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST:  I will tell you how I see this, Greg, because it's really quite different. I mean, to me, to my mind. Let's just look at this this way. You know, if you look at where the cities in America put incinerators where they put dumps. You know, even when they build highway it always goes through minority neighborhoods, poor neighborhoods in case the highway is cutting them off from downtown and much of the economic activity of those places. You think about things like government assistance for housing, mortgage assistance after World War II. Student aid programs after World War II. Even farm aid, farm bureau programs discriminated against black people in this country's history. So, Biden, to my mind, Greg, it's not about guaranteeing any individual outcome. What it's really saying is, we need to make sure that the starting point for everyone is level, that we are on a level playing field. I mean, this extends to childhood, poor where quality schools are, higher levels of unemployment and scarcity of jobs. Again, to me, this is really the problem that Joe Biden is talking about when he talks about equity. Making sure government is playing fair for all people. And you know, to me, it's a painful thing because it's plain for me to see in my life, I think it should be plain for everybody to see. You know, and I think when you talk about like how police treat black people and stuff like that, it just, it burns and hurts deeply when others say there's nothing going on here and it's just so plain for me to see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think the thing is that everything you just mentioned and the front of that commentary, I would absolutely agree with. You are talking about everybody having equal opportunity. But equity built into this idea of outcome equality, which is absolutely impossible."

That's what we all want and discrimination is illegal and it should be, Dana, no matter how hard you try to make it legal. So, Dana, here's what -- this is a different part of the equity/equality thing that drives me crazy is that, we talk a lot about female equality in certain jobs.

I look at this across the country and think K through 12 education it is not up to speed, especially after the pandemic. But that's how you get to equality and equity. Last thing I would say is, if you believe that America is an exceptional nation as many people in America believe, but also so many people around the world. They believe America is an exceptional nation, and why? Because at least in America you would have a shot. Everyone would have a shot to try hard if you come here and you have a dream, you have a business idea. You can make it here unlike in many other places around the world, most other places around the world."

Was my instruction helpful?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, Juan made a very convincing case, Greg. But I think you made a better one. And here is why. If you read Biden's speech from yesterday in print what he says is exactly what you said. And it's very slick. He says that all men are created equal. But because of slavery and historical injustices some of us are not equal, therefore we have to impose equity. We have to impose fair outcome in order to address these historical problems. And if you disagree with any of that, then you are discriminating against people. And he put Susan Rice on point for this. And he even spells out who he is talking about, racial minorities, religious minorities. Indians and people that are in protected classes. And he spells out how he is going to do it, Greg. He says housing is a right, free housing. He says he wants to have universal pre-K. He says he wants certain people to have access to certain loans, certain universities get special perks. He says he wants to federalize the voting system in this country. He wants to guarantee certain levels of health care. So, if you are looking at that, that looks like back door socialism. And kind of looks like to some people like, it's back door reparations. I don't think you can say that yet because it hasn't been implemented yet, but the way it's so vague, it leads you to believe, yes, I'm for this, I'm for that, I want everyone to be prosperous. But when you see that Susan Rice is in charge and she's picking winners and losers with their lawyers and the bureaucrats and she's going to destroy you if you get in your way that doesn't sound very unifying. And the federal government is so big and so powerful and has the arm of the Department of Justice. This affects hiring. This affects firing. This affects buying, selling, contracts, admission. This affects everything. So, when you look back and you see this might destroy the dollar because it's going to spend trillions of dollars. Why are we doing this, Greg? Donald Trump's America first agenda lowered the black poverty rate to the first time under 20 percent, had the black jobless to the lowest level ever. Exploded wages to the highest levels in 60 years. Why wouldn't you want that capitalistic approach? Because they don't want capitalism, they want socialism. They want them to be in charge. And that's the problem. It's not going to work. It's going to make them feel better but it's not going to work."

But we've seen the mayor of Baltimore who is black. The mayor of Atlanta is black. The mayor of Chicago is black. And for me when you look at it and break it down by population and where these problems are happening it looks more like a political class issue than it does a race issue. And there is no accountability for the federal government spending trillions of dollars throughout the decades on these issues with no real return on investments. And then of course you have the teachers unions not allowing for any kind of school choice which just enables this vicious cycle of poverty in these places where the federal government pretends that they are doing something about it."

So, they could have had even more back then. But remember it was more important as Nancy Pelosi said to figure out a way to get Biden elected than it was to do COVID relief. And now you have a situation where parents are going to be pitted against the teachers. The teachers I don't think are being well represented by the union. And the union is definitely not communicating well. And the Biden administration wants to get this COVID relief bill done. They have another, what, $160 billion in the hopper here for teachers unions. They need the teachers unions to be supportive of the effort. But I think that this is really going to cause a huge clash. It would be, to me, I think that teachers are essential workers. We're seeing other problems not just the fact that students can't learn. I read a father said that his kids were completely zoomed out. Like that was it. Like there's nothing more. So they've lost a year the competitiveness that they will have to try -- I would call it a competitiveness gap because they've not been able to learn for a year, it's a competitive world. They are going to have to backtrack. The fact that the teachers union will not just allow their teachers to get back because the science says that we can't. I'm sure somebody else is going to bring that up. That was just another thing last night. Republicans have found an issue. If they want to find a way to win back the suburbs, this could be it."

So, I don't think there is -- I don't who it is that would say, let's not have kids back in school. But I think it's also fair to say, you know, Joe Biden, the president said that he wants schools open in the first 100 days that he is in office.

But teachers, it seems to me, you know, we are talking about safety protocols, I don't see why they don't deserve to be safe. And the CDC says with the right protocols, the right safety protocols that can happen. But now you talk about Chicago. So, let's look at Chicago. One hundred eighty- six people lost to COVID in the last seven days, Katie, 11,000 new infection cases in the last week.

You know, to stick the kids in the head and take their temperature, put some air fitters on the ventilation system? OK. That's a million. Where is the rest of the $49 billion? Honestly, I'm looking at graph, Katie. You are going to launder that kind of cash through state and local education, bureaucrats and expect no one to pinch that? I'd people looking at the superintendent's cars last year. Did he just buy a vacation home? Who did he give the contract to? I mean, you remember during the Iraq war that the toilet that cost $30,000? You're going to find that out again.

I learned so much on my butt on watching YouTube. And I think I came to the conclusion that the real problem with the education system is the delivery system. You know, the teachers arguing, you know, for not teaching, they are actually arguing for their own extinction, their own irrelevance. So, I do think it could be an opportunity for people to seek an alternative. Never let a catastrophe go to waste. And you know my prescription is to adopt the Peloton model for presenting information in training can be a really good thing. I'm for education but I'm for, I believe we can do it more efficiently. Now the thing is, I just want to -- why aren't they following the science? Right? They know the facts that if the kids are in school, they are less likely to get sick if they are not in school. The reason is that they are scared. They are scared of the media. The leaders are scared of the media, they are scared of the unions. Which why, I think it was like 10 months ago I said that we needed a moratorium on finger pointing, because the fear of blame will keep leaders from leaders. And now you see a lot of people that are paralyzed by the fear of Twitter mobs and actual mobs for that matter. You end up in this prison of two ideas which is you either do school or you don't when in fact, as Jesse says, there is a million things in between.

It used to -- there were more wildfires, I think, five to 10 times more area in the early 1900s than there are now. And the present wildfires that we're experiencing now are due to forest management and imperfect zoning. That's been well documented. Also, there are 17 times more homes in high-risk areas for wildfire risk. And flood zones haven't really moved but people have moved into flood zones, and that creates a problem. I think the point is -- one of the bigger points, though, is that I just saw Schumer declare -- wants to declare a climate a national emergency. Where the hell has he been? We are in a national emergency. The guy just wants more money and more power and more control over people. It's like this shutdown just tickled their thirst for even more draconian manipulation.

Do the research. They come over here from China. They're brought over here by fossil fuels. They're built with -- you know, built with minerals that are mined out of the ground using fossil fuels.

If you realize that math is actually a discovery of an existing language, a language that's there all over the place, holy crap, then that blows your mind. It's the language of the -- it's the language of the universe. Like, math is responsible for everything in your room right now. Every single thing is based on everything fitting together with numbers. That's a language. Who wrote that language? We didn't write it. It's there."

I mean, people would send her the final SATs to check. I mean, she's pretty good. And she now has trouble with the grandkids because it's taught in a different manner. So, once you get beyond like, you know, eighth and 10th grade, it's pretty tough."

And I've been out to dinner with him. He doesn't know what 20 percent is. I've seen him tip. He has no idea what 20 percent is."

He has a great book called drug use for grownups. It's obviously about drug legalization and whatnot.

All right, now this. Greg's reason for civil war. We got a lot of problems in this country, but nothing is as bad as this. Take a look at this. This is Kraft mac and cheese Valentine pink flavored macaroni, OK. It's a limited-edition mac and cheese dish that comes with a candy flavor packet that turns its noodles pink and sweets. All right, this is horrible. I will start the civil war if this actually becomes a regular thing."

All right, so everyone knows that Kamala Harris is now but first woman vice president, but I don't think everyone's paying attention to what's going on in the world of sports. Take a look at Jennifer King. The Washington football team just named her assistant position coach. She's the second female coach in the NFL, first black woman coach. Also, take a look at Sarah Thomas. She'll be the first woman to officiate the Super Bowl. She's been in the league since 2015. Also, take a look at Becky Hammon. A month ago, she became the first woman to act as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs during an NBA regular season game. I didn't even mention baseball now has a female general manager. It's a new era. As Bob Dylan would say, the times, they are changing."

They offer free food to people in need, as well as its students and staff. It's Linda Tutt High School. It was founded in partnership with local nonprofits to help students whose families were struggling because of the pandemic. And when it opened in November, it was only available for students and staff. But now it opened to the community. They have produce, milk, eggs, pasta, peanut butter, etcetera. And then, the high school students learn how to run a business by being there in the store. So, the more points they received, the more merchandise they can buy, which is pretty cool. A way to learn and help."
