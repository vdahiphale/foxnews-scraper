It's a fight to the finish with the election just two weeks away. President Trump is continuing to campaign like crazy. He's holding another rally in the key battleground of Pennsylvania later tonight.  While Sleepy Joe Biden is taking a much different approach, the former VP is off the trail again today to prepare for Thursday's debate. It comes as Democrats worry they could be heading for a 2016 repeat. Early voting continues to surge. Over 35 million Americans have cast ballots so far, and President Trump says Republicans are in a strong position in some very key swing states.  As for Thursday's big debate, the commission making a controversial last- minute change by introducing a mute button, here is President Trump sounding off on it all.",

And then a quick note about the polls nationally, we often talk about whether the results can be trusted. But I think the trends themselves are really important.

So it's like I can agree with Juan and go why is he doing this, why is he doing this. But the fact is he usually figures it out and gets it right. The thing that I don't understand is, like, you know, Joe Biden, like, he essentially just drops out like a witness in a mafia trial. So it's, like, there is a mute button, but it's being run by the Democratic Party.  They are just muting him. And yet, he is still tweeting. Like, if you can tweet, you can then walk around and do stuff, unless it's not him tweeting, could be the Russians. But I just -- you did bring up Hunter Biden, so this is like a real -- you know, 2020 is a contrast in transparency. First, you have a candidate who is barely pretending to be the top of the ticket.  We know it's really about Kamala. Then you have the same candidate that is using a debate. He's using a debate to cover the fact that he's hiding from the public over these damaging emails involving Hiding Biden -- Hunter Biden and of course, the fact that, you know, he was promising 10 percent to the big man, which by the way, you know, it would be great.

You know -- and I am curious. Does that change this time around? Will the Democratic voters in Philly turnout for Biden when they wouldn't for Hillary Clinton?

And the economy, that is a little different thing this year. We're dealing with a pandemic. That is different. I also just want to mention one other thing.  The RNC did a $25 million ad buy targeting seniors. One of things that's we have seen is that seniors have softened on Trump, especially when it comes to COVID. But this ad buy is very interesting and the places where they are targeting it. And they're really focusing in on Medicare for all, which seniors don't want. They are talking about things like government takeover of health care. They don't want that.   And so you see in a place like North Carolina where you have Cal Cunningham, the Democrat's got a sexting scandal going on. Some seniors have started to come back to the Republicans. And can this type of a surgical approach of a targeted ad buy to seniors in North Carolina on this issue, can that be a difference, because that could be a close election in that state.",

This is where all the donor's money went to the Biden's, and now they are worried.  So they're basically acting like communist China in trying to suppress it. But the more they suppress the story, the more suspicious it is, the more interest this is. This is getting kicked around all over the internet. People are emailing each other. It's all over talk radio. Seniors are very interested in this story. Everybody knows someone like Hunter. Everybody knows in a small town.

But it doesn't appear that that's what they are going to do. And, you know, he will have four days to get ready for an answer. And so I'm assuming that he will have it. And then you'll have the tech companies having to answer to Congress not long after that. And they don't have friends on the Republican or the Democratic side. And the Republicans are going to say we want to be treated fairly. They feel like they are not being treated fairly at all. And in fact, you know, for example, Joni Ernst of Iowa, she's in a tough re-election battle for the Senate seat there. She -- there was a fake thing that went out that said that the Iowa Farm Bureau had pulled their support from Joni Ernst. It was fake, but it went around and around and around and around before they got it taken down. And in the correction that the Iowa Farm Bureau put out, it barely has any re-tweets. So I think that conservatives are going to demand some equal treatment by these tech companies. If they can get it, it's going to be a really fascinating debate. That's going to take for a long time. And then when President Trump is asking Bill Barr to act, he's pushing the attorney general. That doesn't work very well.

So the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that compared to this economy in 2030, right, that there would also be just under five million Americans less in the workforce, that there would be $2.6 trillion less in the GDP in addition to that 6,500 less in the median income. And I grew up watching my family's businesses get choked by state and federal regulations. I've seen, literally for decades firsthand how regular Americans, the ripple effect, how their businesses struggle because of the tax consequences and the over-regulation, and how it all comes together. And I think, you know, farmers can be small business owners and middle- class Americans can be employers, and all of these things are interrelated. So, I think it doesn't do any American who really is trying to vote earnestly with their family's interests best in mind, it doesn't do them any justice to talk about this one point at a time as if it's not related.

New research found that 97 percent of all the jokes told about candidates last month by Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon were about Trump, leaving a staggeringly huge three percent told about the other guy whose name escapes them. You might have seen him on a missing poster on a phone pole. You just called a four-day lid or what Hunter calls a bender. Still, it's good to see three percent of late-night comedy is not in lockstep with the dull media majority, and that they aren't just performing for half their audience and insulting the other half. Remember when comics took risks? Now, they just take up time pandering to their peers fearful of rejection, providing jokes that 99.9 percent of their fellow entertainers and media allies all embrace. The upside, they need not worry about losing a job, a speech gig, or a party invite. The downside, there is edges of my pillow ad. But who's complaining this researcher -- research is it new. And not only does this lopsided lockstep leave a lane open for me, you admire others for making their own lane too. Johnny Rotten, for example, the original punk just endorsed Trump. 50 Cent, no conformist himself, did the same thing. True rebels are people who leave the pack and afraid of the abuse they'll get. Of course, Republicans are always targeted more because late night writers are libs. But what happens if Biden wins and Trump leaves? I guess we'll know that bridge when we come to it. It'll be the one with all the comedy writers jumping off it. So, Jesse, this is not -- like every four years they -- or maybe two years, they count the number of jokes. They -- it's always the same.

It's a fight to the finish with the election just two weeks away. President Trump is continuing to campaign like crazy. He's holding another rally in the key battleground of Pennsylvania later tonight. While Sleepy Joe Biden is taking a much different approach, the former VP is off the trail again today to prepare for Thursday's debate. It comes as Democrats worry they could be heading for a 2016 repeat. Early voting continues to surge. Over 35 million Americans have cast ballots so far, and President Trump says Republicans are in a strong position in some very key swing states. As for Thursday's big debate, the commission making a controversial last- minute change by introducing a mute button, here is President Trump sounding off on it all."

And I understand that. But I also understand that as he is going down the line and issuing lies, you know, generally, it's OK to, you know, really attack that."

We know that he won Pennsylvania in 2016 by 44,000 votes, but he still got 11,000 more votes in that county then Romney in 2012, so just that goes to show how important that part of the state is to his state-wide victory. And then a quick note about the polls nationally, we often talk about whether the results can be trusted. But I think the trends themselves are really important. Incredible polls today came out and had them within two points of Biden nationally. Those same polls a month ago had Biden ahead by six points, so it shows just how tightening the race has become."

But you know what, you know what, I think you hit on something that -- we said this yesterday, Jesse. I am nervous, because I think the only real poll is Election Day. But I must say that among political people who I chat up, there's this thought that what is Trump doing? Why is he doing what he's doing? I mean, people say he is attacking Fauci, who is very popular. He's attacking the debate moderator. He's attacking the debate topics. He says he doesn't like the debate topics. Then it's not only that, then he goes after Hunter Biden. None of this it seems is going to move the needle or says to people this is really important to me and my family.

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Everything that everybody that Juan has just said and resided six or seven things. You could've said in 2016. And he proved that his strategy, in which it seemed like everything he was doing was wrong allowed him to win. So the thing is you can be Frank Luntz and go this is the worst thing I've ever seen, but you didn't win, Frank. And I was wrong. So it's like I can agree with Juan and go why is he doing this, why is he doing this. But the fact is he usually figures it out and gets it right. The thing that I don't understand is, like, you know, Joe Biden, like, he essentially just drops out like a witness in a mafia trial. So it's, like, there is a mute button, but it's being run by the Democratic Party. They are just muting him. And yet, he is still tweeting. Like, if you can tweet, you can then walk around and do stuff, unless it's not him tweeting, could be the Russians. But I just -- you did bring up Hunter Biden, so this is like a real -- you know, 2020 is a contrast in transparency. First, you have a candidate who is barely pretending to be the top of the ticket. We know it's really about Kamala. Then you have the same candidate that is using a debate. He's using a debate to cover the fact that he's hiding from the public over these damaging emails involving Hiding Biden -- Hunter Biden and of course, the fact that, you know, he was promising 10 percent to the big man, which by the way, you know, it would be great. Donald Trump should just keep referring to Joe as the big man in the debate. What do you say, big man? Just to see -- just to get him a little - -"

So that's where President Obama is going. And we know that Philly did not turnout for Hillary Clinton in the way that she needed them to, obviously, because President Trump was able to win. You know -- and I am curious. Does that change this time around? Will the Democratic voters in Philly turnout for Biden when they wouldn't for Hillary Clinton? And does Barack Obama's appearance there -- I remember in 2016, the last campaign event that Barack Obama did was in Philly."

      "utterance": "Yes. So I don't know. I do think that we have to remind ourselves that 2020 is a different race than 2016. Incumbents usually win. And the economy, that is a little different thing this year. We're dealing with a pandemic. That is different. I also just want to mention one other thing. The RNC did a $25 million ad buy targeting seniors. One of things that's we have seen is that seniors have softened on Trump, especially when it comes to COVID. But this ad buy is very interesting and the places where they are targeting it. And they're really focusing in on Medicare for all, which seniors don't want. They are talking about things like government takeover of health care. They don't want that. And so you see in a place like North Carolina where you have Cal Cunningham, the Democrat's got a sexting scandal going on. Some seniors have started to come back to the Republicans. And can this type of a surgical approach of a targeted ad buy to seniors in North Carolina on this issue, can that be a difference, because that could be a close election in that state."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

But we do have those emails with the receipts from Hunter, and the FBI has the laptop so they can't be asked (ph). And the receipts literally say yeah, kickback 10 from the big guy. So there is a kickback of Chinese money, potentially. There is influence peddling. And he's selling foreign policy for profit. That we know. Now the fact that they have all circled the wagons here, big tech and the media shows that this is a terminal threat to the Biden campaign. This is where all the donor's money went to the Biden's, and now they are worried. So they're basically acting like communist China in trying to suppress it. But the more they suppress the story, the more suspicious it is, the more interest this is. This is getting kicked around all over the internet. People are emailing each other. It's all over talk radio. Seniors are very interested in this story. Everybody knows someone like Hunter. Everybody knows in a small town. You have a family like this that continues to get rich on their name and they continue to be protected. Remember, Joe Biden from Delaware, the smallest state is run by the DuPont's. It's run by credit card companies and the banks. He's been there for decades. He's been protected. He's been doing their bidding. Same thing now, who is he getting money from? More billionaires are giving money to him than Donald Trump. He's getting from big tech, Wall Street, Silicon Valley, big pharma. He's totally in control. And they know when they give him the money he's going to open the borders so they get the cheap -- he's going to let the jobs go to China and he's going to give them that corporate welfare. And that is why Trump's style (ph) is on it. He is on offense now. Biden is on defense, and it's starting -- to Greg, move the needle."

      "utterance": "Well, you know, my instincts as a communications person would be that you would at least want to answer some of these questions, even may be on background before the debate on Thursday night. But it doesn't appear that that's what they are going to do. And, you know, he will have four days to get ready for an answer. And so I'm assuming that he will have it. And then you'll have the tech companies having to answer to Congress not long after that. And they don't have friends on the Republican or the Democratic side. And the Republicans are going to say we want to be treated fairly. They feel like they are not being treated fairly at all. And in fact, you know, for example, Joni Ernst of Iowa, she's in a tough re-election battle for the Senate seat there. She -- there was a fake thing that went out that said that the Iowa Farm Bureau had pulled their support from Joni Ernst. It was fake, but it went around and around and around and around before they got it taken down. And in the correction that the Iowa Farm Bureau put out, it barely has any re-tweets. So I think that conservatives are going to demand some equal treatment by these tech companies. If they can get it, it's going to be a really fascinating debate. That's going to take for a long time. And then when President Trump is asking Bill Barr to act, he's pushing the attorney general. That doesn't work very well. So I think that Bill Barr probably just doesn't really react to things like that."

And yet, they can't be bothered with this story. They can't even shore up the illusion that they might be objective or unbiased. This is a really simple thing for them to do, to follow up. Then you get this letter that is signed by Brennan and Clapper, right? And it's about -- clearly this is Russian disinformation, but we don't have any evidence of that. They say they don't have any evidence. Just like the three-year Russian disinformation campaign that they thrusted on America since 2016. And so we are listening to these clowns who totally screwed us over once again. And the media just sits on the sidelines and pretends like nothing is happening. That's the problem that we have here.

If you listen to the hard left, they are telling you what they are going to do to you. This -- they are not interested in a difference of opinion anymore. After the election, it's about retribution. Economist, leftist, Robert Rice tweeted that post election. We are going to name every person from officials to executives to supporters who quote, \"enabled this catastrophe.\" What is he implying? It sounds like if you are not part of his group, they are going to hunt you down. And it leaves a very vague -- just a Democratic -- no, that is -- he calls it the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, so otherwise known as a lynch mob or a witch trial. You can combine the two.

So it's not just about consequences. It's also about their proposed regulations too. So the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that compared to this economy in 2030, right, that there would also be just under five million Americans less in the workforce, that there would be $2.6 trillion less in the GDP in addition to that 6,500 less in the median income. And I grew up watching my family's businesses get choked by state and federal regulations. I've seen, literally for decades firsthand how regular Americans, the ripple effect, how their businesses struggle because of the tax consequences and the over-regulation, and how it all comes together. And I think, you know, farmers can be small business owners and middle- class Americans can be employers, and all of these things are interrelated. So, I think it doesn't do any American who really is trying to vote earnestly with their family's interests best in mind, it doesn't do them any justice to talk about this one point at a time as if it's not related. Those tax consequences and the regulation are huge."

Obama-Biden raised taxes already and the middle class got hoes. They barely got a raise in eight years. Middle-class have gotten an $8,000 raise so far under Trump. Remember how they promised all those green jobs, all those shovel-ready jobs, those never materialized. Do you remember filling up your gas tank under Obama-Biden $3.50 a gallon? It's been $2.50 under Donald Trump. His green New Deal I think delivers $75,000 additional in taxes to middle-class families. It will be a hellhole.

I think what the President said today was a great way to just distill down the closing argument. And he says it in a way that only Donald Trump can say but it was quite memorable.

No, this is actually -- there are actually scientists involved in this and they have to aim and putting it through. The other point I would make about Cuomo is that he's been wrong with almost every facet of this. He's been able to change when you realize this is -- it's wrong and people die.

New research found that 97 percent of all the jokes told about candidates last month by Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon were about Trump, leaving a staggeringly huge three percent told about the other guy whose name escapes them. You might have seen him on a missing poster on a phone pole. You just called a four-day lid or what Hunter calls a bender. Still, it's good to see three percent of late-night comedy is not in lockstep with the dull media majority, and that they aren't just performing for half their audience and insulting the other half. Remember when comics took risks? Now, they just take up time pandering to their peers fearful of rejection, providing jokes that 99.9 percent of their fellow entertainers and media allies all embrace. The upside, they need not worry about losing a job, a speech gig, or a party invite. The downside, there is edges of my pillow ad. But who's complaining this researcher -- research is it new. And not only does this lopsided lockstep leave a lane open for me, you admire others for making their own lane too. Johnny Rotten, for example, the original punk just endorsed Trump. 50 Cent, no conformist himself, did the same thing. True rebels are people who leave the pack and afraid of the abuse they'll get. Of course, Republicans are always targeted more because late night writers are libs. But what happens if Biden wins and Trump leaves? I guess we'll know that bridge when we come to it. It'll be the one with all the comedy writers jumping off it. So, Jesse, this is not -- like every four years they -- or maybe two years, they count the number of jokes. They -- it's always the same.
