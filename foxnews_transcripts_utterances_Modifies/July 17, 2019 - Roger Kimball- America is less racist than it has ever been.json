We will be taking portions of it live, especially the newsworthy moments. Right now, he is talking about the four radical freshman Democrats, Antifa, and more broadly, the direction the Democrats are moving. We are going to go back and listen in. It's interesting. We will back in a moment.",

So for the past four days, as you well know, he has been embroiled in a remarkably nasty, and yet at times amusing Twitter battle with the foremost left-wing Democrats in the House of Representatives. That would be Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib.  Now, Democrats and their servants in the media have told us that it is inherently racist to criticize these politicians given the way they look. The President clearly disagrees with that. We know because he has been attacking them still, just tonight in his speech in Greenville.  Now, a year ago, these four women were almost completely unknown. Today, they define the Democratic Party. Their rise tells you a lot about where the left is heading. Individually, each of the four members is weak, unaccomplished, uninformed, deeply unimpressive; and yet together as a group, they are strong. Their power derives from a single word, \"racist.\" They deploy that word as a weapon at the first line of resistance every time. Anyone who stands in their way is by definition a racist -- literally anyone, even the leader of their party.  Watch Rashida Tlaib explain to Gayle King of CBS that Nancy Pelosi is a racist. Why? Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't agree with everything Rashida Tlaib thinks. Watch.",

Can you get paid for racial justice work? Is there a racial justice union? Or racial justice workers? It might be interesting to know. Gayle King never asked of course. It sounds totally legitimate to her.   But the point is, and in fact the real headline here is Rashida Tlaib has been working this scam for a long time. Bullying people on the basis of their skin color to accrue more power. That's her game and she will keep doing it until it stops working. There's no sign of that yet though, so in the meantime, neither she nor her equally-entitled friends have any plans to slow down or apologize for anything they do or have done. Ilhan Omar, for example, has accused Israel of quote, \"hypnotizing the planet.\" She called it an evil country.

Because in the new woke Democratic Party, race trumps everything. The old party was the party of equality and the working class. The new party is the party of race baiting. The sad point is that America is actually less racist than it's ever been, but it's also a lot more afraid than it has ever been. People are terrified and demagogues like Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar leverage that fear and that terror to win power.  So far it's working for them. The question is, can it bring them across the finish line in an election? Do most Americans really hate their country? Do most Americans think other Americans are mostly racist? They're betting on it. We are about to find out.  Dana Perino hosts \"The Daily Briefing\" with Dana Perino and she joins us tonight. Dana, thanks a lot for coming on.

I don't know if you saw this today. In \"The New York Times\" on the editorial page, the columnist, Thomas Friedman had a whole column basically - practically begging \"the squad\" to stop, saying the revolution is not going to happen in 2020 and that the questions that he gets most now from people he runs into -- these are Democrats -- they will say -- this is the headline of the peace, \"Trump is going to win again, isn't he?\"  So they know, and they are trying to send all the signals, like, \"Please, stop, don't.\" Nancy Pelosi is trying.

Now, I don't think that there are going to be anywhere near able to do that in 2020, because you have, for example, \"the squad\" has become now the face of the Democratic Party. The president doesn't even need to run against Joe Biden. He can just run against them. One thing that I think is unfortunate, sometimes it feels like the Roman Colosseum and the chanting of \"send her back\" becomes one of those -- look, Omar is a Congresswoman, she is a citizen of the country and sometimes I think that the Trump people, I think even understand -- it could go a little bit too far and have a backlash. However, that said, all of those women in \"the squad\" asked Nancy Pelosi in the interview with Gayle King, to please be more mindful of your words when you're talking about us or referencing us because we are women of color. So then you think about, okay, well, the things that they say about Jewish people. Should \"the squad\" be more mindful of people that are Jewish? And that hateful things are said, right?

He wouldn't spend so much time working on affordable housing, recognize what the crisis was. The list goes on and on. These are not things that people who are racist would do.

Additional reporting, though, suggested that she was fired in part because she didn't use trans-inclusive language. She wouldn't say that men can get abortions, too, and so they canned her.

And what she was saying, as a doctor, she was the first doctor in 50 years, I believe, to be the President of Planned Parenthood. She said, \"We need to keep this a woman's health issue.\" Right?

Or how about what we see on Facebook and Twitter all the time of young parents saying, \"Look, this is the image of our child who is only 10 to 12 weeks,\" that says everything.

Let's talk about the faith of 'I am completely and totally autonomous and can make whatever decision I want about this child that is in my womb.'\" That is so crazy.

Now, Democrats and their servants in the media have told us that it is inherently racist to criticize these politicians given the way they look. The President clearly disagrees with that. We know because he has been attacking them still, just tonight in his speech in Greenville. Now, a year ago, these four women were almost completely unknown. Today, they define the Democratic Party. Their rise tells you a lot about where the left is heading. Individually, each of the four members is weak, unaccomplished, uninformed, deeply unimpressive; and yet together as a group, they are strong. Their power derives from a single word, \"racist.\" They deploy that word as a weapon at the first line of resistance every time.

Can you get paid for racial justice work? Is there a racial justice union? Or racial justice workers? It might be interesting to know. Gayle King never asked of course. It sounds totally legitimate to her. But the point is, and in fact the real headline here is Rashida Tlaib has been working this scam for a long time. Bullying people on the basis of their skin color to accrue more power. That's her game and she will keep doing it until it stops working. There's no sign of that yet though, so in the meantime, neither she nor her equally-entitled friends have any plans to slow down or apologize for anything they do or have done. Ilhan Omar, for example, has accused Israel of quote, \"hypnotizing the planet.\" She called it an evil country.

Because in the new woke Democratic Party, race trumps everything. The old party was the party of equality and the working class. The new party is the party of race baiting. The sad point is that America is actually less racist than it's ever been, but it's also a lot more afraid than it has ever been. People are terrified and demagogues like Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar leverage that fear and that terror to win power. So far it's working for them. The question is, can it bring them across the finish line in an election? Do most Americans really hate their country? Do most Americans think other Americans are mostly racist? They're betting on it. We are about to find out. Dana Perino hosts \"The Daily Briefing\" with Dana Perino and she joins us tonight. Dana, thanks a lot for coming on.

I don't know if you saw this today. In \"The New York Times\" on the editorial page, the columnist, Thomas Friedman had a whole column basically - practically begging \"the squad\" to stop, saying the revolution is not going to happen in 2020 and that the questions that he gets most now from people he runs into -- these are Democrats -- they will say -- this is the headline of the peace, \"Trump is going to win again, isn't he?\" So they know, and they are trying to send all the signals, like, \"Please, stop, don't.\" Nancy Pelosi is trying.

These guys know that President Trump has raised so much money and that every one of these rallies that he goes to, they get something also much more valuable than money in many ways, and that is information about people who want to be there, and they can contact them again and again. \"Make sure you're going to go out and vote.

Take your pick and Donald Trump is able to basically win that hand and gets those three states, becomes the President of the United States. The Democrats are like, \"What just happened\"? In the midterm elections it was more a referendum on him and the Democrats are super organized and they are able to take back the House. Now, I don't think that there are going to be anywhere near able to do that in 2020, because you have, for example, \"the squad\" has become now the face of the Democratic Party. The president doesn't even need to run against Joe Biden. He can just run against them. One thing that I think is unfortunate, sometimes it feels like the Roman Colosseum and the chanting of \"send her back\" becomes one of those -- look, Omar is a Congresswoman, she is a citizen of the country and sometimes I think that the Trump people, I think even understand -- it could go a little bit too far and have a backlash. However, that said, all of those women in \"the squad\" asked Nancy Pelosi in the interview with Gayle King, to please be more mindful of your words when you're talking about us or referencing us because we are women of color. So then you think about, okay, well, the things that they say about Jewish people. Should \"the squad\" be more mindful of people that are Jewish? And that hateful things are said, right? So, it's this terrible, vicious cycle that is really hard to pull out of, but I don't think the Nancy Pelosi is able to figure out a way right now to have a hold of them.

He wouldn't spend so much time working on affordable housing, recognize what the crisis was. The list goes on and on. These are not things that people who are racist would do.

According to Wen, her removal was because she saw Planned Parenthood as a healthcare organization -- big mistake -- rather than a political organization focused on abortion, and helping the Democratic Party. Additional reporting, though, suggested that she was fired in part because she didn't use trans-inclusive language. She wouldn't say that men can get abortions, too, and so they canned her.

She came out and said, \"They fired me in a secret meeting.\" And it was secret, because they were afraid to make it public that she just wasn't radical enough. And you would think -- and the President just said it a few minutes ago -- you would think that after the Governor of Virginia came out and said, \"You know, we need to keep these babies comfortable before we make a decision.\" This is after they're born, \"Before we make a decision whether we kill them or not.\" You would think that plant parenthood would say, \"Hey, let's take it easy, especially in this political election season.\" No. Instead, they're saying our President is not -- our President, meaning the President of Planned Parenthood -- is not radical enough. And what she was saying, as a doctor, she was the first doctor in 50 years, I believe, to be the President of Planned Parenthood. She said, \"We need to keep this a woman's health issue.\" Right? And I think Planned Parenthood was exactly right to say that doesn't work anymore, because the younger generations know that sonograms, right, medical devices, and technology tell us everything about what's going on. So don't pretend it's purely a woman's health decision. Let's talk about making it just, \"We can do whatever we want.\" And that's Planned Parenthood's ideology."

The man's role in this is never discussed, and then the right of the living child is never discussed. Why is that?"

As I mentioned, sonograms, but not only sonograms, but how about hearing a baby's heartbeat? Or how about what we see on Facebook and Twitter all the time of young parents saying, \"Look, this is the image of our child who is only 10 to 12 weeks,\" that says everything. So Planned Parenthood is saying, \"Let's not have a discussion about Medicine. Let's not have a discussion about evidence. Let's not bring in science. Let's talk about the faith of 'I am completely and totally autonomous and can make whatever decision I want about this child that is in my womb.'\" That is so crazy. It is so crazy, and yet that is what they have decided is going to work for Planned Parenthood.

He says, actually, that's a losing argument to say, you can make a decision -- any woman can make a decision autonomously about anything having to do with a child that is in her womb, and President Trump gets that and says that's not going to work. And maybe he also has come to really, truly understand the value and the dignity of every human being. I hope so and I don't know, but I believe that the pro-life argument is a winning argument."

But the other thing is, you know, when he goes through and he still ticks through all of those issues, whether it's immigration or trade, or the wars or ninth-month abortions, you realize just how much low hanging fruit all the politicians in America left out there for a guy to walk up and snatch."

We should note that the administration is trying to address the crisis at the border by making the requirements to apply for asylum stricter. Nancy Pelosi says it's cruel and unusual. Pelosi is talking about the Trump administration. But we should mention the Obama administration said the same thing. Listen to this."
