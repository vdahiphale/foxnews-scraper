Compare that to last year, when 43 million Americans took to the streets for the unofficial start to summer. So, even though these roads are more empty, it doesn't mean that they're not dangerous. According to the National Safety Council, in March, driving decreased by 18 percent, but deaths per mile increased by 14 percent. Cameras across the country are spotting drivers racing and running red lights. Last month, speed cameras caught 40 percent more drivers flying at least 20 miles per hour faster than the limit.

From Alabama to Oregon from Michigan to Texas, 22 states are adding new reopening measures today, covering an alphabet soup of activities from arcades to zoos. Let's start in Kentucky, where you will be able to get some of the country's finest barbecue while sitting in a restaurant again, although all dine-in restaurants will be limited to 33 percent capacity.  Texas also serves a mighty fine barbecue, and restaurants there can now open at 50 percent capacity. And you can wash down the food with a drink at a bar, restricted to 25 percent capacity, and then go bowling, where the alleys will also top out at 25 percent. In South Carolina, various tourist attractions can reopen. So if a ride on the Myrtle Beach ferris wheel will lift your spirits this weekend, you're in luck.   In Ohio, there will be horse racing with no spectators. In Kansas, arcades and trampoline parks are among the venues now allowed to open. And you can get your animal fix in Iowa, where aquariums and zoos can open their doors. And if exercise is your thing, Indiana is allowing tennis courts, basketball courts, community pools, and gyms to reopen.  Here in L.A., Neil, gyms remain firmly closed, which at least spares me the effort of thinking up my daily excuse for not going to the gym -- Neil.",

From Alabama to Oregon from Michigan to Texas, 22 states are adding new reopening measures today, covering an alphabet soup of activities from arcades to zoos. Let's start in Kentucky, where you will be able to get some of the country's finest barbecue while sitting in a restaurant again, although all dine-in restaurants will be limited to 33 percent capacity. Texas also serves a mighty fine barbecue, and restaurants there can now open at 50 percent capacity. And you can wash down the food with a drink at a bar, restricted to 25 percent capacity, and then go bowling, where the alleys will also top out at 25 percent. In South Carolina, various tourist attractions can reopen. So if a ride on the Myrtle Beach ferris wheel will lift your spirits this weekend, you're in luck. In Ohio, there will be horse racing with no spectators. In Kansas, arcades and trampoline parks are among the venues now allowed to open. And you can get your animal fix in Iowa, where aquariums and zoos can open their doors. And if exercise is your thing, Indiana is allowing tennis courts, basketball courts, community pools, and gyms to reopen. Here in L.A., Neil, gyms remain firmly closed, which at least spares me the effort of thinking up my daily excuse for not going to the gym -- Neil."

Before we key you in on what's happening in other states, including the Alaska governor, who completely reopened up his state, he's coming up. At the corner of Wall and Broad, we finished a very, very strong week. A little bumpy rides today, but up 3 percent for all the major market averages here, based on the belief here that they're optimistic things will pick up. We also have the latest on what the president is planning to do to open up places of worship. He has already told the governors, do it, or else. But do they have to do it, or else? After this."

But the president has heard the call from people of faith saying, why are certain businesses open, but churches are still closed? And as a partner piece with what the president said a little bit earlier on today, the Centers for Disease Control has just come out with new guidelines for pastors, imams and rabbis to put in place here as they reopen their doors, use of cloth face coverings for staff and congregants, promote social distancing in services, consider holding services outdoors, add additional services to weekly schedule to pare down the number of people that would be at any one particular service, suspending or decreasing choir and congregants singing, limit sharing of frequently touched objects, and consider electronic collection boxes. But what the president did today -- we knew that these CDC guidelines, Neil, were coming out. But what the president really did today was throw down a gauntlet to the nation's governors, in particular the ones who have been reluctant about allowing churches and other houses of worship to get going again, to say, I want this done and I want it done now, or else. Listen here."

I think, really, he wants just to make the point that he believes that, if you're going to open a liquor store, and if you're going to open something else, then the churches should be open as well.

But this also comes out at the same time that a CDC morbidity and mortality weekly report details a case that happened in Arkansas back at the beginning of March, Neil, in which one person infected 35 people at a church. Three of them died. And then, subsequently, there were 26 community infections that followed that, and another person died. So you had a total of 61 infections and four people dead.

But let me say that long before the CDC recommendations came out, those are all of the things that we have been planning to do. We're increasing the number of masses. We have two special risk masses that will be particularly attended to. We're having people come in one way and go out another. They're signing up before they come. We have alternate pews. We're not using our hymnals. All those kinds of things that are being recommended are already in place. I mean, it's not as though churches are not social organizations who have their own set of concerns and knowledge of what's going on. So -- and let me also say this, not that I have ever been in a tattoo parlor, but I have a suspicion that what goes on in my church is a lot less intimate than a tattoo parlor."

When they're in church, they're in their own pew. They're distant from other families, will receive communion in an orderly fashion. You know, this is not the first time the church has confronted a pandemic. We have dealt with this over the ages. And I agree that it is important that we observe social distancing and the -- all of the sanitary procedures that need to be in place. But to marginalize the churches, though it's not an essential institution, let's remember that religious organizations are the first of the first responders. When people needed food, they came to our church. We provided money for people and things like that. So, the emotional support as well, the solidarity, the sense of hope. What do people need in our country, in our world right now? More than anything else, it's a sense of hope. We have to do it in a rational way. We have to do it in a way that respects the reality of this disease and its potential, but we have to do it."

As of this morning, we have 404 cases, zero hospitalizations today, no new deaths, a total of 10 deaths. And we have recovered 356 individuals. So, our numbers are very low. We have been watching this and managing this really well since we received that plane from Wuhan province with U.S. State Department families and officials back in January. And what we promised the people -- and we can't -- this is very important. What we promised the people of Alaska is, we need your help to give us some time to build up our health care capacity. We have built that health care capacity up. We -- we're keeping our promise with the people Alaska. Our businesses, our entities, our churches are open. We really never had a hard shutdown. We never really told people that they had to stay at home. We actually encouraged people to go out, recreate, but just stay six feet apart, wash your hands, et cetera. And so we are -- we're in pretty good shape right now. We do anticipate our numbers will increase. Just it's going to happen, because our numbers are unusually low. But we believe that we are capable of dealing with this and managing this. And that's what we have to all go into now, is a management phase in managing this virus."

That's happened in other states. Is there a level though, Governor, at which you say, all right, that -- that's a little more than we thought, or the pace -- the pace of positive cases that might give you pause? What would you do?"

If we see an uptick, if we see what we see as a spike or a surge that has the potential of overwhelming our health care system, then we will make the appropriate decisions on individual bases, meaning instead of a statewide rule change, we will probably look at a locale or an establishment, a venue. We will try and isolate and find out what exactly happened on a small scale. But we're not going to close down the state. We think we can manage this.

We're managing that well. The other is going to be an economic issue. And that's really where we need to spend more of our attention, is, how are we going to get our economies back up off the knees moving forward? How are we going to look to the future?

But I think, as we watch this unfold, I think the impacts to the economy are going to be deeper than most people think. But the underlying -- underlying fundamentals of this country and the state of Alaska were really pretty sound before this happened. So we're going to build upon that. We're going to look to the future. We're going to come out of this stronger. Alaska always does after earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. We always come out of these catastrophes stronger. But it's going to take a little while."

That could -- that's still going to be potentially an issue for you, right? I mean, if -- obviously, relations are pretty sour right now between our two countries, but travel will resume. And I'm wondering, are you leery of that?"

And so we're in a phase of managing it and incorporating it into our daily lives. There will be an increase in cases until there's a vaccination, until we have enough antivirals on hand. There will be an increase in cases. We're going to manage that. But the devastation that we thought would come from the first surge of this virus has not materialized. That's a good thing. But the devastation to the economy, our social, our lives, we have to turn our attention to that, because what -- what people didn't understand, I believe, at first is, the ramifications there could be just as devastating in terms of job loss, depression, emotional and mental health issues. And so we have to address the overall health of our states. And that includes the economy."

It's not as if the liquor store has some ability to hypnotize COVID before it comes into its stores and stop it, but the shoe store owner doesn't. Let's be sensible. The mayor's comments at this point are coming off as if he is an elitist dilettante that does not understand the struggles of our small business owners. We got -- we can do this responsibly, but we have to have that sense of urgency around the mom-and-pops that have dedicated their lives to their businesses. I come from a long line of small business owners. And I understand, just as so many New Yorkers do, that when you own a small business, that's not a 9:00 to 5:00. It's your entire life, and they're watching their small businesses wither on the vine. We have got to do something. Let's issue standards. Let's distribute PPE in a massive way. And let's start to get this thing open. Our small business owners are incredibly smart, especially in New York City. And they understand that 25 percent occupancy rates, that's just the beginning.

      "utterance": "Well, absolutely. And, look, I don't think that this is a decision. Now, you look back three months or so, the president, I think actually correctly, noted that opening, closing should be decisions made according to decisions by governors. This as well is a decision that cannot be made on a national basis, and has to be made in partnership with our faith-based leaders. If you look to many of the leading faith-based organizations and leaders in New York City, I think there is an overarching consensus that we are not yet at the point where we can begin an opening. But what we should start to do is tell people when it will happen. We need -- I remember back to when I was in Army Ranger school. The worst thing your R.I.s could ever do to you was put you on a ruck march and tell you -- and not tell you when it was going to end. That was what you feared more than anything else. And that's the place where most New Yorkers are in right now. They have been doing the right thing."

      "utterance": "All right. Be well. All right, in the meantime here, we are efforting trying to get the mayor, de Blasio, to explain this procedure. We will you know let where that -- what comes of that. In the meantime, we told you about beaches are starting to open up, pretty much across the country, the Northeast here in New York, New Jersey, for example. But there are a ton of restrictions. So, I say you go buy a pool. I say you go buy a swimming pool right now, because a lot of people are, and it's making a big splash. You can't go swimming much in the water, and then, when you are in the water, of course, when it's not raining or on the beach, you got to keep moving. They don't want you lounging around. And you got to respect social distances. But -- but it's a start. But if that's such a hassle for you, have you ever considered buying a pool? Well, apparently, people have, because there's a huge surge in these sales. And doesn't our Jeff Flock know it? He joins us out of Orland Park, Illinois -- Jeff."

And I might not be surrounded by pools for long, Neil, because there is this run on these pools, which is like the above-ground pool. Some people maybe turn their nose up at an above-ground pool, not now, because you can get these right away. Bob Jones, American Sale is the company. You have got eight stores in Chicago."

      "speaker": "FLOCK",
      "utterance": "Yes. I want to show you the use. There's all sorts of different sizes of these. This is kind of a medium-sized one here. Joe, if you look off to the left there, maybe you see one of the larger above-ground pools. And these can go in the space of a day once you get it, and they're fairly easy to set up. And I will tell you, right now, people are nesting at home. They're not going on vacation somewhere."
    },

      "speaker": "JONES",

      "utterance": "Yes. And hey, Joe, can you come on over here maybe? Oh, he's killing me. We -- I know we got to run here. But, Neil, I want to leave you with something that I think is very cool, too. And you can get this right away. It's called an endless pool. It's one of those where you can exercise in it. It blows the water back at you. I leave you with the picture of that. This might be something you might be interested in, sir."

      "utterance": "Well, beaches are open in New Jersey. So, in Seaside Heights, even with the rain, there is that. Unfortunately, businesses aren't so lucky. They're in the same pickle they have been in now for the better part of two months. Jessica Walker is the owner of J. Walker Salon in beautiful Bernardsville, New Jersey. Jessica, you still can open, can you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSICA WALKER, OWNER, J. WALKER SALON",
      "utterance": "No.  Yes, and it's been very difficult for us to even sleep at night because it's been 24 years I have been building this business. And my staff and I, we're really suffering. And I think that it's been 10 weeks, and it's too long. It's time for the American people to be able to choose what business and where they want to frequent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "Oh, it's a dagger. It's a dagger right inside to hear that the public bathrooms are open, yet I can't have one or two clients in my business at a time. There are safe and effective ways that we can open slowly and in stages. Our margins are already small across the industry of hair salons and stylists, for that matter. And it's going to be a very, very difficult road to get back up and to be able to climb back up that mountain that I have already had to conquer being in business for 24 years. And now it's like, whoa, start all over again. And I feel very ignored. I think our industry has been ignored in this. And I think that there could be definitely ways to safely open. We're licensed to touch. And I believe that we're going to be a part of the healing process for our communities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, no doubt. I mean, if anyone misses anything, it's people who run salons, if people want haircuts or just want any of that. But you can't do that. And I'm sure you look at this woman in Texas who opened after she couldn't. She was briefly hauled to jail before the governor got her out. Do you ever feel tempted, when you see issues like that? There is the gym owner in, I think, Belmar, New Jersey, who is in the same situation. He wanted to stay open. They kept shutting him down. He opened up the next day. But, obviously you're dealing with the hassles of paying fines and everything else. So, what do you do in the meantime?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "I'm really hoping and praying that the governor will give us his executive blessing and that we will be able to open in the next couple of days. That's what I would like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But I don't know -- I don't hear signs of that. You might be more attuned to this than I am. I mean, the governor seems to be sticking to this timetable that might put off something like yours for a while. You have already heard what's going on in New York City, where Mayor de Blasio is pushing things off weeks. I mean, you can't afford that, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "We can't afford that, no. And to be honest with you, even when we go back, the capacity that we're going to be allowed to be at, it's almost going to be..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALKER",
      "utterance": "It's going to be so difficult to keep -- to keep open and to keep going as it is. I don't know what that's going to look like. I'm willing to roll up my sleeves and, of course, get back in there. I haven't worked my whole life to lose everything that I have built. We all have families. As stylists, we all have families. And a lot of us are bringing home money. And this is our purpose and our life to be able to help our stylists have their careers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, I know. I know very well. I know your shop very well. I know 25 percent capacity in a smaller shop is going to be tough, but it's better than nothing. So, we will watch very, very closely. Jessica, hang in there. My best to you and yours. I'm sure it's going to work out. I'm absolutely sure. More after this."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, the country's coming back, and we are coming back tomorrow, live again, 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. We have got the Ohio governor, Mike DeWine. That could be the next state that fully reopens. We have also got the AstraZeneca CEO, Pascal Soriot, on that big $1.2 billion U.S. government commission, commitment to find, hopefully, some vaccine, Chad Wolf as well. All of that tomorrow.
