      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Bret Baier, with Dr. Nicole Saphier, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she plays hot scotch in a desk calendar, Dana Perino, THE FIVE. Citing security concerns during a shutdown, Nancy Pelosi has asked Donald Trump to give his State of the Union in writing. Trump's response, canceling her trip to Brussels right before takeoff. It's hilarious.  In the letter, he said he was sorry to inform her that he's canceling the trip. No, no. He wasn't sorry, not at all. He basically stole her lunch money and then he ate her lunch. Still, Trump should accept her offer and send the address in writing, a sheet with just two words, bye-bye, then hold a giant event in the middle of America. After all, the people elected Trump, not Washington, D.C.  Nancy and the Dems can take shelter under their desks and watch it on all on iPads. And Trump can cite his achievements, tell some jokes, just so the press has a reason to burn their hair. Broadcast it on YouTube. The media will cover it and highly flammable fact checks. It will be the first people's State of the Union.  If the media doesn't show it, then we know it's personal and political. For this is historical and hysterical because what do the Dems do then? Do they not respond when he does it anyway at a better place with better looking people with music, prizes, farm animals and face painting? And almost no carbon footprint, think about that. Do they hold a response with the same cardboard cutouts from before? Now, Nancy just offered Trump an amazing opportunity. It gets him out of a really dull speech and it gets \"The Five\" out of going to D.C., a place with overpriced booze, incompetent politicians, and substandard food, which really is the whole point of this monologue.  All right, originally, we're going to talk about the State of the Union, but we've got to talk about this letter, which is fantastic. Dear Madam Speaker, due to the shutdown, I'm sorry to inform you -- I'm sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule the seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over. Oh gees. This -- obviously, if you'd like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative. Dana, OK, some might say this is childish or -- I think Juan thinks this is childish. I think it's childishly awesome.",

And he very much dislikes the fact that these rich nations were protecting and they're not paying us a security retainer. He very much dislikes that. And he heard all these generals for many, many years say that, you know, this is going to be generational fight with ISIS. And what happens? He came in in two years and destroyed about 90 percent of the caliphate. I do understand the need to keep troops there for intelligence gathering purposes and to go after high-value targets, and that's an argument that needs to be had, but this is previewing his Afghanistan pullout. I think you're going to see that soon.  What's very interesting, Juan, is the Democrats had totally flip-flopped on Syria.

      "utterance": "Hi, I'm Bret Baier, with Dr. Nicole Saphier, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she plays hot scotch in a desk calendar, Dana Perino, THE FIVE. Citing security concerns during a shutdown, Nancy Pelosi has asked Donald Trump to give his State of the Union in writing. Trump's response, canceling her trip to Brussels right before takeoff. It's hilarious. In the letter, he said he was sorry to inform her that he's canceling the trip. No, no. He wasn't sorry, not at all. He basically stole her lunch money and then he ate her lunch. Still, Trump should accept her offer and send the address in writing, a sheet with just two words, bye-bye, then hold a giant event in the middle of America. After all, the people elected Trump, not Washington, D.C. Nancy and the Dems can take shelter under their desks and watch it on all on iPads. And Trump can cite his achievements, tell some jokes, just so the press has a reason to burn their hair. Broadcast it on YouTube. The media will cover it and highly flammable fact checks. It will be the first people's State of the Union. If the media doesn't show it, then we know it's personal and political. For this is historical and hysterical because what do the Dems do then? Do they not respond when he does it anyway at a better place with better looking people with music, prizes, farm animals and face painting? And almost no carbon footprint, think about that. Do they hold a response with the same cardboard cutouts from before? Now, Nancy just offered Trump an amazing opportunity. It gets him out of a really dull speech and it gets \"The Five\" out of going to D.C., a place with overpriced booze, incompetent politicians, and substandard food, which really is the whole point of this monologue. All right, originally, we're going to talk about the State of the Union, but we've got to talk about this letter, which is fantastic. Dear Madam Speaker, due to the shutdown, I'm sorry to inform you -- I'm sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule the seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over. Oh gees. This -- obviously, if you'd like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative.

And it is kind of like a reality TV show. So, I think, oh, tit for tat. There, I understand the thing about their security concerns, who's going to Afghanistan.

But that's just propaganda. I think Trump has a very black-and-white view of the Middle East. He believes we're there for oil and to stop the Iranians from gaining more power. And that's it. And he very much dislikes the fact that these rich nations were protecting and they're not paying us a security retainer. He very much dislikes that. And he heard all these generals for many, many years say that, you know, this is going to be generational fight with ISIS. And what happens? He came in in two years and destroyed about 90 percent of the caliphate. I do understand the need to keep troops there for intelligence gathering purposes and to go after high-value targets, and that's an argument that needs to be had, but this is previewing his Afghanistan pullout. I think you're going to see that soon. What's very interesting, Juan, is the Democrats had totally flip-flopped on Syria. When Obama was going in there with troops, the Democrats were saying no, no, don't go in. And now Trump wants to pull out and they're saying no, no, stay. It's just amazing.

All I know is that he campaigned on the fact to take troops out. He wasn't there to end the civil war, this big power play that's going on there. In his eyes, he has done what he said he -- to do, defeated ISIS. And now, he's trying to uphold his campaign promise by bringing the troops out. So, he's doing what the American people elected him to do. I'm not a national security or an international policy person at all, but all I know is that he keeps saying he's going on what he was elected to do. And I can't fault him for that. I do hope that he is listening to people around him because there could be some major consequences by pulling these out.

We don't have actually people on the ground fighting. We have advisors there. What we know is that -- what Jesse said is like, yes, of course, they'll come after you. I wouldn't disagree that the generational war is not against ISIS. The generational war is against radical Islamic extremism. So, we lost four soldiers yesterday. We also lost an American on Monday in Nigeria because of al-Shabaab, which is an al Qaeda offshoot. They come from Somalia into Kenya. And so, this is a generational war. And I looked at people like Dan Crenshaw, Michael Waltz, Adam Kinzinger, all of them who had served and now are serving in congress who had said on air, in the last 48 hours, we were willing to go back over and over again. We believe that fighting them there is better than fighting them here. And every day that we prevent a 9/11 is a good day, but we have to keep our foot, our boot on the throat, right?

I don't necessarily agree whether that's related. But I do believe you can hold two thoughts in your head at the same time, meaning you can believe that you are crushing ISIS but you will continue to crush them. That's how we treat cockroaches. Terrorism is one big cockroach mitigation system. The earth is the house. Terrorists are the roaches. Unfortunately, a lot of the tenants hate it when you spray for them. But that's their problem. The thing that really bothers me is that the media narrative, it could be expressing horror over this vile attack and stressing vigilance against an existential terror, radical Islam, and how it feels terror. That's how the media narrative could be. Instead, it's steepened in this smug mantra. Oh, but I thought ISIS was defeated. It was like they were -- there're people in the media taking pleasure out of this to say ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. I thought it was over. Pence said it was over. It was disgusting how pleased they were over this."

This idea will exist forever. That's what I'm saying. You could have two thoughts in your head. You can say you're crushing ISIS but it's never going to end because it's an idea.

So I think ISIS till exists, but I also think the president has not thought out all the consequences of this action.

That could start to add up. You see stories about government workers having to figure out food banks. Right? So that they can do that. Yesterday, as Tyrus said, he talked to his friends in the Coast Guard who said they can't actually complete some of their work that they need to do to protect the Eastern Seaboard. So, you know, there's also problems that come that way. And also 70 percent of workers all across America, 78 percent of Americans that work full-time, live paycheck to paycheck. So this is -- this is very real for a lot of people, and I understand why -- of course, I get it. We've laughed about it. I laughed about it at 2 p.m. when he stopped her trip. And it's not just him punching her. Right? Remember, this is in response to her saying that \"You shouldn't come and do the State of the Union during the shutdown.\" So when they're talking about the president being petty, you have to ask, you know, she did kind of start it."
