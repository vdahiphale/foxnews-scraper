If you look at the donations that are coming out of Silicon Valley.  Joe Biden and big tech, they were the top donor to his campaign, 95 percent of the donations coming out of Silicon Valley went to Joe Biden, through the super pacs and the individual donations. So Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, they owe big tech. You don't give that kind of money to a politician and not expect special access, special favors. So when they're going to get in there, they're already going to write the rules, and that's why his transition team is loaded up with Silicon Valley executives.

But YouTube has also been accused of bias against conservative amongst other things and not taking down videos like the Andy Parker, the father of Allison who was, you know, killed on live television. That video is still up, and he has asked YouTube to take it down. They won't take it down. They said they have reasons not to. There are lots of these laws, but I wonder where this is going. You could see the possibility of something like a Josh Hawley and Elizabeth Warren maybe getting to the same conclusion of what they want to have happen with these companies, but for very different reasons. I do think that content decisions have hurt conservatives in some cases.  Let me give you one example. John James, who was the Republican Senate candidate in Michigan, you know, he lost but not by much. There was an ad that the Democrats cut about him talking about health care. And they cut it deceptively. They edited it so that it looked like he was -- basically didn't care about pre-exisitng conditions. Twitter wouldn't take it down. They wouldn't label it, so then it spread everywhere. And the TV networks then in Michigan started using it, and it wasn't fair. Like, Twitter is quick to label something deceptive on the Republican side, or it feels that way. And so that's what they were trying to get at today. Also, (Inaudible) the senator from Hawaii suggested that because Media Matters has done a report suggesting that there is no bias against conservatives on social media that we are all supposed to take that very seriously. And the last thing I will say is Twitter has -- and Facebook have done this extended ad ban after the election. But now, you have these elections in Georgia, the run-offs. So now, the Democrats are mad because they get fundraising through their Facebook ads.",

It just prevents people from trying to destroy my life, which is what they do on Twitter.  I want to go off on what you said. You said you think they are on drugs. I just want to know why the most powerful people currently in the world look so odd. I mean, here on one side, you got father time. And the other one, you got a shaved of gerbil. I mean, these are people that are basically controlling our lives. I mean, I look at what's his name, Jack, his beard? I mean, that's got to be where the suspended tweets go. I mean, I think if you were to look for Hunter Biden, 90 percent of the time, it is in that beard, incredible. The big concern, I think, for me is that we've already given up on academia, entertainment, and media. It's all overwhelmingly left. Every study shows 90 percent liberal. If -- are we willing to now give up on these social platforms, right? When you look at these studies and you mention one, I think Dana or the study of midterm political contributions of $200 or more. For Netflix, 99.6 percent went to Democrats, right? Twitter, 98.7 percent, Google 96 percent. So what happens is when you're dealing with people who are that bias, they are more welcome to suppressing other opposing political opinions. Generally, if you're the middle of the road, you can deal with both. But when you are 99 percent, you're not going to let anybody there. And that answers you question on why all of the policing of problematic tweets goes one way. Because if you are 99 percent left, you don't see any problem with the problematic tweets, the lies, and the disinformation coming in the direction that you enjoy.   But anybody else, you've got to stamp that out. So that's the problem, I have no solutions.",

All of a sudden, there was a Project Veritas video out, guys saying they are counting Trump votes for Biden. It's on tape. And now, you can't even match the signatures because they threw the envelopes away. And then few counties are not even doing hand recounts. So it's very suspicious, and you just had a case in Texas, woman hit with 134 indictments for voter fraud.

And from what I've heard, millions of votes haven't been counted yet which is interesting. I heard millions of votes haven't been counted yet, which is interesting. But the other argument is that somehow undermining democracy, which is hilarious given the last four years that we've gone through. The Democrats accusing Trump of undermining democracy after their four year escapade is like Ted Bundy criticizing your table manners. They have turned this whole thing upside down. So I think you guys could probably just indulge Trump's administration and the Republicans a couple of weeks. It's only been two weeks to just run the court, kick the tires. We should do this once in a while, especially since mail-in voting will probably be a huge part of all future elections so let's use this opportunity.

When you combine big tech with big media, what that does is big tech makes someone like Biden bullet proof, and then the big media, I think, attacks Trump, what, 95 percent of the time. So then you gave the Democratic nominee for president, you give him a shield to protect himself."

I mean, any Democrat with that kind of protection has to win every time, and they need that type of help because they're not talented to win it on their own. If you look at the donations that are coming out of Silicon Valley. Joe Biden and big tech, they were the top donor to his campaign, 95 percent of the donations coming out of Silicon Valley went to Joe Biden, through the super pacs and the individual donations. So Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, they owe big tech. You don't give that kind of money to a politician and not expect special access, special favors. So when they're going to get in there, they're already going to write the rules, and that's why his transition team is loaded up with Silicon Valley executives. And the minute they smell some regulation coming out of the House or the Senate, those lobbyists are just going to lather up these politicians with donations, take them on hunting trips, put their spouses on boards, that's how it goes down."

But YouTube has also been accused of bias against conservative amongst other things and not taking down videos like the Andy Parker, the father of Allison who was, you know, killed on live television. That video is still up, and he has asked YouTube to take it down. They won't take it down. They said they have reasons not to. There are lots of these laws, but I wonder where this is going. You could see the possibility of something like a Josh Hawley and Elizabeth Warren maybe getting to the same conclusion of what they want to have happen with these companies, but for very different reasons. I do think that content decisions have hurt conservatives in some cases. Let me give you one example. John James, who was the Republican Senate candidate in Michigan, you know, he lost but not by much. There was an ad that the Democrats cut about him talking about health care. And they cut it deceptively. They edited it so that it looked like he was -- basically didn't care about pre-exisitng conditions. Twitter wouldn't take it down. They wouldn't label it, so then it spread everywhere. And the TV networks then in Michigan started using it, and it wasn't fair. Like, Twitter is quick to label something deceptive on the Republican side, or it feels that way. And so that's what they were trying to get at today. Also, (Inaudible) the senator from Hawaii suggested that because Media Matters has done a report suggesting that there is no bias against conservatives on social media that we are all supposed to take that very seriously. And the last thing I will say is Twitter has -- and Facebook have done this extended ad ban after the election. But now, you have these elections in Georgia, the run-offs. So now, the Democrats are mad because they get fundraising through their Facebook ads."

But actually, it allows me to say whatever the F I want. So it ain't no safe space for the people over there. It just prevents people from trying to destroy my life, which is what they do on Twitter. I want to go off on what you said. You said you think they are on drugs. I just want to know why the most powerful people currently in the world look so odd. I mean, here on one side, you got father time. And the other one, you got a shaved of gerbil. I mean, these are people that are basically controlling our lives. I mean, I look at what's his name, Jack, his beard? I mean, that's got to be where the suspended tweets go. I mean, I think if you were to look for Hunter Biden, 90 percent of the time, it is in that beard, incredible. The big concern, I think, for me is that we've already given up on academia, entertainment, and media. It's all overwhelmingly left. Every study shows 90 percent liberal. If -- are we willing to now give up on these social platforms, right? When you look at these studies and you mention one, I think Dana or the study of midterm political contributions of $200 or more. For Netflix, 99.6 percent went to Democrats, right? Twitter, 98.7 percent, Google 96 percent. So what happens is when you're dealing with people who are that bias, they are more welcome to suppressing other opposing political opinions. Generally, if you're the middle of the road, you can deal with both. But when you are 99 percent, you're not going to let anybody there. And that answers you question on why all of the policing of problematic tweets goes one way. Because if you are 99 percent left, you don't see any problem with the problematic tweets, the lies, and the disinformation coming in the direction that you enjoy. But anybody else, you've got to stamp that out. So that's the problem, I have no solutions."

And Twitter is for middle aged people, who in their minds, very old people. And even Instagram is on its way out. And right now, Snapchat is the big thing. But can you imagine an industry this big whose demise would be hastened by teenage girls? Imagine if the oil industry were going to completely collapse upon itself because a bunch of 14-year-olds are, like, I don't know? Why is gas even a thing?

You're not getting anywhere with a claim about a few votes that won't change the election outcome. Here is Chris Krebs, who's Trump's guy leading the cybersecurity for the U.S. government. He said 59 election experts agree. Fraud claims are unsubstantiated in this election.

All of a sudden, there was a Project Veritas video out, guys saying they are counting Trump votes for Biden. It's on tape. And now, you can't even match the signatures because they threw the envelopes away. And then few counties are not even doing hand recounts. So it's very suspicious, and you just had a case in Texas, woman hit with 134 indictments for voter fraud. She was actually falsely registering senior citizens at a home to get their naked ballots and then fill them out erroneously. Same thing happened in LA County, 41 counts of voter fraud there. Two guys did the same thing, except with homeless people. You don't do that because you love Joe Biden or you love to cheat.

This is about whether somebody's counting your votes or not. I don't think my vote's been counted. I voted in New York. And from what I've heard, millions of votes haven't been counted yet which is interesting. I heard millions of votes haven't been counted yet, which is interesting. But the other argument is that somehow undermining democracy, which is hilarious given the last four years that we've gone through. The Democrats accusing Trump of undermining democracy after their four year escapade is like Ted Bundy criticizing your table manners. They have turned this whole thing upside down. So I think you guys could probably just indulge Trump's administration and the Republicans a couple of weeks. It's only been two weeks to just run the court, kick the tires.

And that's what made it so hysterical. The thing that offends me most about the late-night writing over the last four years is it has been so unimaginative, and it has been the same joke rewritten and delivered with the same contempt in the same way. And there have been no boundaries that have been pushed here. And that's why, for a lot of these shows, people have moved on to other content. People are more excited about what they can binge-watch on Netflix than they are about, you know what Colbert said last night, because most people just don't care because they have rendered themselves irrelevant by this redundancy in their humor. And I think it's going to be very bad news for organizations, not just late-night, but New York Times Digital and MSNBC and other places that have seen the ratings and subscribership quadrupled during the Trump era. It could implode. So, what is their answer for that going to be?"

It is a hand holding machine that has soft elastic gel that fits comfortably in your hand and if you squeeze it, the sensors will squeeze you back."

Here's a proud papa teaching his child how to be a boxer. Take a look. That's Kijuan Tucker of New Jersey with a seven-year-old daughter Ruby. It started as a way to build herself confidence. Now, it turns out she's a natural. Fast hands, quick moves, she's a viral sensation. But for now, she just feels good inspiring other girls. Way to go, Ruby.
