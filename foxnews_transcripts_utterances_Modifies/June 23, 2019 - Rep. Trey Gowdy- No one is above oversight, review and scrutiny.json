      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Joining me exclusively straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" two influential Republican lawmakers on breaking developments overseas and here at home.  House Armed Services Committee Member Mike Turner is here on what new sanctions President Trump might have in mind for Iran that are supposed to go into effect tomorrow, this as National Security Adviser John Bolton warns Tehran not to confuse American prudence for weakness.  We will also get reaction from Devin Nunes on the subject, the ranking member of the House Intel Committee. Congressman Nunes also weighing in on the president's decision to delay mass deportations for two weeks to see if Congress can strike a deal on asylum and other security issues at the southern border.  Plus, the congressman tells us about the letter that he sent to FBI director concerning FISA abuse. That letter went out on Friday. Also, we have former Congressman Trey Gowdy on the latest into Attorney General William Barr's investigation into DOJ and FBI actions leading up to the 2016 election.  Plus, China expert Jonathan Ward back with us previewing the high-stakes meeting next week between President Trump and President Xi just days from now at the G20 summit. All that coming up and a lot more right here, right now, \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  President Trump is keeping up the pressure on Iran, announcing that the U.S. will impose further sanctions on Tehran beginning tomorrow. He added that military action is still on the table, just days after calling off retaliatory strikes against Iran following the downing of an American drone.   The president tweeted this: \"Iran cannot have nuclear weapons. Under the terrible Obama plan, they would have been on their way to nuclear in a short number of years. And existing verification is not acceptable. We're putting major additional sanctions on Iran on Monday. I look forward to the day that sanctions come off Iran and they become a productive and prosperous nation again. The sooner, the better,\" the president wrote. National Security Adviser John Bolton had a warning for Iran, meanwhile, while meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. Watch.",

As you were describing, the Iran nuclear deal was flawed, in that it had insufficient inspection regime.  It had a limited period of time for some of the critical components and also didn't include missiles. This administration's also identified Iran's malign activities in Yemen, Syria, Iraq in support of Hezbollah and Hamas as issues of concern. Now that we have the attacks on the tanker and the drones -- the tankers and the drone, this is the administration stepping up and saying through additional sanctions they're going to continue to impact Iran and its economy and its ability to do harm to others in this area.",

Now, Secretary Pompeo has signaled previously some additional areas of sanctions that the United States would look at would, of course, be oil exports. That goes right to heart of really the engine of Iran's economy. But with Iran's new announcement that it's going to increase uranium enrichment, it is probably likely facing additional sanctions from Europeans, as the European leaders are beginning to discuss what sanctions they would put on Iran if they step out of the Iran nuclear deal and begin enriching uranium to a higher level.",

The Europeans do not really have an ability to sidestep those. They have already been announcing how it has impacted their ability to do business with Iran.

I think it's great that the president showed restraint as a result of the downing of the U.S. drone.  But what the president is making clear, both with the buildup in the area and with his planning for action, is the president wouldn't hesitate to use military force. Now, in Congress, the debate right now is -- from the Democrats in the House is how to restrict the president, to take his options off the table. The House just last week voting to repeal the 2001 authorization of use of force against Al Qaeda and ISIS, and the week before, in the National Defense Authorization Act, debating an amendment that would have restricted the ability of the president to even defend Israel if Iran should attack them.

It's worked really, really well. And that means, if everybody was certified by the government that everybody working for you is, in fact, here on a legal permit, that in the long run is great.  Now, you can't is have that without a permit system, because everyone knows that, in this country, we have got millions of people that are here on either expired permits, or they never had a permit in the first place.

So that information, we now know that the government had that in 2016. So, the State Department, in October of 2016, e-mails went to FBI saying things like that Christopher Steele wasn't believable, that he wanted to -- he wanted to bring this out before the election. That should be a big red flag. Also said that the so-called Russia hoax operation against Trump -- or with Trump -- that Trump was a part of was being run out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.  Well, it ends up, guess what? There is no Russian Consulate in Miami. So this number two person at the State Department named Kavalec, she informed the FBI of these concerns. Now, why is that important? It's important for a number of reasons, but, first and foremost, the FISA court should have had this. The FBI had it. The FISA court should have had it before they went and spied on the Trump campaign by getting a warrant on Carter Page. Another reason why this is important for the FBI is because the Congress, under the Republican control last time, asked for anything and everything on Christopher Steele. Clearly, if we would have had this two-and-a-half years ago, when we started this investigation, we would be in a much different place today than we are.",

And she basically raises her hand, raises a red flag about the Steele dossier. She does her due diligence. She says, look, this is not trustworthy. Christopher Steele's work is not credible. And that memo from Kavalec is not shown to FISA court. This is exculpatory evidence that wasn't included in the FISA warrant.

I mean, there's no evidence of this, right? So, the only thing they had on Russians was the Steele dossier, right, and then Joseph Mifsud, who you have talked about on your show.

One is, the FBI was running an investigation into the Trump campaign, not in July of '16, like they said. They're lying about that. It clearly starts in 2015 or early 2016. At the same time, you have the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party running an operation, having their bagmen, Fusion GPS -- they're both running an investigation on a parallel track. The thing that we don't know that we need to get to bottom of is, when did those tracks become one and the same? When -- you know, were there people that were working together with the FBI and Fusion GPS and the Clinton campaign? We know they -- we know at some point they knew about Christopher Steele.

But when you have information that someone you think has done something wrong has, in fact, not done something wrong, when you have exculpatory information, and you don't share it with others, and then you put that together with Strzok and Page and then the defensive briefings, remember, Maria, the defense of Comey and the media and the Democrats has always been, yes, some in the FBI was biased against Trump, and it didn't matter. This really matters. When you have exculpatory information, and you don't share it with a court, when you give two different kinds of defensive briefings to the candidates, depending on who you like and who you don't, then your bias begins to impact the investigation.

Congressman Nunes also weighing in on the president's decision to delay mass deportations for two weeks to see if Congress can strike a deal on asylum and other security issues at the southern border.

As you know, Maria, these additional sanctions would come on top of the maximum pressure campaign, as outlined by Secretary Pompeo, to insure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon. As you were describing, the Iran nuclear deal was flawed, in that it had insufficient inspection regime. It had a limited period of time for some of the critical components and also didn't include missiles. This administration's also identified Iran's malign activities in Yemen, Syria, Iraq in support of Hezbollah and Hamas as issues of concern. Now that we have the attacks on the tanker and the drones -- the tankers and the drone, this is the administration stepping up and saying through additional sanctions they're going to continue to impact Iran and its economy and its ability to do harm to others in this area."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, the economy in Iran is reeling already from the sanctions that have been put in place before as part of the maximum pressure campaign. The International Monetary Fund indicates that Iran's economy this year is projected to contract by 6 percent. Now, Secretary Pompeo has signaled previously some additional areas of sanctions that the United States would look at would, of course, be oil exports. That goes right to heart of really the engine of Iran's economy. But with Iran's new announcement that it's going to increase uranium enrichment, it is probably likely facing additional sanctions from Europeans, as the European leaders are beginning to discuss what sanctions they would put on Iran if they step out of the Iran nuclear deal and begin enriching uranium to a higher level."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you really hit on probably one of the most important points. Does the president have the alliance of other countries in order to really put the maximum pressure on Iran? That's really key, isn't it? Aren't you still seeing Europeans buy oil or try to buy oil from Iran?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Yes, but they're doing so with the United States providing waivers and additional, you know, exceptions to existing sanctions. The United States' ability to provide sanctions are really all-pervasive. And that's why you're seeing such a huge impact on Iran's current economy. The Europeans do not really have an ability to sidestep those. They have already been announcing how it has impacted their ability to do business with Iran. But if Iran does, as they're threatening, increase the enrichment of uranium past the threshold that is set forth in the nuclear deal, Iranians are likely to be facing additional sanctions from Europe in addition to those of the United States, which would, to of course, be more crippling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "When would you expect those additional sanctions from European countries? That's what I'm trying to understand better, whether or not the U.S. has European allies on its side for this, because, while they say they are, they're still using those waivers to buy oil."
    },

      "utterance": "Secretary Pompeo has said that we're going to be closing those loopholes and making it more difficult for anyone really to violate U.S. sanctions, which really, again, are all-pervasive. But I think the Europeans themselves may step up and impose their own sanctions as Iran talks about breaking the nuclear deal. But in looking at European reactions to American sanctions, they don't have very many places to go. That's why we're seeing the maximum pressure campaign impact Iran so much. I mean, this is the goal, of course, to bring them to table, so we can renegotiate the nuclear deal, get one that's lasting, and ensures that Iran never becomes a nuclear power."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Very good. Very good. Now, this is the -- one of the world's biggest potential opportunities for oil and gas, right? I mean, in Iran, this country has an enormous portfolio of oil and gas, and yet they're not developing as much as they could because they're using their efforts and energies instead to support terrorism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Exactly. And Secretary Pompeo has said, we all look forward to a time when Iran becomes a normal nation in the community of nations in the world. As they support Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, threatening our ally Israel, Hezbollah in Lebanon and their activities in Syria, their activities in Iraq, they're a threat to Saudi Arabia with their destabilizing efforts in Yemen, they really are the destabilizing force in the Middle East, which makes it very difficult for them to join the world economy as an equal partner."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "How significant has the conversation of a military strike been as it relates to Iran? I mean, obviously, this president doesn't want to go to war, but is that the only leverage, after all of these sanctions, to have some kind of a military situation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the president has said and certainly Secretary Pompeo has said that all options are on the table, which includes a military response. And, certainly, to extent that Iran has increased its military attacks within the area, both on tankers and U.S. drones, we might see in the future a need for a military response. I think it's great that the president showed restraint as a result of the downing of the U.S. drone. But what the president is making clear, both with the buildup in the area and with his planning for action, is the president wouldn't hesitate to use military force. Now, in Congress, the debate right now is -- from the Democrats in the House is how to restrict the president, to take his options off the table. The House just last week voting to repeal the 2001 authorization of use of force against Al Qaeda and ISIS, and the week before, in the National Defense Authorization Act, debating an amendment that would have restricted the ability of the president to even defend Israel if Iran should attack them.

And he's saying, OK, I will give you two weeks. Now, remember, the Democrats have been in office for six months now. They have yet to move a comprehensive immigration bill. And I think that's what the American people need to focus on, is the people that they elect have responsibilities to pass legislation. They can't just oppose what the president wants to do, because, as you know, you have been at the border. You know that it's a disaster down there.

If you watch the language and the rhetoric that comes from the left, it's scary, really. And, you know, hopefully over time, people of Hispanic descent will understand that the Democrats are only using them. They're not actually trying to help them. If they were trying to help them, they would have passed a bill already. I mean, they have got plenty of votes. They could do a bill that would have border security. They could put in some permit systems. They could take care of all the kids that were brought here by no fault of their own. And, by the way, those are all things that Donald Trump wants to do too.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, the easiest way, in my opinion, to fix all of this is that you put in a permit system. So you put in a system where, if somebody is employing you, you have to -- you have to actually file with the government what's called E-Verify. It's a voluntary program now. It's worked really, really well. And that means, if everybody was certified by the government that everybody working for you is, in fact, here on a legal permit, that in the long run is great. Now, you can't is have that without a permit system, because everyone knows that, in this country, we have got millions of people that are here on either expired permits, or they never had a permit in the first place. And, look, it's important for us to have workers in this country that want to do jobs that, in many cases, are quite skilled, right, whether it's working in agriculture, which now is really tech -- you need technology, you need people who know how to drive complicated equipment, all the way to really smart people that are developing the next generation using math and science and developing the next generation of computer technology. We want all these people to be in the country. We want them to be on a permit system. And if you do that, along with the wall, you take care of the people that are here, it's really an easy solution. And I don't want to act like it's easier than it is. But compared -- the technology today allows us to do it, because we have already proven that this E-Verify system works with people who have voluntarily been taking part in it."

The FBI has until Friday to respond. I'm back now with Congressman Nunes to talk more about that letter he sent.

So that information, we now know that the government had that in 2016. So, the State Department, in October of 2016, e-mails went to FBI saying things like that Christopher Steele wasn't believable, that he wanted to -- he wanted to bring this out before the election. That should be a big red flag. Also said that the so-called Russia hoax operation against Trump -- or with Trump -- that Trump was a part of was being run out of the Russian Consulate in Miami. Well, it ends up, guess what? There is no Russian Consulate in Miami. So this number two person at the State Department named Kavalec, she informed the FBI of these concerns. Now, why is that important? It's important for a number of reasons, but, first and foremost, the FISA court should have had this. The FBI had it. The FISA court should have had it before they went and spied on the Trump campaign by getting a warrant on Carter Page. Another reason why this is important for the FBI is because the Congress, under the Republican control last time, asked for anything and everything on Christopher Steele. Clearly, if we would have had this two-and-a-half years ago, when we started this investigation, we would be in a much different place today than we are."

So someone at the FBI determined to hide this information, not provide it to the court, and what I'm concerned about is, not provide it to the U.S. Congress. So they have until Friday to get it to us. And if they don't, we will make our ninth criminal referral. Basically, we won't know exactly who at the FBI obstructed justice, but some -- Durham or the Department of Justice should be able to figure it out, because there's e-mails that went around, and somebody decided not to give it to the Congress."

And she basically raises her hand, raises a red flag about the Steele dossier. She does her due diligence. She says, look, this is not trustworthy. Christopher Steele's work is not credible. And that memo from Kavalec is not shown to FISA court. This is exculpatory evidence that wasn't included in the FISA warrant. Do you think that the FISA judge may have reacted differently had he known that there were State Department people who were saying this information is not credible, rather than just handing over a warrant to wiretap on Carter Page?"

Number two, they also kept this from congressional investigators, meaning other Republicans that have been investigating this for two-and-a-half years. And this is really important information. And, you know, I think a lot of times Americans are just becoming tone-deaf to this because it's just like one grenade after another. It's like, how many times do we have to see this Russia hoax, how bad it was, and how really what you see -- I think the only way to define this, Maria, is, we have people that are possessed in this country, that continue to perpetuate this Russia hoax, whether it's ignoring important information like this that Kavalec had, whether it's continuing to say, oh, my gosh, bring in Hope Hicks and pretend like something really was wrong here, that Trump really was colluding with Russians. I mean, there's no evidence of this, right? So, the only thing they had on Russians was the Steele dossier, right, and then Joseph Mifsud, who you have talked about on your show. Those are their Russians. But guess what? They're fake Russians. They're phony Russians. They're Fusion Russians. They're Russians that only the Democrats knew about. And the Democrats were the ones that were colluding with Russians. You just can't make this up. So I don't know of a better term to use than you have the Democrats in this city, in Washington, D.C., the media for the most part, 90 percent of them, are possessed individuals."

And that is this. There were two parallel operations that were running at the same time that I believe started in late 2015, early 2016. One is, the FBI was running an investigation into the Trump campaign, not in July of '16, like they said. They're lying about that. It clearly starts in 2015 or early 2016. At the same time, you have the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party running an operation, having their bagmen, Fusion GPS -- they're both running an investigation on a parallel track. The thing that we don't know that we need to get to bottom of is, when did those tracks become one and the same? When -- you know, were there people that were working together with the FBI and Fusion GPS and the Clinton campaign? We know they -- we know at some point they knew about Christopher Steele. My guess is, they knew this a long -- early on in the process, probably January -- at least January, February, March of 2016."

It always seems like, most of the time, it's the conservatives that get kicked off, and you can't see our platforms, or you can't see us on their platforms, where the left, they get away with murder. And so that's -- this discovery process on Twitter starts tomorrow. Then, of course, we have more lawsuits that are on the way.

Peter Doocy is live in Columbia, South Carolina, this morning. And, Peter, was there much talk about the president's decision to call off ICE raids this weekend?"

What he's certainly attempting to accomplish is to distract us from the fact that there are kids today in El Paso in Border Patrol detention centers sleeping on cold concrete with aluminum foil blankets in the dirtiest, most inhumane conditions. That's under this administration."

      "speaker": "DOOCY",
      "utterance": "To hear Joe Biden suggest that the relationship between the U.S. and Iran shouldn't be there is somewhat surprising, because it was Obama- Biden administration that negotiated the much-discussed Iran deal. Biden left South Carolina. He went home to prep for the first debate, which is going to be later on this week. And we don't know yet if anybody in the top tier that's going to share the stage with him will challenge him directly. But if this weekend is any indication, they might not, because at a fish fry on Friday and then at two separate candidate forum-style events here yesterday that went all day, none of the other candidates for the primary on the Democratic side used their time on the stage to challenge number one, Biden."

I want to bring in former Congressman Trey Gowdy. He's former chairman of the House Oversight Committee and former member of the House Judiciary Committee. He's also a former prosecutor and a FOX News contributor. Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "It's entirely appropriate. And, you know, I think some people would tell you Russia wanted her to lose and then, in a binary choice, by default, that means he must win. The intelligence community's always really skittish when people look at their work product. They don't deal in evidence. They don't deal in evidentiary burdens or thresholds. They deal in assessments. And, Maria, you and I can think of some famous examples in the past where their assessments were wrong. So I have got a lot of respect for the intelligence community, but no one is above oversight and review and scrutiny. And if Barr wants to look at the evidentiary foundations for this counterintelligence investigation, he should."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Yes. That's what they always say. I mean, remember the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and then remember the spontaneous reaction to an anti- Muslim video in Libya. That's what Morell told us then, too. You can't interview the analysts. It'll have a chilling effect. OK, then, quit using intelligence products in your criminal justice analysis. If you don't want us applying a criminal analysis to your intelligence work, then quit using it. And I think what we're going to find in 2016 is, the intelligence community was providing information to law enforcement that then went into this investigation, where some Democrats are calling for Donald Trump to be in prison. So you can't have it both ways."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And yet there was some information that actually wasn't presented to the powers that be that were making important decisions. You just heard your former colleague Devin Nunes. He sent a letter to head of the FBI on Friday saying, how come we never saw the Kathleen Kavalec notes, where she raised her hand and said, Christopher Steele's information is not to be trusted?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Yes, you have her assessment, but you also have the FBI's own assessment of Christopher Steele as a source. Have you ever seen that? Have you ever seen the FBI's internal analysis of whether Christopher Steele was reliable? Have you seen the paperwork where he was defrocked as a source because he couldn't follow FBI rules and regulations? Have you seen the exculpatory information as it relates to George Papadopoulos? Here's one, Maria. Have you seen the disparate defensive debriefings that they gave candidate Clinton vs. candidate Trump? And has anyone asked the FBI to explain why they took entirely different tracks with those two debriefings? There's a lot left to be seen by you and your viewers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And you mentioned something the last time you were with us, which we want to come back to. Let's take a short break. More with Trey Gowdy when we come right back. Stay with us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And I'm back with Trey Gowdy. And, Trey, the last time you joined us, we were talking about the informants that the FBI used to entrap certain people, potentially, like George Papadopoulos. And you said that there were certain transcripts that had the potential to persuade people, should they be made public. Now, I know that the president has given the authority to William Barr to declassify certain documents, but can you talk to us a bit more about those transcripts that have the power to persuade? What exactly are we looking for? What's most damning?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think any time law enforcement talks to a target or a potential target, they're either going to record that conversation or they're going to monitor it in real time and take notes. Some of us have seen transcripts of those conversations. And I was supportive of Mueller. I was supportive of the idea to initiate -- to investigate what Russia did. But when I saw this transcript, it actually changed my perspective, because you want to think of law enforcement as being unbiased and disinterested in the outcome, as long as we just find the facts. But when you have information that someone you think has done something wrong has, in fact, not done something wrong, when you have exculpatory information, and you don't share it with others, and then you put that together with Strzok and Page and then the defensive briefings, remember, Maria, the defense of Comey and the media and the Democrats has always been, yes, some in the FBI was biased against Trump, and it didn't matter. This really matters. When you have exculpatory information, and you don't share it with a court, when you give two different kinds of defensive briefings to the candidates, depending on who you like and who you don't, then your bias begins to impact the investigation. That's what I saw when I saw the transcript, but your viewers should be entitled to make up their own minds."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "That is unbelievable. So, in other words, that wasn't presented to the FISA court when they tried to get the warrant to surveil Trump campaign members like Carter Page. Would the FISA judge have acted differently?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, we will never know. But I know this, having been a prosecutor. When you have exculpatory information, something that tends to show the person didn't do what you think they may have done, you have a constitutional obligation to turn that information over to other side."
