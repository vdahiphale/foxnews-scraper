So, Bill Barr is going to be far more transparent than, I think, if the shoe were on the other foot, and this was a Democrat A.G. with an uncharged person.

He was in the Obama administration, a lawyer. He now has a similar problem it sounds like to me.

He said, \"I want to look at the investigations that were done on the Hill. And then, I want to see if there are questions that still aren't answered. And if there are questions still aren't answered about whether or not there was unsubstantiated -- that there wasn't a predicate for basically spying, surveilling members of the Trump campaign, then I think, we all need to know about that because you really -- spying on a campaign is kind of a big deal.

Which also happened into this case. I am really to use Clapper's word stunned that anyone would not want to know, what was the factual predicate for the United States government to monitor the conversations and activities of two campaign officials, regardless of whether they were working for a Republican or a Democrat?

So, he is trying to get attention. Nancy Pelosi, said that Barr was off the rails. If anyone in the country would understand being off the rails, it would be Speaker Pelosi. This is a guy that was voice voted by the Senate. Democrats loved him. They thought he was an institutionalist, he was going to revive the Department of Justice. What they don't like is what he summarized in the Mueller report. That's what they don't like. \"No collusion, and we decided there's no obstruction of justice.\" And now, if that wasn't bad enough, now he's going to say something as crazy as, \"We're going to look at the origins of this investigation to make sure the law was followed.\" That's what they're upset about."

He said, \"He's being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he is trying to mislead people, I think it's just completely bizarre.\" What do you say about that?"

I don't think the Department of Justice should publish derogatory information on someone who has not been charged. So, you get Schiff and others talking about beyond a reasonable doubt, that's what you have to have to convict. They don't even have evidence enough to charge, which is probable cause. So, Bill Barr is going to be far more transparent than, I think, if the shoe were on the other foot, and this was a Democrat A.G. with an uncharged person. Remember what Comey did, and all of us said, when did the government start holding press conferences and announcing derogatory information on people who were not charged? That's exactly what the Democrats want Barr and Mueller to do with President Trump."

Overseeing the special counsel to the extent that they did that. I want to say one other thing here about Greg Craig, who's a name that, you know, people have heard a lot over the years. He was in the Obama administration, a lawyer. He now has a similar problem it sounds like to me. And you can tell me what the -- his legal situation is kind of like what Mike Flynn went through in terms of not registering as a federal agent and doing work for the Ukraine.

So, if you want a blind justice system, if you want her to wear a blindfold, I think that's good. He is presumed to innocent. It is Mueller indicting a Democrat.

He was charged by the Justice Department for his role in the Chelsea Manning hack of the Pentagon, and of Defense documents -- very sensitive information. WikiLeaks also famously released e-mails from the DNC and top Clinton aide John Podesta, sprinkling them from the summer of 2016 all the way through November.

Julian Assange was then dragged out of the embassy and into a London courtroom where a judge berated him for being a narcissist who can't get beyond his own self-interest. The court appearance is the first step to Assange being extradited to the U.S. to face charges of conspiring with former Army Intel Analyst Chelsea Manning to break into a classified government computer at the Pentagon and publish secret military cables. Chelsea Manning spent several years in prison for leaking the classified documents until former President Obama commuted her sentence. Manning is once again in custody in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks.

Now, he's been living for six years in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. Remember, he didn't go there because of these charges, he went there because he was an accused rapist in Sweden, to give you a sense of the character of the men with which we're dealing. But I guess he's used to dealing and are living in small places so a federal prison cell will be a good place for him to be. Frankly, I'm glad Chelsea Manning is back behind bars as well.

It's the last straw for the hedge fund owner who is the guy who pulls the money strings at the National Enquirer. Now it looks like the Enquirer is just days from being sold because it's become an embarrassment, it's not only a financial albatross but a political liability. Based both on the Bezos controversy. And remember, this comes after a short time after the CEO of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, a close friend of President Trump entered into an immunity deal and admitted trying to influence the election by paying off the sort of catch and kill technique that former Playboy model Karen McDougal who made the allegations about having an affair with Donald Trump."

The studies -- multiple studies using liberal and nonpartisan studies data have shown that this thing is going to cost $32.5 trillion. To put that in perspective, our national debt is $22 trillion. And that is based on the older version of the Sanders plan. The new version is much more of that. No co-pays, no premiums, no cost whatsoever. How are we going to pay for that? Sanders doesn't say anywhere in his plan how are we going to pay for it. He makes a vague reference to a tax on extreme wealth. Well, the only person who is put forward a tax on extreme wealth is Elizabeth -- is Elizabeth Warren and according to the Washington Post analysis of her plan, it only brings in $2.75 trillion, so we are about $30 trillion short.

Every piece of your phone, Martha, the planes we fly on, the satellites we use, all came from government funded R&D. We've gotten away from that and the rest of the world is all in. We used to by far lead the world. The government didn't fund R&D, now we are barely in the top 10 and that's a large cost of productivity slow down."

Sometimes it seems like sex is everywhere but a new study says that the problem is it's not, it blames in part the liberation movement of the ‘60s which was supposed to make everybody freer and happier and more like those folks and less constrained by social institutions. But it shows that happiness among young adults in America fell to a record low in 2018 while the share of Americans having sex at least once a week also plummeted to a new low from 59 percent in 1972 to 49 percent into 2018. Two social scientists ultimately concluding that declining sex is at least partly about family and religious changes that make it harder for people to achieve stable couple life at a young age. And if we -- if we'd like more young adults to experience that joy of sex, we will either have to revive those institutions and find -- or find new ways to kindle love in the rising generation. I just had a lot. Joining me now, Lila Rose, founder and president of Live Action, and Cathy Areu, founder of Catalina magazine. So, Cathy, did the women's movement make us less happy?"

Sociological studies over the last 30, 40, 50 years prove it time and time again, if you put love first, then you put marriage, then you put sex, then you put babies, and if you believe in God and you make that a part of your life, you go to -- you go to faith services, you are going to be happier.

And you know, I think when you look at studies like this, maybe some of that didn't really work. I mean, Gloria Steinem and Jane Fonda gave us all these messages growing up, Cathy.
