BREAKING TONIGHT, we are covering two major stories, even more turmoil as hard as that is to be believed this evening among Democrats over the chaotic Iowa caucuses.  The head of the National Democratic Party wants a recanvass. The head of the state Democratic Party, says that request is not good enough to get it done. We'll explain.  Meanwhile, Republicans seem to be as united tonight as Democrats are divided. President Trump turned an expected impeachment victory lap into a marathon today, alternately praising his supporters and castigating his detractors in an hour-long stream of consciousness performance, ending with thanks for all who stuck with him, including his family.  Also tonight, the top Democrat in Congress says it's imperative the country have a new president next year and called Tuesday's State of the Union speech, a copy. Of which she dramatically tore up, a manifesto of mistruth. The president called Speaker Pelosi, an evil person today. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts, starts us off on this evening. Just another one from the North Lawn. John?",

His supporters, Byron, would say he's entitled to it because it's been a long haul and he feels justified to be able to say these are the people that stuck with me. These are the people who didn't. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": After a big traumatic event, politicians sometimes say it's a time for healing and to bring the country together. This was not that, not anywhere close. But it was classic, classic Donald Trump. He extravagantly praised the members of Congress, House and Senate who had defended him so often either in Congress or on television. And he extravagantly criticized all the villains of the piece, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and others. And I think really the question that comes out of it is, is this show just going to continue? Will Democrats continue, and as Mike Emanuel was reporting, continue their investigations, more subpoenas, more this, all the way through the spring and the summer and into the campaign?

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": There's a lot of Democratic anger about losing on impeachment, although that was, of course, preordained from the start. I actually think there's a debate going on in the Democratic Party about exactly how to proceed, because Nancy Pelosi has been pretty focused on trying to pass legislation, much of it goes to the Senate and dies there, that affects people's lives, like the chant that you heard of the State of the Union of HR-3, which the prescription drug bill that the House has passed that's waiting in the Senate. So I think Nancy Pelosi does have a sense that that's what they need to do in the next year.

BREAKING TONIGHT, we are covering two major stories, even more turmoil as hard as that is to be believed this evening among Democrats over the chaotic Iowa caucuses. The head of the National Democratic Party wants a recanvass. The head of the state Democratic Party, says that request is not good enough to get it done. We'll explain. Meanwhile, Republicans seem to be as united tonight as Democrats are divided. President Trump turned an expected impeachment victory lap into a marathon today, alternately praising his supporters and castigating his detractors in an hour-long stream of consciousness performance, ending with thanks for all who stuck with him, including his family. Also tonight, the top Democrat in Congress says it's imperative the country have a new president next year and called Tuesday's State of the Union speech, a copy. Of which she dramatically tore up, a manifesto of mistruth. The president called Speaker Pelosi, an evil person today. Chief White House correspondent John Roberts, starts us off on this evening. Just another one from the North Lawn. John?"

However, Sanders leads in the popular vote. The Democratic Party's top official wants a recanvass of the whole thing. His counterpart in Iowa appears to be resisting. All of this happens as the candidates focus on Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire. We have \"FOX TEAM COVERAGE\". Peter Doocy in Derry, New Hampshire, shows us what the contenders are doing today.

Just after 11:00 a.m., a tweet from Tom Perez, the chairman of the DNC read, \"Enough is enough. In light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in results, I am calling on the Iowa Democratic Party to immediately begin to recanvass.\" Now, this follows reports of human error in the precincts on caucus night. Of paper records being sent by snail mail and a reliance on a smartphone app, which had not been subject to stringent testing. The chairman of Iowa's Democratic Party responded that they need to finish the original caucus tally, and request for a recanvassing, needs to come from the campaigns. Part of the statement from Troy Price, reads, \"Should any presidential campaign in compliance with the Iowa Delegate Selection Plan request to recanvass, the Iowa Democratic Party is prepared.

We didn't think it could get any stranger, but the fact that Tom Perez comes in today and throws another kind of wrench into this, what does this mean to you?

I cannot imagine that four years from now, Democrats allow there to be caucuses in Iowa to start off this process after these results. And in fact, I think the party is moving away from caucuses. And generally, seem very archaic, they seem undemocratic. And the fact that counting them is so complicated that apparently it can't be done in the space of day after day, just unacceptable."

I mean, he cannot afford another -- he doesn't necessarily have to win. But he can't afford another fourth-place finish that's double digits behind the two leaders. And that looks to be kind of where he is right now. You mentioned Pete Buttigieg has definitely got a bump out of this. Bernie Sanders has not really, his numbers are still -- is still solid up there. But I think he was really robbed off potentially. And I -- you just sit there and you listen to Bernie talk about this. I mean, just imagine what Donald Trump would have done in the same situation. Bernie Sanders is sort of taking this, I think very, very well and very gentlemanly, probably not the way many of the supporters are feeling. And we'll see whether it cost him in the end."

In the past, they kept them secret, and they just told you they calculated these delegate equivalents. And then, they announced that to the public, and we didn't know how many votes any candidate had gotten. And it was because it was very close between Bernie and Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Sanders people pushed and pushed and pushed and forced this reform. And what it is done, it is open the curtain and shown a really, really messy project, much messier than we ever really thought."

He may do something that no one's ever done before, which is skip those early states, come in late in the game, and take it away. Especially if we -- if we continue to see Sanders doing well, when the first state popular vote likely to win New Hampshire, and Joe Biden continuing to falter. That is the scenario that Bloomberg was counting on to create an opening for him to come in on Super Tuesday, do well in California and other big states, and we have a race."

The POLITICO has a report saying that \"A half dozen women of color have departed Elizabeth Warren's Nevada campaign in the run-up to the state's caucuses with complaints of a toxic work environment in which minorities felt tokenized and senior leadership was at loggerheads. The six staffers have left the roughly 70-person Nevada team since November, during a critical stretch for the race. Three of them said they felt marginalized by the campaign, a situation they said didn't change or worsened after they took their concerns to their superiors or on to human resources staff.\" Josh Kraushaar, our friend, says, \"Yikes. As bad as Biden's Iowa fall out is, arguable that Warren's in even worse shape, in fourth in a state next to her home state where voters know her well, and now this story raising serious questions about her viability in Nevada.\" I mean, these stories are heading up."

He's risen in the national polls, but the last poll I saw at a California had him at four percent. So, he's spending all this money and he's going to be spending even more, he's going to -- I think, hire 800 staffers, I think in California, sending letters to 2.5 million people. I'm not sure it's getting him where he needs to go, he may be wasting a lot of money. If Biden falters, that creates more opportunity for him, but I'm not sure that the Michael Bloomberg scenario is going to play out."

That's obviously one of his goals, but he is committed to doing this even if he ends up not as a nominee, keeping his folks on staff, continuing to buy these huge amounts in T.V. ads. And his T.V. ads have been interesting, and that they target Trump. They don't target the other Democrats. In this way. Bloomberg could be a factor regardless of whether he becomes a nominee."

Doctor, say other babies born to infected mothers have tested negative. So, further study is needed to determine whether the virus can spread from mother to child in the womb. In Japan, health officials say, 20 passengers aboard a quarantine cruise ship more than Yokohama port have tested positive for the coronavirus including three Americans. And the State Department continues to evacuate U.S. travelers from Wuhan, bringing them to U.S. military bases for 14-day quarantines."

The president's victory lap was unique. We hadn't seen anything like that in the East Room of the White House. His supporters, Byron, would say he's entitled to it because it's been a long haul and he feels justified to be able to say these are the people that stuck with me. These are the people who didn't. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": After a big traumatic event, politicians sometimes say it's a time for healing and to bring the country together. This was not that, not anywhere close. But it was classic, classic Donald Trump. He extravagantly praised the members of Congress, House and Senate who had defended him so often either in Congress or on television. And he extravagantly criticized all the villains of the piece, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and others. And I think really the question that comes out of it is, is this show just going to continue? Will Democrats continue, and as Mike Emanuel was reporting, continue their investigations, more subpoenas, more this, all the way through the spring and the summer and into the campaign? Or will it actually turn to issues at some point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "It seemed like Nancy Pelosi, Susan, was saying it is going to continue. She mentioned the Supreme Court decision on his taxes, the president's taxes, whether that can come out. She mentioned the court decision about whether the former White House Chief of Staff Don McGahn can testify, and we are hearing about possible subpoenas for John Bolton. SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": There's a lot of Democratic anger about losing on impeachment, although that was, of course, preordained from the start. I actually think there's a debate going on in the Democratic Party about exactly how to proceed, because Nancy Pelosi has been pretty focused on trying to pass legislation, much of it goes to the Senate and dies there, that affects people's lives, like the chant that you heard of the State of the Union of HR-3, which the prescription drug bill that the House has passed that's waiting in the Senate. So I think Nancy Pelosi does have a sense that that's what they need to do in the next year. But Democrats are mad enough that it will not be possible, I think, to constrain them from continuing to do some oversight, and certainly to continue to pursue these court cases that are already in the works."

I don't think politically, though, I think this has been a debacle for the Democrats. I don't think it's helped them and I don't think they want to extend it. I think the cooler heads in the Democratic Party will take a look at this and say, look, this did not go the way he wanted it to. And as Guy Cecil said, this is the irony is the Democratic candidates for president haven't really been talking about impeachment. They've been talking about issues, but they have struggled to get the message through because everybody inside this town, the media and the Democrats have been focused on impeachment for so long there's been that real disconnect."

And I think she looked worse than he did on State of the Union night because he did appear to shun a handshake, but this whole tearing thing was really quite extraordinary. I think the most practical argument against impeachment was always that we are going to have an election in nine months. Two or three months from now, that argument will be actually far stronger, and at some point you can't just be impeaching on Election Day. Maybe I shouldn't say that, but I don't think you can.

He also gave -- I think he also gave some protection for some of those conservative Democrats like Joe Manchin who might have considered voting to acquit the president on at least one count of impeachment. So I think he had actually a big effect. You can disagree with where Mitt Romney came down on this, and every other Republican did. I think it is unseemly, though, to say he didn't do it for the reasons that he said. I think he's a man of faith. He talks about his faith.
