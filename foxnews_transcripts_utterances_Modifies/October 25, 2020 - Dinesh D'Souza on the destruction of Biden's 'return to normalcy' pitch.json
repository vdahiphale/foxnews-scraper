Dinesh D'Souza explains how the Left's radical rhetoric already reveals that Joe has no control. But first, the Dems abortion litmus test. That's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\"   We saw it coming for years, but with the possible Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, the anti-Christian and anti-Catholic bigotry within the Democrat Party is now undeniable. Now, I'm going to say it even more starkly. Joe Biden, a Roman Catholic, is now presiding over a party that has an ugly vendetta against all people of strong, traditional faith. Democrats revealed their antipathy toward Barrett's faith background during her confirmation hearing to the appellate court a few years ago.",

Now, in response, Kennedy gave a absolutely stirring defense of his candidacy and of religious liberty.    JOHN F. KENNEDY, 35TH U.S. PRESIDENT: If I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied that I had tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people.",

She's a practicing Roman Catholic, a mother of seven children, a judicial textualist and unfailingly respectful and courteous, even when her critics are the opposite.  Since Democrats have pegged their entire existence on preserving Roe v. Wade - they'll die on that hill, they've shunned and expelled pretty much all pro-Life members of their own party. Now, that means excluding from their ranks every Christian, Jew and Muslim in the entire country who believe in traditional gender roles and protecting innocent life, and so be it.  And now they don't even pretend to hide their anti-Catholicism. In November 2019, Letitia James, the rabid product- abortion, New York Attorney General, announced that henceforth no money from the Democratic Attorneys General Association would go to pro-Life Democrats. None of those AG candidates would get a penny. In fact, they had to publicly swear fealty to abortion rights to get money. Now, what a far cry from the time when the Democrat Party still cared about appealing to the country's religious voters, many of whom were pro-Life. In 1993, President Bill Clinton stated his party's abortion views this way.   BILL CLINTON, 42ND U.S. PRESIDENT: an approach that seeks to protect the right to choose while reducing the number of abortions. Our vision should be of an America where abortion is safe and legal, but rare.",

Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and her Marxist mavens perhaps don't realize that the constitution and Article VI expressly states that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. Get it?   The Left always proclaims that views that they oppose are somehow outside the mainstream. That's a little trick. First, if you believe in the proper role of judges, you know that their political or cultural views should be irrelevant to judging. Second, support for abortion-on-demand in America isn't overwhelming at all. In fact, 47 years after Roe, the country is still bitterly divided on the issue, which is another reason why it was better left up to the States.  And by the way, according to a Gallup poll on abortion from May 2020, 24 percent of Democrats identify as pro-Life. 41 percent of women say they're pro-Life, as to 43 percent of non-White voters. Are they all out the window for the Democrats as well, they just don't count?  Additionally - and this always shocks the liberal elites, 55 percent of Americans say abortion should be illegal or allowed in only a few circumstances. But the Democrats have really got themselves in a pickle here, because they're so invested in using the court as a way to advance a far Left social agenda that they can't get past and the regular legislative process, that they've alienated millions and millions and millions of moderate voters in rural and suburban America, like the people represented in that Gallup poll. Now, of course, Democrats, all right, they think you're really stupid. They think that you're going to forgive and forget all of their efforts to cancel the faithful from public life, by the way, by using meaningless generalities about Joe's faith.",

They've move so far Left on cultural issues, they're so wedded to Roe that they exclude and demonize people from their own church who hold traditional views on life, marriage and human sexuality. All the while bragging about how they cherish diversity and inclusivity. By the way, those are total lies. Yesterday Newsweek published a story entitled, How Charismatic Catholic Groups like Amy Coney Barrett's People of Praise Inspired 'The Handmaid's Tale'. Now, that's like saying your church inspired The Da Vinci Code, but it doesn't make the fiction true, no matter what group inspired it. Now, this defamatory piece contradicts itself when it states that Atwood was inspired by an entirely different group with no connection to this people of praise. Amazingly, Newsweek left the piece up, despite having to issue this embarrassing correction. \"This article's headline originally stated that People of Praise inspired The Handmaid's Tale. A New Yorker profile of the author from 2017 mentions a newspaper clipping as part of a research for the book of a different charismatic Catholic group. People of Hope. Newsweek regrets the error.\"  But this is how the Left always operates. Depict a benevolent, charismatic faithful prayer group, which counts Catholic Bishops, by the way, as their members, portray that as an evil cult and then attempt to use it against a judge who has the audacity to believe in God. Now, I fully expect the upcoming confirmation hearing will showcase Democrats supreme desire to excommunicate the faithful from serving in any prominent capacity in government. And their actions will once again demonstrate how fundamentally they misconstrue the Constitution, their proper advise and consent role, and the function of nine justices who sit on the court itself.",

We don't have the right in this country to impose our religious beliefs on other people. It's fine that she's Catholic. That's up to her. She has that freedom under this constitution. And you're right, there is no religious test. But when you point out that an organization opposes the right to choose, you oppose - they have other positions that have been taken, it is perfectly legitimate to question a potential lifetime appointee about their position on things that could affect millions of Americans' reproductive freedom. So yes, so I expect a vigorous debate, especially given the climate that Mitch McConnell has created for judicial nominees.

The Constitution, as you know, is very clear that it is the legislatures of the states that prescribe the method by which electors for the Electoral College are to be selected. And while all states use the popular vote, it's the legislature that lays out the rules for conducting that popular vote election.

He's going into the parts of these states where the people really appreciate that their president is going there and fighting for them and making sure that he's going to be there for their jobs, for their healthcare, and to keep their taxes low. So President Trump I think is absolutely running laps around the Biden teleprompter right now.",

And now, who is threatening to pack the court? Let's be really clear, Laura. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the court must have nine justices. One could have a decent argument, should the court have 15 justices, and that would, of course, diminish the power of any given president, Republican or Democrat, to dramatically influence the court.

Now, in response, Kennedy gave a absolutely stirring defense of his candidacy and of religious liberty. JOHN F. KENNEDY, 35TH U.S. PRESIDENT: If I should lose on the real issues, I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied that I had tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans lost their chance of being President on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people."

She's a practicing Roman Catholic, a mother of seven children, a judicial textualist and unfailingly respectful and courteous, even when her critics are the opposite. Since Democrats have pegged their entire existence on preserving Roe v. Wade - they'll die on that hill, they've shunned and expelled pretty much all pro-Life members of their own party. Now, that means excluding from their ranks every Christian, Jew and Muslim in the entire country who believe in traditional gender roles and protecting innocent life, and so be it. And now they don't even pretend to hide their anti-Catholicism. In November 2019, Letitia James, the rabid product- abortion, New York Attorney General, announced that henceforth no money from the Democratic Attorneys General Association would go to pro-Life Democrats. None of those AG candidates would get a penny. In fact, they had to publicly swear fealty to abortion rights to get money. Now, what a far cry from the time when the Democrat Party still cared about appealing to the country's religious voters, many of whom were pro-Life. In 1993, President Bill Clinton stated his party's abortion views this way. BILL CLINTON, 42ND U.S. PRESIDENT: an approach that seeks to protect the right to choose while reducing the number of abortions. Our vision should be of an America where abortion is safe and legal, but rare."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Rare? Well, that's now totally out of the window. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and her Marxist mavens perhaps don't realize that the constitution and Article VI expressly states that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. Get it? The Left always proclaims that views that they oppose are somehow outside the mainstream. That's a little trick. First, if you believe in the proper role of judges, you know that their political or cultural views should be irrelevant to judging. Second, support for abortion-on-demand in America isn't overwhelming at all. In fact, 47 years after Roe, the country is still bitterly divided on the issue, which is another reason why it was better left up to the States. And by the way, according to a Gallup poll on abortion from May 2020, 24 percent of Democrats identify as pro-Life. 41 percent of women say they're pro-Life, as to 43 percent of non-White voters. Are they all out the window for the Democrats as well, they just don't count? Additionally - and this always shocks the liberal elites, 55 percent of Americans say abortion should be illegal or allowed in only a few circumstances. But the Democrats have really got themselves in a pickle here, because they're so invested in using the court as a way to advance a far Left social agenda that they can't get past and the regular legislative process, that they've alienated millions and millions and millions of moderate voters in rural and suburban America, like the people represented in that Gallup poll. Now, of course, Democrats, all right, they think you're really stupid. They think that you're going to forgive and forget all of their efforts to cancel the faithful from public life, by the way, by using meaningless generalities about Joe's faith."

All the while bragging about how they cherish diversity and inclusivity. By the way, those are total lies. Yesterday Newsweek published a story entitled, How Charismatic Catholic Groups like Amy Coney Barrett's People of Praise Inspired 'The Handmaid's Tale'. Now, that's like saying your church inspired The Da Vinci Code, but it doesn't make the fiction true, no matter what group inspired it. Now, this defamatory piece contradicts itself when it states that Atwood was inspired by an entirely different group with no connection to this people of praise. Amazingly, Newsweek left the piece up, despite having to issue this embarrassing correction. \"This article's headline originally stated that People of Praise inspired The Handmaid's Tale. A New Yorker profile of the author from 2017 mentions a newspaper clipping as part of a research for the book of a different charismatic Catholic group. People of Hope. Newsweek regrets the error.\" But this is how the Left always operates. Depict a benevolent, charismatic faithful prayer group, which counts Catholic Bishops, by the way, as their members, portray that as an evil cult and then attempt to use it against a judge who has the audacity to believe in God. Now, I fully expect the upcoming confirmation hearing will showcase Democrats supreme desire to excommunicate the faithful from serving in any prominent capacity in government. And their actions will once again demonstrate how fundamentally they misconstrue the Constitution, their proper advise and consent role, and the function of nine justices who sit on the court itself."

And as your \"Angle\" says, the Constitution is clear, there can be no religious test, consistent with the law.

And you're right, there is no religious test.

But here's the problem, it might jeopardize these same people who are trying to restore their civil rights, because it might be breaking federal law. Federal law makes it a crime to pay for, or offer to pay for or receive money for voting.

That is a thing of value. So he would also be creating tax liability, in addition to jeopardizing their criminal freedom. Now, they're finally trying to restore the rights and he's screwing it up."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, Christian, you you've hit the federal law at play, and now tax implications. But here's what Florida law says about buying votes. \"No person shall directly or indirectly give or promise anything of value to another intending thereby to buy the person or another person's vote or to corruptly influence that person and other casting his or her vote,\" et cetera, et cetera - a third degree felony there. Could Bloomberg be in violation of that?"

      "speaker": "ADAMS",

So if you indirectly give somebody something of value, which is, namely pay their debt, the real question is whether or not you're buying their vote, you're getting them to vote in exchange for that. And I think that's kind of what Bloomberg said he's doing, isn't it? So it really is a real unfortunate situation. You thought you've seen everything until this year, the avalanche of money that's affecting this election is just astonishing."

It's more opaque. But Christian, fascinating, we're going to be following this. Thanks so much. And as Bloomberg meddles in Florida's election, the GOP is challenging a recent court ruling that could let Democrats steal the race and Pennsylvania. Well, Republicans are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a State High court order that mail-in-ballots received days after the election must be counted. But that's just one of several recent rulings out of swing states, threatening the integrity of the November 3rd election. here to break it all down as former acting U.S. Attorney General George Terwilliger. Attorney General Terwilliger courts in Wisconsin, in Michigan, have also extended the deadlines for mail-in-ballots and a lot of Republicans very worried that these votes will be miraculously found regardless how much Trump might win a state by, they'll always find just enough in the mail ins, a week, two weeks later, to make up the difference. Is that a concern?"

When somebody either fakes a vote or gets a vote twice or something like that, it dilutes every legitimate voter's vote and that that's a civil right to have your vote counted on the basis of the one person, one vote standard. But even of more concerned right now, at least to me, is that that judges are already getting into the act with changing these kinds of election rules. The Constitution, as you know, is very clear that it is the legislatures of the states that prescribe the method by which electors for the Electoral College are to be selected. And while all states use the popular vote, it's the legislature that lays out the rules for conducting that popular vote election. And with judges already stepping in and changing those rules when elections are already underway, there are a number of laws, including federal laws, that are implicated. And those laws have been cited, at least in the Pennsylvania case, that we are already asking the Supreme Court to step in and take a look."

What are the state combinations the Trump team is now looking at? JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN POLLSTER: You can see -- again, you were pointing out that Joe Biden is quitting on a lot of days around 12:00 because his teleprompter is very hard to move out and keep up with the president. But when he does go out, you can tell he's following the president precisely to the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. He even brushed off the teleprompter to go to Florida and give two speeches. So when you're looking at the polls, and the media polls are coming out every day. There's tight battleground polls that look good for the president, whether it's North Carolina within the last 24 hours, Iowa, or Georgia, Joe Biden has got a lot of ground to cover with that teleprompter."

For a lot time I thought Wisconsin was going to be the tipping point state, but for all the reasons you mentioned, if you look at that 2016 map, Donald Trump could lose 36 electoral votes and still win 270 to 268. If he holds onto Florida, holds onto North Carolina, and wins Pennsylvania, he can lose Michigan, he can lose Wisconsin, he can even Arizona. And if he hangs onto Nebraska's second district and Maine's second district, it will be to 269- 269 tie. But I think Pennsylvania is key.

And Biden is having some virtual events and a few smaller events, but you have the circles and everyone is in the circle.

And a week from today you have a big debate coming up. So I don't know whether Biden is resting up for that or he's got to figure out how to make the teleprompter work during the day, but the president is out there, and he's going places were no president has ever been before, parts of the country where he's going into the exurb counties. He's going into the parts of these states where the people really appreciate that their president is going there and fighting for them and making sure that he's going to be there for their jobs, for their healthcare, and to keep their taxes low.

Which side has been unleashing paramilitary gangs on the street to loot and burn and harass people eating on sidewalks? Which party has been deploying the deep state, the police agencies of government against political opponents? The answer is it's the left, it's the Democrats. And now, who is threatening to pack the court? Let's be really clear, Laura. There is nothing in the Constitution that says the court must have nine justices. One could have a decent argument, should the court have 15 justices, and that would, of course, diminish the power of any given president, Republican or Democrat, to dramatically influence the court. But that's not what the Democrats are talking about. They don't just want an expansion of the number of justices. They want to stack the court. And that's a completely different matter.

      "utterance": "Well, the Democrats for a long time have counted on the Republicans to be the party of the nice guys. The Democrats basically assume that we will never do to them what they do to us. They can knock down our monuments, we will never knock their monuments. They can stack the court. We won't stack the court. And I think the answer to this is we have got to learn to call them on their bluff. If they want to put forward a court stacking plan, and we happen to win the House next time, maybe we should adopt their plan, and in the spirit of bipartisanship, pack the court ourselves."

      "utterance": "This is an embarrassment. First of all, people talk about Obama as a constitutional law professor. Here's a guy who has never published a scholarly article on any subject in his life. The other point is that I think that we saw in the Kavanaugh hearings when they trotted out one accusation after another, and you notice that at the end of it, when Kavanaugh was seated, all the accusations evaporated."
