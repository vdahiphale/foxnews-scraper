      "sentences": "We've got the full tape of the raid. We'll play it for you. James O'Keefe will join us in just a moment with more details. Also tonight, the great one Mark Levin, he will weigh in on Ukraine and, of course, the Supreme Court nomination. The hearings going on in D.C. But first again, tonight, we turn to Ukraine where, against all odds, the city of Mariupol is refusing to surrender. Encircled by Russian forces, they're cut off from food, water, power with weeks of nothing but in -- look at -- look at this, it's been leveled, indiscriminate shelling. The suffering is unimaginable. Look at your screen. This is Mariupol, every single building is a blown out shell. A once booming European metropolis, home to half a million people has pretty much now been reduced to rubble. We don't know how many civilians are still alive, but we do know that dead men, women and children are being buried in mass graves, even as we speak. And those lucky enough to still be alive, they're without food and water and clean facilities and medical care. They're hopelessly trapped, effectively held hostage by Russian forces. You have no problem firing on innocent, unarmed civilians. That would be hell on earth what you're looking at. Now, this is Vladimir Putin's legacy, all this innocent blood, women, men, children, that's on his hands. This is literally evil in our own time. How much more suffering does Joe Biden, do our NATO allies need to see before they give Ukraine, they're not looking for boots on the ground nor should we give it to them, but they're looking for the weaponry so they can beat back Vladimir Putin and his forces? They need more. The American people, however, never underestimate them, they get it. Look at this brand new poll just released by FOX News, an overwhelming majority of you the American people want the U.S. to do more to help Ukraine, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans. Now, the same poll shows a whopping of Americans are in favor of sending weapons to Ukraine, only 42 percent approve of Biden's response. Now, why do you think that is? Because Biden has, as usual, been dragging his feet, undecisive, afraid of Vladimir the whole time, all while the Ukrainian people are fighting for their lives. Now, you the American people clearly support what I have been saying and that is the Reagan and the Trump doctrines, peace through strength -- provide the weapons so Ukraine can win and not one American boot on the ground. For all you people lying about my position, not one American boot on the ground. Ukraine, no, it's not a perfect country, but guess what? Vladimir Putin invaded a sovereign country, he was not provoked in any way. Ukraine is not carpet bombing cities. Vladimir Putin is. Ukraine is not killing innocent women and children Vladimir Putin is. Ukraine is not pursuing their territorial ambitions if they even have them, but Vladimir Putin is. And Putin keeps threatening, oh, I may use nukes or other weapons of mass destruction, biological, chemical weapons now Putin is the guy that has nuclear weapons pointed at, oh, this city, New York City, Washington, D.C., and other states in the United States and not Ukraine. And like most bullies, Putin will only respond to strength. So, Biden needs to stop bubbling and fizzing every time Vladimir makes a threat like a potential cyberattack or chemical weapons attack or a nuclear attack. We already knew before this ever happened that he had that capability. What Biden needs to do is start preparing for any and every worst case scenario and he needs to let Putin know himself in no uncertain terms that his threats do not scare us. He is the one that needs to be worried, not us. Because if he chooses to go that route, which is separate and apart from what's happening in Ukraine guess what America and NATO must unleash hell on Russia. There's no other answer. He will decide if that happens, not us. He will start it we'll have no option but to finish it. Does anybody want this? No, God forbid. Pray for the best but always be prepared for the worst. Now, the U.S. has the most powerful military, the most powerful economy on the face of the Earth. Our capabilities are unmatched. We have the capacity to ruin Putin's world forever and we should not be cowering in fear the way Joe is. Right now, Joe is in Europe and two things that should be happening likely will not be happening. One, Joe must reaffirm our commitment to supply Ukraine and as fast as possible with whatever supplies they need that would be Javelin missiles. Stinger missiles, air defense systems, drones and, yes, the MiG fighter jets that Joe Biden personally vetoed. Let Poland, Joe, give Ukraine the planes. You can stay out of it, let Poland do what Poland wants to do. They're living right next to Ukraine. They may be next. And number two, it is time for the Western world to now completely cut Russia off financially in every way possible. The way to win this conflict is to defeat Vladimir Putin economically. I've said that from day one. That means importing no more Russian oil or gas until Putin is gone and those troops are pulled back and they go back home to Russia. And that means every NATO ally, every Western European country they need to stop all Russian energy imports. No more Iranian nuclear deals negotiated by Russia. Stop talking to the murdering dictator thug in Venezuela, Joe. Why on earth would we give cash and other currency to mullahs in Iran that chant death to America and a deal that's brokered by Russia? Are you that dumb? Are you that stupid? Do you not see what's happening? Why would we loosen restrictions on Iran's nuclear program? They are the number one state sponsor terror, Joe. You get the presidential daily briefings every day, I don't. But we know that to be the truth. They have a sick, twisted, ugly ideology. They hate us. They hate Israel. How does any of that make any sense? So, tonight, Joe also needs to send a very clear warning to Belarus. That is the -- this European -- Eastern European country ruled by one of Putin's puppets and now there are mixed reports about whether or not they are amassing soldiers and military equipment to join the invasion of Ukraine. Now, Belarus needs to know if they send soldiers into Ukraine, the consequences for them should be dire but let's see if Europe, NATO, Western European countries have the backbone. The end goal of all of this is stop Putin and Russia's advance and prevent World War III. We don't want World War III. We don't want to be dragged into World War III. We want our American treasure to stay right here at home. Remember, an attack on one NATO country, Article 5, is an attack on all countries. If Putin fails in Ukraine, he'll never be able to wage war in the Baltics or Poland or any other NATO country. This is not a difficult concept to understand, unless, of course, you're Joe Biden and you don't know that today is Wednesday. Now, the war in Ukraine is not -- is right now at a very critical juncture. Putin has his eyes on the historic port city Odessa, and that's not stopping the city's residents from preparing for the worst while remaining calm. Take a look at this video. They're preparing to be invaded. They're playing one of Jon Bon Jovi's anthem songs. \"It's Our Life\", now or never. Take a look.",

For once, make a foreign policy decision that makes sense, Joe. Joe, wake up. It's Wednesday. I know you're tired. You traveled. By the way, this strategy is currently working, and now with his invasion stalled, meaning Putin's, many top Russian officials are going missing in action, including Russia's top minister of defense. He's not been seen apparently for 12 days. Here with more, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. I will say this. The Reagan doctrine worked in Afghanistan and Nicaragua. The Trump doctrine is a little different because the weaponry is way more sophisticated and modern technology allows buttons to be pushed from anywhere in the U.S. and we can hit any target we want with pinpoint accuracy, and that's how he beat the caliphate, took out Soleimani and Baghdadi. But the Reagan doctrine is working here, but I think we need to ratchet up the weapons of defense that Ukraine needs.",

Here's what's not working: he is not deterring Putin from destroying the great people of the Ukraine. God bless Ukraine and damn Putin to hell. And he is not deterring China for being provocative in Asia and he's about to do a deal with a religious Nazi called the ayatollah. This NATO summit can be a disaster. It can be a resounding success depending on what happens. If NATO will tell Putin with clarity, if you use chemical weapons, we will establish a no-fly zone. If you explode a nuclear device inside of Ukraine, we'll consider that attack on NATO itself because the radiation will flow throughout Europe. And tell China right now before it's too late that if you keep giving aid to Putin, we will sanction you and here are the sanctions.",

By the way, I actually agree with Rand Paul, I think at some point down the line, Ukraine should pay us back for every weapon we give them, find a way to pass back, but we don't need payment up front. But without those weapons, they cannot defend their country. It seems like they're barely hanging on by a thread here but they're on the precipice potentially of pushing Putin not only back but out of their country.",

Biden told us two weeks three weeks before the invasion is going to happen. Why didn't you start flowing weapons into Ukraine before the invasion? Now, 28 days later, they still don't have the MiGs that Poland's willing to transfer. They still don't have the S-300 system that can knock down a bomber. So Biden has not been all in. He assumed that Putin would win in the Ukraine would lose, and he can't embrace the idea that Ukraine can win. I embrace it. I disagree with Rand Paul. You know, the Ukrainian people have paid back the whole freaking world by standing up to this thug Putin and standing up for democracy against a dictator. They have sacrificed. They have lost their cities. They have lost their children. So they don't owe me a damn thing. Here's what we owe them: everything we can give them we should give them. If there's chemical weapons dropped on these brave people by Putin, we should declare no-fly zone because that's the breach of every protocol in the world. And if he explodes a nuclear device inside a Ukraine to scare the world off, we should consider that an attack on NATO because it would infect all of Europe. So let's get tough with this guy. If NATO is not clear about what we will do regarding chemical weapons and the use of nuclear weapons, this summit will be a failure.",

I can't think of one single thing they've done that is successful and has better the lives of the American people. They're refusing to hold bad actors across the globe accountable. They're refusing to confront growing aggression, not only from Russia but China and Iran. Now, they're sucking up to the mullahs in Iran and the dictator in Venezuela. We have brand new FOX polling out today that shows Americans are skeptical of Biden's strategy. Only 42 percent of Americans approve of Biden's Ukraine response, a whopping 76 percent approve of President Zelenskyy's handling of the Russian invasion, 63 percent of you the American people say the U.S. should be doing more to fight Russia, 78 percent of Americans favor sending military equipment to Ukraine. Here with reaction, he is the host of the number one show Sunday nights, 8:00 p.m., \"Life, Liberty and Levin\", also nationally syndicated radio host, I call him the great one. You know, Mark, I've been talking a lot to this audience and my radio audience, and you served in the Reagan administration. You know the Reagan doctrine as well as anybody and by talking about the Reagan doctrine and the Trump doctrine, not the Obama doctrine and not the Biden doctrine. No boots on the ground, send them the military equipment they need. Where are you on this? MARK LEVIN, HOST OF \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\": Well, I'm with you and the vast majority of the American people apparently are too. There is a small percentage of people out there, I call them Putinoids or pacifists isolationists who don't necessarily regurgitate Putin's talking points and trash the Ukrainians, but who are truly misguided in my view. And that's right, there's the radical interventionists and I'm not that either. But let's get to the bottom line here. We Americans despise Putin. Why do we despise him? Because he's a living genocidal monster. He's unleashed his war machine against little babies, children and women, unprovoked. That's why we despise him. And it's not the first time. He's done it in Syria where he's contributed to slaughtering hundreds of thousands of people. He's done it in other parts of the world. This is a maniac. This guy was KGB. He used to be in charge of East Germany where I'm sure he did other things. He murdered his way to the top. He's assassinated people left and right. His biggest political opponent got another nine years yesterday. They threw him in prison. You don't hear that talked about much by the Putin wing. And so, now, if you are really repulsed and you think something should be done by the world or the United States, and I don't mean something stupid, but something done to effectively address this or address it as best we can to try and contain what could become a mass of war, you're a warmonger or maybe you're a neocon or maybe you're part of the federal contractors or God knows what other what other things you're accused of. This isn't Libya. It's not Afghanistan. It's not Iraq. It's not Vietnam. It's Russia and we know what Putin wants to do. He wrote about it in July - - July, last summer, read it. It's 5,000-words long. It's long. He obviously had help writing it, but he's made it abundantly clear. It's not just Ukraine, it's Poland. It's not just Poland, it's Hungary. It's not just Hungary, it's Romania. He's essentially said that. Now, why is it that the leaders in those countries, all of whom are rather conservative some of them you would say or even right wing agree with you and me -- not the Putin wing of the media and the Republican Party in the Democratic Party. And if people are tired of being called that, then stop acting like it. If you have a rational foreign policy that suggests that we close our eyes to this, that we become ostriches and put our heads in the sand, that we have nothing to do with this, then explain your foreign policy. I find many of the people who are making excuses here or making that case as best as they can which is very weak were also against Donald Trump when he took out Soleimani. Soleimani responsible for so many that men and women have lost limbs and had head injuries and you see Tunnel to Towers, Wounded Warriors and so many others. That same Putin who was slaughtering Syrians with chemical attacks, did Donald Trump stand for that? Not for one minute. And he attacked that airport. He killed a lot of Russians at the same time. So these people are not America First, Donald Trump supporters. They're certainly not Reaganites, peace through strength. I don't know what they are. More Buchananites I suppose. And this argument that if we don't secure our border, we can't assist our allies is one of the dumbest arguments I've ever heard. How about we secure our border and assist our allies? Joe Biden is doing enormous damage to this country, not just to other countries. He's going to sign a deal with Iran illegally, illegally because he needs to go back to Congress that will ensure they are armed with ICBMs with nuclear warheads that can hit our country. Nobody's talking about this. This is a big deal. We had peace breaking out of the Middle East under Trump and Netanyahu. Now, we have these weak leaders who are bending over backwards to help the Iranians? Can you believe this? And you cannot separate Russia from China. How do we know that? They've said so. China's watching this. They're chomping at the bit to invade Taiwan. So what are we supposed to do when they invade Taiwan, pretend they're not doing it? What are we supposed to do when Iran's attacking its neighbors? Pretend that they're not doing it? Do people really think the Pacific and the Atlantic are going to protect us from hypersonic missiles and nuclear missiles? I mean, we've got to pay attention to this. We should be muscling up the United States military. We should be providing the Ukrainians with whatever they need to contain that war, to contain it and to keep it there. And, of course, we're moving forces into the eastern part of NATO. What are we stupid? We've been behind NATO through Republican and Democrat presidents of all kinds. NATO's there to try and prevent a world war. That's why they're there, and a lot of us have ancestors who fought over that territory. So it's not a matter of we've got to focus on domestic versus foreign. We've got to focus on all of it. One quick thing I know you need to go. This nominee to the Supreme Court is the most radical nominee in American history. She's for critical race theory. She's for transgenderism as a movement. She was -- she was weak on sentencing child porn perverts. She is the worst of the worst. She smiles. She's a nice lady. It's a historic appointment. She needs to be defeated. That's it.",

Also tonight, the great one Mark Levin, he will weigh in on Ukraine and, of course, the Supreme Court nomination. The hearings going on in D.C. But first again, tonight, we turn to Ukraine where, against all odds, the city of Mariupol is refusing to surrender. Encircled by Russian forces, they're cut off from food, water, power with weeks of nothing but in -- look at -- look at this, it's been leveled, indiscriminate shelling. The suffering is unimaginable. Look at your screen. This is Mariupol, every single building is a blown out shell. A once booming European metropolis, home to half a million people has pretty much now been reduced to rubble. We don't know how many civilians are still alive, but we do know that dead men, women and children are being buried in mass graves, even as we speak. And those lucky enough to still be alive, they're without food and water and clean facilities and medical care. They're hopelessly trapped, effectively held hostage by Russian forces. You have no problem firing on innocent, unarmed civilians. That would be hell on earth what you're looking at. Now, this is Vladimir Putin's legacy, all this innocent blood, women, men, children, that's on his hands. This is literally evil in our own time. How much more suffering does Joe Biden, do our NATO allies need to see before they give Ukraine, they're not looking for boots on the ground nor should we give it to them, but they're looking for the weaponry so they can beat back Vladimir Putin and his forces? They need more. The American people, however, never underestimate them, they get it. Look at this brand new poll just released by FOX News, an overwhelming majority of you the American people want the U.S. to do more to help Ukraine, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans. Now, the same poll shows a whopping of Americans are in favor of sending weapons to Ukraine, only 42 percent approve of Biden's response. Now, why do you think that is? Because Biden has, as usual, been dragging his feet, undecisive, afraid of Vladimir the whole time, all while the Ukrainian people are fighting for their lives. Now, you the American people clearly support what I have been saying and that is the Reagan and the Trump doctrines, peace through strength -- provide the weapons so Ukraine can win and not one American boot on the ground. For all you people lying about my position, not one American boot on the ground. Ukraine, no, it's not a perfect country, but guess what? Vladimir Putin invaded a sovereign country, he was not provoked in any way. Ukraine is not carpet bombing cities. Vladimir Putin is. Ukraine is not killing innocent women and children Vladimir Putin is. Ukraine is not pursuing their territorial ambitions if they even have them, but Vladimir Putin is. And Putin keeps threatening, oh, I may use nukes or other weapons of mass destruction, biological, chemical weapons now Putin is the guy that has nuclear weapons pointed at, oh, this city, New York City, Washington, D.C., and other states in the United States and not Ukraine. And like most bullies, Putin will only respond to strength. So, Biden needs to stop bubbling and fizzing every time Vladimir makes a threat like a potential cyberattack or chemical weapons attack or a nuclear attack. We already knew before this ever happened that he had that capability. What Biden needs to do is start preparing for any and every worst case scenario and he needs to let Putin know himself in no uncertain terms that his threats do not scare us. He is the one that needs to be worried, not us. Because if he chooses to go that route, which is separate and apart from what's happening in Ukraine guess what America and NATO must unleash hell on Russia. There's no other answer. He will decide if that happens, not us. He will start it we'll have no option but to finish it. Does anybody want this? No, God forbid. Pray for the best but always be prepared for the worst. Now, the U.S. has the most powerful military, the most powerful economy on the face of the Earth. Our capabilities are unmatched. We have the capacity to ruin Putin's world forever and we should not be cowering in fear the way Joe is. Right now, Joe is in Europe and two things that should be happening likely will not be happening. One, Joe must reaffirm our commitment to supply Ukraine and as fast as possible with whatever supplies they need that would be Javelin missiles. Stinger missiles, air defense systems, drones and, yes, the MiG fighter jets that Joe Biden personally vetoed. Let Poland, Joe, give Ukraine the planes. You can stay out of it, let Poland do what Poland wants to do. They're living right next to Ukraine. They may be next. And number two, it is time for the Western world to now completely cut Russia off financially in every way possible. The way to win this conflict is to defeat Vladimir Putin economically. I've said that from day one. That means importing no more Russian oil or gas until Putin is gone and those troops are pulled back and they go back home to Russia. And that means every NATO ally, every Western European country they need to stop all Russian energy imports. No more Iranian nuclear deals negotiated by Russia. Stop talking to the murdering dictator thug in Venezuela, Joe. Why on earth would we give cash and other currency to mullahs in Iran that chant death to America and a deal that's brokered by Russia? Are you that dumb? Are you that stupid? Do you not see what's happening? Why would we loosen restrictions on Iran's nuclear program? They are the number one state sponsor terror, Joe. You get the presidential daily briefings every day, I don't. But we know that to be the truth. They have a sick, twisted, ugly ideology. They hate us. They hate Israel. How does any of that make any sense? So, tonight, Joe also needs to send a very clear warning to Belarus. That is the -- this European -- Eastern European country ruled by one of Putin's puppets and now there are mixed reports about whether or not they are amassing soldiers and military equipment to join the invasion of Ukraine. Now, Belarus needs to know if they send soldiers into Ukraine, the consequences for them should be dire but let's see if Europe, NATO, Western European countries have the backbone. The end goal of all of this is stop Putin and Russia's advance and prevent World War III. We don't want World War III. We don't want to be dragged into World War III. We want our American treasure to stay right here at home. Remember, an attack on one NATO country, Article 5, is an attack on all countries. If Putin fails in Ukraine, he'll never be able to wage war in the Baltics or Poland or any other NATO country. This is not a difficult concept to understand, unless, of course, you're Joe Biden and you don't know that today is Wednesday. Now, the war in Ukraine is not -- is right now at a very critical juncture. Putin has his eyes on the historic port city Odessa, and that's not stopping the city's residents from preparing for the worst while remaining calm. Take a look at this video. They're preparing to be invaded. They're playing one of Jon Bon Jovi's anthem songs. \"It's Our Life\", now or never. Take a look."

For once, make a foreign policy decision that makes sense, Joe. Joe, wake up. It's Wednesday. I know you're tired. You traveled. By the way, this strategy is currently working, and now with his invasion stalled, meaning Putin's, many top Russian officials are going missing in action, including Russia's top minister of defense. He's not been seen apparently for 12 days. Here with more, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. I will say this. The Reagan doctrine worked in Afghanistan and Nicaragua. The Trump doctrine is a little different because the weaponry is way more sophisticated and modern technology allows buttons to be pushed from anywhere in the U.S. and we can hit any target we want with pinpoint accuracy, and that's how he beat the caliphate, took out Soleimani and Baghdadi.

It can be a resounding success depending on what happens. If NATO will tell Putin with clarity, if you use chemical weapons, we will establish a no-fly zone. If you explode a nuclear device inside of Ukraine, we'll consider that attack on NATO itself because the radiation will flow throughout Europe.

Now, 28 days later, they still don't have the MiGs that Poland's willing to transfer. They still don't have the S-300 system that can knock down a bomber. So Biden has not been all in. He assumed that Putin would win in the Ukraine would lose, and he can't embrace the idea that Ukraine can win. I embrace it. I disagree with Rand Paul. You know, the Ukrainian people have paid back the whole freaking world by standing up to this thug Putin and standing up for democracy against a dictator. They have sacrificed. They have lost their cities. They have lost their children. So they don't owe me a damn thing."

That means higher prices to heat and cool your home and for every product you buy at every store you go to. And as \"The Wall Street Journal\" put it, quote, this trickles down to everything even your potato salad. And don't forget, whatever you buy is shipped in a truck, they use diesel and guess what? Much of it is made in a factory or farm that now faces rising energy costs. And by the way, look at the price of fertilizer, it's through the roof. By the way that that price also is wrapped in plastic, oh that too is made with oil. But according to Biden's Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, we just need to suck it up because the climate can't wait she said.

The idea that you're going to bring America to its knees in this effort to chase after this issue of the climate when they won't face the facts, American clean energy was reducing the emissions in the world and we could continue to be doing that, we could have been replacing Indian coal with American natural gas.

All told and this is according to NATO, as many as 40,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, injured, captured or are missing. If that is true, Sean, that is one-fifth of the total combat force of Russia. Ukrainian forces are hanging in there in the embattled port city of Mariupol, but just a hundred thousand people are left there, 90 percent of the city destroyed. The targeting of civilians by Russians there and in many other cities across this country leading the U.S. on Wednesday to formally assess that Russia has committed war crimes. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy hanging in there too, telling this time via video link Japan's parliament about the danger of Russia possibly resorting to tactical nuclear weapon. There are also fears among many officials, including in Washington of Moscow resorting to chemical or biological weapons. And as for Russian President Putin himself, it looks like there's a little bit of trouble in the corridors of Kremlin right now. We've already reported that intelligence officials are getting the ax for their bad information. Now, their reports on Wednesday, a top economic adviser to Putin has left -- quit -- left the country and we haven't seen the defense chief of that country in public in two weeks, Sean.

They're refusing to confront growing aggression, not only from Russia but China and Iran. Now, they're sucking up to the mullahs in Iran and the dictator in Venezuela. We have brand new FOX polling out today that shows Americans are skeptical of Biden's strategy. Only 42 percent of Americans approve of Biden's Ukraine response, a whopping 76 percent approve of President Zelenskyy's handling of the Russian invasion, 63 percent of you the American people say the U.S. should be doing more to fight Russia, 78 percent of Americans favor sending military equipment to Ukraine. Here with reaction, he is the host of the number one show Sunday nights, 8:00 p.m., \"Life, Liberty and Levin\", also nationally syndicated radio host, I call him the great one. You know, Mark, I've been talking a lot to this audience and my radio audience, and you served in the Reagan administration. You know the Reagan doctrine as well as anybody and by talking about the Reagan doctrine and the Trump doctrine, not the Obama doctrine and not the Biden doctrine. No boots on the ground, send them the military equipment they need. Where are you on this? MARK LEVIN, HOST OF \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\": Well, I'm with you and the vast majority of the American people apparently are too. There is a small percentage of people out there, I call them Putinoids or pacifists isolationists who don't necessarily regurgitate Putin's talking points and trash the Ukrainians, but who are truly misguided in my view. And that's right, there's the radical interventionists and I'm not that either. But let's get to the bottom line here. We Americans despise Putin. Why do we despise him? Because he's a living genocidal monster. He's unleashed his war machine against little babies, children and women, unprovoked. That's why we despise him. And it's not the first time. He's done it in Syria where he's contributed to slaughtering hundreds of thousands of people. He's done it in other parts of the world. This is a maniac. This guy was KGB. He used to be in charge of East Germany where I'm sure he did other things. He murdered his way to the top. He's assassinated people left and right. His biggest political opponent got another nine years yesterday. They threw him in prison. You don't hear that talked about much by the Putin wing. And so, now, if you are really repulsed and you think something should be done by the world or the United States, and I don't mean something stupid, but something done to effectively address this or address it as best we can to try and contain what could become a mass of war, you're a warmonger or maybe you're a neocon or maybe you're part of the federal contractors or God knows what other what other things you're accused of. This isn't Libya. It's not Afghanistan. It's not Iraq. It's not Vietnam. It's Russia and we know what Putin wants to do. He wrote about it in July - - July, last summer, read it. It's 5,000-words long. It's long. He obviously had help writing it, but he's made it abundantly clear. It's not just Ukraine, it's Poland. It's not just Poland, it's Hungary. It's not just Hungary, it's Romania. He's essentially said that. Now, why is it that the leaders in those countries, all of whom are rather conservative some of them you would say or even right wing agree with you and me -- not the Putin wing of the media and the Republican Party in the Democratic Party. And if people are tired of being called that, then stop acting like it. If you have a rational foreign policy that suggests that we close our eyes to this, that we become ostriches and put our heads in the sand, that we have nothing to do with this, then explain your foreign policy. I find many of the people who are making excuses here or making that case as best as they can which is very weak were also against Donald Trump when he took out Soleimani. Soleimani responsible for so many that men and women have lost limbs and had head injuries and you see Tunnel to Towers, Wounded Warriors and so many others. That same Putin who was slaughtering Syrians with chemical attacks, did Donald Trump stand for that? Not for one minute. And he attacked that airport. He killed a lot of Russians at the same time. So these people are not America First, Donald Trump supporters. They're certainly not Reaganites, peace through strength. I don't know what they are. More Buchananites I suppose. And this argument that if we don't secure our border, we can't assist our allies is one of the dumbest arguments I've ever heard. How about we secure our border and assist our allies? Joe Biden is doing enormous damage to this country, not just to other countries. He's going to sign a deal with Iran illegally, illegally because he needs to go back to Congress that will ensure they are armed with ICBMs with nuclear warheads that can hit our country. Nobody's talking about this. This is a big deal. We had peace breaking out of the Middle East under Trump and Netanyahu. Now, we have these weak leaders who are bending over backwards to help the Iranians? Can you believe this? And you cannot separate Russia from China. How do we know that? They've said so. China's watching this. They're chomping at the bit to invade Taiwan. So what are we supposed to do when they invade Taiwan, pretend they're not doing it? What are we supposed to do when Iran's attacking its neighbors? Pretend that they're not doing it? Do people really think the Pacific and the Atlantic are going to protect us from hypersonic missiles and nuclear missiles? I mean, we've got to pay attention to this. We should be muscling up the United States military. We should be providing the Ukrainians with whatever they need to contain that war, to contain it and to keep it there. And, of course, we're moving forces into the eastern part of NATO. What are we stupid? We've been behind NATO through Republican and Democrat presidents of all kinds. NATO's there to try and prevent a world war. That's why they're there, and a lot of us have ancestors who fought over that territory. So it's not a matter of we've got to focus on domestic versus foreign. We've got to focus on all of it. One quick thing I know you need to go. This nominee to the Supreme Court is the most radical nominee in American history. She's for critical race theory. She's for transgenderism as a movement. She was -- she was weak on sentencing child porn perverts. She is the worst of the worst. She smiles. She's a nice lady. It's a historic appointment. She needs to be defeated. That's it."

My lawyer Paul Callan (ph) argued in court yesterday that this is an act of violence against the First Amendment. This is about Ashley Biden's diary, I thought we didn't corroborate that it was hers. Turns out we are better journalist than we thought we were, because the Feds and \"The New York Times\" have now verified that this was actually Ashley Biden's diary the tipsters sent to us. First, they raided our homes and took our equipment, and then now it turns out I found out this week that they were spying on us. The Department of Justice was spying on journalists and Project Veritas going back eight months before we knew anything about this diary and spying on us and getting secret gag orders against Microsoft from telling us that it took all of our emails. Sean, this is insane. This should shock everyone because they could do it to you."

Now it turns out the diary is authentic. \"The New York Times\" corroborated it. Obviously, it's real now. Moreover, Sean, Microsoft, some at Microsoft contacted us this week and showed us a secret warrants. The Department of Justice went to magistrate judges and got all of our emails to use Microsoft Outlook, back to January 2020. Eight months before we even heard about the diary. And then after, Sean, a federal judge adopted a special filter team a few months ago in December after my home was raided. The federal judge cited journalistic privilege. Well, a month after that, the feds went behind that federal judge's back and continued to try to gag through Microsoft their secret orders. Microsoft filed a motion, they never sent it out but I have a copy because they sent it to me and as soon as they wrote that, the Feds backed down and we published all the secret warrants yesterday. The Department of Justice was spying on my team, teams, and all of our emails since January 2020."
