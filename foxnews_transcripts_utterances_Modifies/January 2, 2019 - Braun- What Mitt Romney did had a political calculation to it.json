Congressman Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows join me in just minutes. Plus, incoming Senator Mitt Romney's first order of business is taking on Trump, this coming months after accepting the President's endorsement. Also a resident at the Cleveland Clinic fired, after social media posts surface of her comparing Jewish people to dogs and saying, she'd give them the wrong medication on purpose. But first, tomorrow marks Day 13 of the government shut down and while President Trump and the Republicans are working around the clock to come up with a compromise, to get funding for border security Democrats are doing their best to delay and score political points as the situation at our southern border grows more dire by the day.   Just look at what happened Monday night. A violent mob of more than 150 illegal immigrants rushed the border, putting women and children in danger, even reportedly pushing them to the front while clashing with border patrol agents. This is the second such incident since the caravan arrived late last year. President Trump says, it's more proof he needs the money to build the Wall.",

A violent mob of migrants hurling rocks at our border patrol agents. This as Nancy Pelosi doubles down on her refusal to give any money for the border Wall and President Trump not backing down today, saying they shut down will last as long as it takes. Congressman Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows join me in just minutes. Plus, incoming Senator Mitt Romney's first order of business is taking on Trump, this coming months after accepting the President's endorsement. Also a resident at the Cleveland Clinic fired, after social media posts surface of her comparing Jewish people to dogs and saying, she'd give them the wrong medication on purpose. But first, tomorrow marks Day 13 of the government shut down and while President Trump and the Republicans are working around the clock to come up with a compromise, to get funding for border security Democrats are doing their best to delay and score political points as the situation at our southern border grows more dire by the day. Just look at what happened Monday night. A violent mob of more than 150 illegal immigrants rushed the border, putting women and children in danger, even reportedly pushing them to the front while clashing with border patrol agents. This is the second such incident since the caravan arrived late last year. President Trump says, it's more proof he needs the money to build the Wall."

We're in a shut down because Democrats refused to fund the border security. They try and make it like it's just about the Wall and it is about the Wall.

Meantime in the wake of two migrant children who died in the custody of immigration agents, Customs and Border Protection says the number of sick kids at the border is soaring and that they are now referring 50 people a day for urgent medical care including for tuberculosis, flu and women about to give birth. Most of those who need care are children, in fact 20% of all cases are those under the age of five. CPB also says most of those needing medical help were sick before they arrived at the border and many of the migrants have acknowledge being told that if they brought their young children to the border, they would get more lenient treatment by U.

She was going to give them a real life situation on the border. How many children are sick? How many people coming need medical attention? How many people come with diseased?

Yesterday, I was on the phone with him on Christmas Eve. Senator Graham has done the same, doing great work, really offering a number of options. It's interesting, the whole narrative is that the Republicans won't compromise and the Democrats will compromise but I can tell you there's been at least three substantial offers, both directly and indirectly that have been made on behalf of the Republicans that really come up against a wall. It is a wall of really undeniable resolve where they're saying 0 money for border security. Let's have open borders and the American people won't support that."

This is the same Nancy Pelosi who three weeks ago in the Oval office said, there aren't the votes on the House to pass a Bill with border security, border wall funding in it and a few days later it was 217 to 185. So when she says she's not going to do it, I say let's take the case to the American people just like the President's doing. Ask some families who've seen terrible things happen by people who came in this country illegally. Ask Molly Tibbett's family. Ask the law enforcement officer, just a few weeks back so this is important, we need the border security wall, the President's been clear on that as Mark just indicated, he's willing to compromise but the Democrats have said nothing. Just like Nancy Pelosi, nothing for the well, that's the problem. If you want to deal with the drug problem, the gang problem as your previous guest said and the human trafficking problem, you need your border security wall, that's all we're saying and we're only asking for $5 billion and we were willing to come down some on that.

So we'll see, do they - I think the President said this best, do they want to legislate or do they want to investigate?

So far the only significant Republican coming to Romney's defense is outgoing Senator Jeff Flake. Other than that Romney's alone after writing an op-ed headlined, \"The President shapes the public character of the nation. Trumps character falls short.\" He outlines a number of complaints with the President and says in part on balance, \"the President has not risen to the mantle of the office.

There are a lot of problems with the Senator elect's ill-timed op-ed. Romney readily accepted Trump's endorsement when he was running for the Senate even after calling Trump, a phony and a fraud back in 2016 but nothing changed. Trump is still the same person he was back in 2016. Part of what I actually live about President Trump. Romney rode that Trump train all the way to Washington.

To the good people of Utah, some of who will cheer these Romney comments, his job is to represent the state of Utah, not himself. This is not a good look for an incoming Senator, in fact it's a selfish move, it does not help the state of Utah or solve a problem, it only creates one.

You know, I don't dismiss that. I think what Mitt Romney did have a political calculation to it that remains to be seen. I'm just anxious and would not have run unless I was inspired by the fact that it wasn't going to be business as usual and to me, for a main street entrepreneur like myself from a functional state like Indiana, we were looking for something refreshing that was different from the past two or three decades which Mitt Romney and others have been a part of.

And where I come from, when I was on the school board, when I was in a functional state government, and when I've run a business for 37 years, you'd been laughed out of any one of those institutions if you were operating like the federal government does.

She praises him at times. It reads to me like somebody who loves The New York Times, who, by the way, is not a fan of President Trump. She's criticized him in her own columns.  But she believes that the paper that she loves has gone off the rails when it comes to this president."

And Abramson is telling about the The Times, she says it's the younger staff, the more woke staff, that feels like, the standards we use for every other president, throw them out the window because this is Donald Trump. And then she says the more anti-Trump the The Times was perceived to be, the more it was mistrusted for being biased. And that is the cost. You make lots of money in the short term, but if you lose that credibility that you are just applying a whole different set of standards to a president you don't like personally, viscerally, ideologically, I think your credibility gradually erodes with a larger audience."

That's been the subject of a lot of debate since 2016. But the point is this is not me saying it, you saying it, President Trump saying it, this is the former editor of the paper, former Washington bureau chief, former Wall Street Journal reporter, putting her thoughts into this book, and essentially saying that the critics, the worst critics of the The Times are true when it comes to the Trump coverage. And I think journalists at all organizations have to worry at this point, and not that there shouldn't be aggressive reporting, not that there aren't smart reporters at The Times, not that some of the investigations missed the mark, but the cumulative tone and volume and relentless nature of the anti- Trump fusillade I think is really hurting credibility, and now we have Jill Abramson --"

I think he has been kind of angling for it for some time. He couldn't resist. He didn't call out Trump by name, as you mentioned. And yet I actually think the things he is calling for when he talks about a new era for justice in terms of voter registration and taking no corporate money into state campaigns, we have that federally, as you know. So I actually don't think what his agenda is as all that radical, but he has to but that little twist on rhetorically, and that again, I think is in his gene pool."

But this is a trend I think we are seeing in some blue states, where some blue state officials seem more interested in Donald Trump then they are in what is going on in their own states. Cuomo spent a lot of his reelection campaign talking about the Trump administration and the president. Letitia James, the new New York state attorney general basically won a race that was kind of a get Trump contest, where all of the candidates talked about how much they will go after Donald Trump if they became the attorney general. So in these blue states, where you do have huge, huge anti-Trump majorities among the voters, there seems to be more interest in national politics at the moment than what is going on in their own states."

Put aside the question of whether all of these pardons or commutations were justified. Some of them involved people who had been convicted of murder.  Put aside that question. Here again, you have states of trying to make their own immigration laws. We saw this began before Donald Trump appeared, the whole sanctuary city thing dead. But they are trying to make the own immigration laws, in particular because they dislike this president."
