The textbook definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods. And so the Democrats talk about spending at one time up to $5 trillion, most of which would be borrowed, and then finance some of it with tax increases, which would also be harmful to inflation. Trying to break it down and pass it in pieces doesn't make it any better. It's still wasteful spending at a time when we really ought to be focused on dealing with the issues that are front and center for the American people.

And, yes, we doubled the child tax credit, the 2017 tax law, during the pandemic, and they took it up to $3,600 if you're -- if you got kids under 6 years old, and widened the income bracket, so that there are more people eligible for it. Obviously, that flooded the zone, as I said earlier, with a lot of money out there. And all that does is fuels inflation.

There will be some maybe, perhaps, depending on who the nominee is. We don't know that yet. We have heard some names mentioned.

Those flights don't take off whenever they want. They don't land whenever they want. That's all very regimented. Those contractors that are employed by ICE to bring those people to those destinations have to file flight plans. They have to get permission to take off and land at airports. Why can't they just put that out so that the governors, members of the House can see where these flights are going and what the volume is? Why are they not doing that, even though we have all been talking about it since at least the spring, and all they have got to do is be a little bit more transparent, so they can stop having this conversation about what might or might not be secret flights? But they could just tell everybody what's going on. The reason they don't want to talk about it, they would have to expose the volume of activity that's going on, on the border that's been created by the lack of coherent policy at the beginning of this administration.",

The textbook definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods.

Trying to break it down and pass it in pieces doesn't make it any better.

And that was too much spending at the time. And this is just compounding that problem. So it's -- they can say what they want, but they're going to have to -- it's going to have to be phony math for them to suggest that in any way possible that you can put more dollars out there and have it not add to the inflationary problem."

If we say we're helping working people too much, and say that the cause of this is, oh, it's because we provided too much assistance during the American Rescue Plan, stimulus checks were too generous, that is why we are dealing with the problems that we're dealing with now, what that's going to result in is a pullback in the assistance that some families need the most right now."

Do you think there was an overreach on the Democrats' part to sort of widen the net of people who were becoming accustomed or who gained government assistance? Because it's nonsensical that someone in a household of $400,000 would be getting these kinds of checks from the government."

And, yes, we doubled the child tax credit, the 2017 tax law, during the pandemic, and they took it up to $3,600 if you're -- if you got kids under 6 years old, and widened the income bracket, so that there are more people eligible for it. Obviously, that flooded the zone, as I said earlier, with a lot of money out there. And all that does is fuels inflation. So -- and, in the end, if you get inflation growing faster than wage increases, then everybody comes out net-net loser. So, her math, her economics breaks down pretty quickly."

So you're getting people who have better opportunities to make money in this economy. But to suggest, I guess, that everything falls on business is a fairly typical -- it's kind of a throwaway Democrat line. But, in the end, it pits you against the very people that are going to help us grow the economy and create jobs and make the investments that are necessary to raise the standard of living and the quality of life for everybody in this country. And so they -- it's -- I get it. I mean, it's part of their philosophy. But as I said earlier, I have been around here a long time.

And ours is, basically, we want someone who's going to call balls and strikes, is going to apply the Constitution and the law in a fair and even-handed way and be impartial. And they believe in legislating and moving their agenda from the bench. And so I suspect that it's going to be very hard to find Republicans. There will be some maybe, perhaps, depending on who the nominee is. We don't know that yet. We have heard some names mentioned. And they are people who are pretty qualified, but they're also very, very liberal.

And if it is, in fact, unaccompanied minors who are being sent to shelters or to sponsors or family in the United States, why can't the administration just publish the manifests to the states that they're going to or to those airports, right? Those flights don't take off whenever they want. They don't land whenever they want. That's all very regimented. Those contractors that are employed by ICE to bring those people to those destinations have to file flight plans. They have to get permission to take off and land at airports. Why can't they just put that out so that the governors, members of the House can see where these flights are going and what the volume is? Why are they not doing that, even though we have all been talking about it since at least the spring, and all they have got to do is be a little bit more transparent, so they can stop having this conversation about what might or might not be secret flights? But they could just tell everybody what's going on. The reason they don't want to talk about it, they would have to expose the volume of activity that's going on, on the border that's been created by the lack of coherent policy at the beginning of this administration."

If you -- if people come to the border and are released en masse all over the United States, they're going to send home for more of their friends, more of than relatives. It's going to encourage more people to come. So, if you look at what's going on in the policy side, if you look at what's going on operationally, in which the Border Patrol and CBP are distracted by the care and comfort mission and the processing, which lets a lot of people come to the border and get away -- they aren't even encountered by the Border Patrol -- many of the ones that are being encountered are being released. And so you're encouraging people from all over the globe to come to the border now. On top of that, the rhetoric around immigration enforcement inside of the United States is all backwards too, because the secretary himself said that they're not going to go after people in the country just because they're here illegally.

We have record numbers of activity, when, in fact, the beginning of January last year, we had record lows of activity at the Southwest border because the policies that were in place disincentivized people from coming in large numbers. And those agents are frustrated because that traffic that comes to them, those people that they have to process, they can't walk away from that. They're stuck.

But yet you had the top three in the chain of command running down to Border Patrol and say that they were going to pay, that they were going to have consequences. So that's bad enough, right? Those three people that make those statements, they're all lawyers. They're law school graduates. If you wear the uniform of this country, you still have the right to due process.

Putin made a thinly veiled threat about European energy supplies, suggesting Europeans could face problems next year. Russia's neighbors say they feel like they are living next to a volcano. The prime ministers of Poland and Britain were in Kyiv today, promising more weapons and support to Ukraine, portable air defense systems, drones, mortars and ammunition."

So, a new piece in The Wall Street Journal editorial from The Wall Street Journal editorial board making a case to not only hit Vladimir Putin with sanctions, but also to hit the so-called Kremlin mafia, the billionaire elites who also play a major role in running that country.

They got very wealthy in the disintegration of the Soviet Union, when they took over large chunks of what the -- of the utilities and the energy companies and the others that belonged to the Soviet Union. They made a fortune. Now, the key thing about these guys, Charles, is that they don't spend their winters in -- they don't spend any time really in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Maybe they go and pay your service, lip service, to the emperor every now and then. They hang out in South of France and in London in their very large -- very large houses and on their $300 million yachts. Now, this would be a really effective way of going after Putin and actually deterring him perhaps from doing what he might do in Ukraine, or, if he does do it, then responding to it, because there's a lot of concerns about regular sanctions, Charles. Russia has built up huge foreign exchange reserves. It can probably withstand significant economic sanctions. Some of those economic sanctions hit us, would hit the West as hard as they would hit Russia, things like cutting off the energy supply to Europe and things like that. But this, going after these guys, going after these oligarchs, these mafia, who are really close to Putin, who are looking after a lot of Putin's own money, that would be a really, really powerful way to really send a message to Russia, send a message to Vladimir Putin, we really are going to hurt you if you do this."

Gerry, real quick, because I want to also ask you about what's going on in Canada, just what's what's your thoughts about Germany, though, with respect to trying to participate in this?

Look, the Germans have spent the last, since -- the entire time since the since the end of the Cold War building a very strong economic relationship with Russia. They're dependent on Russia for most of their energy supplies. They have a new government, a new government that is led by a Social Democrat, Olaf Scholz, who is with -- whose party has historically been quite close to Russia. They don't want, frankly, to do anything that's going to upset their relations with Russia. And they -- look, a former chancellor, a former Social Democratic chancellor of Germany, sits on the board of Gazprom, the Russian energy giant.

We're going to get the January numbers. And they're probably going to show a decline in jobs for the first time in months. That's in large part because a lot -- a lot -- in part because a lot of these vaccine mandates are taking effect. Some companies are not being able to -- don't have as many staff as they would like to have. And this Canada problem, in particular, this applies to those Canadian truck drivers who come across the border. Many, many of them, understandably, don't want to get vaccinated.

He didn't just happen to forget to mention the Patriots. He doesn't get along with head coach Bill Belichick. They had a falling out. This is publicly known. And he was just like -- I feel like he didn't mention the Patriots because he would have had to thank Belichick, and he doesn't want to do that. So he purposely didn't match the Patriots. You look through that whole entire thing, it's a novel. He thanked everybody under the sun, except the Patriots. The Patriots fans are whining, and they're all selfish. Bottom line is, from a sports standpoint, this is sad. It's a sad day for sports fans. There will never be another football player that wins seven Super Bowls. It will not happen. Free agency.

That's the way to help us get out of this, and that the fact that Biden is doing stuff to help this, whether it's making sure that the ports are open 24 hours to have the supplies, or also making sure to -- that there's gas available for people and opening up the 50 gallons to have that.

And are you concerned that too much money has poured into this economy, where you had these -- that's how you got all the issues in the port in the first place. Those ships were summoned here because of so much money and so much spending?"

And I have said on your show, Charles, and on Neil's show for 12 months the Fed has been way behind the curve in terms of getting -- pulling some of this money out of the economy. But when you have the federal government borrowing $2 trillion a year, when you increase the government spending by $5 trillion, the Fed has accommodated that by putting money into the economy. So I think it's equal blame between Biden and between the Fed. And, by the way, you're right. We have got to do something about the COVID crisis. I don't think that -- I'm with the American people. I don't think COVID -- that Joe Biden has very good grades when it comes to -- what did he say, that he was going to shut down the virus. I don't think he's done that."
