So, they're very, very, very good at what they do. I'm very lucky to have them. However, of course, we do have some issues that are going on. And we recently had some additional flooding because the Neches River is beginning to crest. And it's continuing. That's probably what I'm seeing on your screen right now.",

Our industry partners are amazing. As far as our water is concerned -- and I don't mean that standing water. I mean our drinkable and our water system. We have a plant that has been there for actually 100 years. Now, the plant is not 100 years old, but the site has been there. And it has never even come close to flooding. And we did have a failure or a breach in that system on Thursday night about 11:00. I'm sorry. Wait. Wednesday night at about 11:00. And we have come up -- one of our great engineers has come up with a work-around. We're hoping that it's going to work. It is starting to. It won't be drinkable water, but we are giving out drinkable water at two locations already in the city of Beaumont.   And we're working on three more locations. Citizens can just drive up. We give them a jug of water, a case of water, some MREs, et cetera, et cetera, all kinds of things. And they just drive up and we put it in their car. We're serving about 12 people a minute.",

And then we did do a voluntary evacuation along our river. And we went door-to-door yesterday to those residents, encouraging them to leave. That's some of the photographs that I saw when you first opened this cast, this newscast.  So, we -- most of those people did get out.
