When it all comes to the wall, we knew he had a very tough sell, but our new numbers just out showing exactly how tough. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  And there's new Gallup poll that find 60 percent of Americans might oppose building that wall. So what, if anything, can the president do to turn those numbers his way?  We are all over it with Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott on if the president can get Congress united, Ohio Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan on the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and what she should be offering, national Border Patrol council president Judd, Brandon, on what could happen now if he doesn't get that wall in the offing, and the Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst with some advice for Democrats who will be responding.  First, we go to John Roberts at the White House, where a busy president is no doubt preparing -- John.",

Members of the conference committee that have got until February the 15th to come up with a solution to open the government and satisfy border security are expressing some optimism that there may be a way out of this. They say that their staffs are beginning to talk together. There's some measure of cooperation that's going on there.  And this is significant. Tomorrow, they will be inviting up to Capitol Hill for briefings members of Customs and Border Protection, ICE, other agencies who are tasked with border security. They hope to learn enough from them that they will be able to come up with some sort of comprehensive solution.   There's also overriding all of this, Neil, this idea that the president could declare a national emergency. Not expected to do that tonight at the State of the Union, though he may make mention of it. Senator Richard Shelby, who is a member of that conference committee, said pressure from the president on this idea of a national emergency might not be such a bad thing, that it might not split the conferees, but bring them together.

We saw a little bit of this with the government shutdown, where working- class families literally cannot survive losing one paycheck, where 45 percent of the country have less than $400 in savings.  And it's been a failure really on both parties' parts to plug in communities and families and areas of the country that have missed globalization, missed automation. It passed us by. And because there's been no national industrial policy or no national strategy on how we make sure the Youngstown, Ohio's of the world, and the Gary, Indiana's of the world, and many parts of the Southern part of this country get plugged in. Globalization is yielding great wealth, but it's not getting everywhere. It's getting concentrated in certain parts of the country. I have said it before on your show; 80 percent of venture capital goes to three states, California, New York and Massachusetts.  Well, how do we have a national strategy that gets those investments into communities like ours? And the salt in the wound, lastly, is that when General Motors makes these cuts, people lose their jobs, communities erode, their stock goes up 6 percent.

When it all comes to the wall, we knew he had a very tough sell, but our new numbers just out showing exactly how tough. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And there's new Gallup poll that find 60 percent of Americans might oppose building that wall. So what, if anything, can the president do to turn those numbers his way? We are all over it with Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott on if the president can get Congress united, Ohio Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan on the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and what she should be offering, national Border Patrol council president Judd, Brandon, on what could happen now if he doesn't get that wall in the offing, and the Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst with some advice for Democrats who will be responding. First, we go to John Roberts at the White House, where a busy president is no doubt preparing -- John."

      "utterance": "He is. And he will giving that speech in just a few hours, as you pointed out, and immigration, the border wall, border security will form a large section of that. Members of the conference committee that have got until February the 15th to come up with a solution to open the government and satisfy border security are expressing some optimism that there may be a way out of this. They say that their staffs are beginning to talk together. There's some measure of cooperation that's going on there. And this is significant. Tomorrow, they will be inviting up to Capitol Hill for briefings members of Customs and Border Protection, ICE, other agencies who are tasked with border security. They hope to learn enough from them that they will be able to come up with some sort of comprehensive solution. There's also overriding all of this, Neil, this idea that the president could declare a national emergency. Not expected to do that tonight at the State of the Union, though he may make mention of it. Senator Richard Shelby, who is a member of that conference committee, said pressure from the president on this idea of a national emergency might not be such a bad thing, that it might not split the conferees, but bring them together. Listen here."

But, then again, it could be negotiating tactic to say to the conferees, if you can't come up with something between now and the 15th, you're looking at an emergency declaration or shutting down the government again . Maybe just trying to light a fire under them to see if they can get something going. But, again, very positive sign that they're inviting up to Capitol Hill tomorrow these experts who know what it takes to secure the border -- Neil."

He's offered a lot, the White House said more than enough. But he wants funding for that wall. If he doesn't get it by next Friday, we could be looking at an emergency to get it. How do you feel about that?"
    },

      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, my -- it's not my first choice. I didn't think it was great when Barack Obama used executive orders. But the president has proposed things. He's tried. He's tried to compromise. And the Democrats just haven't worked with him. So, in the end, the president needs to use the authority he has to secure our borders and to keep people safe. So I think he ought -- if he does it, I would hope he would do a permanent solution for TPS and DACA also, take care of these kids that didn't come here on their own. Their parents brought them here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, a lot of your Republican colleagues particularly, Senator, are concerned about going the emergency route, that it would be almost as problematic as, you know, facing another shutdown. It's a no-win situation for them as well. Do you share that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Sure. No one wants the president to have to use his emergency -- use an executive order, use the emergency power. But what is he to do? He knows the crisis. There's a crisis on the border. The Democrats won't come to the table. Nancy Pelosi has basically said, no way, there's not going to be any money. I mean, the way I look at it is, I'm going to the State of the Union. There are going to be more actors there than is at the Oscars, because people are just acting like they care about things. But then pass a bill. I mean, if you say you care about border security, Nancy Pelosi, do something. Chuck Schumer, do something about it, instead of just talking about it and doing nothing about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, there has been talk as well that, if he is able to cobble together something with Democrats, the next here could be infrastructure, or maybe dealing with drug prices, and that both parties find common ground here. Do you agree with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. We have got to figure out how to drive down the cost of health care. It's way too expensive, especially drugs. We have got to figure out how to do that. I think he needs to highlight the importance of continuing to build the economy. It's what we did in Florida. So, as we did that, we had more revenues to do good things, like in the environment. So, he needs to talk about what's happened in the last year, three million more jobs since the tax cuts came in. So he needs to keep doing those things and also talk about border security. So I'm very optimistic. This is my -- I think my fifth week up here, so I want to get things done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, we're talking about drug prices. And you're well- schooled in the health industry, before you went into politics. And the drug companies, the CEOs, of which I think about a dozen companies in the end might be called to the Senate to testify on what's been going on here, they have recently been pointing the finger at middlemen, not themselves, for this run-up. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "I think we need to figure it out, but we have got to drive down the cost of drugs. If you -- if you want people get more health care, the way to do it is -- is not have some big government program, but drive the cost of health care down. And so whether it's -- whatever we can do. I mean, there's -- there's a lot of ideas on the table. I have been talking to a lot of different senators about ideas. But I want to get something done on driving drug prices down."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, in the meantime, fair and balanced, we are going to hear from Ohio Democratic Congressman -- in fact, was in the running for speaker for a while -- Tim Ryan in a moment. Now, he's the guy, of course, who was speaking for a more moderate way, middle ground way among Democrats to deal with this, and not necessarily toe Nancy Pelosi's line. His view after this. And then, meanwhile, don't forget, with the president expected to be touting a strong economy tonight, and foreign markets all open tonight, FOX Business will be following these developments closely, beginning at 7:00 p.m. with my colleague Lou Dobbs. We take over on \"Coast to Coast\" on Fox Business at 8:00, where we gauge not only the speech, but the Democratic response, futures reaction, foreign market reaction, tick by tick around the world. And then Trish Regan wraps it up at 11:00 with analysis you can only find on FOX Business, the best of politics, the best of business. It's your life. It's your money. We have got it. More after this."

That means the person behind him, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, won't necessarily be complimentary of everything that president is talking about, including a wall along the border, something she's called immoral and something she says for which she would not contribute $1. The read from Ohio Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan, who joins us right now. Congressman, good to have you."

And that plant is going to be empty as of March, due to all the General Motors job cuts. And so we're bringing him to make sure that the president and everyone else is paying attention about what's happened in Lordstown, Ohio."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, as you know, on those job cuts here, GM said it had no choice, up to 4,000 white-collar workers hit as well, and that this is a way of keeping the company viable and vibrant. What -- when you heard Mary Barra, the CEO, say that, what did you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RYAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I have talked to her on several occasions, and we're still trying to work, because they may distribute some products after the union contracts are negotiated. And we're fighting real hard to make sure one of those products ends up in Lordstown, Ohio. But I think it's more indicative of what's happening in the economy today, Neil. We saw a little bit of this with the government shutdown, where working- class families literally cannot survive losing one paycheck, where 45 percent of the country have less than $400 in savings. And it's been a failure really on both parties' parts to plug in communities and families and areas of the country that have missed globalization, missed automation. It passed us by. And because there's been no national industrial policy or no national strategy on how we make sure the Youngstown, Ohio's of the world, and the Gary, Indiana's of the world, and many parts of the Southern part of this country get plugged in. Globalization is yielding great wealth, but it's not getting everywhere. It's getting concentrated in certain parts of the country. I have said it before on your show; 80 percent of venture capital goes to three states, California, New York and Massachusetts. Well, how do we have a national strategy that gets those investments into communities like ours? And the salt in the wound, lastly, is that when General Motors makes these cuts, people lose their jobs, communities erode, their stock goes up 6 percent. I mean, that to me is not an economic model."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, but the president is going to apparently mention infrastructure, and that kind of thing, that could benefit some of those workers."

    {
      "speaker": "RYAN",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Would you be for something like that? There does seem to be broad bipartisan appeal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RYAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. I have been waiting for the president to push a legitimate infrastructure bill since he got into office. In fact, I saw Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway the night of the inauguration. And we talked on the on the dais right after his speech. And I said, let's do infrastructure. Let's find a way to get together on this stuff. It would be critically important. But it goes well beyond that. I mean, there was an article today in The Washington Post about 5G. China's kicking our rear end on 5G. And it has defense and military implications. These are the kind of -- this is the leadership we need from the White House on how we grow these area of the economy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But the president is addressing those issues in the trade talks with China. I mean, you're not lumping all this on his doorstep, because last time I checked, the economy, it's doing pretty well. I understand in your district and some of the concerns about that. But, by and large, we're in and out of record low unemployment. We got 304,000 jobs in the latest period, wages going up at better than a 3 percent clip for four months in a row. That's a -- that's a pretty good direction, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RYAN",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, I would just say, look, I think the old metrics aren't applicable to what's happening in the world today. I mean, there are so many communities in America that are being left behind, people that don't have money in the stock market, people that are working part-time or two or three jobs to make ends meet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, those particular metrics, Congressman, are better than they were under Barack Obama, those examples I stated. Now, so, were they OK when the same thing was happening or worse under Barack Obama, and not now because it's Donald Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RYAN",
      "utterance": "No, I don't want to get into that, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump. I'm caring about my people. I'm just saying, Neil, both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party has failed to address the structural problems in the United States economy. And..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Fair enough, because a lot of your presidential candidates of the party -- and I don't -- you might stand out because for now you're not one of them -- but they are advocating things like a wealth tax, a higher estate tax to address this and other things. Do you like that approach?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RYAN",
      "utterance": "I think we need more progressivity in our tax code. There's no question about it. We have a trillion-dollar deficit next year and the years to come. That's a problem. We have got huge infrastructure needs in the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, what is progressivity to you? Would it be beyond the 37 percent top rate we're at now? And, if so, to what level?"
    },

Now, whether you're a Democrat or Republican, whether you're rich or you're middle class, with trillion-dollar deficits and investments that we need to make, and China pumping 5G and clean energy, and rebuilding their military, and going in Africa for raw materials, we don't have a strategy."

As Americans, we need to recognize that we are in a very stiff competition with China. And they are using the entire government that they have, their economic system, their educational, research, infrastructure, military, everything, to take over Asia and to displace the United States. And we live in a 24-hour news cycle that is not addressing this issue. And I'm very, very concerned about it, because we will get so far behind, we may not be able to catch back up."

Nancy Pelosi might find a wall immoral or might find the idea of walls period, not funding a $1 for them -- they're not in synch on that. Steny Hoyer has indicated that. Others have told me that.

We know we have drugs coming across our southern border. We know that we have human trafficking. These are issues that we have to address. And Democrats, especially Democrats like Congressman Ryan from Ohio, recognize that the middle of this country and Americans want to see Republicans and Democrats work together."

And I'm wondering what you make of that."

And there are allowances, even within Congress, statutes that they have put forward that allow the president to build infrastructure to fight drugs. So, we will see what happens. I imagine it will end up in the courts. But the president does have a crisis on our southern border. Asylum claims are up 1700 percent in eight years. You're seeing more family units come across our border. You're seeing children come unaccompanied. We have 12,000 right now in custody of HHS who came without parents. There is a overwhelming crisis, on top of the 800,000 cases that are backlogged in our courts. We just can't handle this deluge.

Yet, when you hear Democrats portray the have-nots, or those who haven't participated along, does the president feel this venue tonight is an opportunity for him to go through what's been happening on the economy, or is he gun-shy about it? A lot of Republicans, for example, when it comes to the tax cut, are -- almost are afraid they were behind it, because suddenly it's very unpopular. What's his stance on this?"

Wages have increased over 3 percent. That's more than we have seen in the past decade. You have seen four million people, Neil, four million people have gone off of food stamps. Think about what that means for a family to not have to take food stamps, because now you're able to find gainful employment. So many good things are happening because of President Trump and his policies with the tax cuts and the deregulation. I think, absolutely, he needs to tout that, on top of funding our military, taking on bad actors like Syria and North Korea. I mean, there's been so many gains, our energy policy. So he can give a state of our union and give a -- say that our union is strong, and then present a vision on things that we can work together on. Americans want to see Republicans and Democrats work together and compromise and solve issues that average people are facing."

We have had a -- you and I and the entire country have had a longstanding debate about what should the rate of spending be, what should the level of taxation be? What's happened in the last two years is, we have had a dramatic reduction in taxes as a share of the economy, well below -- virtually unprecedented in non-recession times. So I think the argument that really what the big problem here is spending, I think that what has happened, the big problem that's exploding the deficit, is we have a massive revenue shortage."

      "utterance": "All right, Sean Spicer is coming up after this. Who goes to the speech as an invite of the president of the United States, including a boy whose only problem is his last name is Trump? And he's not related to the president."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "He's 11 years old. His name is Joshua Trump. He will be a guest a President Trump tonight. He's been facing a lot of bullying, simply for having the last name Trump. Former White House Press Secretary and America First Action senior adviser Sean Spicer joins me right now. It's an interesting story. How do they pick out these people will be guests of the president, Sean?"

    {
      "speaker": "SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Well, in this case, Joshua is a sixth-grader. And I don't know what his story was. In some cases, people have written letters to the White House explaining a situation, and one of the offices there will flag individuals throughout the year. There's an Office of Public Liaison that is constantly working with groups and individuals on issues that they have around the country where the president's agenda can be helpful to their lives. And so there are times throughout the year when people come across the White House purview, and that they kind of mark them, and say, this is an individual that might be worthy of presenting for the State of the Union."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And in this little kid's case, he was bullied simply because his last name is Trump. No relation to the president."

      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it is interesting. I always have liked when this president and other presidents have taken to referring to guests sitting with the first lady and to tell their story. It humanizes the approach to the address. How important do you think it is to communicate an idea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "I think it's very important. If you think about the last two addresses that the president has given, first, his joint address right after he took office and the one last year, he has really effectively used these Americans' stories in so many walks of life to illustrate either a need and a problem that exists that he wants to solve, or an area where his administration has really improved the lives of Americans. Last -- the first year, it was the widow of Chief Ryan Owens, who was the first individual killed, military member killed in action under the president's watch. And you remember the entire chamber lighting up in applause and honoring her husband's service. Last year, you had the North Korean dissident. And this year, the president and the first lady have 13 individuals that talk about everything from prison reform and how the president's First Step Act has given individuals a chance to turn their lives around and get a second chance in life. You have got victims of opioid addiction who are overcoming it, thanks to the president's commitment to this. And there are -- an individual who's benefiting from tax reform and growing his business. But it's not just the individuals there that are there, Neil. It's how the president talks about them and integrates them into the speech. And if you look back on the last two joint addresses, one a joint address, one a State of the Union, that the president's given, he's used them extremely effective. And he's humanized an issue and brought to life either a problem that he is seeking to solve or something that his administration has done that has truly positively impacted the lives of Americans."

      "utterance": "No, I agree with you. And I think he's very, very good at it. We don't have much time left, but I think he ruins it the next day by tweeting something nasty. You know what I'm saying? And I wonder how that goes, because he does a very good job at these events and venues. And I'm just wondering, is there a temptation? You think the people on the staff tell him, don't say anything bad about Nancy Pelosi? Don't -- you're on a roll here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you don't have to say that much. I mean, the first year, I remember being there, and the accolades were pouring in from the left and the right about what a great job the president did. He understands the stage that he's on tonight, the -- not just the domestic, but the international audience."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, but then he was saying stuff about Barack Obama. And it just took the aura away, right?"

      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, I think that there is a lot."
