Thank you for having afforded me this opportunity to serve our country.\" There had been disagreements between Bolton and the president through most of Bolton's 17-month tenure over things like Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Russia interference in the American election, Venezuela, and more.   A source told me today -- quote -- \"At some point, it becomes inevitable that the relationship had to end.\" Bolton's approach, I'm told, was to provide national security advice based on a coherent philosophy, and that it was difficult to carry that out in this White House.

John Bolton had let it be known through intermediaries that he was not a fan of the idea bringing the Taliban to Camp David and not a fan of the overall peace plan.  The two got into a heated discussion last evening. Bolton offered his resignation. According to Bolton, the president said, let's talk about it tomorrow.   A source familiar with Bolton's thinking says, he slept on it, came into work this morning, chaired a principals meeting on refugees, and then said, you know what? There's no real reason to keep discussing this. He handed his resignation to the president at 11:30 in the morning. It was 28 minutes later after that the president tweeted out that he asked Bolton for his resignation last night. So we will forever be wondering, Neil, did the president fire him or did John Bolton decide to resign? There's definitely a difference of opinion there.  Now, as to what might happen next, a couple of names being kicked around Washington, Brian Hook, who is the senior policy adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Stephen Biegun, who is the chief of the North Korea negotiations, President Trump likes both of them. Mike Pompeo likes both of them.  And you can bet that because Pompeo is now the president's most trusted adviser on foreign policy and national security, Pompeo will likely have a big influence over who the president picks -- Neil.",

It compares very much to Richard Nixon's resignation letter back on August 9, 1974, short, pithy, to the point.  Keep in mind, when Jim Mattis decided to leave as defense secretary, he had two full single-spaced pagers, arguing his point that it had a lot to do with some bigger issues and no ill will or toward the president.

And, frankly, it just doesn't work that way. There's a lot of history of getting rid of strongmen in the Middle East and having them replaced by vacuums or chaos, or actually making the place more hospitable for terrorist training.  So, I think his idea that the way you deal with Iran is you just topple the government, or the way you deal with North Korea is you topple the government really wasn't what the president has been talking about. The president is actually talking about not having regime change and finding a diplomatic solution to some of these conflicts around the world.

The problem is, is, when people like Bolton say, oh, we are going to topple Gadhafi and we're going to make Libya into this great American-style republic, they don't elect Thomas Jefferson. They elect another religious leader who becomes an autocrat in place of one religious leader or one autocrat. So, really, I think the Middle East and many of these places who have been ruled by strongmen, the answer isn't military regime change. And I think Bolton was very wrong and naive in his world view. I'm glad to see him gone.   And I hope the president can find somebody who actually listens to what the president says. This president is extraordinary. In his State of the Union, he said great nations don't fight perpetual war. And he's absolutely right, but that defies the orthodoxy of the establishment foreign policy in Washington.

But I can go back to Reagan's administration, where all of us conservatives, we loved Ronald Reagan, and then all of a sudden he was appointing sometimes people who we didn't think, frankly, were conservative or fulfilling Reagan's vision. So, I think this is true in every administration. But my advice and my hope is that the president will pick somebody who actually listens to what he says and wants to further his goals. I think the president could do something really heroic and dramatic in getting us out of the war in Afghanistan.

So, I think part of one way we end the war is, we continue to support, in a gradually lessening fashion, through money and arms, the government of Afghanistan, and we have them step up. But, really, it's the obligation of them to be strong enough that the Taliban will negotiate with them. Right now, the Taliban doesn't believe that they are strong enough. So they negotiate with us as a proxy. But the problem is, the Taliban aren't reliable. They are violent and they continue to commit violence.

I don't think the Taliban, frankly, are trustworthy, nor do I think the people negotiating have the ability to control all of the other fighters in the field. But, nevertheless, I would come home, because the idea that we have to control land around the world to prevent terrorism is a fallacy. There's land everywhere. There is chaos in Africa. There is chaos in the Middle East. There's all kinds of place for terrorists to be. It's a foolish notion to think that America has to be all in those places, policing all those areas, to prevent terrorism. No, we should be vigilant about who comes to our country. The people on 9/11 all came here legally, or the vast majority of them, and we didn't pay any attention. We should pay attention to those who would come to our country.

Flynn's new legal team convinced the judge to put off sentencing, giving them until mid-October to file more briefs with the court to make their case that special counsel prosecutors are guilty of misconduct and withholding evidence that would have helped Flynn's defense. Under the microscope today, former FBI Director James Comey. During his book tour, Comey admitted he sandbag the White House over Flynn's FBI interview about his contacts with the Russian ambassador before the inauguration. Comey said FBI leadership circumvented standard procedures and went around the White House counsel, taking advantage of the new administration. Flynn's team told the court they believe there is a memo that shows the FBI agents concluded in January 2017 that Flynn wasn't a Russian agent, raising more questions about the underlying offense. Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan, who threw out a conviction about a decade ago against Alaska Senator Ted Stevens over prosecutorial misconduct, wants briefs from both sides on the issues with a hearing on Brady material at the end of October. That is material favorable to the defense. The prosecution said that they had provided all relevant records to Flynn's legal team and emphasized Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI, but his conversations with the Russian ambassador, he was never prosecuted for being a Russian agent -- Neil.",

And today it happened. We got his resignation letter. In his typically unvarnished fashion, Bolton says -- quote -- \"I hereby resign, effective immediately, as assistant to the president for national security affairs. Thank you for having afforded me this opportunity to serve our country.\" There had been disagreements between Bolton and the president through most of Bolton's 17-month tenure over things like Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Russia interference in the American election, Venezuela, and more. A source told me today -- quote -- \"At some point, it becomes inevitable that the relationship had to end.\" Bolton's approach, I'm told, was to provide national security advice based on a coherent philosophy, and that it was difficult to carry that out in this White House.

John Bolton had let it be known through intermediaries that he was not a fan of the idea bringing the Taliban to Camp David and not a fan of the overall peace plan. The two got into a heated discussion last evening. Bolton offered his resignation. According to Bolton, the president said, let's talk about it tomorrow. A source familiar with Bolton's thinking says, he slept on it, came into work this morning, chaired a principals meeting on refugees, and then said, you know what? There's no real reason to keep discussing this. He handed his resignation to the president at 11:30 in the morning. It was 28 minutes later after that the president tweeted out that he asked Bolton for his resignation last night. So we will forever be wondering, Neil, did the president fire him or did John Bolton decide to resign? There's definitely a difference of opinion there. Now, as to what might happen next, a couple of names being kicked around Washington, Brian Hook, who is the senior policy adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Stephen Biegun, who is the chief of the North Korea negotiations, President Trump likes both of them. Mike Pompeo likes both of them. And you can bet that because Pompeo is now the president's most trusted adviser on foreign policy and national security, Pompeo will likely have a big influence over who the president picks -- Neil."

When they are short and pithy and to the point, normally, the person leaving is not too happy. You have seen this little-more-than-one-sentence resignation letter on the part of Mr. Bolton. It compares very much to Richard Nixon's resignation letter back on August 9, 1974, short, pithy, to the point. Keep in mind, when Jim Mattis decided to leave as defense secretary, he had two full single-spaced pagers, arguing his point that it had a lot to do with some bigger issues and no ill will or toward the president. That was then. This is now. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul with me now. Senator, good to see you. What do you make of this?"

I think he had a naive point of view for the world, that we should topple regimes everywhere and institute democratic governments, and we would make the world perfect or remake the world in our image. And, frankly, it just doesn't work that way. There's a lot of history of getting rid of strongmen in the Middle East and having them replaced by vacuums or chaos, or actually making the place more hospitable for terrorist training. So, I think his idea that the way you deal with Iran is you just topple the government, or the way you deal with North Korea is you topple the government really wasn't what the president has been talking about. The president is actually talking about not having regime change and finding a diplomatic solution to some of these conflicts around the world. And I think the president deserves to have somebody who's his national security adviser who actually will try to further his policy, and not try to stymie it."

      "speaker": "PAUL",

The problem is, is, when people like Bolton say, oh, we are going to topple Gadhafi and we're going to make Libya into this great American-style republic, they don't elect Thomas Jefferson. They elect another religious leader who becomes an autocrat in place of one religious leader or one autocrat. So, really, I think the Middle East and many of these places who have been ruled by strongmen, the answer isn't military regime change. And I think Bolton was very wrong and naive in his world view. I'm glad to see him gone. And I hope the president can find somebody who actually listens to what the president says. This president is extraordinary. In his State of the Union, he said great nations don't fight perpetual war. And he's absolutely right, but that defies the orthodoxy of the establishment foreign policy in Washington. And so the president really needs to find somebody who has the guts to stand up to the orthodoxy, not someone who is part of the swamp."

He has said for a long, long time the Iraq War was a mistake, that we emboldened Iran by getting rid of Saddam Hussein, that there was a counterbalance in having Saddam Hussein there, and that that vacuum allowed ISIS to grow in that vacuum. And so, really, I think the president has been very, very consistent. Now, I think, historically, even when you..."

Now, I would grant you that some of the people he's picked haven't been people who've actually agreed with the president. But I can go back to Reagan's administration, where all of us conservatives, we loved Ronald Reagan, and then all of a sudden he was appointing sometimes people who we didn't think, frankly, were conservative or fulfilling Reagan's vision. So, I think this is true in every administration. But my advice and my hope is that the president will pick somebody who actually listens to what he says and wants to further his goals. I think the president could do something really heroic and dramatic in getting us out of the war in Afghanistan. And I think he would, if he didn't have people working for him who were contradicting and countermanding his orders and had their own agenda. So, I think he finds to somebody who follows the president."

    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Well, here -- here's what I would say about it, is, it's a confusing situation. I think the Taliban needs to negotiate, but I think they should negotiate directly with the government of Afghanistan. They have refused to do so. So, I think part of one way we end the war is, we continue to support, in a gradually lessening fashion, through money and arms, the government of Afghanistan, and we have them step up. But, really, it's the obligation of them to be strong enough that the Taliban will negotiate with them. Right now, the Taliban doesn't believe that they are strong enough. So they negotiate with us as a proxy. But the problem is, the Taliban aren't reliable. They are violent and they continue to commit violence. The other problem is, the people with the Taliban negotiating with us may not well have the strength of organization to control all elements of everybody else in Afghanistan. So, maybe they don't control the Taliban."

However, I would say that peace comes when we make the decision that we declare victory and we come home, and shouldn't be dependent on the Taliban. I don't think the Taliban, frankly, are trustworthy, nor do I think the people negotiating have the ability to control all of the other fighters in the field. But, nevertheless, I would come home, because the idea that we have to control land around the world to prevent terrorism is a fallacy. There's land everywhere. There is chaos in Africa. There is chaos in the Middle East. There's all kinds of place for terrorists to be. It's a foolish notion to think that America has to be all in those places, policing all those areas, to prevent terrorism. No, we should be vigilant about who comes to our country. The people on 9/11 all came here legally, or the vast majority of them, and we didn't pay any attention. We should pay attention to those who would come to our country. We should have strict rules on who comes into our country. And we should have great intelligence around the world. But it doesn't mean we have to occupy every acre of the world."

What's our mission in Afghanistan? There's not one general out there that can tell you exactly what our mission is. Is our mission the Vietnam mission, to take one more village to get a better negotiated settlement? Is that what we're there for? There is no national security reason to be there. There is no Al Qaeda. There's a -- there might be 10 people in Al Qaeda left there. All of the leadership's been destroyed. The Taliban are fighting against foreign fighters. The Taliban aren't this international organization that's going to come to the United States. They are people who have been fighting historically for over 100 years.

But the president, Neil, said he does a killer interview on FOX News, which is true, and I agreed with a lot of what I heard from John Bolton even the night that he was announced. But the reality is, you have to have a team player. I think Mike Pompeo, Mark Esper, many of the others understand the way in which this president functions.

We all know that from his past. And he's going to do things that are rather unconventional. If you can't live with that frenetic type of lifestyle and that sort of foreign policy, then you shouldn't be advising the president who has that in mind. He's going to show up at the demilitarized zone. He's going to talk to Rouhani at the U.N. maybe later this month. He's going to meet with Putin, in spite of all the criticism in the media. So the president has a technique. I think anyone that has been watching him for the last few years understands where he wants to go. When Mark Esper came up with billions of dollars out of other programs overseas and here at home to build the border wall, he understood what this president wants. The president is the elected official of this country. We have to be either team players or get out of the way."

And if you can't abide by that, then you leave the team. General Mattis understood that. And so we went through Shanahan, who didn't get to stick in the job, and Mark Esper, obviously, as the secretary of the army, has done a good job and he was elevated. Mike Pompeo is much the same. The president deserves the team that will be obedient to his philosophy and his agenda. And I believe, whether it's in North Korea, Iran, Russia, or China, we live in a dangerous world.

But yet we get barraged by Alabama and maps, by war of words with actresses, now John Bolton. The Taliban may be coming in right before 9/11. I just think all that has been getting on top of what's really being lost, and that's the great, great numbers of unemployment, which matter most to voters when all is said and done. I think they really need to get out of their way and get the message right and just stay focused. But I have been hoping that for a couple years, and it just hasn't happened."

He will point to -- in his criticisms of the media and branding of other people, he actually brings more attention to the story that he claims is fake news than if he just never tweeted about it at all. But I think that, when it comes to the economy here and something I think that the president does have actually a point about is, the media is in many ways, sometimes with the economy, overcorrecting for some of its past mistakes. So, in 2008, no one really predicted that the Great Recession was coming. And so I think that's why some people in the media are kind of trying to hedge their bets, so that they don't miss it this time."
    },

They are not into this following the markets and following the economy. They just don't get in the weeds. Now, I think, because of that, Gary, that their sort of eyes glaze over when you start discussing it, even though the statistics, whether you want to credit the president or not, are pretty -- pretty damn good. What do you think?"

But, look, the president has like 60 million people on Twitter. He's got the bully pulpit. He gets in the Rose Garden all the time in front of reporters, and he talks about all these other things. All I'm saying is, the stock market, the big four indices are like 2 or 2 percent from the highs. It's done very well since the election. The economy, we are not in recession. Considering the fact other areas around the globe are suspect, we're doing great compared to them. Yet the message is not getting out. I just think if they get some sound messaging, straightforward, and just get away from all this stuff, I bet you the poll numbers go up. But, again, it just hasn't happened."

And the president for the turn of 70,000 plus votes are so in some crucial Rust Belt states, turned this election and won. Now, in those same states, he's got a battle going on. And that's the one area where he is weak, to focus on those states, to focus on that, because the real slowdown -- and that is a slowdown from where we were -- is in the manufacturing sector, in those very states that he needs to win again. Right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TREENE",
      "utterance": "Exactly. And this is something -- this is why I think a lot of people are pointing to the potential for the some sort of economic slowdown because -- and this is something that the president himself has caused with this trade war with China. There's a lot of uncertainty. That's the thing that Wall Street hates the most, is the uncertainty in the markets. And that's I think contributed to some of these fears that there could be a potential economic slowdown. So, between the uncertainty with China, as well as some of the other president's economic policies, a lot of people are pointing to potentially there will be a slowdown in the next few years. And this is something that in my conversations with people on the Trump campaign, within the White House is their biggest fear, is if the economy starts to take a turn, the president really is in a much more dangerous spot in these states that you have just brought up."

They want to get some certainty on China and just everything else that's coming down the pike, also the Fed. But, look, I'm just not seeing an overall recession, slowdown, not a big deal. You have got the Fed now backstopping things. I'm pretty sure there's going to be at 1.5, maybe down to 1 percent on Fed Funds. And interest rates have really helped.

Let me just say that, if you implemented as she has discussed, which, again, I don't think will ever happen, you would have every wealthy family to which it would be applying in perpetual lawsuit with the IRS.

That's not too shabby, and apparently he has some money. I don't know. Anyway, there's a new iPhone that's front and center at this Apple launch today. I don't know about you. I'm a bit of a tech geek, almost as much as he is a market geek. I don't get it here. I don't see what's new here, but I could be missing something -- after this."

We know it was going to come before the end of this year, but the pricing was shocking, $4.99 a month. That's cheaper than Netflix. And that's even cheaper than the upcoming Disney+ streaming service and it will launch on November the 1st. Also, we got a new watch as well. The 5 series will be coming out and release later on this month. And a new iPad as well, which starts at $329 apiece. But it is still all about the iPhone for Apple. And given that we're in this crucial inflection point, where they're facing slowing iPhone sales, what's in this iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the Pro Max? I took a closer look for you. Listen."

      "utterance": "Thanks, Neil. And good afternoon. Flynn's new legal team convinced the judge to put off sentencing, giving them until mid-October to file more briefs with the court to make their case that special counsel prosecutors are guilty of misconduct and withholding evidence that would have helped Flynn's defense. Under the microscope today, former FBI Director James Comey. During his book tour, Comey admitted he sandbag the White House over Flynn's FBI interview about his contacts with the Russian ambassador before the inauguration. Comey said FBI leadership circumvented standard procedures and went around the White House counsel, taking advantage of the new administration. Flynn's team told the court they believe there is a memo that shows the FBI agents concluded in January 2017 that Flynn wasn't a Russian agent, raising more questions about the underlying offense. Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan, who threw out a conviction about a decade ago against Alaska Senator Ted Stevens over prosecutorial misconduct, wants briefs from both sides on the issues with a hearing on Brady material at the end of October. That is material favorable to the defense. The prosecution said that they had provided all relevant records to Flynn's legal team and emphasized Flynn pled guilty to lying to the FBI, but his conversations with the Russian ambassador, he was never prosecuted for being a Russian agent -- Neil."
