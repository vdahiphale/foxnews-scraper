I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto.  Why the former border chief under President Barack Obama hopes this president does do more. And former Whitewater prosecutor Robert Ray on if the president legally can do more.  But first to Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill on the vote that is happening right now, and John Roberts at the White House on the national emergency that is likely to be coming next.

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "And it was a bit of a surprise this afternoon, Charles, because the last thing we had been told by White House officials was that there was no read on which way the president was going on this bill, that they were still sifting through the 1,159 pages. There was a lot in it that they didn't like, things like the fact that the National Butterfly Center in Texas just West of McAllen had the authority under this bill to say, you can't build a wall on our property, and DHS was already making preparations to do that.  There's also a provision in it that would allow local officials in four Texas border towns, as well as one census area, to veto the wall if they didn't want it in their area. So the president saw that there was no other choice here, particularly given the amount of money that was in the wall.  He wanted $5.7 billion. He was only getting 1.375 -- that he was going to declare a national emergency. Sarah Sanders, the press secretary in a statement, saying: \"President Trump will sign the government funding bill and, as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action, including a national emergency to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. The president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border and secure our great country.\"  The president does have support from several members of Congress. You heard Mitch McConnell say that he's behind it. Senator Lindsey Graham floated this idea, this exact idea, more than a month ago, where he said the president should take a couple of weeks to try to negotiate a deal, and if he doesn't get what he wants, declare a national emergency. That is exactly what happened. Jim Jordan from the House Freedom Caucus, introducing a continuing resolution yesterday that would have allowed another week for more negotiation, said the president should declare an emergency.   And the White House knows full well, Charles, that they're going to end up in court on all of this, and that they are prepared to fight this fight.  Now, here's the way they could avoid a court fight, at least at the beginning. The Office of Management and Budget has identified more than $5.7 billion, according to Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff, that it could put toward, that it can move around together and put to work construction of a border wall. The first tranche of that money, they think, wouldn't meet a legal challenge. But then each basket of money that they pull from after that sort of increases the chances. The president was looking to get $2.6 billion as of, say, the middle of January. So, if he can get this 1.375, declare an emergency, and get that billion or so that they think that they can get without a legal challenge, then he's most of the way to where he wanted to be, at least for fiscal year 2019. Then he can fight this fight as of September 30, when fiscal year '20 starts. We will see how it goes. he will probably be enjoined by the ACLU or some other group in a San Francisco or Los Angeles court, something in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, fairly quickly, but it may be that if the initial legal challenge the White House may win.   So we will just have to see how all of this plays out. We're just at the starting gate here, Charles.",

There's two sections there, Charles, that talk about it. There's Section 231 and 232-A. And that's where the 55 miles, the only 55 miles they're giving, but they put so many limitations on that 55 miles, like local governments have to agree, and there's five areas where they can't build a wall or put any funding whatsoever. That pretty much erases the 55 miles that's included. So we're not going to get probably a single mile of wall there.

That should lay out what the cartels do and the devastation in this country and the drugs that are pouring in. And we could go on and on with the facts, which political party wants to discard 100 percent. And one other thing that I want to talk about this bill that's very important, Section 2 -- it's Section 224. It actually creates a new level of amnesty. If you sponsor a child, this bill tells ICE, you can't do anything to a sponsor. You can't go after a sponsor. You can't go after the family of a sponsor of a child. That gives them 100 percent amnesty. And we know the majority of sponsors are here illegally. It's amnesty without calling it amnesty.",

It's not an omnibus, but a minibus, where they glom together seven of the appropriations bills that weren't finished for this fiscal year. The seventh, of course, is the Department of Homeland Security.  And looking at this vote right now -- I'm looking at the screen just off to my right here -- there are more than 80 yeses on this bill. That is a big deal, because what that meant is that there were -- there was so much support for this between Republicans and Democrats that the president was about to be abandoned, frankly, by this. Now, Mitch McConnell, I think it's very important to note that he didn't put this piece of legislation the floor until he got assurances from the president of the United States that he was in fact going to sign it. That was an issue in December. You might remember that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, felt that he was burned when they put a bill on the floor to avoid a shutdown for just about five or six weeks, and then the president said, no, I'm not going to sign it. One of the other issues here -- and we have been hearing about this the past hour here -- is, what is going to be the constitutional issues if the president goes ahead and declares a national emergency? Now, I'm going to look right here at Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution. It says, no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law. That's very important, because there are ways in what we call transfer authority and reprogramming where you can go around a little bit, administrations can go around in an individual spending bill and in extreme cases even go between multiple spending bills and say, OK, we're not going to get a blessing from Congress, but we're going to move some of that money around, but you have to get a sign-off there from the leaders on the Appropriations Committees in both the House and the Senate. One wonders if Democrats would go for that. And that's why this declaration of a national emergency is so important. Here's the other key thing to note.  I asked Nancy Pelosi if the announcement by the president that he was going to sign the bill and the fact that he was declaring a national emergency, would that affect the vote matrix here in the House tonight? And she said, we have the votes. So it's going to pass in the House of Representatives. We don't think that they're going to be able to pass this alone with just Democratic votes. They're going to need some Republicans to come on board here. If you do the math, Democrats can lose about 18 votes, if everybody is voting on their side. So we expect a bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives probably later tonight.",

And I asked him, I said, well, will you try to hold this up? Remember, they just had that procedural vote a few minutes ago to break a filibuster. And Senator Paul said, well, I will just vote no. Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, he indicated that he needed about at least a day or so to go through and look for what he called nuggets in the bill. But, at the end of the day, everybody said, all right, we're just going to go through and do this. And, Charles, the one thing I want to point out, that, inevitably, in the next couple of days, people are going to be mining and finding those nuggets that are hidden in this bill. That always happens when you do a big bill. The other thing I should point out it is 1,100 pages, but 1,100 pages across seven appropriations bills. They had already knocked out five of the spending bills for this fiscal year. So you're glomming together those seven. So, on the outside, that might seem like a really big bill, but if you're doing seven appropriations bills together, 1,100 pages is really not that big.  I just want to look off screen here for a second to check where we are on this vote. We would think that they would close this pretty soon. They're up to a total of 97 members voting, 81-16. And we know that Richard Burr, the Republican senator from North Carolina, he went to North Carolina for the funeral of the late Congressman Walter Jones. So we might be just waiting for one more person to vote here. But the bottom line is that this bill is going to pass in the Senate sometime in the next five or 10 minutes with an overwhelming vote.

I think the president, though, has an area where he can act constitutionally. He is able to move certain funds around, some of which I think are not open to question, as is indicated by OMB, some of which would be more likely to be subject to challenge. Yes, there will be litigation, but that's not an unfamiliar place for this administration to be. It's not frankly a place that's unfamiliar to any administration.

Senators want to go home for the next week-and-a-half here. The House will come back in later tonight and vote on this bill. I want to pick back up on this point I was talking about a moment ago that there are political consequences if the president goes through and tries to transfer money from one account to the other. Now, there's two issues here. There's declaring a national emergency. And that's different from transferring money around from different accounts. Keep in mind that the Homeland Security appropriations bill is about $49 billion, $50 billion. There's a cap on that. And so if they try to move money from account A for, say, pandemic flu and another account over to the wall, then somebody might say, wait a minute, we need money for the pandemic flu. Or maybe they try to go over to the Pentagon appropriations bill and try to move money for ships or aircraft and move things over there. There are constituencies throughout the Congress, Democrats and Republicans, who will absolutely howl about that. Don't forget that they just got a big increase in defense spending last year. And if the president goes in, even though some of these lawmakers might, in fact, support the wall, that's going to be a problem for them, when they say, wait a minute, you're going to go in and raid Peter to pay Paul. That's going to be a problem here on Capitol Hill. Watch for those fights. Here's another point I want to make about Nancy Pelosi. She kept her powder dry as to what the tactics might be by Democrats . She talked about, maybe we should declare a national emergency on firearms. She cited the one-year anniversary of the massacre in Parkland, Florida, a year ago. And there was just a markup in the Judiciary Committee on a gun bill yesterday to increase restrictions on background checks and things. She might say, wait a minute, if the president going to play ball this way, and we think we can get a Democrat elected to the White House in 2020, maybe we like this idea of national emergencies. We want to have this agility. This is kind of opening Pandora's box. And that's why a lot of lawmakers on Capitol Hill in one respect are very concerned, because it's ceding power from Article 1 of the Constitution, Article 2 of the Constitution, from the Congress to the executive -- Charles.",

That's not good, four pounds more than he weighed last year. His blood pressure is still fine, though, 118 over 80, his temperature 98.2. A lot of people think the president runs a little hot, but he actually runs a little cool. There were no findings of any significance or changes to the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, teeth, guns, heart, lung, skin, gastrointestinal or neurologic system, liver, kidney and thyroid function all normal, as are his electrolytes and blood counts. He still has a fairly high cholesterol number. It's 196, with his LDL at 122. So, as a result, the doctors increased his dose of Crestor up to 40 milligrams a day, which is pretty close to the maximum. But all in all, his heart is in good shape. They say that the rest of him is in good shape as well. So he does remain in very good health. I don't want to say he's the healthiest president ever, but he's in good health.",

So my daughter was subjected to a kid that wore swastikas to school, brought a dead animal to school, bullets to school, and with never being arrested. So those things were addressed now in Florida. We're looking into the diversionary programs. The president recently through his federal commission ended the Obama era leniency policy, so every kid's going to have a safer environment throughout the school. Also, what we looked on was arming the right personnel in schools. Through -- through the research, through that Marjory Stoneman Douglas Commission, they came to the conclusion that armed personnel in schools would make a big difference. So now in Florida, we have one armed per thousand student. And a lot of other states are following in Florida's footsteps, because usually a mass shooting takes about four minutes. And average response time is about seven. So we need people to act right then and there at a situation if we want our kids safe.",

There was a lot in it that they didn't like, things like the fact that the National Butterfly Center in Texas just West of McAllen had the authority under this bill to say, you can't build a wall on our property, and DHS was already making preparations to do that. There's also a provision in it that would allow local officials in four Texas border towns, as well as one census area, to veto the wall if they didn't want it in their area. So the president saw that there was no other choice here, particularly given the amount of money that was in the wall. He wanted $5.7 billion. He was only getting 1.375 -- that he was going to declare a national emergency."
    },

      "speaker": "Sarah Sanders, the press secretary in a statement, saying",
      "utterance": "\"President Trump will sign the government funding bill and, as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action, including a national emergency to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. The president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border and secure our great country.\" The president does have support from several members of Congress. You heard Mitch McConnell say that he's behind it. Senator Lindsey Graham floated this idea, this exact idea, more than a month ago, where he said the president should take a couple of weeks to try to negotiate a deal, and if he doesn't get what he wants, declare a national emergency. That is exactly what happened. Jim Jordan from the House Freedom Caucus, introducing a continuing resolution yesterday that would have allowed another week for more negotiation, said the president should declare an emergency. And the White House knows full well, Charles, that they're going to end up in court on all of this, and that they are prepared to fight this fight. Now, here's the way they could avoid a court fight, at least at the beginning. The Office of Management and Budget has identified more than $5.7 billion, according to Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff, that it could put toward, that it can move around together and put to work construction of a border wall. The first tranche of that money, they think, wouldn't meet a legal challenge. But then each basket of money that they pull from after that sort of increases the chances. The president was looking to get $2.6 billion as of, say, the middle of January. So, if he can get this 1.375, declare an emergency, and get that billion or so that they think that they can get without a legal challenge, then he's most of the way to where he wanted to be, at least for fiscal year 2019. Then he can fight this fight as of September 30, when fiscal year '20 starts. We will see how it goes. he will probably be enjoined by the ACLU or some other group in a San Francisco or Los Angeles court, something in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, fairly quickly, but it may be that if the initial legal challenge the White House may win. So we will just have to see how all of this plays out. We're just at the starting gate here, Charles."

And everyone's saying, hey, this thing has -- this could be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it could take a long time, it could be a legal nightmare.

There's two sections there, Charles, that talk about it. There's Section 231 and 232-A. And that's where the 55 miles, the only 55 miles they're giving, but they put so many limitations on that 55 miles, like local governments have to agree, and there's five areas where they can't build a wall or put any funding whatsoever. That pretty much erases the 55 miles that's included. So we're not going to get probably a single mile of wall there.

Right there alone to me is a national emergency. Read the indictment of Chapo that just was convicted this week in New York. That should lay out what the cartels do and the devastation in this country and the drugs that are pouring in. And we could go on and on with the facts, which political party wants to discard 100 percent. And one other thing that I want to talk about this bill that's very important, Section 2 -- it's Section 224. It actually creates a new level of amnesty. If you sponsor a child, this bill tells ICE, you can't do anything to a sponsor. You can't go after a sponsor. You can't go after the family of a sponsor of a child. That gives them 100 percent amnesty. And we know the majority of sponsors are here illegally. It's amnesty without calling it amnesty."

      "utterance": "Well, right now, the Senate is taking this final vote on this appropriations bill. Keep in mind that this is a -- what we call a minibus. It's not an omnibus, but a minibus, where they glom together seven of the appropriations bills that weren't finished for this fiscal year. The seventh, of course, is the Department of Homeland Security. And looking at this vote right now -- I'm looking at the screen just off to my right here -- there are more than 80 yeses on this bill. That is a big deal, because what that meant is that there were -- there was so much support for this between Republicans and Democrats that the president was about to be abandoned, frankly, by this. Now, Mitch McConnell, I think it's very important to note that he didn't put this piece of legislation the floor until he got assurances from the president of the United States that he was in fact going to sign it. That was an issue in December. You might remember that Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, felt that he was burned when they put a bill on the floor to avoid a shutdown for just about five or six weeks, and then the president said, no, I'm not going to sign it. One of the other issues here -- and we have been hearing about this the past hour here -- is, what is going to be the constitutional issues if the president goes ahead and declares a national emergency? Now, I'm going to look right here at Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution. It says, no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law. That's very important, because there are ways in what we call transfer authority and reprogramming where you can go around a little bit, administrations can go around in an individual spending bill and in extreme cases even go between multiple spending bills and say, OK, we're not going to get a blessing from Congress, but we're going to move some of that money around, but you have to get a sign-off there from the leaders on the Appropriations Committees in both the House and the Senate. One wonders if Democrats would go for that. And that's why this declaration of a national emergency is so important. Here's the other key thing to note. I asked Nancy Pelosi if the announcement by the president that he was going to sign the bill and the fact that he was declaring a national emergency, would that affect the vote matrix here in the House tonight? And she said, we have the votes. So it's going to pass in the House of Representatives. We don't think that they're going to be able to pass this alone with just Democratic votes. They're going to need some Republicans to come on board here. If you do the math, Democrats can lose about 18 votes, if everybody is voting on their side. So we expect a bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives probably later tonight."

It's $300 billion, 1,100 pages, $270 million per page, and that no senator is even prepared -- pretending to have read the thing, swamp thing.\" Any others down there expressing the similar sentiment?"

And I asked him, I said, well, will you try to hold this up? Remember, they just had that procedural vote a few minutes ago to break a filibuster. And Senator Paul said, well, I will just vote no. Senator John Kennedy, Republican from Louisiana, he indicated that he needed about at least a day or so to go through and look for what he called nuggets in the bill. But, at the end of the day, everybody said, all right, we're just going to go through and do this. And, Charles, the one thing I want to point out, that, inevitably, in the next couple of days, people are going to be mining and finding those nuggets that are hidden in this bill. That always happens when you do a big bill. The other thing I should point out it is 1,100 pages, but 1,100 pages across seven appropriations bills. They had already knocked out five of the spending bills for this fiscal year. So you're glomming together those seven. So, on the outside, that might seem like a really big bill, but if you're doing seven appropriations bills together, 1,100 pages is really not that big. I just want to look off screen here for a second to check where we are on this vote. We would think that they would close this pretty soon. They're up to a total of 97 members voting, 81-16. And we know that Richard Burr, the Republican senator from North Carolina, he went to North Carolina for the funeral of the late Congressman Walter Jones. So we might be just waiting for one more person to vote here. But the bottom line is that this bill is going to pass in the Senate sometime in the next five or 10 minutes with an overwhelming vote. And that should probably give the House of Representatives enough air cover to pass this probably with an overwhelming vote later tonight."

I think the president, though, has an area where he can act constitutionally. He is able to move certain funds around, some of which I think are not open to question, as is indicated by OMB, some of which would be more likely to be subject to challenge. Yes, there will be litigation, but that's not an unfamiliar place for this administration to be. It's not frankly a place that's unfamiliar to any administration.

And then certain things flow from that, including access to funds that the president otherwise might not have access to. So, the argument that this is going around the appropriations power is an interesting one. But it sort of bumps up against the actual reality, which is Congress has already legislated in this area. And as the Supreme Court made clear in Youngstown in the concurring opinion, the famous concurring opinion by Justice Jackson, when the president acts pursuant to express authorization from Congress -- this would be an example -- he's at the height of his power, including the fact that he's the commander in chief."

Senators want to go home for the next week-and-a-half here. The House will come back in later tonight and vote on this bill. I want to pick back up on this point I was talking about a moment ago that there are political consequences if the president goes through and tries to transfer money from one account to the other. Now, there's two issues here. There's declaring a national emergency. And that's different from transferring money around from different accounts. Keep in mind that the Homeland Security appropriations bill is about $49 billion, $50 billion. There's a cap on that. And so if they try to move money from account A for, say, pandemic flu and another account over to the wall, then somebody might say, wait a minute, we need money for the pandemic flu. Or maybe they try to go over to the Pentagon appropriations bill and try to move money for ships or aircraft and move things over there. There are constituencies throughout the Congress, Democrats and Republicans, who will absolutely howl about that. Don't forget that they just got a big increase in defense spending last year. And if the president goes in, even though some of these lawmakers might, in fact, support the wall, that's going to be a problem for them, when they say, wait a minute, you're going to go in and raid Peter to pay Paul. That's going to be a problem here on Capitol Hill. Watch for those fights. Here's another point I want to make about Nancy Pelosi. She kept her powder dry as to what the tactics might be by Democrats . She talked about, maybe we should declare a national emergency on firearms. She cited the one-year anniversary of the massacre in Parkland, Florida, a year ago. And there was just a markup in the Judiciary Committee on a gun bill yesterday to increase restrictions on background checks and things. She might say, wait a minute, if the president going to play ball this way, and we think we can get a Democrat elected to the White House in 2020, maybe we like this idea of national emergencies. We want to have this agility. This is kind of opening Pandora's box. And that's why a lot of lawmakers on Capitol Hill in one respect are very concerned, because it's ceding power from Article 1 of the Constitution, Article 2 of the Constitution, from the Congress to the executive -- Charles."

We need to have a work permit system. That's really what we should be doing. But the Democrats in the House haven't wanted to come to the table. So they promised that they were going to take care of immigration. This is the obvious time to take care of the DACA kids. But they're not willing to even put something on the table. So what we're left with is barely starting the wall. But a true solution is real border security, with a real worker permit system, and dealing with the people that are here. That's what the American people should expect from us."

President Trump now, perhaps, according to sources, ready to use a national emergency, Sarah Sanders saying that they're very prepared for legal challenges. Where do you stand with respect to that? Because I know, within the Republican Party, some think that this could be a dangerous path to go down. It could open a Pandora's box."

      "speaker": "NUNES",

So I really support this idea, because I think we have to have legal challenges, so that we can show the American people whether the courts are going to only side with Democrats and Democratic presidents, or are the courts going to be fair? There's definitely in the law -- this is an emergency on the border. The president has the powers to do it, where if you take, with President Obama, even though I'm the person who actually wants to deal with the DACA kids -- I think they need to be dealt with in a humane way. But President Obama didn't have the legal authority to give these people status. And that's still being fought over in the courts. So I think it's a good idea, because we're paying the price for an administration that went really awry over the last eight years, before Donald Trump became president."

I mean, what do you make of that?"

What I think most Republicans agree with that, but the terror came from the FBI and Department of Justice, who used a document, dirt, dug up by the Clinton campaign to start an investigation, and then including -- I mean, if you read -- if you have seen some of the interviews or have read the excerpts -- he even talked about the steps that he -- that he took to ensure that the investigation would continue. We know from -- I have looked at all of this over the last two years. We know for a fact the FBI knew at the time of the appointment of the special counsel from the lead investigators that there was no there there, meaning that they had nothing on Trump. They had no collusion. They never did. Why? Because it was propaganda from the Russians given to the Clinton campaign, picked up by our FBI. It's an embarrassment. And it is a terror. And they did try to attempt a coup. And it should never have been done. And this needs to be righted. It's a wrong that needs to be righted."

And I think we get hit with so much news, and it changes every 24 hours, that we just let things go. But the idea that the FBI was doing a nose count to see maybe how many members of the Cabinet -- they needed eight -- would be OK with the 25th Amendment to take away the presidency, to overturn essentially the vote of the American people, ostensibly because they thought he would pull the plug on a Russian investigation. It just -- it's so far-fetched. And yet this is real life. This was happening. How is this happening in this country right now?"

The only evidence they had was this dossier that the Clinton campaign paid for that came from Russians. And the irony in all this -- and I know I can't say it enough times -- the very thing that they were investigating the Trump campaign for, which was supposedly getting dirt from Russians to use against Hillary Clinton, that's exactly what the Clinton campaign did. And so I hope that the new A.G. gets in there, and he starts to clean house, and so that we can start to put the Department of Justice and the FBI back together again."

Whether -- whether it was a conspiracy or not, whether it was abuse of power, I don't know, but they should be held accountable. The court, the FISA court, should hold them accountable also. The FISA court should step in. They could all lose their -- their law licenses or be -- or be charged with lying to the court or misleading the court. Those are the types of things that need to happen if we're going to keep this process, this FISA process, which is designed to target terrorists, to target bad guys. The American people need to understand that system that's supposed to target really bad terrorists and foreigners was used against a political campaign. That's where this all went wrong. And somebody's got to fix it, because every day that goes by that it's not fixed, there's fewer and fewer Republicans who will support the continuation of these programs, which are extremely important to protecting Americans."

It's a joint statement -- quote -- \"Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for it, his wall. \"It is yet another demonstration of President Trump's naked contempt for the rule of law. This is not an emergency, and the president's fear- mongering doesn't make it one. He couldn't convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he's trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it.

So they probably just ought to look in the mirror, because normally whatever they accuse you of doing, they're actually doing themselves. Like I said earlier, I think this is an important step to take, because this needs to get into the courts, because we need to deal with all of the executive actions that have taken place over the last decade or so."

Remember, Republicans got about 180 votes last year in the House. We need 218. We only got 180. But that was for DACA. It was for building the wall. It was for border security. It was a great -- it was a great piece of legislation. Not one Democrat voted for it. Here they now have -- they promised all these DACA kids that they're going to take care of the DACA kids. The president reached out to them, gave them an olive branch to have some type of comprehensive immigration reform, and they haven't done it. So -- and then they sit there.

A team of doctors, including his personal physician, Sean Conley, and 11 specialists looked him over. And they pronounce that he is -- quote -- \"in very good health overall.\" One problem for the president, he weighs 243 pounds. That gives him a BMI of 30.4. That's not good, four pounds more than he weighed last year. His blood pressure is still fine, though, 118 over 80, his temperature 98.2. A lot of people think the president runs a little hot, but he actually runs a little cool. There were no findings of any significance or changes to the ears, eyes, nose, mouth, teeth, guns, heart, lung, skin, gastrointestinal or neurologic system, liver, kidney and thyroid function all normal, as are his electrolytes and blood counts. He still has a fairly high cholesterol number. It's 196, with his LDL at 122. So, as a result, the doctors increased his dose of Crestor up to 40 milligrams a day, which is pretty close to the maximum. But all in all, his heart is in good shape. They say that the rest of him is in good shape as well. So he does remain in very good health. I don't want to say he's the healthiest president ever, but he's in good health."

So my daughter was subjected to a kid that wore swastikas to school, brought a dead animal to school, bullets to school, and with never being arrested. So those things were addressed now in Florida. We're looking into the diversionary programs. The president recently through his federal commission ended the Obama era leniency policy, so every kid's going to have a safer environment throughout the school. Also, what we looked on was arming the right personnel in schools. Through -- through the research, through that Marjory Stoneman Douglas Commission, they came to the conclusion that armed personnel in schools would make a big difference. So now in Florida, we have one armed per thousand student. And a lot of other states are following in Florida's footsteps, because usually a mass shooting takes about four minutes. And average response time is about seven. So we need people to act right then and there at a situation if we want our kids safe."

And if someone knows that they're going to go to a school that doesn't have a sign on it that says gun-free zone or there's a canine on patrol, they're not going to go to the school."

When my daughter was waiting, if there would have been a teacher on that third floor, a janitor, a lunch lady that's been trained, they could have saved my daughter. So I know how extensive the training is. It's about 150 hours of training. They're held to a higher accuracy than regular deputies, gun retention. They're trained so extensive, that it would be an asset for any school to have someone to go through that guardian program and be armed at a school. So I'm all for it.
