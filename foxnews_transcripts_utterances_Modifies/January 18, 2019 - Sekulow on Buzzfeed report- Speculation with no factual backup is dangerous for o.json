It is a lie. It is all fake news.  So, the professional Trump haters and the fake news media, they have yet done it again.  And earlier today, \"BuzzFeed\" news reported a salacious story about Michael Cohen and President Trump, alleging that Cohen briefed Trump about a building project in Moscow numerous times and that the president directed Michael Cohen to lie about the existence of that project when it already had been well-known. Now, the story allegedly sourced two anonymous federal law enforcement officials.  As it turns out, this report was total fake news. Everyone at \"BuzzFeed\" should be ashamed of themselves. But moments ago, the Office of Special Counsel, they actually issued a statement. They wrote, quote: \"BuzzFeed's\" description of specific statements to the special counsel's office and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate. Not accurate. But are we really surprised? Oh, and it even gets better. The editor-in-chief of \"BuzzFeed\" is actually standing by the reporting, which the FBI, the special counsel completely refutes. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "All right. You would think by now the so-called journalists in the echo chamber, the extension of the Democratic Party, would have learned their lesson. They have been burn sod many times before in the last two years.  Remember, the short life hysteria about NPR's fake Don Jr. story? Remember the hype surrounding Michael Cohen secret prom trip? It never happened. \"The Guardian's\" false reporting about Paul Manafort or when three CNN fake news staffers -- they were forced to resign after reporting fake news about our friend Anthony Scaramucci.  Look at the list we have compiled, fake story after fake story. Now, \"The Washington Examiner\" put this together, 47 printed pages for one year alone against Donald Trump of fake news that they breathlessly report. Unbridled.  Remember what I said at the beginning of the year hatred of the president, so many forced corrections. But then they just keep doing it again and again. How many anonymous sources hearsay, rumors? Do you think any of this is good for the country? Are they looking out for your security, the economy, the better job for your children, a better future for our grand kids? You know what? Right now one more notch in the old fake news belt. It is beyond disgusting.  But you just saw it all, all day, people screaming impeach, impeach, impeach. This is all the hate that we get as I have been saying every second, every minute, every hour of every day from the Democrats, the hate Trump press and, of course, the deep state. Now, all of a sudden, today, the hate Trump media was concerned about obstruction of justice. That's what they wanted you to believe today. But they are the same people who gave Hillary Clinton a pass. It's been almost two straight years of never ending, conspiracy theories. Fake news hatred. Not just for the president though, but also for the people that voted for this president. I have said it since 2007 and 2008. Journalism in America is dead, and it is buried, and driven by an unprecedented pathological hatred for the president. The bias in this country has become more important than what is fact and what is reporting, rumor is more important than sources, as reckless speculation rules the day. We told you at the beginning of the year on this program. We will always fight back. We want the country to be safer, more secure. We want every American family prosperous and we are going to look out for you, the American people, because you deserve better than what the rest of the media is offering, which is why we actually cover, for example, the crisis at our southern border.  Now, when the fake news industry is too busy with their fake stories and conspiracy theories about the president, well, today, nearly 400 migrants were apprehended by border patrol at once after all crossing illegally. The situation is urgent. It is serious.  Yet, someone still needs to remind the speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, that we're in the middle of a government shutdown. Her detachment and heir indifference, her lack of self-awareness is beyond shocking. Today, Speaker Pelosi and other top Democrats once again tried to skip out of town, a week long international excursion which would have guaranteed the furloughed employees some 800,000 of them don't get paid again. Now, this time they were going to take a commercial plane just for show after the president foiled her first attempt to leave the country on your dime in a U.S. military aircraft. But now, after her new plan released sparking security concerns, Pelosi's overseas voyage has once again been postponed indefinitely. Now, maybe she will accept what is the president's daily invitation to negotiate -- safety, security, and our country, and the government shutdown. Spokesperson for the speaker actually blamed the president, of course, for the leak. An allegation the White House has called a flat out lie.  So, here we are today, 28 days into a government shutdown and the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the most powerful Democrat in the country, is trying desperately, once again, to leave town, refusing to negotiate yet again. Remember, she took her lengthy tropical vacation at the beginning of the shutdown. Dozens of other Democrats, oh, they had a luxurious vacation paid for by lobbyists in a chartered aircraft to Puerto Rico. While Pelosi and Schumer sent aides to negotiate with the vice president of the United States? Instead of helping the furloughed employees and creating more security that they did support four years ago? So, tonight we have got to ask some really important obvious questions. Does Speaker Pelosi really want an answer solution? Is she really working at all? Is she now compromised by the radical left wing of her party and scared to death to even talk to the president? Does she care about the 90 percent of heroin in this country coming across our southern border, or the gangs or the cartels or the human trafficking? She won't even talk to the angel moms and dads that went outside her office this week that have lost their children because of illegal immigration? Now, the president, he didn't go on vacation. He has been here the whole time inviting Democrats every day. He is trying to fulfill not only a campaign promise but he is trying to keep the country safe, trying to prevent the drugs from coming into the country.   Remember, maybe the 1 percent or 2 percent of those people that enter the country illegally, they are criminals and murders have happened and worse. And, you know, how many sexual assaults? How many violent assaults? Now, the president tweeted today: I will be making a major announcement concerning the humanitarian crisis on our southern border, and the shutdown tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 p.m. live from the White House. Oh, he is working on Saturday. In the meantime, President Trump is ready, will, able to negotiate and has been since day one of the shutdown. Democrats have offered nothing except a dollar. No negotiations, no compromise. No time with the president. They just sit back and do nothing. Hundreds of thousands of government employees are not receiving their pay. The speaker is having a meltdown about not getting to take a government funded trip on your dime. And even worse, thousands of lives have been lost, thousands more devastated by the flow of illegal drugs, human trafficking, the opioid crisis. The gang activity across the southern border and Nancy Pelosi complaining about having to postpone a government- funded trip. That's where her mind is tonight.  But fear not, let not your heart be troubled. Speaker Pelosi, while Americans suffer, while we're not safer -- well, your close friends in the mainstream media, they are cheering you every step of the way. You know, just like last week, manufactured crisis. Democrats say it. The media says it. They are like tied at the hip. Take a look.",

In other words, really simply, you need to do your job. The president, his door is wide open. Go negotiate a deal. Maybe you will get some of the things you say you want -- secure the borders, reopen the government. And for goodness' sake, get out of your ivory tower. If not, the president, he will do it without you.  Now, let's not lose sight of the fact that what we're fighting for, don't be fooled by all the Trump haters, the crisis at the southern border is not manufactured. In fact, as can you see, a brand new migrant caravan marching toward our southern border as we speak. Earlier today, thousands of migrants poured into southern Mexico after authorities there, they just left the gates at the border wide open. Mexican border guards didn't show up until sunrise -- or actually after sunrise. So, now, while Mexico may be embracing open borders, the president, he is continuing to stand strong, stay on the job, waiting to negotiate, waiting to keep his promise to secure the border of this country. This is about life and death. He tweeted today, quote: Another big caravan is heading our way. Very hard to stop without a wall. And the fact is we have an actual crisis on our southern border. Just look at this video from border patrol and the Huma sector in Arizona where nearly 400 migrants apprehended at once today after crossing illegally. That is not manufactured. That is the reality. We need these physical barriers, which are effective, all across the world. Remember yesterday, also in Arizona, a group of migrants were caught trying to tunnel under a wall. But, because there was a wall, they couldn't just walk across and flee law enforcement. And once they tunneled through, they were promptly caught. Oh, the wall works. Now, don't expect to hear any of this from the hate Trump media as you can see from tonight's \"BuzzFeed\" huge massive embarrassment the fake news epidemic has never been worse. By the way, it all surrounds one thing -- their hatred of all things Donald Trump. And by the way, Trump supporters. And that's why they are all completely ignored what was major news that we had this week about the deep state, about FISA abuse. And, meanwhile, we have been one of the only programs reporting these latest developments, latest, needless to say, it was a bad week for some of those embedded inside of our government that don't like the president. We learned under James Comey's watch, his general counsel, we learned this week, James Baker, is now under a criminal investigation.  And according to John Solomon's reporting and don't forget Andrew McCabe, his deputy, is also under a criminal investigation. And John Solomon pointing out that James Comey and others were all briefed about the phony dossier back in August. They were told by Bruce Ohr, according to his sworn testimony that we only got this week then he told all of them in the FBI, all of them in the State Department, oh, Hillary paid for it. And Christopher Steele hates the president. Oh, and, by the way, they put this thing together and I wouldn't trust it. But in spite of that warning, he went ahead anyway. And as the Grassley- Graham memo pointed out, the bulk of information was used in the FISA warrant. That would be a conspiracy to commit a fraud against the court. We also know that Andrew Weissmann and another Mueller investigator, they were also briefed on these warnings think knew it was biased and unverified. Hillary paid for lies to influence the 2016 election. But still, Mueller used it as a basis of his investigation but never investigated Hillary who bought it. Now, we have been warning you for months, this is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in modern American history. And, by the way, the news media can be biased in other ways. Like what they don't report. Joining us now, the author of \"The Case against the Democratic House Impeaching Donald Trump\", Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, FOX News contributor Sara Carter. Professor, you know, what I really like about you is even in your new book, even though you have been ostracized from the Martha's Vineyard crowd. I'm sorry about that. I know it's actually been hurtful to you. You just continue to point out criminalizing political differences, waiting for truth in fact. And you see this happen now. I got 47 printed pages for 2017 alone. Fake news stories that the media has peddle you had hysterically to the American public. To me, it's a danger to the country.",

I have a responsibility as a 50-year civil libertarian to speak out about these issues whether it involves North Korea or president Trump. Look, on the \"BuzzFeed\" thing, before the announcement was made by the special counsel's office, I posted a piece on the \"New York Daily News\" raising all kinds of skepticism, asking hard questions about the \"BuzzFeed\" report. It did not seem credible to me, particularly the arguments that it's like Richard Nixon. It's not like Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon, on tape, told his subordinates directly to lie about criminal activities, breaks in, et cetera. And here, of course, there is no credible allegation that there are emails or there are eyewitnesses. And I pointed that out in my article and now my view has been confirmed. Look, I have to tell you my views on this investigation have been confirmed over and over and over again. I have been right and many of the get Trump any cost people have been wrong over time. So, I think it's about time that we start substituting -- stop substituting wishful thinking. You know, it's wishful thinking to get Trump at any cost people wish to find evidence to impeach him. And they substitute wishful thinking for careful factual analysis and careful factual analysis, and victims of the American public. We have a right to be informed of the facts.

Sara Carter thank you. Joining us now, a host now of \"Life Liberty & Levin\", every Sunday night, the number one show right here on Fox News, I call him the \"Great One, Mark Levin\". Mark, I will let you go, but the one thing I will stay to start is how fascinating today, Democrats and the media actually cared about, quote, obstruction of justice when they have ignored, let's see, the deleting subpoena emails, acid washing hard drives and busting up devices and removing SIM cards. That never expressed them. But only if it's Trump do they get worked up about something. MARK LEVIN, LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN HOST (via telephone): Never will impress them. I want to make a point here, Sean, about Mueller's office. They sat there all day long while this false reporting was going on, while the president was being smeared, while the reporters so-called and their friendly Democrats with Capitol Hill saying this is an impeachable offense. They won't be held to account. They won't apologize. They will continue on tomorrow until the next great fake story. I want to say this about Mr. Mueller's office. They didn't do anybody any favor. I will tell you why they issued their statement around 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time tonight, because I was on the radio, among other things, demanding that the attorney general of the United States, Mr. Whitaker, the deputy attorney general of the United States, Mr. Rosenstein, immediately launch a leak investigation because if these reporters, these two clowns were right -- of course they weren't, but if they were, the only place these documents, texts and emails could have come from is Mr. Mueller's office. And they issued their statement 7:30, give or take tonight, tonight Eastern Time not because the story was accurate. It was inaccurate. But because if you conduct a leak investigation the sit down Mr. Weissmann and you make him undertake a lie detector test and ask him if he has ever talked to the press about anything, about any subject or any of those individuals in that office, including Mr. Mueller, I suspect a number of people would be mad. And so, the fact is, Mr. Mueller's office did not want a leak investigation. There was every basis to have a leak investigation if, in fact, the Justice Department believed this story was accurate. So they didn't release this rare statement just because they are good people. They released it to cover their asses because they don't want a leak investigation again.

But that's like saying, if someone robbed a bank, it would be a crime. If someone did rob a bank it would be a crime. But, I think, it's important here for a moment to reflect on that this was actually a good day for justice and a very, very good day for the President of United States. But it's also important to say and to focus for a moment here on what the Special Counsel's Office actually said. And Sean - because my job as the President's lawyer, as a part of the legal team is to analyze these things and to respond to what was going on - this frenzy that was going on in the last 24 hours. And so let me start with what the - what he actually said. This is from Bob Mueller's office. By the way, it's the first time they have spoken publicly about a false news story. This is what they said, \"BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office\", that's one. And, \"Characterization of documents\", that's two. And \"Testimony obtained by this office regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate\", so it's three things. It's the description of the specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, the characterization of the documents that were the basis upon which the media speculation started and the testimony obtained by the office regarding Michael Cohen's cooperation with the Special Counsel's Office, all of that as reported in the report today are not correct. And this isn't coming from me, it's not coming from the American Center for Law & Justice, it's not coming from my law firm, who is it coming from? It's coming from the Special Counsel's Office - Bob Mueller's office. So I think, Rudy Giuliani is right in saying that this was the right thing to do and I'm glad they did it. Now where does that leave us? So Sean, here's what I think this is. This is a warning sign to everybody that the speculation with no factual backup is dangerous for our republic. And look, I've been dealing with this, as you know, for more than 24 hour - about 24 hours. Actually it started last night about 10 o'clock, so about an hour from now. And the end result of this was the right thing. But it took us 24 hours to get the right thing. But I think it's important for everyone that's watching to realize that the speculation and the media anxiousness to report out of the gate has got to stop. But there's also another message in all, and you said this in your monologue. Look what is transpired - people say is there any action being taken on the people that are doing wrong deeds, illegal conduct? Well let's look at it.

We know about Strzok and Page. They were even appointed to Mueller's team along with Genie Ray (ph) who used to be Clinton's attorney and the Pit Bull, Andrew Weissmann. But here's my question, Bruce Ohr, we learned, under oath, in testimony released this week, that in fact he warned everybody about the phony dossier. He warned that Clinton paid for it.",

But let me tell you something else about the Bruce Ohr testimony. Bruce Ohr did say that he told the higher-ups at the FBI - my gosh, he was the #4, that that in fact that the dossier was biased. That it was paid for by political operatives. But his wife worked for the political operative company that put the dossier together. And there's - also simultaneous with his mea culpa from Bruce Ohr is what - a text messages that have been released between Bruce Ohr and who - Christopher Steele, the so-called, British spy. And that is a plea for Bruce Ohr and Chris Steele for Steele come back to work to the FBI right after James Comey is fired. Now ask yourself this question. Why was Christopher Steele fired by the FBI in the first place? And you know what the answer to that one is? He leaked to the media. So this is - look, the legitimacy of the inquiry from the outset has been - is incredible. But it's the consistency obtaining information out. So - again, while I'm glad that the Office - or the Special Counsel's Office today issued this very clear three-part statement - and that's how you have to analyze it, and some of these networks trying to parse it. It's almost funny watching it. But here's what, I think, is important. What's the consistent theme through this - illegal, inappropriate leaks. And who started leaking as well? James Comey, he said he gave his notes of a conversation he had with the President of the United States to a friend of his to leak to the press, so he would get the appointment of a Special Counsel, which lo and behold happens. So let me tell you something. That's what I want everybody focusing on tonight. This is consistent pattern of leaking, and that's going on at the highest - it's not the individual FBI agents - in mass they do a great job. But the Strzok and Page thing - someone explain this one to me. There are e-mails that are missing or text messages from the time that they were at this Special Counsel's Office and the resource officer at the Special Counsel's Office says, \"Well, we didn't really check the material\", and one phone was left and the other phone was recirculated and no one checked the text messaging? So, look - again, I am glad that Bob Mueller's Office issued this statement. It was called for, it was due, it was the appropriate thing to do. But there are a lot of questions that are still not answered by the activities that taking place here. Now, again, I'd say good day for the President - great day for the President, great day for the country, not such a great day for the media. And I caution friends of mine in the media today to watch this, be very careful here, be careful.",

This is happening almost every day or week now for two years. The first time, though, Mueller's Office has publicly pushed back on a phony fake news published article. But it's just the latest in a long series of botched fake stories published by the hate Trump media, it's hurting the country. Joining us with more, National Security Strategist Dr. Sebastian Gorka and on the phone, Former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova. Joe, I will start with you tonight. With your legal background, you have been very forceful in pointing out there is evidence and another narrative about the Deep State. You used the term corrupt cops, crooked cops. They've ignored all of that. They've run with every false story, your reaction to this, just the latest example. JOE DIGENOVA, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY (via telephone): Well, I was very proud that the President borrowed my phrase, \"Dirty Cop\", the other day, and he honored me. But what you saw happen today with Bob Mueller issuing his statement is very simple. It's called the Barr effect - the \"Bill Barr Effect\", because Bill Barr will be the Attorney General in a matter of days. Mueller was forced to issue this statement for this very simple reason. As soon as Bill Barr is sworn in, he will have a meeting with Mr. Mueller. He will get a full briefing on the status of all the investigation. And the first question Bill Barr was going to ask was that story true that BuzzFeed published? And Mr. Mueller would say, \"No it wasn't Mr. Attorney General\", and Bill Barr would have said, \"Why didn't you refute it?\" And Mueller would have said, \"Well Mr. Attorney General, we don't do that.\" And Mr. Barr would have said, \"Well, Mr. Mueller, you're fired\".",

DIGENOVA (via telephone): Because I've known Bill Barr for 30 years. He actually asked that I be appointed the Independent Counsel in the Clinton passport search during the Daddy Bush administration. And I was appointed an Independent Counsel. Bill Barr is a man of great legal and ethical stature. I could assure you that the scenario that I just painted for you is exactly what would have happened and it is exactly why Mueller issued his statement tonight. He knows that Bill Barr would be furious if he knew that Mueller knew a false story was out there and it was left unrefuted.

The story is, how the media lapped it up and used it for a day to call for the impeachment of the President, that's the story.

And earlier today, \"BuzzFeed\" news reported a salacious story about Michael Cohen and President Trump, alleging that Cohen briefed Trump about a building project in Moscow numerous times and that the president directed Michael Cohen to lie about the existence of that project when it already had been well-known.

They wrote, quote: \"BuzzFeed's\" description of specific statements to the special counsel's office and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen's congressional testimony are not accurate.

They have been burn sod many times before in the last two years. Remember, the short life hysteria about NPR's fake Don Jr. story? Remember the hype surrounding Michael Cohen secret prom trip? It never happened. \"The Guardian's\" false reporting about Paul Manafort or when three CNN fake news staffers -- they were forced to resign after reporting fake news about our friend Anthony Scaramucci. Look at the list we have compiled, fake story after fake story. Now, \"The Washington Examiner\" put this together, 47 printed pages for one year alone against Donald Trump of fake news that they breathlessly report. Unbridled. Remember what I said at the beginning of the year hatred of the president, so many forced corrections. But then they just keep doing it again and again. How many anonymous sources hearsay, rumors? Do you think any of this is good for the country? Are they looking out for your security, the economy, the better job for your children, a better future for our grand kids? You know what? Right now one more notch in the old fake news belt. It is beyond disgusting. But you just saw it all, all day, people screaming impeach, impeach, impeach. This is all the hate that we get as I have been saying every second, every minute, every hour of every day from the Democrats, the hate Trump press and, of course, the deep state. Now, all of a sudden, today, the hate Trump media was concerned about obstruction of justice. That's what they wanted you to believe today. But they are the same people who gave Hillary Clinton a pass. It's been almost two straight years of never ending, conspiracy theories. Fake news hatred. Not just for the president though, but also for the people that voted for this president. I have said it since 2007 and 2008. Journalism in America is dead, and it is buried, and driven by an unprecedented pathological hatred for the president. The bias in this country has become more important than what is fact and what is reporting, rumor is more important than sources, as reckless speculation rules the day. We told you at the beginning of the year on this program. We will always fight back. We want the country to be safer, more secure. We want every American family prosperous and we are going to look out for you, the American people, because you deserve better than what the rest of the media is offering, which is why we actually cover, for example, the crisis at our southern border. Now, when the fake news industry is too busy with their fake stories and conspiracy theories about the president, well, today, nearly 400 migrants were apprehended by border patrol at once after all crossing illegally. The situation is urgent. It is serious. Yet, someone still needs to remind the speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi, that we're in the middle of a government shutdown. Her detachment and heir indifference, her lack of self-awareness is beyond shocking. Today, Speaker Pelosi and other top Democrats once again tried to skip out of town, a week long international excursion which would have guaranteed the furloughed employees some 800,000 of them don't get paid again. Now, this time they were going to take a commercial plane just for show after the president foiled her first attempt to leave the country on your dime in a U.S. military aircraft. But now, after her new plan released sparking security concerns, Pelosi's overseas voyage has once again been postponed indefinitely. Now, maybe she will accept what is the president's daily invitation to negotiate -- safety, security, and our country, and the government shutdown. Spokesperson for the speaker actually blamed the president, of course, for the leak. An allegation the White House has called a flat out lie. So, here we are today, 28 days into a government shutdown and the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the most powerful Democrat in the country, is trying desperately, once again, to leave town, refusing to negotiate yet again. Remember, she took her lengthy tropical vacation at the beginning of the shutdown. Dozens of other Democrats, oh, they had a luxurious vacation paid for by lobbyists in a chartered aircraft to Puerto Rico. While Pelosi and Schumer sent aides to negotiate with the vice president of the United States? Instead of helping the furloughed employees and creating more security that they did support four years ago? So, tonight we have got to ask some really important obvious questions. Does Speaker Pelosi really want an answer solution? Is she really working at all? Is she now compromised by the radical left wing of her party and scared to death to even talk to the president? Does she care about the 90 percent of heroin in this country coming across our southern border, or the gangs or the cartels or the human trafficking? She won't even talk to the angel moms and dads that went outside her office this week that have lost their children because of illegal immigration? Now, the president, he didn't go on vacation. He has been here the whole time inviting Democrats every day. He is trying to fulfill not only a campaign promise but he is trying to keep the country safe, trying to prevent the drugs from coming into the country. Remember, maybe the 1 percent or 2 percent of those people that enter the country illegally, they are criminals and murders have happened and worse. And, you know, how many sexual assaults? How many violent assaults?"

Oh, he is working on Saturday. In the meantime, President Trump is ready, will, able to negotiate and has been since day one of the shutdown. Democrats have offered nothing except a dollar. No negotiations, no compromise. No time with the president. They just sit back and do nothing. Hundreds of thousands of government employees are not receiving their pay. The speaker is having a meltdown about not getting to take a government funded trip on your dime. And even worse, thousands of lives have been lost, thousands more devastated by the flow of illegal drugs, human trafficking, the opioid crisis. The gang activity across the southern border and Nancy Pelosi complaining about having to postpone a government- funded trip. That's where her mind is tonight. But fear not, let not your heart be troubled. Speaker Pelosi, while Americans suffer, while we're not safer -- well, your close friends in the mainstream media, they are cheering you every step of the way. You know, just like last week, manufactured crisis. Democrats say it. The media says it. They are like tied at the hip. Take a look."

Maybe you will get some of the things you say you want -- secure the borders, reopen the government. And for goodness' sake, get out of your ivory tower. If not, the president, he will do it without you. Now, let's not lose sight of the fact that what we're fighting for, don't be fooled by all the Trump haters, the crisis at the southern border is not manufactured. In fact, as can you see, a brand new migrant caravan marching toward our southern border as we speak. Earlier today, thousands of migrants poured into southern Mexico after authorities there, they just left the gates at the border wide open. Mexican border guards didn't show up until sunrise -- or actually after sunrise. So, now, while Mexico may be embracing open borders, the president, he is continuing to stand strong, stay on the job, waiting to negotiate, waiting to keep his promise to secure the border of this country. This is about life and death."

Just look at this video from border patrol and the Huma sector in Arizona where nearly 400 migrants apprehended at once today after crossing illegally. That is not manufactured. That is the reality. We need these physical barriers, which are effective, all across the world. Remember yesterday, also in Arizona, a group of migrants were caught trying to tunnel under a wall. But, because there was a wall, they couldn't just walk across and flee law enforcement. And once they tunneled through, they were promptly caught. Oh, the wall works. Now, don't expect to hear any of this from the hate Trump media as you can see from tonight's \"BuzzFeed\" huge massive embarrassment the fake news epidemic has never been worse. By the way, it all surrounds one thing -- their hatred of all things Donald Trump. And by the way, Trump supporters. And that's why they are all completely ignored what was major news that we had this week about the deep state, about FISA abuse. And, meanwhile, we have been one of the only programs reporting these latest developments, latest, needless to say, it was a bad week for some of those embedded inside of our government that don't like the president. We learned under James Comey's watch, his general counsel, we learned this week, James Baker, is now under a criminal investigation. And according to John Solomon's reporting and don't forget Andrew McCabe, his deputy, is also under a criminal investigation. And John Solomon pointing out that James Comey and others were all briefed about the phony dossier back in August. They were told by Bruce Ohr, according to his sworn testimony that we only got this week then he told all of them in the FBI, all of them in the State Department, oh, Hillary paid for it. And Christopher Steele hates the president. Oh, and, by the way, they put this thing together and I wouldn't trust it. But in spite of that warning, he went ahead anyway. And as the Grassley- Graham memo pointed out, the bulk of information was used in the FISA warrant. That would be a conspiracy to commit a fraud against the court. We also know that Andrew Weissmann and another Mueller investigator, they were also briefed on these warnings think knew it was biased and unverified. Hillary paid for lies to influence the 2016 election. But still, Mueller used it as a basis of his investigation but never investigated Hillary who bought it. Now, we have been warning you for months, this is the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in modern American history. And, by the way, the news media can be biased in other ways. Like what they don't report. Joining us now, the author of \"The Case against the Democratic House Impeaching Donald Trump\", Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, FOX News contributor Sara Carter. Professor, you know, what I really like about you is even in your new book, even though you have been ostracized from the Martha's Vineyard crowd. I'm sorry about that. I know it's actually been hurtful to you. You just continue to point out criminalizing political differences, waiting for truth in fact. And you see this happen now. I got 47 printed pages for 2017 alone. Fake news stories that the media has peddle you had hysterically to the American public. To me, it's a danger to the country."

Look, on the \"BuzzFeed\" thing, before the announcement was made by the special counsel's office, I posted a piece on the \"New York Daily News\" raising all kinds of skepticism, asking hard questions about the \"BuzzFeed\" report. It did not seem credible to me, particularly the arguments that it's like Richard Nixon. It's not like Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon, on tape, told his subordinates directly to lie about criminal activities, breaks in, et cetera. And here, of course, there is no credible allegation that there are emails or there are eyewitnesses. And I pointed that out in my article and now my view has been confirmed. Look, I have to tell you my views on this investigation have been confirmed over and over and over again. I have been right and many of the get Trump any cost people have been wrong over time. So, I think it's about time that we start substituting -- stop substituting wishful thinking. You know, it's wishful thinking to get Trump at any cost people wish to find evidence to impeach him. And they substitute wishful thinking for careful factual analysis and careful factual analysis, and victims of the American public. We have a right to be informed of the facts.

So, from the get-go, we know there was problem with this story. I agree with Alan Dershowitz, the same thing when I read this story. They never actually attributed anything to the documents. It seemed like their sourcing was very flimsy. Everything about that story seemed false. But this disinformation does an extraordinary damage to our national security and to the administration. Think about what's been going on. I mean, the trip, Michael Cohen supposedly took to Prague that we found out was a lie. Stories over and over again filled with disinformation.

And then to submit for request for a warrant to the FISA court without disclosing that information, it's so unethical and so improper. You know, it's an ex parte proceeding. That means you have a special obligation to be truthful. Look, only 1/3 of 1 percent of FISA applications are turned down. And that's why it's so important for the prosecution to be credible with the FISA court. And this information about Ohr is devastating because it demonstrates that they did it deliberately.

Sara Carter thank you. Joining us now, a host now of \"Life Liberty & Levin\", every Sunday night, the number one show right here on Fox News, I call him the \"Great One, Mark Levin\". Mark, I will let you go, but the one thing I will stay to start is how fascinating today, Democrats and the media actually cared about, quote, obstruction of justice when they have ignored, let's see, the deleting subpoena emails, acid washing hard drives and busting up devices and removing SIM cards. That never expressed them. But only if it's Trump do they get worked up about something. MARK LEVIN, LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN HOST (via telephone): Never will impress them. I want to make a point here, Sean, about Mueller's office. They sat there all day long while this false reporting was going on, while the president was being smeared, while the reporters so-called and their friendly Democrats with Capitol Hill saying this is an impeachable offense. They won't be held to account. They won't apologize. They will continue on tomorrow until the next great fake story. I want to say this about Mr. Mueller's office. They didn't do anybody any favor. I will tell you why they issued their statement around 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time tonight, because I was on the radio, among other things, demanding that the attorney general of the United States, Mr. Whitaker, the deputy attorney general of the United States, Mr. Rosenstein, immediately launch a leak investigation because if these reporters, these two clowns were right -- of course they weren't, but if they were, the only place these documents, texts and emails could have come from is Mr. Mueller's office. And they issued their statement 7:30, give or take tonight, tonight Eastern Time not because the story was accurate. It was inaccurate. But because if you conduct a leak investigation the sit down Mr. Weissmann and you make him undertake a lie detector test and ask him if he has ever talked to the press about anything, about any subject or any of those individuals in that office, including Mr. Mueller, I suspect a number of people would be mad. And so, the fact is, Mr. Mueller's office did not want a leak investigation. There was every basis to have a leak investigation if, in fact, the Justice Department believed this story was accurate. So they didn't release this rare statement just because they are good people. They released it to cover their asses because they don't want a leak investigation again. Not related to this case in if I can which is absurd but think don't want to be asked about it."

They all know this information is -- they all know that a contempt was committed against the court, which means the justice system. There is simply no question about this now. And so, it's a serious question about the functioning of the federal judiciary in this respect and this FISA court judges. But I want to get back to it today. The media have disgraced themselves. They tomorrow will say we said if the story is true, you don't go with the story if you don't know if it's true. You don't go with a story if you don't know if you can verify it. And this has been going on since before President Trump was President and it's unique to him and it's a disgrace. They were talking about impeaching him, indicting his kids. I think the American people believe in fairness and justice. They believe in a free press, but the free press apparently doesn't believe in a free press. And over at CNN and MSNBC and these other outlets, they really need to clean house.

But that's like saying, if someone robbed a bank, it would be a crime. If someone did rob a bank it would be a crime. But, I think, it's important here for a moment to reflect on that this was actually a good day for justice and a very, very good day for the President of United States. But it's also important to say and to focus for a moment here on what the Special Counsel's Office actually said. And Sean - because my job as the President's lawyer, as a part of the legal team is to analyze these things and to respond to what was going on - this frenzy that was going on in the last 24 hours. And so let me start with what the - what he actually said. This is from Bob Mueller's office. By the way, it's the first time they have spoken publicly about a false news story. This is what they said, \"BuzzFeed's description of specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office\", that's one. And, \"Characterization of documents\", that's two. And \"Testimony obtained by this office regarding Michael Cohen's Congressional testimony are not accurate\", so it's three things. It's the description of the specific statements to the Special Counsel's Office, the characterization of the documents that were the basis upon which the media speculation started and the testimony obtained by the office regarding Michael Cohen's cooperation with the Special Counsel's Office, all of that as reported in the report today are not correct. And this isn't coming from me, it's not coming from the American Center for Law & Justice, it's not coming from my law firm, who is it coming from? It's coming from the Special Counsel's Office - Bob Mueller's office. So I think, Rudy Giuliani is right in saying that this was the right thing to do and I'm glad they did it. Now where does that leave us? So Sean, here's what I think this is. This is a warning sign to everybody that the speculation with no factual backup is dangerous for our republic. And look, I've been dealing with this, as you know, for more than 24 hour - about 24 hours. Actually it started last night about 10 o'clock, so about an hour from now. And the end result of this was the right thing. But it took us 24 hours to get the right thing. But I think it's important for everyone that's watching to realize that the speculation and the media anxiousness to report out of the gate has got to stop. But there's also another message in all, and you said this in your monologue. Look what is transpired - people say is there any action being taken on the people that are doing wrong deeds, illegal conduct? Well let's look at it. James Baker the General Counsel of the FBI is under investigation for what? Leaking to the media. Andrew McCabe--"

      "utterance": "False reporting, which we have documented, and I believe the President has forever branded, rightly so, fake news as such. And for them to ever get their credibility back, I don't think it's even possible. Look at this, we've learned about the General Counsel Baker. We know about Andrew McCabe. We know about Strzok and Page. They were even appointed to Mueller's team along with Genie Ray (ph) who used to be Clinton's attorney and the Pit Bull, Andrew Weissmann. But here's my question, Bruce Ohr, we learned, under oath, in testimony released this week, that in fact he warned everybody about the phony dossier. He warned that Clinton paid for it."

      "utterance": "He warned the Christopher Steele had a hatred of the President. And he warned that it wasn't verified or corroborating. But it still became the bulk of information - for FISA warrant."

      "speaker": "SEKULOW",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, Sean I've always - I've - yes, I've asked the question of what happens to the evidence that was gathered during the course of the proceedings, the investigation that were outside legal parameters, not appropriate, not legal, because call it a fruit of the poisonous tree. But let me tell you something else about the Bruce Ohr testimony. Bruce Ohr did say that he told the higher-ups at the FBI - my gosh, he was the #4, that that in fact that the dossier was biased. That it was paid for by political operatives. But his wife worked for the political operative company that put the dossier together. And there's - also simultaneous with his mea culpa from Bruce Ohr is what - a text messages that have been released between Bruce Ohr and who - Christopher Steele, the so-called, British spy. And that is a plea for Bruce Ohr and Chris Steele for Steele come back to work to the FBI right after James Comey is fired. Now ask yourself this question. Why was Christopher Steele fired by the FBI in the first place? And you know what the answer to that one is? He leaked to the media. So this is - look, the legitimacy of the inquiry from the outset has been - is incredible. But it's the consistency obtaining information out. So - again, while I'm glad that the Office - or the Special Counsel's Office today issued this very clear three-part statement - and that's how you have to analyze it, and some of these networks trying to parse it. It's almost funny watching it. But here's what, I think, is important. What's the consistent theme through this - illegal, inappropriate leaks. And who started leaking as well? James Comey, he said he gave his notes of a conversation he had with the President of the United States to a friend of his to leak to the press, so he would get the appointment of a Special Counsel, which lo and behold happens. So let me tell you something. That's what I want everybody focusing on tonight. This is consistent pattern of leaking, and that's going on at the highest - it's not the individual FBI agents - in mass they do a great job. But the Strzok and Page thing - someone explain this one to me. There are e-mails that are missing or text messages from the time that they were at this Special Counsel's Office and the resource officer at the Special Counsel's Office says, \"Well, we didn't really check the material\", and one phone was left and the other phone was recirculated and no one checked the text messaging? So, look - again, I am glad that Bob Mueller's Office issued this statement. It was called for, it was due, it was the appropriate thing to do. But there are a lot of questions that are still not answered by the activities that taking place here. Now, again, I'd say good day for the President - great day for the President, great day for the country, not such a great day for the media. And I caution friends of mine in the media today to watch this, be very careful here, be careful."

It has been breaking news all day, all over the media. They ran with it, if true, if true, this is going to happen impeachment, impeachment. This is happening almost every day or week now for two years. The first time, though, Mueller's Office has publicly pushed back on a phony fake news published article. But it's just the latest in a long series of botched fake stories published by the hate Trump media, it's hurting the country. Joining us with more, National Security Strategist Dr. Sebastian Gorka and on the phone, Former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova. Joe, I will start with you tonight. With your legal background, you have been very forceful in pointing out there is evidence and another narrative about the Deep State. You used the term corrupt cops, crooked cops. They've ignored all of that. They've run with every false story, your reaction to this, just the latest example."

      "utterance": "Well, I was very proud that the President borrowed my phrase, \"Dirty Cop\", the other day, and he honored me. But what you saw happen today with Bob Mueller issuing his statement is very simple. It's called the Barr effect - the \"Bill Barr Effect\", because Bill Barr will be the Attorney General in a matter of days. Mueller was forced to issue this statement for this very simple reason. As soon as Bill Barr is sworn in, he will have a meeting with Mr. Mueller. He will get a full briefing on the status of all the investigation. And the first question Bill Barr was going to ask was that story true that BuzzFeed published? And Mr. Mueller would say, \"No it wasn't Mr. Attorney General\", and Bill Barr would have said, \"Why didn't you refute it?\" And Mueller would have said, \"Well Mr. Attorney General, we don't do that.\" And Mr. Barr would have said, \"Well, Mr. Mueller, you're fired\"."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DIGENOVA (via telephone)",
      "utterance": "Because I've known Bill Barr for 30 years. He actually asked that I be appointed the Independent Counsel in the Clinton passport search during the Daddy Bush administration. And I was appointed an Independent Counsel. Bill Barr is a man of great legal and ethical stature. I could assure you that the scenario that I just painted for you is exactly what would have happened and it is exactly why Mueller issued his statement tonight. He knows that Bill Barr would be furious if he knew that Mueller knew a false story was out there and it was left unrefuted. You are now seeing what it means when a real Attorney General shows up in town. This is the new Sheriff."

And I just spoke to somebody who worked with him at the DOJ. He is exactly the right man for the job. But with regards to this story today, Sean, it's incredibly important that we look at what the media did with it. That's the story - not that BuzzFeed ran this garbage story, because we know BuzzFeed is the gutter press. The story is, how the media lapped it up and used it for a day to call for the impeachment of the President, that's the story. Like Pavlovian dogs, they were given the bell and they reacted with their calls for impeachment. The end of the story is the following. Today at 7:30 the President of the United States was utterly vindicated. This is fake news. This is the state of the media. They are not independent. We don't have a free media, Sean. We have private-sector propaganda and today the President was vindicated."
