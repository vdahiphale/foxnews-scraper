      "speaker": "JEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to JUSTICE. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. Two days to go and President Trump is about to hold this fourth rally of the day in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. You'll see it here live.  But first, let's get right to my open.  Have you had enough? Have you had enough? Do you want to be free? Live free?  Now I've been telling you we are in the fight of our lives. We may not be in uniform, carrying muskets, but we are on a battlefield where the fight between good and evil and truth and lies unfolds. We shouldn't have to spend every day fighting for what has already been fought for over 200 years ago. But then again, Ronald Reagan reminded us that freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. Face it at every turn, the leftist progressives with Joe and Kamala at the helm are fighting freedom loving and liberty loving Americans. They want to control every aspect of our lives, irrespective of the Constitution, right down to what we can say, how we can say it, whether we can say it at all, whether we can go to church or synagogue, or whether we can have a gun.  So the choice in 72 hours is yours. Now they laughed at the prospect of Donald Trump becoming President. They spied on him. They framed him. They impeached him for a legitimate phone call, when in truth, Joe Biden should be prosecuted for his role in Ukraine.  Since when does the Vice President withhold a billion American dollars unless the prosecutor investigating his son's company is fired? That's corruption, folks. And this guy says he is running on character. What character?   How does a man who signs only the back of a government check for 47 years, whose wife is a teacher able to afford multiple lavish homes around the country? The question for Joe Biden who is running on character is why Tony Bobulinski says he met Joe in a dark bar to discuss his son, hunter's business. Why did Hunter negotiate a $10 million annual fee for introductions with the Chinese with a 10 percent saved for the big guy? Why would the Chinese give Hunter Biden, a troubled individual, a $5 million unsecured interest free loan and $100,000.00 spending spree? What was China buying?   Why would the wife of the mayor of Moscow give Hunter three and a half million dollars? What was Russia buying? The answer folks is access and blackmail on a potential future President whose son is a playbook example of a compromised individual to say the least. If the leftist socialist had their way with Joe Biden at the helm, and Kamala Harris breathlessly waiting to take over, we would still be locked down in our basements waiting for a government subsidy to buy groceries and waiting for a greenlight to go outside. Can someone please tell me why the left is so determined to control us? But Mr. Cool and his sunglasses goes even further by limiting his rallies to cars in a parking lot. As he screams at the cars, they scream back by blowing their horns, and Biden actually had his own deplorable moment, calling Trump supporters chumps and ugly.  Really, Joe?   And as Joe Biden proposes the biggest tax increase, $6,500.00 estimated for Middle Americans, increased regulations essentially shutting down the economy and factories, bringing in socialized medicine, defunding police, globalist trade deals, the elimination of oil and fracking. President Donald Trump has raised middle class income by more than $6,000.00 in three years, and that doesn't even include the energy savings. But most important, President Trump has kept his promises to the American people, unlike the two-faced parasites in Washington, who were in it for themselves. Donald Trump truly wanted to make America great again, and he did.  In the beginning, he took on the media, and they said it was suicide. But he was right, and we saw it for ourselves. And he was right about Big Tech as we watched it control what we communicate to each other. That my friends is socialism and fascism. In 2016, Donald Trump talked about law and order. Little did we know how much the left despises law and order.  Now, Joe Biden said nothing for a hundred days as businesses and cities were burning and police and others killed. But Joe Biden, you know, he wants to build back better. What is he going to build back better? If he had 47 years and never built anything other than jails, to incarcerate a whole generation of young blacks, he called predators.  Joe Biden is a part of the gang that will not -- will not -- defend your religious freedom. He is not going to fight for your rights to go to church or House of Worship or synagogue. And on the other hand, there is a Christian, Donald Trump took on those who made believers feel uncomfortable. He was the first President to actually move the embassy to Jerusalem, the first President to nominate a Supreme Court Justice who actually admitted during confirmation that she was pro-life. All the talk of the Presidents in the last 47 years since Roe versus Wade was decided, this President is the only one who actually walked for Christians and evangelicals, which is why that community overwhelmingly by more than 80 percent supports President Donald Trump.  This President is a man of his word. He has kept his promise to America, bringing us the greatest economy in the history of our nation. He has brought us freedom, prosperity, judicial restraint, security and law and order. He believes in God and he believes in country. He believes in law and he believes in order.   He believes in you and he believes in me. This election is a choice. You can spend the next four years in the dark, depressed with police defunded with Beto O'Rourke coming for your guns and Elizabeth Warren in charge of the Treasury, with Kamala Harris, the most left candidate in the Senate who is pro-criminal and anti-police paying more taxes, making less money. And that's assuming you even have a job or they even let you go to the job. Or you can vote for the man who has delivered on Criminal Justice Reform, on opportunity zones, on police reform, on school choice, on building the wall, on destroying the ISIS Caliphate, on bringing us the greatest economy America has ever seen, on bringing our troops home, on insisting on religious freedom, again; speech that is free again and protecting our Second Amendment rights to bear arms.  He is a true American who believes in God and country.  Our last quarter's economic growth was the best ever recorded by more than double in history, a GDP of 33.1 percent, he said it would happen and it did. Donald Trump put together his own rainbow coalition of African-Americans and Hispanics and Asians, people of all colors with more jobs than the people that fill them. He has reawakened our American spirit, he has reignited the flame of liberty. He is a man whose philosophy is based not on politics, but on reason. He has prioritized law and order and the safety of American citizens, the first President to actually do something about the southern border, the first President who understands that we are born with certain natural rights that come not from the government, but from God, and that government wields power only with the consent of the governed and that's us.   So the choice is yours. A dark dreary future with shutdowns, factories closing, jobs eliminated, economic depression, your free speech eliminated, your guns confiscated and Big Brother interfering with your religious freedom and your life. But if you choose the man was what stood what no other President has, who believes in truth, justice and the American way, and if you want freedom, prosperity, peace, security, safety, a soaring economy, a strong military, the freedom to say what you want and do what you want and the ability to defend yourself and your family, there is only one man, only one man who can deliver on that promise and that's President Donald Trump.  You have 72 hours.  And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine. And if you like my opens, you'll love my new book, \"New York Times\" bestseller, \"Don't Lie to Me\" available everywhere.   Newt Gingrich is standing by. But first, let's listen in for a few minutes to President Trump holding his fourth rally today, this one in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. Take a listen.",

Biden is a Washington vulture who decimated your steel mills and annihilated your coal jobs and supported every disastrous sellout trade deal for over a half a century. You know what's happened? You know what I had to do where they would dump steel all over the place. They are dumping steel. I put big tariffs on and all of a sudden, the steel mills started doing good.

I think in the last five or six days, between the Biden family corruption and the realization that cognitively, Biden is incapable of being President, and the realization that Kamala Harris is a radical San Francisco Democrat, who stands for almost nothing that normal Americans stand for, all of that has come together. And then the President, frankly, has been amazing. Biden hides in the basement, the President does four or five events a day. The country kind of gets it.

If you care about the American way of life, you must turn out because Joe Biden wants to turn to a dark winter and have a socialist America. That's not who Donald Trump is and his voters know it and they have to turn out at all cost.",

Thunderous applause on issues like peace in the Middle East, thunderous applause about the economy. The President tonight described the fact that Special Forces were able to actually capture an American hostage, an American citizen who had been held hostage and the crowd again, cheering \"U.S.A. U.S.A.\" The President also talked about the fact that he took out Soleimani and Baghdadi and what he did for veterans across this country when it took so long for all of the other administrations to deliver on issues for veterans. And finally, tonight, the future of the country is in your hands. Every single vote counts. So please make sure you cast your vote.

      "utterance": "Hello and welcome to JUSTICE. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. Two days to go and President Trump is about to hold this fourth rally of the day in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. You'll see it here live. But first, let's get right to my open. Have you had enough? Have you had enough? Do you want to be free? Live free? Now I've been telling you we are in the fight of our lives. We may not be in uniform, carrying muskets, but we are on a battlefield where the fight between good and evil and truth and lies unfolds. We shouldn't have to spend every day fighting for what has already been fought for over 200 years ago. But then again, Ronald Reagan reminded us that freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. Face it at every turn, the leftist progressives with Joe and Kamala at the helm are fighting freedom loving and liberty loving Americans. They want to control every aspect of our lives, irrespective of the Constitution, right down to what we can say, how we can say it, whether we can say it at all, whether we can go to church or synagogue, or whether we can have a gun. So the choice in 72 hours is yours. Now they laughed at the prospect of Donald Trump becoming President. They spied on him. They framed him. They impeached him for a legitimate phone call, when in truth, Joe Biden should be prosecuted for his role in Ukraine. Since when does the Vice President withhold a billion American dollars unless the prosecutor investigating his son's company is fired? That's corruption, folks. And this guy says he is running on character. What character? How does a man who signs only the back of a government check for 47 years, whose wife is a teacher able to afford multiple lavish homes around the country? The question for Joe Biden who is running on character is why Tony Bobulinski says he met Joe in a dark bar to discuss his son, hunter's business. Why did Hunter negotiate a $10 million annual fee for introductions with the Chinese with a 10 percent saved for the big guy? Why would the Chinese give Hunter Biden, a troubled individual, a $5 million unsecured interest free loan and $100,000.00 spending spree? What was China buying? Why would the wife of the mayor of Moscow give Hunter three and a half million dollars? What was Russia buying? The answer folks is access and blackmail on a potential future President whose son is a playbook example of a compromised individual to say the least. If the leftist socialist had their way with Joe Biden at the helm, and Kamala Harris breathlessly waiting to take over, we would still be locked down in our basements waiting for a government subsidy to buy groceries and waiting for a greenlight to go outside. Can someone please tell me why the left is so determined to control us? But Mr. Cool and his sunglasses goes even further by limiting his rallies to cars in a parking lot. As he screams at the cars, they scream back by blowing their horns, and Biden actually had his own deplorable moment, calling Trump supporters chumps and ugly. Really, Joe? And as Joe Biden proposes the biggest tax increase, $6,500.00 estimated for Middle Americans, increased regulations essentially shutting down the economy and factories, bringing in socialized medicine, defunding police, globalist trade deals, the elimination of oil and fracking. President Donald Trump has raised middle class income by more than $6,000.00 in three years, and that doesn't even include the energy savings. But most important, President Trump has kept his promises to the American people, unlike the two-faced parasites in Washington, who were in it for themselves. Donald Trump truly wanted to make America great again, and he did. In the beginning, he took on the media, and they said it was suicide. But he was right, and we saw it for ourselves. And he was right about Big Tech as we watched it control what we communicate to each other. That my friends is socialism and fascism. In 2016, Donald Trump talked about law and order. Little did we know how much the left despises law and order. Now, Joe Biden said nothing for a hundred days as businesses and cities were burning and police and others killed. But Joe Biden, you know, he wants to build back better. What is he going to build back better? If he had 47 years and never built anything other than jails, to incarcerate a whole generation of young blacks, he called predators. Joe Biden is a part of the gang that will not -- will not -- defend your religious freedom. He is not going to fight for your rights to go to church or House of Worship or synagogue. And on the other hand, there is a Christian, Donald Trump took on those who made believers feel uncomfortable. He was the first President to actually move the embassy to Jerusalem, the first President to nominate a Supreme Court Justice who actually admitted during confirmation that she was pro-life. All the talk of the Presidents in the last 47 years since Roe versus Wade was decided, this President is the only one who actually walked for Christians and evangelicals, which is why that community overwhelmingly by more than 80 percent supports President Donald Trump. This President is a man of his word. He has kept his promise to America, bringing us the greatest economy in the history of our nation. He has brought us freedom, prosperity, judicial restraint, security and law and order. He believes in God and he believes in country. He believes in law and he believes in order. He believes in you and he believes in me. This election is a choice. You can spend the next four years in the dark, depressed with police defunded with Beto O'Rourke coming for your guns and Elizabeth Warren in charge of the Treasury, with Kamala Harris, the most left candidate in the Senate who is pro-criminal and anti-police paying more taxes, making less money. And that's assuming you even have a job or they even let you go to the job. Or you can vote for the man who has delivered on Criminal Justice Reform, on opportunity zones, on police reform, on school choice, on building the wall, on destroying the ISIS Caliphate, on bringing us the greatest economy America has ever seen, on bringing our troops home, on insisting on religious freedom, again; speech that is free again and protecting our Second Amendment rights to bear arms. He is a true American who believes in God and country. Our last quarter's economic growth was the best ever recorded by more than double in history, a GDP of 33.1 percent, he said it would happen and it did. Donald Trump put together his own rainbow coalition of African-Americans and Hispanics and Asians, people of all colors with more jobs than the people that fill them. He has reawakened our American spirit, he has reignited the flame of liberty. He is a man whose philosophy is based not on politics, but on reason. He has prioritized law and order and the safety of American citizens, the first President to actually do something about the southern border, the first President who understands that we are born with certain natural rights that come not from the government, but from God, and that government wields power only with the consent of the governed and that's us. So the choice is yours. A dark dreary future with shutdowns, factories closing, jobs eliminated, economic depression, your free speech eliminated, your guns confiscated and Big Brother interfering with your religious freedom and your life. But if you choose the man was what stood what no other President has, who believes in truth, justice and the American way, and if you want freedom, prosperity, peace, security, safety, a soaring economy, a strong military, the freedom to say what you want and do what you want and the ability to defend yourself and your family, there is only one man, only one man who can deliver on that promise and that's President Donald Trump. You have 72 hours. And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine. And if you like my opens, you'll love my new book, \"New York Times\" bestseller, \"Don't Lie to Me\" available everywhere. Newt Gingrich is standing by. But first, let's listen in for a few minutes to President Trump holding his fourth rally today, this one in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. Take a listen."

It's not a trend. It's whatever they want to do. You look at Big Tech, you look at what's been happening lately, right? You look at the media where they refuse to cover one of the biggest scandals. No, but the biggest scandal is we caught them spying on our campaign. Right? We caught them trying to overthrow a duly elected -- commonly known as me -- President of the United States.

If Biden gets in, the economy will collapse. Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that many of you have never even heard of. I didn't hear too many of them either if you want to know the truth. Biden is a Washington vulture who decimated your steel mills and annihilated your coal jobs and supported every disastrous sellout trade deal for over a half a century. You know what's happened? You know what I had to do where they would dump steel all over the place. They are dumping steel. I put big tariffs on and all of a sudden, the steel mills started doing good. It was a beautiful thing. And we took some of that money, $28 billion, we took and we gave it to our farmers because they were targeted by China. And our farmers liked them."

And that Des Moines poll which show Joni Ernst now up winning her Senate seat re-election, show the President carrying Iowa is typical of what's going on. I think in the last five or six days, between the Biden family corruption and the realization that cognitively, Biden is incapable of being President, and the realization that Kamala Harris is a radical San Francisco Democrat, who stands for almost nothing that normal Americans stand for, all of that has come together. And then the President, frankly, has been amazing. Biden hides in the basement, the President does four or five events a day. The country kind of gets it. You know, one guy has the energy to be President; the other guy has the energy to go home and they sort of know which one is which."

One of the most important issues in this election is law and order and you know about it well. You see what's going on in your large city. It's not good. And you have great police, but they are not allowed to do their job. This week violent mobs of Biden supporters ransacked Philadelphia.

During the debate, I said Joe, what law group -- what -- any police group, anybody looking for law and order -- did anybody endorse you? He couldn't answer the question, then he was bailed out by the anchor, right? He was bailed out. I said, Joe, say the words law and order. He wouldn't do it. He didn't want to lose the radical left. I'm not just running against Joe Biden. I'm running against the left-wing media, the Big Tech giants, the RINOs, you know what a RINO is, right? Republican In Name Only. We've got a couple of them.

I went to college. We love it. But strange things have been known to happen, especially in Philadelphia. So send them a message that they'll never forget.

This is a movement of love. And I'm watching all day what my father is doing. Did you see that rally in Butler, Pennsylvania? I mean, literally 30,000 people to 40,000 people, seas of people and gee, you know, Judge, this is a movement. This is a movement with people that love this country, love our flag, they love our Constitution. They love our Supreme Court. Love faith in America. You know, love our pledge of allegiance, will not stand for people burning the American flag or desecrating who we are as a country, will not apologize for this nation.

And the other guy is, you know, on a single bus just traveling along by himself. But you know, in 2020, right before the pandemic, Eric, there was a poll taken by Gallup that said that 90 percent of Americans were happier than they had ever been in not just in terms of their personal life, but in terms of their economic prospects and that was an incredible moment in history that your dad can be proud of and I think Americans are remembering that now.

Criminal Justice Reform, four peace deals in the Middle East in the last four weeks alone, moved the embassy to Jerusalem, made us energy independent, built almost 400 miles of southern wall. I mean, I could go on and on. Lowest illegal immigration, Judge, lowest amounts of human trafficking and drugs coming into this country, restored faith in this nation, protected our Second Amendment, put three Supreme Court Justices on the bench and Judge, I could go on for another 10 minutes. I mean, there's never been a President in U.S. history that has done more than what my father has done for this country. And then you look at Biden, who calls a lid on it at, you know, 8:30 in the morning on a Monday and doesn't emerge from his cave until, you know, Thursday afternoon. You know, you've got a guy that wants to increase taxes by $4 trillion. You've got a guy that wants a socialized healthcare.

Biden having an event, you'll have five circles, and you can only find four people. He can't even fill up all the little circles. But when the President has an event, or anyone who is a surrogate for the President's campaign has an event, you see huge crowds, because they know what Eric just said. They know this President has done more of what he said he would do than any President in our lifetime. He said he would cut taxes. He said he would reduce regulations. He said we would have the best economy in history, we do. And the economy is roaring back as we saw by the numbers. He said he would get out of the Iran Deal and he did. He said, he would put the embassy in Jerusalem, he did. He said he'd build the wall, he did. And most importantly, he said he'd put out a list of qualified people he put on the highest court in our nation. And then he selected from that list, Mr. Gorsuch, Mr. Kavanaugh, and just this week, Amy Coney Barrett went on the court, and Joe Biden won't tell us what he'll do. He won't even tell us if he is going to pack the court, which we sort of know he is going to if they win. All of those reasons are why people are going to come out in a big way.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome back to JUSTICE. President Trump's rally has just wrapped in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. The President has left the stage. He is getting into his car and what a night it has been. We saw so much energy in President Trump tonight and that energy went back and forth between the President and his audience. Thunderous applause on issues like peace in the Middle East, thunderous applause about the economy. The President tonight described the fact that Special Forces were able to actually capture an American hostage, an American citizen who had been held hostage and the crowd again, cheering \"U.S.A. U.S.A.\" The President also talked about the fact that he took out Soleimani and Baghdadi and what he did for veterans across this country when it took so long for all of the other administrations to deliver on issues for veterans. And finally, tonight, the future of the country is in your hands. Every single vote counts. So please make sure you cast your vote. And if you haven't already ordered my \"New York Times\" bestseller, \"Don't Lie to Me\" on Amazon, or at the Judge Jeanine store, pick it up. It'll make you laugh because they've been lying to you. Thanks so much for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way and the President of the United States. \"THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" is next. Go to Cameo and I'll see you next week. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
