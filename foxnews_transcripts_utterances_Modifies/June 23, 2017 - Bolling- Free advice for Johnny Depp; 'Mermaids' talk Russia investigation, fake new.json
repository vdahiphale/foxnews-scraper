It's getting serious and lately much of it has been directed against President Trump and the GOP. Earlier this month, newly elected congresswoman Karen Handel receiving letters containing a suspicious white powder, now thankfully, after a thorough FBI investigation, it was announce today that the powder was none hazardous. That threat may have been neutralize, but the feel is real and worrisome. In fact, the Washington Free Beacon reports today that nearly 30 GOP congressman have been attacked or threatened since May alone, and now that is downright disturbing. The left wing media is no better, possibly helping to fuel the threats with comments like this.",

Decapitation, brutal multiple stabbings, and now a call for a presidential assassination, the liberal wasteland that is Hollywood, have once again top itself in discussing an incendiary remarks about President Trump. We've highlighted the career-ending decision to air a photo-shoot, depicting a bloody decapitated head of the president. When 11-year-old, Baron Trump saw it, he ran to his mom asking, mom, is daddy dead? No, Baron, your dad is not dead, but Kathy Griffin's career likely is. And then, the fools in Shakespeare at the park with their assassination of the president by a hundred cuts with a hundred blades as they called it. The actors went overboard with a bloodbath that became too violent and too political. The play lost major sponsors. Delta airlines and Bank of America both pulled out.

That threat may have been neutralize, but the feel is real and worrisome. In fact, the Washington Free Beacon reports today that nearly 30 GOP congressman have been attacked or threatened since May alone, and now that is downright disturbing. The left wing media is no better, possibly helping to fuel the threats with comments like this."

It's time to wake up, America. Decapitation, brutal multiple stabbings, and now a call for a presidential assassination, the liberal wasteland that is Hollywood, have once again top itself in discussing an incendiary remarks about President Trump. We've highlighted the career-ending decision to air a photo-shoot, depicting a bloody decapitated head of the president. When 11-year-old, Baron Trump saw it, he ran to his mom asking, mom, is daddy dead? No, Baron, your dad is not dead, but Kathy Griffin's career likely is. And then, the fools in Shakespeare at the park with their assassination of the president by a hundred cuts with a hundred blades as they called it. The actors went overboard with a bloodbath that became too violent and too political. The play lost major sponsors. Delta airlines and Bank of America both pulled out.

But here's some free advised, Johnny Depp. Johnny, rather than pretending to know a damn ounce about politics, stick to the movie scripts, or maybe take on a role of a guy who came from Northing, made half a billion dollars playing a make-believe pirate on the big screen, and then he blows all his money, gets arrested for thrashing hotel rooms, abuses drugs and alcohol to the point of being accused of abusing his beautiful young wife, played by Amber Heard.

So I think for those that really -- and I thought you said that beautifully, Danielle, earlier. And those that really feel this way, whether you like Trump or don't, or Obama, it's not about that. It's about elevating as human being in this society. We're not going to go here anymore, and that's how they consistently show their distaste for this."

What are you doing? Get over it. But, again, I don't think it's fair to call to assassinate the president. I don't think anybody was going to watch that and thought he's being serious.

You can't incite someone to actual violence, right? I don't think we're there, but I think that the way that these conversations are heating up, we're going to get there.

I mean, you know, Rand Paul as more of a libertarian conservative, and Ted Cruz to the right of everybody. You know they're looking for perfection. And they're missing two key elements of this bill that it's surprising that they forget that they're in Washington. And part of it is a little bit of compromise. You've got a $590 billion tax cut over ten years in this bill, and all the while they keep Obamacare in place, premium continue to go up.

Under policy, I'm going to disagree 100 percent, Bill, I think this is terrible policy. I'm going to agree with Kat, and that it doesn't address the most important part of the healthcare problem and it's the cost of healthcare. Not health insurance, but the cost of healthcare. You have to drive the underlying commodity costs down. You have to, in order for to it work. And Kat's right, all this bill does is take taxpayer dollars, throw it at people and say, look, it's going to cost you a little bit less. It's not. It's costing taxpayers a lot more. The politics of it, very quickly. The politics of it, it lets the Democrats off the hook, Eboni. The Democrats were on the hook for an awful healthcare bill. Everyone hated Obamacare.
