But that didn't get far, a response from the House Speaker.  If you look at our latest Fox News poll where people in America seem to be on this, on the State of the Union speech, deliver as usual, 56 percent, skip altogether, 33 percent. But the Speaker's letter soon after the President said he was going forward, \"When I extended the invitation on January 3rd for you to deliver the State of the Union address, it was on the mutually agreed-upon date January 29th. At that time there was no thought that the government would still be shut down. My further correspondence, January 16th, I said we should work together to find a mutually agreeable date when the government has reopened, and I hope that we can still do that. I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President's State of the Union address in the House Chamber until the government has opened.\" Where is this going? Let's bring in our panel, Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review,\" Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" We debated how big a deal this was, this back and forth. There's a lot of things happening around the world, but it is pretty unique, Jonah, for this moment in political history.  JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Yes. I think it's not a great spectacle. I think Donald Trump was right to call Nancy Pelosi's bluff on the security thing, because I always thought that was a fairly bogus and lame thing. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want him there, she should stand up for her institution and say so.   I had a hard time believing when 10 percent of the American people say they are severely affected by the shutdown according to this poll, that even a fraction of those people are really heartbroken that they may not see the State of the Union address. I think this is something that Washington cares about a great deal. If he gives a speech from someplace else it will substitute just fine for it. But I can't stand the State of the Union Address, so I'm glad to see it taken down a peg. But it is a sign of the partisan breakdown in Washington.",

On the norm violation thing, I think it's absolutely true that Speaker Pelosi is violating norms, but Donald Trump comes in bragging about how he is a disruptor. When you're a disrupter, other people react in disruptive ways as well. There are cascades and feedbacks in all of this. And I think that one of the things you talk to Democrats on the Hill, what they'll say is, they are negotiating. And I think it's absolutely true the Trump White House has offered some perfectly reasonable negotiation tactics. They've moved positions and Democrats haven't, but that's in part because Nancy Pelosi is locked into this idea that what they don't want to do is credit this idea that you can shut down the government to get what you want from Congress.",

      "utterance": "It started that the President was saying, I'm going forward with the invitation and I will deliver the State of the Union address in the house chamber next Tuesday. But that didn't get far, a response from the House Speaker. If you look at our latest Fox News poll where people in America seem to be on this, on the State of the Union speech, deliver as usual, 56 percent, skip altogether, 33 percent. But the Speaker's letter soon after the President said he was going forward, \"When I extended the invitation on January 3rd for you to deliver the State of the Union address, it was on the mutually agreed-upon date January 29th. At that time there was no thought that the government would still be shut down. My further correspondence, January 16th, I said we should work together to find a mutually agreeable date when the government has reopened, and I hope that we can still do that. I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President's State of the Union address in the House Chamber until the government has opened.\" Where is this going? Let's bring in our panel, Jonah Goldberg, senior editor at \"National Review,\" Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" We debated how big a deal this was, this back and forth. There's a lot of things happening around the world, but it is pretty unique, Jonah, for this moment in political history. JONAH GOLDBERG, SENIOR EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": Yes. I think it's not a great spectacle. I think Donald Trump was right to call Nancy Pelosi's bluff on the security thing, because I always thought that was a fairly bogus and lame thing. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want him there, she should stand up for her institution and say so. I had a hard time believing when 10 percent of the American people say they are severely affected by the shutdown according to this poll, that even a fraction of those people are really heartbroken that they may not see the State of the Union address. I think this is something that Washington cares about a great deal. If he gives a speech from someplace else it will substitute just fine for it. But I can't stand the State of the Union Address, so I'm glad to see it taken down a peg. But it is a sign of the partisan breakdown in Washington."

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": Or like an infrastructure bill, or anything else this year, right? One of the things that we see unfolding now is the way that these two powerful people who represent their parties are going to operate for the next two years. And I think it doesn't give you much hope on legislative action on anything or on a path to opening the government. In fact, it's 33 days. The President is taking it on the chin in polls.

You showed the one that has 51 percent of the country blames Trump for the shutdown. Considering that he said he was willing to take full credit for it and that he thought border security and enforcement of our nation's laws and rule of law are so important he is willing to shut the government down, that it's only 51 percent I think speaks to some of this recalcitrance we're seeing where Nancy Pelosi says she couldn't even imagine that the government would be shut down after this long, yet she has done absolutely nothing to open it back up. She has offered $1 for border security. That is not a serious person right now."

But again, when Nancy Pelosi has offered $1, that is what she thinks is her powerful bed, and then to do all these antics. Yes, I agree, we've talked about the State of the Union not being a very -- we might not like it. It is also an institution. It's particularly a modern institution. And to be the first speaker in history to get rid of this norm, to get rid of this thing and then to complain about other people who are supposedly big norm breakers when you're the one who is actually destroying modern institutions, it undercuts a major --"

I felt this way under Barack Obama, I feel that way under Donald Trump. We treat it as if he is the guy running the government when in fact the Congress is the supreme branch. On the norm violation thing, I think it's absolutely true that Speaker Pelosi is violating norms, but Donald Trump comes in bragging about how he is a disruptor. When you're a disrupter, other people react in disruptive ways as well. There are cascades and feedbacks in all of this. And I think that one of the things you talk to Democrats on the Hill, what they'll say is, they are negotiating. And I think it's absolutely true the Trump White House has offered some perfectly reasonable negotiation tactics. They've moved positions and Democrats haven't, but that's in part because Nancy Pelosi is locked into this idea that what they don't want to do is credit this idea that you can shut down the government to get what you want from Congress."

FOX poll five, U.S.-Mexico border, build the wall, more border agents, and there you see the breakdown. Build the wall, 43 percent, and more border agents, 73 percent. Hardship, Jonah, you mentioned this, that your family is experiencing the government shutdown, 10 percent severe, and there you see the breakdown, obviously for the 800,000 employees, they are feeling it directly. President Trump's job approval, we have it at 43 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove. This tracks a little higher than some others. A.P. has it down in the 30s I saw tonight.

It's a big problem, and one of the big problems also is the military, the leadership of which is completely corrupt and bought off by the Maduro regime, even if they would like to split with Maduro, the problem is that they may be complicit in all sorts crimes against humanity, and so their fate is sort of tied up with keeping the Maduro regime going. The truth of it is Maduro is losing the support of the poor people who were staying behind who have been his base, and if he loses those, it's going to be a people power thing. It is a prudential question for us. Morally I think we are completely right, I think the Trump administration is completely right morally.
