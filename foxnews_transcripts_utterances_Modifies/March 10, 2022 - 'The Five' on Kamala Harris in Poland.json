Remember in high school you just had to get it to 300 words. That's how she sounds. So, I'm sick of them saying nothing and I would actually like Biden especially to stop saying what he won't do. I know people have said that before, but why not keep Putin guessing? Why not maybe say, you know, what we might actually -- we're not taking anything off the table? You know, maybe you buzz some jets over the Russian border, maybe you throw some subs into the Black Sea. Maybe you pay Putin's girlfriend to visit in Switzerland. You knock on the door, the Chalet, maybe deliver a bouquet of roses, maybe the CIA writes a little something in the note. I'll see you in the Hague. Get in his head.

Trey Yingst is in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, where he and the Fox team I must say working tirelessly under the near constant threat of attack. So filled with admiration for the job you guys are doing. Trey, what is the latest?",

Over the past 24 hours we have seen explosions in the distance, air raid sirens going off, and Ukraine's air defense system in action. The war is getting closer and closer to this capital city of nearly three million people. Though the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said today about half of the city is actually evacuated since this invasion began. Staying in the city though is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who spoke directly to Russian soldiers who invaded his country. VOLODYMY ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translation): You can still save yourselves if you just go home. Do not believe your commanders who say that you still have a chance in Ukraine. Nothing but prison and death awaits you here. You are taking our lives and we'll pay with yours.",

The Ukrainian president has called the attack a war crime and you can see from this video there is evidence of a civilian area, a hospital being targeted with a Russian strike. The deputy mayor of Mariupol detailed other disturbing actions by the Russians in the city since the invasion began, saying more than 1,200 people have been killed, dozens today buried in those mass graves. They simply don't have time to bury the dead. These lifeless bodies just thrown into the ground. A gut wrenching reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here. But again, the capital of Kyiv, they are seeing these images across their country and fearing that the days to come could have even worse things in store for the population here. Back to you.",

First of all, I barely know the president and then I'm here in front of Vladimir Putin. And so I deliver the message. I say, you're going to get asked about this. And he says, why would I answer that, and he looks at 43 and says when you fired that newsman. And the president says, what are you talking about, Vladimir? He say, you know, you fired the newsman. And 43 says are you talking about Dan Rather? He said that's not how it works. He works for a private company. That company fired him. I'm telling you as your friend don't go out there and say that.

They -- nobody wants to go into the weeds on that. But we know that a lot of that stuff isn't usable and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The problem with having a Democrat in charge in this kind of ordeal is if the consequences match their desires, they will not mitigate the consequences. We see that now. Isn't it weird that the White House dismisses higher oil prices? It's because they wanted higher oil prices well before this war started and Putin invaded the Ukraine. This is why they don't care about it because they want us to pay more. They want us to feel pain at the pump so we reduce our oil usage our gas usage and then we go to the -- you know, cars with windmills in their back seats. We are also reminded that Joe Biden is an inside weather vane. Whoever's in the room with him, he will simply do what they want. He's an empty vessel.

Ronald Reagan, one of the ways he brought down the Soviet Union, he told Gorbachev, he said, bud, we're going to pump our own oil. And he got the Saudis to pump oil, and that almost bankrupt the Soviet Union. And he sold the Saudis a ton of weapons and made the Saudis happy. What are we doing now? We cut arm sales to the Saudis and we're pissing them off because we're trying to redo the Iran deal. It's ass backwards. God, I sound like Greg, what is happening? All -- he negotiates with the Taliban, but he won't talk to big oil. Think about that. They asked him today, why won't you even have any of these oil executives over the White House for some tea, for some croissants? Talk about how you guys are going to make prices better for the people. And she goes up, well, we don't have anything on the schedule for that.

You know, maybe you buzz some jets over the Russian border, maybe you throw some subs into the Black Sea. Maybe you pay Putin's girlfriend to visit in Switzerland. You knock on the door, the Chalet, maybe deliver a bouquet of roses, maybe the CIA writes a little something in the note. I'll see you in the Hague. Get in his head. Because right now Putin doesn't -- and what's he have, two weeks to surround the capital. Zelenskyy is in deep trouble if he can't hold this guys off soon. And it's, you know, they're going to starve him out and then they're going to send in assassins. We don't have a lot of time. We have to do something more than we're doing right now."

The deputy mayor of Mariupol detailed other disturbing actions by the Russians in the city since the invasion began, saying more than 1,200 people have been killed, dozens today buried in those mass graves. They simply don't have time to bury the dead. These lifeless bodies just thrown into the ground. A gut wrenching reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here.

And they are working to look through these cars to make sure there's no Russian advance forces trying to get into the city. We have seen the battles already take place here as the Russians send in troops to try to figure out how much resistance they are going to face. But they are in desperate need right now of ammunition of anti-aircraft batteries and anti-tank missiles.

But the problem is this -- you've got hundreds of thousands of people now who don't have food, water, heat, energy, people are now fighting each other for food.

He's got us back down like a bunch of wusses, you know, saying okay you can do the anti-tank missiles, but don't you dare send any jets and then we back down even though Blinken at first said yes, we're going to do it.

And I was told make sure you tell Putin that he's going to get a question from the American press that he -- question about press freedoms in Russia. So, I go in there. I'm really intimidated, right? First of all, I barely know the president and then I'm here in front of Vladimir Putin. And so I deliver the message. I say, you're going to get asked about this. And he says, why would I answer that, and he looks at 43 and says when you fired that newsman. And the president says, what are you talking about, Vladimir? He say, you know, you fired the newsman. And 43 says are you talking about Dan Rather? He said that's not how it works. He works for a private company. That company fired him. I'm telling you as your friend don't go out there and say that. And I was thinking back on that today that I don't know if Putin really didn't understand or was choosing not to understand, but it didn't matter to him because he has relentless focus on his audience back home.

They -- nobody wants to go into the weeds on that. But we know that a lot of that stuff isn't usable and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The problem with having a Democrat in charge in this kind of ordeal is if the consequences match their desires, they will not mitigate the consequences. We see that now. Isn't it weird that the White House dismisses higher oil prices? It's because they wanted higher oil prices well before this war started and Putin invaded the Ukraine. This is why they don't care about it because they want us to pay more. They want us to feel pain at the pump so we reduce our oil usage our gas usage and then we go to the -- you know, cars with windmills in their back seats. We are also reminded that Joe Biden is an inside weather vane. Whoever's in the room with him, he will simply do what they want. He's an empty vessel.

Ronald Reagan, one of the ways he brought down the Soviet Union, he told Gorbachev, he said, bud, we're going to pump our own oil. And he got the Saudis to pump oil, and that almost bankrupt the Soviet Union. And he sold the Saudis a ton of weapons and made the Saudis happy. What are we doing now? We cut arm sales to the Saudis and we're pissing them off because we're trying to redo the Iran deal. It's ass backwards. God, I sound like Greg, what is happening? All -- he negotiates with the Taliban, but he won't talk to big oil. Think about that. They asked him today, why won't you even have any of these oil executives over the White House for some tea, for some croissants? Talk about how you guys are going to make prices better for the people. And she goes up, well, we don't have anything on the schedule for that. Well, you should because you guys have to work together with these people. Oil is like food. You need it to live. You can't survive, America cannot survive without oil, inexpensive oil. So, they need to get their act together. And I'm sick of him telling people to drive electric. He doesn't drive electric. He drives these muscle cars. They get terrible miles to the gallon. Psaki doesn't drive an EV. Does Mayor Pete driving EV. None of them do. It's like the masks. Remember the masks? You guys all have to wear masks.

And instead of dealing with the Saudis who we shouldn't be dealing with, we're dealing now with Iran. And we're dealing with Iran, with Russia at the table. And I thought that we were sanctioning Russia, but now we need them at the table with Iran. To me, this is like if you need a babysitter, right, and you have a 15- year-old daughter who can babysit but you say, no, I don't want my daughter to babysit. I'm going to go next door.

From what I heard, there are two bio labs in that country, one in Odesa, one in Kyiv, and the U.S. government has involvement with it because we say that they're there to protect against deadly pathogens, and, you know, swine flu, and avian flu and things like that. U.S. Senators had been involved in trying to create these centers and protect these centers after the Soviet Union collapsed. We're still there. We still have a footprint. So, I guess we're saying that if Putin takes Odesa takes Kyiv, then those Bio Labs would be vulnerable to Russian forces. And then God knows what you could do with any of these little samples.

And why would they share it, right? They've -- we've been -- this is a strategy that they've been using over the past several months to say, we know what Putin is about to do, we know what he's about to do. Now, that hasn't necessarily deterred things from happening, but perhaps this also sends a message to China.
