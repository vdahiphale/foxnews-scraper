Second, while it's true that Germany has not sent arms to Ukraine, after the United States, they are the second largest donor to Ukraine and Europe. The great thing, Martha, about having the kind of alliance we have, with 30 NATO allies, is that different allies step up to take different pieces of this. So, we and the U.K. and some of the other countries are supplying weapons, and then there are other allies who are providing different forms of support to Ukraine. But the bottom line is this: the reason that we are able to swiftly move a battalion into Romania to reinforce the -- and reinsure our ally Romania is because those forces were stationed in Germany. Having forces stationed in Germany is in fact a strategic asset to the United States because not only can they help defend German territory, but they can be moved to our allies in the East to reinforce, reassure, and deter Russia and that puts the United States and a stronger position to stand up to Russian military aggression.",

We need pressing, biting sanctions now, not after an invasion. What Putin is talking about has been putting together the old Soviet Union. Ukraine is the first part of that. He wants to swallow the whole thing, and it's about -- it is the second largest country in Europe. We need to prevent that through letting him know that it's going to be very painful if he tries to do it. If he gets away with it, that's the bigger problem.

You know, there's talk about the diplomatic boycott, but the sanctions effort is really the power here. And just in terms of China, just on Friday, the House passed a substantial sanctions bill. In June, the Senate passed it on a bipartisan basis. The House bill got caught up in some politics. Only one Republican vote there. But the overall power of it as it goes into conference is to impose serious sanctions on China, and also to boost America's economic independence from China, which I think is absolutely critical to make us more innovative, strengthen American manufacturing, go in terms of American ability to do things on the energy front, like scrub air, produce clean energy, so that we are less dependent on China. This is all, it seems to me, critical. I think the partisanship is regrettable. I think it's shameful that there was only one GOP vote in the House over issues like, you know, clean oceans and coral.

The ceremony captivated the world. It was watched by over a hundred million people. She has served with 14 prime ministers. During her reign, the British empire has shrunk considerably and the royal family has certainly had its ups and downs under the glare of global media. Now the royals are hoping for a reset as she celebrates this milestone. Joining us now from London, U.K. media correspondent Neil Sean. Neil, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. Good to have you with us today. I want to start with the news this morning which is significant to people who watch this sort of thing, and that is that Queen Elizabeth has essentially given the nod for Camilla, Prince Charles' wife, to become queen, essentially, when he takes the throne after she passes.

The key thing is that the United States needs to be, and is prepared for any of those contingencies in lockstep with our allies and partners. We have reinforced and reassured our allies on the Eastern Flank, we have united the West, we have provided material support to Ukraine, all of President Biden's direction, and we've also offered Russia a diplomatic path if they choose to take it.

We have sent forces to Europe to defend NATO territory. We have a sacred obligation under Article Five to defend our NATO allies, Poland and Romania, and the Baltic States. We have made that commitment to them. We will keep that commitment to them. But we can do for the Ukrainians is not send American troops to fight in a war in Ukraine, but we can send defensive assistance which we have done to the tune of more than half a billion dollars over the course of the past year. And we can provide other forms of support alongside our allies and partners, we have done that as well. We have been clear from the start about the steps that we are prepared to take.

And yes, that would include reciprocal limitations on the placement of offensive missiles. It would include greater transparency measures. It would include mechanisms to reduce the possibility of mistake or escalation if there were incidents at sea or in the air. We're prepared to do all of that, just as we have been over the course of the past decades in the Cold War and after. If Russia wants to sit at the table into that, we are prepared to come flanked by allies and partners and negotiate an outcome along those lines.

So we have 30,000 to 50,000 troops in Germany. I think a lot of people look at the situation and remember some of the proposals in the prior in administration and say, why aren't we -- why aren't we doing that? Why aren't we moving those troops to NATO, to our stronger allies than Germany at this moment?"

Second, while it's true that Germany has not sent arms to Ukraine, after the United States, they are the second largest donor to Ukraine and Europe. The great thing, Martha, about having the kind of alliance we have, with 30 NATO allies, is that different allies step up to take different pieces of this. So, we and the U.K. and some of the other countries are supplying weapons, and then there are other allies who are providing different forms of support to Ukraine."

Having forces stationed in Germany is in fact a strategic asset to the United States because not only can they help defend German territory, but they can be moved to our allies in the East to reinforce, reassure, and deter Russia and that puts the United States and a stronger position to stand up to Russian military aggression."

And we have been absolutely clear that if Russia invades Ukraine, one way or the other, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.

It's where the strategic advantage will lie, because we can't just look at next year or the year after. That's not what China is doing. We have to look out 10, 20, 30 years.

But there's a more important point here, which is that the United States, the West, the free world, we need to believe in ourselves, we need to have confidence in ourselves. The U.S. and the West collectively comprise more than half the world's GDP. Russia and China comprise less than 20 percent. We've got innovation. We got entrepreneurship. We've got immense capacity and human potential. And one thing that President Biden has done over the course of the last year is rally our allies in Europe, in Asia, and other parts of the world, to stand together for a vision in which democracies will win the day over the years ahead, not autocracies. And we feel very good about the fact that we have that kind of strategic alignment and convergence with close friends and partners in the G7, in the Quad, in NATO, with the European Union.

Senator, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday.\" Good to have you with us. All of the senators received closed-door intel briefing at the end of last week, and there are quite startling figures and news coming out of that. One is from the Joint Chiefs Chair Mark Milley, who said that it's possible that Kabul could fall inside of 72 hours. What was your reaction when you came out of that briefing in terms of where this is headed?"

And to see the two of them standing in solidarity and seeming to be eager to double-team America is going to be a real test of President Biden's resolve. So the question now comes down to Putin and, does he or doesn't he? It's not, can he or can't he? He certainly has the potential to do this if he decides to move. I think it's incumbent upon us to do everything we can to discourage that action. But ultimately, he's going to make that decision by himself. It became clear to me from the briefing that he's not going to take input from others, he is a predator, he's going to see what it costs him and what he gets. And if we put biting sanctions in place right now, without delay before an attack, then those will be financial, as well as make sure that Ukraine has the weapons that they need to defend themselves. That's not U.S. troops, that's Ukraine defending themselves with first-class weapons, then that will make Putin think twice."

Do you see something happen here that's some sort of arms agreement that allows Putin to be in Ukraine and then sort of take some of the -- some arms off the table? I mean, you heard -- I (inaudible) Jake Sullivan moments ago, and there's a commitment to put troops in the region, but not in Ukraine, which I think a lot of people agree with. I know your colleague Josh Hawley agrees with that. But how far are we willing to go is the question."

I think you're 100 percent right, he does use energy as a weapon and we can talk more about that, but we ought to have biting sanctions in place now, not later. We have a bipartisan piece of legislation that we've been working on and I'll tell you what is happening now is the administration has been weak kneed on this, they've been dragging their feet, they want Democrats to water it down. We need pressing, biting sanctions now, not after an invasion. What Putin is talking about has been putting together the old Soviet Union. Ukraine is the first part of that. He wants to swallow the whole thing, and it's about -- it is the second largest country in Europe. We need to prevent that through letting him know that it's going to be very painful if he tries to do it. If he gets away with it, that's the bigger problem. He needs to choke on trying to swallow Ukraine because if it's easy pickings for him, my worry is that then China moves against Taiwan and Iran moves quickly to a nuclear weapon."

So, yes, I think it's very clear that he has his operatives directly, indirectly in Ukraine in order to produce false information to justify an invasion if, in fact, he does invade.

And if Mr. Putin further incurs into Ukraine, it will not be used. So, to me, it's a mistake. At this particular moment, I don't believe it's an issue in regards to Mr. Putin's calculations, other than he knows that he -- if he does invade, he will not be able to get that pipeline open. You are correct, part of his playbook is to use energy as a weapon. That's Mr. Putin's playbook. So we don't want to give him a stronger hand in the use of this -- of weaponizing energy."

It might sound a little absurd and rather juvenile, but the reality is it poses a threat to the United States. They have now said going forward they're going to work together on Taiwan, they're going to work together on Ukraine. Those are the two biggest issues to those countries. But they're also going to partner on this whole host of other issues, from work and, you know, defense, in space, to artificial intelligence, to Internet security. Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, tried to push back on you, Martha. He said, well, nowhere in this 5,000 page document does it call this partnership and alliance. Again, the reality is that this means whatever Russia and China wants it to mean on any given day. They might not be calling it an alliance right now, but it's an alliance."

      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Oh, I do. I think that it's being taken seriously globally, Martha. And, you know, here in the United States, you have had discussions earlier today about the sanctions efforts against Russia, but, you know, we've also seen sanctions efforts now in Congress against China. You know, there's talk about the diplomatic boycott, but the sanctions effort is really the power here. And just in terms of China, just on Friday, the House passed a substantial sanctions bill. In June, the Senate passed it on a bipartisan basis. The House bill got caught up in some politics. Only one Republican vote there. But the overall power of it as it goes into conference is to impose serious sanctions on China, and also to boost America's economic independence from China, which I think is absolutely critical to make us more innovative, strengthen American manufacturing, go in terms of American ability to do things on the energy front, like scrub air, produce clean energy, so that we are less dependent on China. This is all, it seems to me, critical. I think the partisanship is regrettable. I think it's shameful that there was only one GOP vote in the House over issues like, you know, clean oceans and coral. You know, I think we need, at this point, to stand strong and be very clear, we're not going to play around with China or Russia."

MITCH MCCONNELL, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDING PARTNER OF CAVALRY, AND CO-HOST, \"RUTHLESS PODCAST\": Well, it could. Look, I think the Biden administration has all of the tools that are necessary to try to unite the west against basically what's happening with Russia and Ukraine and send a strong message to China vis-a-vis Taiwan. I think what Juan was talking about, in terms of the congressional angle here, is that what has become a hallmark of Democratic-led Congress, they can figure out how to screw up a two-car parade. This is something in terms of the China aspect of it that passed the United States Senate with broad, bipartisanship this summer and it subsequently was pulled out of negotiations made entirely partisan and had a whole bunch of different Democratic priorities that frankly didn't reflect the will of the Senate in the first place in crafting a bipartisan package. And so now that's stuck, right? And that's the kind of gridlock we don't need. I think that what this needs is a very strong response from the Biden administration, which I certainly hope they get, because the message it sends to Xi vis-a-vis Taiwan is extremely significant."

      "utterance": "So, obviously, this is all getting a lot of attention overseas. But one of the biggest things that's getting attention here, Gillian, is crime. And the president came to New York. There was an editorial that came out in \"The New York Post\" which basically said that the president needs Eric Adams, the new mayor of New York, who's talking tough at least at this point on crime, more than Adams needs him. Gillian, was that a successful trip to New York for the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "I'm -- the Biden administration counts it as a success, absolutely, because they're facing a midterm where violent crime is going to determine a lot of the races in various regions across the country. This is their best shot at trying to team up with a mayor who's been, you know, very tough on crime, but, at the same time, has embraced President Biden personally and directly. You know, Adams has called himself the Biden of Brooklyn I think he said. He also has boasted that he is President Biden's favorite mayor in America. And that all is fine. But I would agree that the Biden administration has more eggs in this basket then Mayor Adams. They are desperate to put some credentials behind their new slogan, which is, we're getting tough on crime."

    {
      "speaker": "HOLMES",
      "utterance": "Oh, of course there is. But I think it's indicative of the larger problem in the progressive movement with talking about crime in general. I mean the reason that this is a huge liability for the Biden administration is because Democrats have, frankly, thought it's impolitic to talk about violent crime across this country for the last two years. And the only way that they can discuss crime at all is about eliminating guns, to say nothing of the carjackings and the lootings and the riots all across this country for the last two years. I think they have an extreme problem. I think this administration understands that. But they still can't get to a point where they're talking about it in a way that resonates with the American people."

He's talking there about 2024."

      "utterance": "Well, he's right, of course, and he's a man of integrity and principle, and I think he demonstrated that on January 6th. He's demonstrating that again today. I think it says less about his relationship with the former president than it does about himself. What I found most interesting about this speech was the venue that he chose. It was at The Federalist Society, which is sort of an intellectual hub of conservatism. Certainly, the site of the group most influential and President Trump's probably largest accomplishment with the reshaping of the judiciary. And it certainly -- you're not going to find a gathering more conservative anywhere in the United States. So that -- the fact that that was warmly received, I think, is an interesting takeaway going forward for those remarks."

Your thoughts on that censure?"

      "utterance": "You know, I think it was carefully worded and written with the intent to support former President Trump and, you know, what's called the big lie about January 6th. The cleanup afterwards was pretty pathetic because of the fallout from the use of that phrase, legitimate political discourse. What happened, everyone in the world saw it on tape, you can watch it today, was not legitimate political discourse. There was an effort by the RNC chair to say, well, she was not talking about -- she was not talking about the violence, she was talking about everything before. But, clearly, everything that happened before and during this episode, you know, is defined by the violence, police being hit with bear spray, speared with flag poles, people dying. That's not legitimate political discourse. And, you know, again, I think that it's in-service to President Trump's narcissism. It's all about him. I don't think this is helping the Republican Party going forward. And I think it just opens them up to widespread criticism."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Let's talk about the Republican Party going forward because President Trump was able to sort of discuss politics and midterm realities with Benny Moreno, who's a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Ohio. He dropped out of that crowded primary. So, Gillian, how much does it appear that President Trump is really influencing a lot of what's happening out there with regard to the midterms?"

      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "He all -- Martha, I just want to flag -- he also, in a statement a couple of days ago, said that he thinks America is going to hell. So, he clearly doesn't have a very optimistic outlook going forward. I don't know what that says about him as a politician. I will say, with the two measures you just talked about, vice president -- -- former Vice President Pence's comments combined with the GOP's censure of Cheney and Kinzinger, they really -- I mean the Republican Party this week really codified this litmus test that has been in place now for the better part of a year. It -- this litmus test goes something, you know, to the tune of, was January 6th and insurrection, right? And if you're a politician, if you're a candidate right now and your answer is yes, you are in mortal peril. Odds are you're not going to survive the next midterm elections. And your career is dead in the water. I think both these things were like looming, huge elephants in the room over the better part of a year and now they are putting them all out there."

He said, this is not on people's list. You know, it's not what people are talking about in Wyoming. When I go out and hear what concerns -- and they're really concerned about inflation. We know Americans are very concerned about crime, which we spoke about in the last bloc. So, you know, how much of this really matters in the midterms? But, obviously, the behind the scenes king making stuff probably matters more for these candidates than the -- than the issues, the larger issue underlying."

      "speaker": "HOLMES",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, look, of course Senator Barrasso is absolutely correct about this. This is nowhere in -- near the top ten of concerns of Americans regardless of your political affiliation across this country. I think the challenge for Republicans is to try to figure out how to stay on message here. You don't want to be distracted by things that turn the firing squad within. But you what to figure out basically how to communicate a message that most Americans are concerned about, the economy, immigration, foreign policy, things like that."

      "utterance": "So, Queen Elizabeth, today, marks 70 years on the throne. The duty of monarch began for her with the shocking news that her father, King George VI, had died. And I just 25 years old, she became queen of an empire that at that time spanned a quarter of the world. Her grand coronation that June was the very first to be televised. The ceremony captivated the world. It was watched by over a hundred million people. She has served with 14 prime ministers. During her reign, the British empire has shrunk considerably and the royal family has certainly had its ups and downs under the glare of global media. Now the royals are hoping for a reset as she celebrates this milestone. Joining us now from London, U.K. media correspondent Neil Sean. Neil, welcome to FOX NEWS SUNDAY. Good to have you with us today. I want to start with the news this morning which is significant to people who watch this sort of thing, and that is that Queen Elizabeth has essentially given the nod for Camilla, Prince Charles' wife, to become queen, essentially, when he takes the throne after she passes. Why is that so significant?"

      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, right. Right. Now, let me explain this. Let me explain this, though. It's very simple. She's queen consort. So what the queen is actually doing is this. She's reshaping the monarchy. And I don't know about you, Martha, but I found it very strange actually when she, you know, used the phrase, you know, \"in the fullest of time.\" She's setting up the shop, as it were, for the next session of the monarchy. And what's interesting also, Martha, is that, you know, people are then saying, well, is Camilla going to be queen? No, she is the queen consort. So it's King Charles and then she is the consort. But I think by her majesty the queen putting this out there, she's basically saying, these are my wishes, even after I'm no longer here, sadly. This is what I want you to do. And telling, of course, not just the United Kingdom, but the commonwealth, this is what's happening. As you know, I admire greatly our gracious majesty the queen and I think what a girl and what a time to do it on the eve, of course, of the accession (ph). Marvelous."

And you spent some time at Buckingham Palace sort of taking the pulse this morning outside of what people think about this because everybody, you know, really things of Camilla as the person who broke up Diana and Charles' marriage. But has that mellowed a little bit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "Oh, it's mellowed a lot. Let me tell you, I was at a functionalist week with Catherine, Prince Charles and Camilla, and you can see a really good bond, for instance, with Catherine and Camilla. And the public, you know, has really changed over the last 17 years. I'm not decrying -- you know, we all have a past. Camilla will be the first to admit that. And when you think about other people in the royal family who have moaned and moaned about media intrusion, did anybody apart from Camilla, and of course the duchess of York, go through terrible times in the '90s with the media? That's already changed because she's been very strong with a lot of her charities, you know, the abused charities, the reading charities."

Who do you expect will be sort of in the prime spots there, and do you think Prince Andrew and Meghan and Harry, will they even be there?"

      "speaker": "SEAN",
      "utterance": "You have to spoil it, Martha. The thing is -- no, the thing is, yes, you're right, I think I'm -- we're going to see a lot more of Princess Anne. She is one of the figures behind the scenes putting a lot of this together. We will see Prince William and Prince Charles alongside our gracious majesty the queen. Do I believe Prince Andrew will be involved? I think privately, yes, but publicly, no. That's his choice. Meghan and Harry, there is no appetite over here in the United Kingdom for them to return, whatever the message you're hearing over there. Over here they're polling incredibly badly. And I think after the messages over the last couple of days about, you know, the things that Prince Harry does and the Oprah Winfrey interview is still rated so badly in people's minds over here. It's actually made Prince Charles and Camilla even more popular. A lot of people feel incredibly sorry for them."
