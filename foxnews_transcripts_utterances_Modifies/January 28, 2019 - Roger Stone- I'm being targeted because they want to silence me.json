      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "And this is a Fox News alert. We are now monitoring a very serious situation tonight out of Houston. Multiple police officers were shot while serving a narcotics warrant. The suspect is believed to be dead. We're going to keep you posted as this horrific story continues to unfold. We start tonight, though, with \"Hannity Watch\" on the deep state and turn to Robert Mueller's ongoing witch hunt. Now, in the early morning hours, January 25th, 17 vehicles including two armored tactical trucks rolled into Roger Stone's Fort Lauderdale neighborhood. Two dozen heavily armed federal agents dressed in SWAT gear surrounding his home, drawing their weapons in this predawn raid pounding on his door, and taking Stone into custody.  While the CNN cameras are there to watch, of course. He's not charged with a violent crime. He's not a drug kingpin. He's not a ruthless gangster mafia guy. This isn't El Chapo.  Instead, Stone has been indicted on several, again, processing violations, including lying to Congress. And once again, nothing to do with Russia.  And because Roger Stone is not a risk to society, oh, he was let out immediately on bail, on his own recognizance, right here on this program he will join us tonight in minutes. We'll talk about these tactics which are now all too common. The question remains, why this show of force? After all, he would have happily turned himself in. Of course, we've seen this with Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen. It is an outrageous abuse of power. Where is FBI Director Wray on this?  So this is the new standard? SWAT teams, 27 people, predawn raids, CNN cameras, tactical armored vehicles, somebody charged with lying? And as it turns out, this only applies to those associated with President Trump. Now, take, for example, former Obama A.G. Eric Holder. Where is his FBI raid? He has a long history of lying, including some surrounding a blatant cover-up, oh, the Fast and Furious scandal.  What about the Obama officials who lied to Congress about the plan to give Iran access to U.S. banks as an incentive to sign off on that horrible nuclear deal? Are their houses going to be surrounded? What about former IRS official Lois Lerner lying about her department's financial persecution of Tea Party groups? Federal agents going to drag her out in cuffs?   What about comrade John Brennan? He lied before Congress on multiple occasions about Hillary's bought and paid for dirty dossier. Or James Clapper's perjury before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the NSA?  Where's that predawn raid? And we can't forget Hillary. She has the biggest slam dunk case of obstruction of justice violating the Espionage Act we've ever seen. Are they going to have a predawn raid, guns blazing raid for Hillary Clinton? Now, the danger here, this is a two tiered system of justice. That's what's shocking. It's also dangerous. It should disgust every American to their core because it doesn't matter where you stand politically, it's a clear and present danger to what is our great Democratic republic.   These are the actions of a banana republic. Rank and file members, law enforcement -- they are working hard every day to keep this country safe.  Those rank and file officers and field agents, they have no say in any of this. Instead, we have a few very powerful, top echelon bureaucrats in Washington working equally hard to destroy the Trump administration, invalidate the 2016 election, protect their friends from ever being held accountable, like Hillary, exoneration before investigation, the phony dossier. Lying to FISA court judges and committing fraud. Now, with that said, the witch hunt is now, according to reports, in its final days. According to the new acting A.G., Matthew Whitaker, the investigation was close to being completed. Watch this. Oh, apparently not.",

      "sentences": "All right. So, here we are, 621 days, the witch hunt now may be almost over. So far, zero evidence of any collusion. And. meanwhile, the president of the United States, he does have important work to do -- namely, the safety and security of the American people. Now, let not your hearts be troubled. This is a president who keeps his promises.  So, I have a couple of questions for my conservative friends that are mad at the president for allowing Congress three weeks to do their job, make a deal on immigration, and open the government in the interim. Here's the question. Do you believe for one second, do you really believe the president has stopped his full-on fight over the border wall that he has promised? Has he not shown he's a tenacious fighter when it comes to keeping his promises?  I've said this before. In my opinion, I don't care where the money comes from. I don't care how they get it as long as they build the wall to keep us safe. So, don't let what is what I believe a shift in strategy fool you because I don't have any doubt that the president is going to fight as hard, if not harder, for the money for the wall, because in this case, his fight is principled. Think about this. The president, he's talking about safety and security, even life and death of the American people. He talks about stopping drugs and cartels and gangs, human and drug trafficking. Where were Chuck and Nancy? What were they fighting for? They wouldn't even talk to the president, wouldn't sit down. They abandoned the process furloughed workers, DACA kids, Dreamers, the very things they have said over and over and over, are so important to them, that the president offered to them, just to cater to the radical and extreme hate-Trump base of theirs?  The only question now on Democrats, are they willing to make a deal or not?  Are they going to let the left run that party? Because in three weeks, Democrats can come to the table, work out a compromise that gets them the things they say they wanted.   Remember, Obama was president, they sounded like Trump on the wall. If Democrats are unwilling to fund the border security, the president can and the president should declare a national emergency. He will build the wall with billions of dollars in funds that he allocates, probably going to take a court fight. Democrats will go liberal judge shopping in the Ninth Circuit. But as commander in chief, I believe on the law and the Constitution, this president's going to win this battle in the courts. And if not, he's not going to stop. He'll move to plan C. So, what we should be doing is putting aside political differences, working together to keep the American people safe, and stopping the 90 percent of heroin from coming across our southern border, or fentanyl, which is killing people every day. That's why a group of border patrol wives have invited Speaker Pelosi to McAllen, Texas, so she could witness the effects of our porous border firsthand herself. Now, remember, she rejected a meeting with Angel Moms and Dads. While she was in her office, they were outside her office.  Wouldn't meet with them.  And, frankly, any future crimes -- think about this -- resulting from open borders, the Democratic Party will now own. They will be partly responsible. And sadly, it's unlikely that Pelosi will accept the invitation.  By the way, we have a new 12,000-persons- strong caravan, what if they come to an area that isn't secure? Both sides are at risk. She doesn't seem to care. To Democrats, anyone affected by the shutdown or our flawed immigration system, even Angel Moms and Dads are just pawns in what is their political game. The Democrats think their resistance to border security somehow harms the president politically, well, they better start playing chess, because as more crime happens, as more drugs come into this country, they will get the blame they rightly deserve.   Look at this new \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC poll. It shows the president support remained steady throughout the shutdown. And according to other polling, the president's approval rating remains high in Democratically- held districts that he won in 2016. Also keep in h mind, as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich pointed out, in January of 1983, Ronald Reagan had a 35 percent approval rating.  Two years later, he swept 49 states and was overwhelmingly reelected -- all because he kept his promises, fought for the American people, the economy turned around, fought against the far left detractors. Sound familiar?  And we can't predict 2020. We don't know what we'll be debating in two years, but it brings us to our \"Hannity Watch\" on the radical crop of 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Unlike 2018, this year's going to be awesome. 2018, they were hiding their positions. 2020, they're going to all try to out- radical each other.  Get ready, because every Democrat who wants to run for president is about to take that hard turn to appease what is now the radical, extreme socialist Democratic Party base. Take, for example, possible contender Andrew Cuomo. Now, honest people can have a difference as to when life begins. He just celebrated a bill in New York state making late-term abortion legal. Now, according to now New York state, you can get an abortion in the seventh month of pregnancy, the eighth month of pregnancy, and the ninth month of pregnancy. That would be called infanticide. Viable lives can now be destroyed with the seal of the New York legislature putting their seal of approval?   This is frankly, I don't care what your position on abortion is, you know, for the first three months, viability, when you think life begins. But these are fetuses that can live on their own. It is grotesque, it is gruesome, it is extreme.  And then there's California. Senator Kamala Harris -- she just kicked off her 2020 campaign this weekend, but she laid the groundwork months ago when she was comparing ICE to the Ku Klux Klan. You may remember this.",

Now, it's pretty clear Senator Harris is trying to placate this radical socialist base, which is not going to be good for the country. Oh, Obama, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty. Takes on more debt than every other president before him combined. So, make no mistake. Lofty, big government policies -- they come with a price. Now, for example, look of the people of Venezuela. They're paying that price.  Once upon a time, remember, they were promised universal health care, education, pretty much everything. Instead, what did he do? It ended up in death, destruction, and chaos. We now have 3 million Venezuelans fleeing their country because of poverty and hunger. Hyperinflation, 80,000 percent. Home to the world's largest oil reserves, could be one of the richest countries, Venezuela, the poster child for socialism's failures. It's never worked. Food shortages, lack of public services, skyrocketing crime rate. Full-blown health care crisis. For example, 2016 piece, \"New York Times\" revealing gruesome details like the high rate of deaths for newborns and new mothers. Basic supplies like gloves vanishing, patients having to retreat to the black market to get cancer drugs even and save their lives.  And here's what's more scary. This universal health care nightmare, championed by the late Hugo Chavez, sounds eerily similar to the plans of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Total government control, massive spending, more red tape, raising your taxes. By the way, how did Obama, keep your doctor plan and pay less, work out?  Of course, socialists are never eager to talk about the costs, the real costs. Take a look.",

      "utterance": "And this is a Fox News alert. We are now monitoring a very serious situation tonight out of Houston. Multiple police officers were shot while serving a narcotics warrant. The suspect is believed to be dead. We're going to keep you posted as this horrific story continues to unfold. We start tonight, though, with \"Hannity Watch\" on the deep state and turn to Robert Mueller's ongoing witch hunt. Now, in the early morning hours, January 25th, 17 vehicles including two armored tactical trucks rolled into Roger Stone's Fort Lauderdale neighborhood. Two dozen heavily armed federal agents dressed in SWAT gear surrounding his home, drawing their weapons in this predawn raid pounding on his door, and taking Stone into custody. While the CNN cameras are there to watch, of course. He's not charged with a violent crime. He's not a drug kingpin. He's not a ruthless gangster mafia guy. This isn't El Chapo. Instead, Stone has been indicted on several, again, processing violations, including lying to Congress. And once again, nothing to do with Russia. And because Roger Stone is not a risk to society, oh, he was let out immediately on bail, on his own recognizance, right here on this program he will join us tonight in minutes. We'll talk about these tactics which are now all too common. The question remains, why this show of force? After all, he would have happily turned himself in. Of course, we've seen this with Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen. It is an outrageous abuse of power. Where is FBI Director Wray on this? So this is the new standard? SWAT teams, 27 people, predawn raids, CNN cameras, tactical armored vehicles, somebody charged with lying? And as it turns out, this only applies to those associated with President Trump. Now, take, for example, former Obama A.G. Eric Holder. Where is his FBI raid? He has a long history of lying, including some surrounding a blatant cover-up, oh, the Fast and Furious scandal. What about the Obama officials who lied to Congress about the plan to give Iran access to U.S. banks as an incentive to sign off on that horrible nuclear deal? Are their houses going to be surrounded? What about former IRS official Lois Lerner lying about her department's financial persecution of Tea Party groups? Federal agents going to drag her out in cuffs? What about comrade John Brennan? He lied before Congress on multiple occasions about Hillary's bought and paid for dirty dossier. Or James Clapper's perjury before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the NSA?  Where's that predawn raid? And we can't forget Hillary. She has the biggest slam dunk case of obstruction of justice violating the Espionage Act we've ever seen. Are they going to have a predawn raid, guns blazing raid for Hillary Clinton? Now, the danger here, this is a two tiered system of justice. That's what's shocking. It's also dangerous. It should disgust every American to their core because it doesn't matter where you stand politically, it's a clear and present danger to what is our great Democratic republic. These are the actions of a banana republic. Rank and file members, law enforcement -- they are working hard every day to keep this country safe.  Those rank and file officers and field agents, they have no say in any of this. Instead, we have a few very powerful, top echelon bureaucrats in Washington working equally hard to destroy the Trump administration, invalidate the 2016 election, protect their friends from ever being held accountable, like Hillary, exoneration before investigation, the phony dossier. Lying to FISA court judges and committing fraud. Now, with that said, the witch hunt is now, according to reports, in its final days. According to the new acting A.G., Matthew Whitaker, the investigation was close to being completed. Watch this. Oh, apparently not."

      "speaker": "MATTHEW WHITAKER, ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Right now, the investigation is, I think, close to being completed and I hope that we can get the report from Director Mueller as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. So, here we are, 621 days, the witch hunt now may be almost over. So far, zero evidence of any collusion. And. meanwhile, the president of the United States, he does have important work to do -- namely, the safety and security of the American people. Now, let not your hearts be troubled. This is a president who keeps his promises. So, I have a couple of questions for my conservative friends that are mad at the president for allowing Congress three weeks to do their job, make a deal on immigration, and open the government in the interim. Here's the question. Do you believe for one second, do you really believe the president has stopped his full-on fight over the border wall that he has promised? Has he not shown he's a tenacious fighter when it comes to keeping his promises? I've said this before. In my opinion, I don't care where the money comes from. I don't care how they get it as long as they build the wall to keep us safe. So, don't let what is what I believe a shift in strategy fool you because I don't have any doubt that the president is going to fight as hard, if not harder, for the money for the wall, because in this case, his fight is principled. Think about this. The president, he's talking about safety and security, even life and death of the American people. He talks about stopping drugs and cartels and gangs, human and drug trafficking. Where were Chuck and Nancy? What were they fighting for? They wouldn't even talk to the president, wouldn't sit down. They abandoned the process furloughed workers, DACA kids, Dreamers, the very things they have said over and over and over, are so important to them, that the president offered to them, just to cater to the radical and extreme hate-Trump base of theirs? The only question now on Democrats, are they willing to make a deal or not?  Are they going to let the left run that party? Because in three weeks, Democrats can come to the table, work out a compromise that gets them the things they say they wanted. Remember, Obama was president, they sounded like Trump on the wall. If Democrats are unwilling to fund the border security, the president can and the president should declare a national emergency. He will build the wall with billions of dollars in funds that he allocates, probably going to take a court fight. Democrats will go liberal judge shopping in the Ninth Circuit. But as commander in chief, I believe on the law and the Constitution, this president's going to win this battle in the courts. And if not, he's not going to stop. He'll move to plan C. So, what we should be doing is putting aside political differences, working together to keep the American people safe, and stopping the 90 percent of heroin from coming across our southern border, or fentanyl, which is killing people every day. That's why a group of border patrol wives have invited Speaker Pelosi to McAllen, Texas, so she could witness the effects of our porous border firsthand herself. Now, remember, she rejected a meeting with Angel Moms and Dads. While she was in her office, they were outside her office.  Wouldn't meet with them. And, frankly, any future crimes -- think about this -- resulting from open borders, the Democratic Party will now own. They will be partly responsible. And sadly, it's unlikely that Pelosi will accept the invitation. By the way, we have a new 12,000-persons- strong caravan, what if they come to an area that isn't secure? Both sides are at risk. She doesn't seem to care. To Democrats, anyone affected by the shutdown or our flawed immigration system, even Angel Moms and Dads are just pawns in what is their political game. The Democrats think their resistance to border security somehow harms the president politically, well, they better start playing chess, because as more crime happens, as more drugs come into this country, they will get the blame they rightly deserve. Look at this new \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC poll. It shows the president support remained steady throughout the shutdown. And according to other polling, the president's approval rating remains high in Democratically- held districts that he won in 2016. Also keep in h mind, as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich pointed out, in January of 1983, Ronald Reagan had a 35 percent approval rating.  Two years later, he swept 49 states and was overwhelmingly reelected -- all because he kept his promises, fought for the American people, the economy turned around, fought against the far left detractors. Sound familiar? And we can't predict 2020. We don't know what we'll be debating in two years, but it brings us to our \"Hannity Watch\" on the radical crop of 2020 Democratic hopefuls. Unlike 2018, this year's going to be awesome. 2018, they were hiding their positions. 2020, they're going to all try to out- radical each other. Get ready, because every Democrat who wants to run for president is about to take that hard turn to appease what is now the radical, extreme socialist Democratic Party base. Take, for example, possible contender Andrew Cuomo. Now, honest people can have a difference as to when life begins. He just celebrated a bill in New York state making late-term abortion legal. Now, according to now New York state, you can get an abortion in the seventh month of pregnancy, the eighth month of pregnancy, and the ninth month of pregnancy. That would be called infanticide. Viable lives can now be destroyed with the seal of the New York legislature putting their seal of approval? This is frankly, I don't care what your position on abortion is, you know, for the first three months, viability, when you think life begins. But these are fetuses that can live on their own. It is grotesque, it is gruesome, it is extreme. And then there's California. Senator Kamala Harris -- she just kicked off her 2020 campaign this weekend, but she laid the groundwork months ago when she was comparing ICE to the Ku Klux Klan. You may remember this."

Now, it's pretty clear Senator Harris is trying to placate this radical socialist base, which is not going to be good for the country. Oh, Obama, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, 8 million more in poverty. Takes on more debt than every other president before him combined. So, make no mistake. Lofty, big government policies -- they come with a price. Now, for example, look of the people of Venezuela. They're paying that price. Once upon a time, remember, they were promised universal health care, education, pretty much everything. Instead, what did he do? It ended up in death, destruction, and chaos. We now have 3 million Venezuelans fleeing their country because of poverty and hunger. Hyperinflation, 80,000 percent. Home to the world's largest oil reserves, could be one of the richest countries, Venezuela, the poster child for socialism's failures. It's never worked. Food shortages, lack of public services, skyrocketing crime rate. Full-blown health care crisis. For example, 2016 piece, \"New York Times\" revealing gruesome details like the high rate of deaths for newborns and new mothers. Basic supplies like gloves vanishing, patients having to retreat to the black market to get cancer drugs even and save their lives. And here's what's more scary. This universal health care nightmare, championed by the late Hugo Chavez, sounds eerily similar to the plans of Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Total government control, massive spending, more red tape, raising your taxes. By the way, how did Obama, keep your doctor plan and pay less, work out?  Of course, socialists are never eager to talk about the costs, the real costs. Take a look."

And Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, well, since we know you're watching because you like to take pictures and tweet us out, what's the difference between what you're proposing and what so many other socialist countries have proposed? How will a government take over private medicine? How is it going to be different here? How great do you think Obamacare worked out? Now, how do you guarantee patients quality of care and a system devoid of any competition, or will you start being honest with the American people and admit this isn't about making health care better. This is about government control? Your power, you want the government to have more and more control of people's lives, health care, all while it's our bank accounts. Oh, yes, you don't like the Second Amendment. You don't like the freedom that America offers and has made us different and has created a standard of living that is the envy of the world.

She's virtually deaf without her hearing aids. She hadn't awoken. I was afraid that they would think she wasn't complying with an order and shoot her. You know, and the idea that they had to do this because they were worried that I would tamper or destroy evidence is absurd. I've been under investigation for two years.

You did not conspire to steal anything. And the Pentagon Papers case, my reading of it is very clear.

Any other narrative about what happened there is false and there was no controversy about my tweet for six weeks. Until it is alleged that Stone was foreshadowing Podesta's e-mails being stolen.
