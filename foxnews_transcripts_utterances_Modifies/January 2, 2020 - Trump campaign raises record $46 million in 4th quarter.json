      "utterance": "Tension is growing between the U.S. And Iran after Iranian-backed militants tried to storm the American embassy in Baghdad. The attack ending when the militia left the scene after just two days. The Trump administration responding by sending hundreds of troops to the area, but media coverage of what happened is getting major backlash. Some outlets slamming the president and even trying to label the incident as Trump's Benghazi. Here's a look at some of the coverage."

The New York Times is also facing similar criticism for describing the attackers as mourners. A former Benghazi team member is blasting the Benghazi comparisons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "John Tiegan",
      "utterance": "It's not really similar at all. It wasn't another Benghazi. It's not Trump's Benghazi. To me, it wasn't even close to Benghazi. I kind of laughed when some said, \"Oh this is Trump's Benghazi.\" No, it's not, because all -- again, all the non-essential personnel were evacuated. There's no ambassador there to be killed like they'd left the ambassador in Benghazi."

      "utterance": "At all. And Tig said it well. But Tanto also says there is a difference between a riot -- he was also there -- and a coordinated attack. And the response was also different. There were no lives lost. The fact is that President Trump immediately, and the Defense Department, the Secretary of State, all stepped in to make sure that there were people there, marines are already there, people are being shifted, and nobody died. I just think this shows you how far the media is willing to go to give cover to Democrats. And you think when it comes to national security, foreign policy, although we may have some differences when it comes to attack, we should be unified on it. And the fact that they are carrying the water, the Democratic Party, is pretty shady."

      "speaker": "Dana Perino",
      "utterance": "Marie, you know, probably, more about this attack than anybody here. So, how do you -- what do you think about attempts to compare this? I mean, one of the things that happened in Benghazi was the video maker got arrested and basically, they did a perp walk of him saying that the video sparked the attack when that -- we of course, we know that wasn't true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marie Harf",
      "utterance": "They're very different situations. The compound in Baghdad is incredibly well-fortified. It's very well-protected. Obviously, the Benghazi outpost was in the front lines of an ongoing civil war. An actual better comparison to Benghazi, I think it was the attack in Niger, early in the Trump administration where four American service members were killed in a very botched operation. I don't think the comparison is good here. Some of the people we played, though, in those clips weren't talking about Benghazi. They were talking about what President Trump's strategy is vis-a-vis Iran and whether he has one, quite frankly. And I think my concerns here aren't about some Benghazi comparison. It's about the fact that much of what the Trump administration has done has emboldened the hardliners in Iran. The IRGC today feels like they can encourage their militias in places like Iraq and Syria to do this. And we have to figure out how we're going to respond. You know, the Israelis have taken a lot of kinetic action against Shiite militias backed by Iran in places like Iraq and Syria. But they do it much more quietly because they're trying to send a message, but not provoke some of the outrage that you've seen on the ground, which unfortunately can put our people in harm's way. Thankfully, we've evacuated the embassy, but a result of that is that we don't have people on the ground doing American diplomacy --"

Real protests. And I -- this what you see on social media, you see people on Twitter saying, I'm one of the real protesters. I've been protesting this government because they are very angry in Iraq about -- they want reforms. Yes. And so, Iranians have come in and piggybacked on those protests. And the media needs to differentiate, and they're not doing their job and saying that they're very different --"

If you've been working this during the holidays and you're like me, you're like, is it Friday? Is it Monday? I haven't really no idea. And take a listen to President Trump, who -- he obviously knows what day is."

      "utterance": "The Marines came in. We had some great warriors come in and do a fantastic job, and they were there instantaneously, as soon as we heard. I used the word immediately. They came immediately and it's in great shape. As you know, this will not be a Benghazi. Benghazi should never have happened. This will never, ever be in Benghazi."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marie Harf",
      "utterance": "Look, it's not a comparable comparison for it on any level. We have made drastic efforts not to provoke Iranian- backed militias as we've been fighting ISIS this entire time. And the bottom line is that their continued aggression against bases could not be tolerated. So, I agree with you that there's a bit of nebulous-ness in strategy in the past couple years. But the bottom line is we've taken that hardline stance with a very articulable position that will serve us well in the long-term. And I think that, you know, the Iraqi government, obviously, they're in a difficult position. But regardless, they need to take a stance. They need to protect our embassy. And you know, to your point about the media, you know, their headline today -- not to jump issues, but about the Uyghur murder right now in China. They said as it detains parents, China weans children from Islam. So, we are no stranger, they are no stranger to the fact that all of their headlines are absolutely ludicrous in these times of -- what we deserve would be political specificity. And final point, my friend actually headed out to Baghdad today on behalf of the U.S. government. He said as he was checking in -- he flew commercial. And the woman who checked him in at the airline counter was like, Baghdad, like, are you aware of what's going on right now? And he goes, \"More than the average bear.\"."

      "speaker": "Marie Harf",
      "utterance": "Yes, they are. They're their bad guys. The Iraqis, as as Emily said, are in a tough position because they want this place to be safe. They want our embassy to be safe. They also see these airstrikes, at some level, as an imposition on their sovereignty. And so, they're trying to play this game where they're trying not to allow, you know, people to come on to their airspace and to do these things. But they also don't like these Iranian-backed militias. They're trying to play this middle space here. And that's really hard for the Iraqis, a government we want to be strong going forward."

      "speaker": "Dana Perino",

There's a great movie about that called 13 Hours. Catch it over the weekend because it's only Thursday. All right. President Trump getting a big boost for 2020 while Democrats continue to take aim at each other. We're going to tell you about it next."

The president's campaign with a massive cash haul, raising almost $50 million in the last quarter. It also has over $100 million on hand. The Trump campaign crediting the Democrats impeachment push for the huge numbers. On the other side of the aisle, Bernie Sanders is surging. The socialist raised over $34 million while Joe Biden struggles to keep up. This all happening while Democrat in-fighting intensifies. Andrew Yang going after Biden for saying, \"Coal miners should learn to code.\" Take a look."

And they get mad if anybody orders office supplies from Amazon because Amazon is like this evil corporate giant. I think the thing is President Trump will have an advantage over Democrats no matter what. He's the incumbent."

      "utterance": "No. I think what's interesting is that we all learned the lesson in 2016 that having the most money doesn't make you a winner. Hillary Clinton had a lot more money than Donald Trump. It's about a lot of different things. So, money doesn't equal victory, right? Joe Biden is competitive with these numbers. What's interesting, a couple of points. First, Elizabeth Warren, really tanking. I mean, she had a surge. She was going up and up in the polls and she has just flatlined."

But the resurgence of Bernie Sanders, as Dana said, he had a heart attack, a literal heart attack on the campaign trail. But if you look at how much Democrats are willing to invest in this cycle, if you add up all of these numbers, whoever the nominee is, is going to be very well funded. Democrats are focused. They're willing to spend, not just for the presidential, for the Senate races, for the House. They're very invested in this cycle overall."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Emily Compagno",
      "utterance": "I think so, absolutely. A predictable one because, as there has been that civil war in the Democratic Party of how to approach impeachment and how to approach Trump, all that did was galvanize the other side of the equation who are rallying in support, clearly, as the donations indicate. I think it's also interesting that -- okay. So, we just got our quarter four numbers. In quarter one, two of the three highest fundraising Democratic candidates are no longer in the race --"

Every run is obviously a vanity project, but his, like, off the charts, way more so. And this is not the last we've heard from him, obviously. And I think that the New York Times in 2014 said it best, which is basically that ever since he was the first Latino to give the keynote speaking address at the DNC convention that he and his twin brother have been seeking ways to stay on the national stage, to stay on the national radar, and they will continue to do so."

Obviously, the president's been able to fundraise off that.\" And so, it's been very effective for him for, you know, as far as money goes. He's also getting tons of small donors. I don't know the numbers on the Democrats, though, because that's what I want to see. Who's getting the small donors? I'm assuming it's Bernie."

De Blasio tweeting, “Jacking up your prices on people trying to celebrate the holidays, classy Domino's.” He also claims the chain exploited customers and suggests visiting other local pizzeria. A large Domino's pie usually goes for around 15 dollars and the pizza chain is now firing back, saying those locally owned stores provide jobs to thousands of his constituents. Now, first of all, I think this is indefensible, especially because everyone knows, apparently, except for the mayor, that, yes, these represent franchise franchises they are all locally owned, they're all local employees, and also, maybe he hasn't gone to Times Square during a ball drop, but it is so packed and that's economics when you're dealing with to a time when you're dealing with delivering food to a ton of people in a confined space in a constrained amount of time that's called supply and demand.

      "speaker": "Emily Compagno",

We have -- it's the 30th states, or is among 30 states that have legalized it for medicinal purposes, which kind of dovetails into your question to Dana. I agree with Dana. And, I think, moving forward, you can say that this is a win for citizens, sure, and that it's reflecting a trend that polling has indicated. That being said, a) the federal government has not caught up so, frankly, we are all still confused, and legislatively we are still confused. And secondly, remember where this is coming from. It's all about the government see a dollar that you have is a dollar of lost income to them, to them. So, this is all about the amount that the share that they can recoup each state. That's also why, for example, out-of-state residents there in Illinois, what they are able to purchase is like half the quantity that in-state residents can. So, there's just a lot of, I think, additional things that stem from this that it helps to be knowledgeable about. And to your point about the information, I think we place a lot of stock in things like FDA approval and the federal government's attachment to things, where there's a whole host of other sources that are probably far more cutting edge and reliable that would help to educate citizens so they had less fear and worry about it becoming legalized."

Judges in New York no longer be setting money bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent offenses, including many drug offenses of the kind we were just talking about. Under the new law, thousands of people currently in jail awaiting trial on bail will be released. You know, Emily, there's been a big debate in this country about whether cash bail is fair or not. You shouldn't be able to get yourself out on bail only if you're rich. Right? Our criminal justice system is supposed to treat everyone equally. What do you make of this new law?"

      "speaker": "Emily Compagno",
      "utterance": "I think it is an example of a poor solution to a definable problem. And I believe in this state in particular, it's a horrible solution. Here's why. The two issues in this state in particular are, one, that it removed judges' discretion to make that call, whether that person is injurious or potentially -- basically for public safety, that they can take that away. And secondly, it's the classification system of violent felonies. So, everyone accepts this aid, oh, well but it doesn't apply to violent felonies. Well, guess what's not a violent felony? A sex crime against a child. A home invasion burglary. Stalking. A lot of other things that are pretty violent to me. So, I think this particular law is absolutely poorly executed. And even before January 1st, we had 25,000 defendants released because the judges were like, well, it's coming around the corner. So, might as well."

And when it comes to bills, it is true that a lot of poor people can't afford it. But I also believe that people should only be in prison if their a risk to society. And so, this has become a money-making business, just like when we were just talking about marijuana a while ago. Part of the reason why this hasn't been repealed and people can just buy it is because of the pharmaceutical companies, and that they give so much money to politicians and stuff. And so, we've got to take money out of this stuff. We also have to take money out of the criminal justice system. When it comes to civil asset forfeiture when you have --"
