I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\" A story of so-called collusion between top Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer that has the President's critics gleeful tonight, so is it? Let's hit the pause button as Jonathan Turley says there is \"no clear criminal act in such a meeting.\" He joins us in just a moment with his legal opinion out of all this, but first, let's the story from Trace Gallagher in our West Coast Newsroom tonight.

We found eight examples over the past year where members of the Trump campaign or Trump administration flatly denied having any contact with Russians trying to meddle in the election, including Donald Trump Jr., telling the New York Times in March quoting, \"Did I meet with people that were Russian? I'm sure I did, but none that were set up, none that I can think of at the moment, and certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way.\" But now we know that in June of 2016, Trump Jr., Representing the campaign, did have a meeting set up with Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.  On Saturday, Trump Jr. said the meeting dealt primarily with primarily the program about the adoption of Russian children. On Sunday, he amended his statement saying the Russian lawyer was supposed to have proof that Russia was donating to the Democratic National Committee and supporting Hillary Clinton, but her information turned out to be vague and ambiguous. Today, Trump Jr. said there was no inconsistency in his statement, tweeting: \"Obviously, I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent. Went nowhere but had to listen.\" In fact, Trump supporters say it is routine for political campaigns to gather opposition research. Here's Deputy Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.",

Though, it's worth noting the Russian lawyer who met with Trump Jr. is a big advocate of overturning the Magnitsky Act, which bans Russian children from being adopted by American families. Martha.",

You just don't find these ambiguous crimes. Some people have said this could be treason. For the love of God, treason is defined in the constitution. This is not treason. Other people have said, this could be a Logan Act violation. Well, Logan Act has been used once in 200 years and is spatially unconstitutional. One said, well, if you take things of tangible value under the campaign laws and treat information like that, then maybe you have a campaign contribution violation. Well, yes, but we haven't seen that done. You could also treat it like a Panda and say it's an endangered species violation. But courts haven't done that. So, I think that people need to take a breath. You know, this was a meeting where someone said they had evidence of a possible crime by the opponent of the Trump campaign. They met with this person. I think a lot of people in the city view that as naive. I think a lot of people say, my God, why didn't you use a surrogate, which is how it's done in Washington. But that itself is not a crime.",

People like the Clintons are notorious for using surrogates, people like David Brock, who's rather notorious. But a lot of other people serve as surrogates or buffers to campaigns. It's very rare that you see something like this happened, but the fact that they're high ranking, the fact that they met with his lawyer doesn't constitute a crime unless we start to broaden the definition of criminal conduct. What I've said to a lot of my friends who do legal analysis is, is this really the world you want to live in where we broaden the definition of crime so far that most any conversation could be a criminal act? That's a very dangerous world to live in. But more importantly, if the information is now a thing of tangible value under federal campaign laws, then the Clinton campaign could be charged with the same type of offense, and a wide variety of other campaigns could be charged. There's a point in which you have to show some element of maturity and stand back and tell people, look, this is worthy of investigation, but you shouldn't suggest that this is a clear evidence of the criminal act.",

But the fact that you received information from a foreign source is not itself any type of crime unless you start to radically broaden campaign finance roles. The fact is campaigns and aides meet with foreign leaders and nationals all time. They share information about trade and other issues. Sometimes they share information that runs against their opponent, in the campaign. That is fairly routine. Now, what is not routine is to have high-ranking people like this meet with someone without knowing the nature of the meeting. That was not a smart move to make, but it doesn't make it a crime. And so, people have to be very careful. If this is a crime that a wide array of contacts that routinely occurs between a politician and foreign nationals would also be a crime.

Welcome to all of you. Ari, let me start with you. What's your take on this, and also, sub-question here, the forms that weren't filled out?

Well, I don't think team Trump has held this very well. All the issues relating to Russia they keep having to correct their forms, they keep having to remember things that they previously forgot. The best course is always when you get hit with something like this, disclose it all voluntarily upfront yourself. Frame it yourself, so your critics can't misframe it and get it out there. That's number one; they haven't done that. Number two, you know, people ought to be precise in their language about what collusion means. There's a huge difference between having a meeting with a foreign official to ascertain if there is a fact that you can use the campaign. That is entirely different than working with a foreign nation to track a stolen material -- in this case, the emails from the DNC and from John Podesta. That would be a very troubled collision. Receiving the fact that matter from a foreign official, I don't that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, and that didn't even take place here.",

I actually think that is less important than what we have established with this meeting. Donald Trump himself, Mike Pence himself said that none of his campaign officials met with Russian officials regarding campaign activities, and that just turned out not to be true. It's not only not true with Donald Trump Jr., there are five other Senior Trump Officials who also have met with Russian officials and have either lied about it or have conveniently forgotten about it. And so, what I think that is the most significant thing that we have from this particular meeting is that we have the first public evidence that the Trump campaign senior officials, three of them, not only met with a Russian official with the connection with the Kremlin but try to coordinate their efforts in order to influence the election and swing it their way.

You know, there are all of these allegations that there was collusion between the Trump campaign in Russia, and of course, no concrete evidence that it has happened, but there have been so many things that have been done that feel like a cover-up really unnecessarily. I think Ari was right, that this drip, drip, drip, has not served the Trump administration well. And what it's done has put a lot of Trump administration officials who may well be trying to do the right thing in a tough position.  You have, for instance, Vice President Pence who was told, look, none of these folks have had meetings with the Russians. You can go out, put your credibility on the line and say this is nothing, and that's the reason why Mike Flynn got shown the door, not just because he forgot that he had some conversations with some Russians but because he misrepresented it to people inside the administration. Now, nobody's going to be showing Donald Trump Jr. the door. He's got a pretty close relationship with the President, of course. But it does put a lot of these administration officials in a tough position when they come out, they say one thing categorically, and then a couple of days, weeks, and months later, new information contradicts that.",

And it seems Representatives on Capitol Hill are really not any closer to passing their promised health care reform than they were last week. So, here is my story on this. When one party wins control of Congress and the White House, they have a unique opportunity. During President Obama's time in office, the GOP railed on Obamacare, they said it was a disaster; terrible for patients and bad for businesses. Both, in fact, agree with them. And much the surprise of Republicans apparently, elected them and the President, to among other things to do away with it. Now, imagine this in your own life as a company where you work. That you keep complaining the boss that if only he would let you, you could fix the company and it would be so much better if he would only give you a shot. So, one day the boss says, you're on, let's see what you got. And you say, well, I didn't think you would ever ask; see my team is not quite sure, and it's actually much more complicated than anybody thought. You know what, faster than the limo could pull up in front of Trump Tower, you would be headed home with your suitcase on wheels and you would have a zero approval rating at your company. Or kind of like congress at 17 percent. So with 68 workdays in the summer for the rest of America, the senate will be in session for 35 of those as of now. There's talk that they might stick around. So the president is proving to be a rather patient boss and has given his party a nearly seven month extension on a project that could have been worked on and hammered out for six years. So likely, the boss, which is actually the American people in this case, will have little patience when they get their chance to weigh in on this. And all those elected in a sweep in November, could very well get swept out the door for congressional malpractice, and who could blame the voters because that's what the people who voted for them wanted to happen. So is that correct? Let's bring in Anthony Scaramucci, senior vice president and chief strategist officer at the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and a former Trump transition team executive committee member.",

His decision resulted in an interview with Secretary Mattis who called him back being from Washington state as well. Teddy asked about the world, the military, and the future of our conflicts. And at the end he asked the defense secretary his advice to graduating seniors. Here's what the very thoughtful former history teacher, James Mattis, said, just look for ways to help others along the way, Teddy, and you'll never go far wrong if you're always looking to do that. There will be a lot of people who want to tell you what to think in this world, if you read a lot of history, you will thank them for their help, but you won't be governed by what someone else has told you to think, wise words from the defense secretary.

I'm sure I did, but none that were set up, none that I can think of at the moment, and certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way.\" But now we know that in June of 2016, Trump Jr., Representing the campaign, did have a meeting set up with Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya."

But critics say the meeting between Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer goes to the very heart of the Russian collusion argument, proving that some in the Trump campaign was willing to accept Russian help. Though, it's worth noting the Russian lawyer who met with Trump Jr. is a big advocate of overturning the Magnitsky Act, which bans Russian children from being adopted by American families. Martha."

      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's odd. It's like we have this giant work check test where everyone sees it in plots and sees crimes everywhere. I mean, the criminal code is defined elements to it. You just don't find these ambiguous crimes. Some people have said this could be treason. For the love of God, treason is defined in the constitution. This is not treason. Other people have said, this could be a Logan Act violation. Well, Logan Act has been used once in 200 years and is spatially unconstitutional. One said, well, if you take things of tangible value under the campaign laws and treat information like that, then maybe you have a campaign contribution violation. Well, yes, but we haven't seen that done. You could also treat it like a Panda and say it's an endangered species violation. But courts haven't done that. So, I think that people need to take a breath. You know, this was a meeting where someone said they had evidence of a possible crime by the opponent of the Trump campaign. They met with this person. I think a lot of people in the city view that as naive. I think a lot of people say, my God, why didn't you use a surrogate, which is how it's done in Washington. But that itself is not a crime."

This is a very high-level meeting. This is Paul Manafort, the campaign manager; Jared Kushner, very close advisor to the President and his son-in-law; and his son, Donald Trump Jr. So, these were big guns at this meeting, and they claim that they didn't know why they were even there. That, you know, they had just been asked to join in this meeting. Do you buy that? And is there any significance to who was there?"

      "speaker": "TURLEY",

People like the Clintons are notorious for using surrogates, people like David Brock, who's rather notorious. But a lot of other people serve as surrogates or buffers to campaigns. It's very rare that you see something like this happened, but the fact that they're high ranking, the fact that they met with his lawyer doesn't constitute a crime unless we start to broaden the definition of criminal conduct. What I've said to a lot of my friends who do legal analysis is, is this really the world you want to live in where we broaden the definition of crime so far that most any conversation could be a criminal act? That's a very dangerous world to live in. But more importantly, if the information is now a thing of tangible value under federal campaign laws, then the Clinton campaign could be charged with the same type of offense, and a wide variety of other campaigns could be charged. There's a point in which you have to show some element of maturity and stand back and tell people, look, this is worthy of investigation, but you shouldn't suggest that this is a clear evidence of the criminal act."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "No, it's only if -- certainly if would get more information, there could be some wire that's tripped. But the fact that you received information from a foreign source is not itself any type of crime unless you start to radically broaden campaign finance roles. The fact is campaigns and aides meet with foreign leaders and nationals all time. They share information about trade and other issues. Sometimes they share information that runs against their opponent, in the campaign. That is fairly routine. Now, what is not routine is to have high-ranking people like this meet with someone without knowing the nature of the meeting. That was not a smart move to make, but it doesn't make it a crime. And so, people have to be very careful. If this is a crime that a wide array of contacts that routinely occurs between a politician and foreign nationals would also be a crime. And then you raise serious free speech, and associational concerns over the constitution."

Welcome to all of you. Ari, let me start with you. What's your take on this, and also, sub-question here, the forms that weren't filled out?

Well, I don't think team Trump has held this very well. All the issues relating to Russia they keep having to correct their forms, they keep having to remember things that they previously forgot. The best course is always when you get hit with something like this, disclose it all voluntarily upfront yourself. Frame it yourself, so your critics can't misframe it and get it out there. That's number one; they haven't done that. Number two, you know, people ought to be precise in their language about what collusion means. There's a huge difference between having a meeting with a foreign official to ascertain if there is a fact that you can use the campaign. That is entirely different than working with a foreign nation to track a stolen material -- in this case, the emails from the DNC and from John Podesta. That would be a very troubled collision. Receiving the fact that matter from a foreign official, I don't that there's anything necessarily wrong with that, and that didn't even take place here."

      "utterance": "Well, look -- I mean, I don't think it's a smoking gun, and I don't know whether the act itself is criminal or not. I actually think that is less important than what we have established with this meeting. Donald Trump himself, Mike Pence himself said that none of his campaign officials met with Russian officials regarding campaign activities, and that just turned out not to be true. It's not only not true with Donald Trump Jr., there are five other Senior Trump Officials who also have met with Russian officials and have either lied about it or have conveniently forgotten about it. And so, what I think that is the most significant thing that we have from this particular meeting is that we have the first public evidence that the Trump campaign senior officials, three of them, not only met with a Russian official with the connection with the Kremlin but try to coordinate their efforts in order to influence the election and swing it their way. And that's a pretty significant development."

You know, there are all of these allegations that there was collusion between the Trump campaign in Russia, and of course, no concrete evidence that it has happened, but there have been so many things that have been done that feel like a cover-up really unnecessarily. I think Ari was right, that this drip, drip, drip, has not served the Trump administration well. And what it's done has put a lot of Trump administration officials who may well be trying to do the right thing in a tough position. You have, for instance, Vice President Pence who was told, look, none of these folks have had meetings with the Russians. You can go out, put your credibility on the line and say this is nothing, and that's the reason why Mike Flynn got shown the door, not just because he forgot that he had some conversations with some Russians but because he misrepresented it to people inside the administration. Now, nobody's going to be showing Donald Trump Jr. the door. He's got a pretty close relationship with the President, of course. But it does put a lot of these administration officials in a tough position when they come out, they say one thing categorically, and then a couple of days, weeks, and months later, new information contradicts that."

That would have been like me being Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, being in a top secret briefing taking notes, and then leaving the meeting and handing them to my friend and say give this to the media, share it with the media, and he look at it and say I guess it's not classified. The reason it's not classified is the classifiers never -- probably never saw the document. This is getting more and more bizarre.

      "utterance": "So, I'm just back from vacation and Congress is also just back from vacation. And it seems Representatives on Capitol Hill are really not any closer to passing their promised health care reform than they were last week. So, here is my story on this. When one party wins control of Congress and the White House, they have a unique opportunity. During President Obama's time in office, the GOP railed on Obamacare, they said it was a disaster; terrible for patients and bad for businesses. Both, in fact, agree with them. And much the surprise of Republicans apparently, elected them and the President, to among other things to do away with it. Now, imagine this in your own life as a company where you work. That you keep complaining the boss that if only he would let you, you could fix the company and it would be so much better if he would only give you a shot. So, one day the boss says, you're on, let's see what you got. And you say, well, I didn't think you would ever ask; see my team is not quite sure, and it's actually much more complicated than anybody thought. You know what, faster than the limo could pull up in front of Trump Tower, you would be headed home with your suitcase on wheels and you would have a zero approval rating at your company. Or kind of like congress at 17 percent. So with 68 workdays in the summer for the rest of America, the senate will be in session for 35 of those as of now. There's talk that they might stick around. So the president is proving to be a rather patient boss and has given his party a nearly seven month extension on a project that could have been worked on and hammered out for six years. So likely, the boss, which is actually the American people in this case, will have little patience when they get their chance to weigh in on this. And all those elected in a sweep in November, could very well get swept out the door for congressional malpractice, and who could blame the voters because that's what the people who voted for them wanted to happen. So is that correct? Let's bring in Anthony Scaramucci, senior vice president and chief strategist officer at the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and a former Trump transition team executive committee member."

And I think my prediction is the president will get this done. He'll get some tax reform done. And then I think he's going to try to reach out to the other side and be the president for everybody.

Thirty four year-old, Ikaika Kang, was stationed at Schofield Barracks in Honolulu, charges claim that he swore allegiance to ISIS, attended to provide the military document to the terror group, and attempted to provide training to them as well. More on that as we get it. And coincidentally, a victory in the fight against ISIS, the Iraqi prime minister today declaring victory in Mosul over the terror group. This is a very big deal. In a written statement earlier, President Trump offered his congratulations stating that the victory in Mosul signals that the days of ISIS in Iraq and Syria are numbered."

Look, this isn't about western values. Western values is capitalism. Capitalism has done more to combat poverty than any other ideology ever. It is something we should celebrate. And American should be particularly proud when you look at how much money we give to international organizations and to the U.N. We give a quarter for peacekeeping, a quarter of the budget. We give a quarter of the U.N. assessed budget. That doesn't include world food program and UNICEF funding which we are 50 percent plus in feeding the world and being on the ground when there is a crisis. Americans are generous. We should be proud. And we are able to do that because of capitalism and our western values."

I mean, we're a beacon of hope in that way, even though I think that we've had some strain to society in the past few decades, certainly in terms of freedom of religion. But I found it astounding. I found it surprising. And it is not as if I'm someone who's not looking for subtext in Donald Trump's speech."

I also think it has a lot to do with what happened after that speech in the press conference, when he went after the intelligence community and how people may have perceived what he was doing with Vladimir Putin. And I think that color the whole trip for people. When I was watching the initial reaction to the actual speech, the scripted speech, it was all incredible positive. And then something shifted because Trump shifted himself, when he went off script and he was doing one of his press conferences, and he had an ax to grind with CNN and with the intel community. But I totally agree with you. I didn't see anything wrong in there."

They have talked about a lot of issues with regards to -- and Africa for women, and climate change, I mean, you name it. It amazes me that there's liberal outrage about her sitting there when she is one of the strongest proponents of many of the things that they really cared about."

The other countries want to know whoever sits in that seat is close to the president, speaks for the president, effective ambassadors are people that are close to the president. Not someone with differing views. When Ivanka stepped in, they know that they are dealing with somebody who has very similar views or has a lot of access to the president. That is a very valuable thing to use Ivanka in these situations."

And I think that the fact that the right is defending this when we know what would have happened if that was Chelsea Clinton sitting in that seat herself. It would have been as if the world had exploded. And people brought up, you know, the Bobby Kennedy issue, and just because of Democrats, doesn't mean that I think that it was right than many Democrats thought that it was right for him to be appointed. There is an issue and it began in the transition."

Her role is clearer now, but this began in the transition when she sat in on that first meeting with Prime Minister Abe, and she had no place in that meeting.

According to court documents, on Saturday, 29-year-old Kurdel Emmanual, barged in to a New York City police precinct and attacked a female officer, reportedly tried to grab her gun before he was arrested. But tonight, he could be anywhere because the criminal courts judge released him without bail. Dan Bongino is a former secret service agent and former NYPD officer. Dan, welcome, good to have you here tonight. It's been a very tough week for New York city police officers, and now this."

You know my nearly two decades in law enforcement and 42 years on this planet, I've never seen such a ground ball decision to keep someone on a heavy bail or, Martha, this is what's infuriating about this, the judge had another path here too. They could have pursued an involuntary commitment on a potential, you know, psychopathological problem here, and they chose neither. They just let this guy walk after an officer was assassinated and shot in cold blood in the face? I mean, what planet does this judge live on? This was an unexplainable decision by any reasonable person."

She was also the caregiver for her 80-year-old mother, who is recovering from cancer. I mean, you can't even imagine an environment where Mayor de Blasio is not around. He leaves during this process. He comes back, apparently, he visited Officer Familia's family today, but to have this add insult to injury, I mean, what do police officers in New York saying about all this?"

But these guys and these women out there, Martha, you know, they're banged up. They've got their heads on swivels. They've got to worry about being attacked by axes and cold-blooded shooters shooting at them. They've got to worry about terrorist attacks. Now you've got activist judges letting people out who literally attempted to murder a police officers. You've got black lives matter with these chants that happen, and a general climate against the cops. You know, these guys are really -- I was just up in New York, and I spoke to a port authority cop and he said morale is at an all-time low. They can't seem to catch a break ever. Thank God the general public still holds them in high esteem, but the politicians have really failed them. It's really a disgrace. The De Blasio thing, forget it.

Fisher who attends Mercer Island High School stumbled upon a leaked copy of defense secretary James Mattis' phone number. So he called and left a message. His decision resulted in an interview with Secretary Mattis who called him back being from Washington state as well. Teddy asked about the world, the military, and the future of our conflicts. And at the end he asked the defense secretary his advice to graduating seniors. Here's what the very thoughtful former history teacher, James Mattis, said, just look for ways to help others along the way, Teddy, and you'll never go far wrong if you're always looking to do that. There will be a lot of people who want to tell you what to think in this world, if you read a lot of history, you will thank them for their help, but you won't be governed by what someone else has told you to think, wise words from the defense secretary. Have a good night, everybody. Good to be back here on The Story. We'll see what your story is tomorrow at seven. Good night, everybody. Tucker is coming up next.
