But we must be honest and tell you there was another factor at play and that was ideology.  Thomas was only on the street in the first place because politicians long ago decided to side with criminals over normal people in New York. By the time he began stabbing strangers in the synagogue, Thomas had already been arrested seven times, in some cases for violent offenses like assault, resisting arrest and killing a police animal.  Now, despite all of that, the only jail time Thomas ever received was in 2013 on a drug offense, somehow he was able to kill a police animal and never go to jail.   In other words, Grafton Thomas gave us plenty of warning.  The people in charge of protecting us just decided to ignore those warnings. Bernard Kerik was once the New York City Police Commissioner and he joins us tonight.  Bernie, thanks so much for coming on.  How did this happen?",

As you just heard, New York City appears to be doing everything that it can to create more Grafton Thomas's.  A New Year's Day new bail laws went into effect in New York State.  Those aren't going to help. Pretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included.  What does it mean?  It means the crimes like burglary, stalking, petty assault, many drug offenses, even some types of arson and robbery are no longer bail crimes.   In the words of Governor Andrew Cuomo himself, the guy behind this, 90 percent of criminal defendants will now be back on the street right after being arrested. Habitual offenders will find it even easier than ever to commit more crimes immediately after getting caught.  With no bail constraining them, there is no incentive to show up for court, so of course, many will simply disappear and reoffend.  Who benefits from this?  It's hard to see who benefits from it, except the people getting out of jail.  Last week, New York resident Tiffany Harris allegedly assaulted three Orthodox Jewish women in Brooklyn.  Harris was arrested, charged and released.  On Sunday she was arrested and charged with another assault and she was released again. On New Year's Eve, guess what she did?  She got arrested for a third time. This time she is finally being kept in custody.  That's New York. But Democratic presidential candidates have made it clear that if they take power in Washington this fall, they will make the rest of the country every bit as inviting for criminals.  Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Is this what the country wants or needs?  Is this a peaceful place where law-abiding citizens feel safe and protected and ought to be, increasingly it's not. For about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class.  Eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging.  They're also demanding shorter prison sentences, fewer cops in quote, \"over policed neighborhoods,\" whatever that is, voting rights for violent criminals in prison and more.   Now, often these policies enjoy support from guilt-ridden Republicans who have forgotten who they represent.  The year 2019 just ended and so now, we can bring some data to this conversation and fully assess the human toll of these policies.  We have the numbers.  Here's what they are.  In Philadelphia, a city we've taken a close look at in the show under the direction of Soros funded DA, Larry Krasner, the city recorded 359 murders for the year.  That's the most in more than a decade. In other words, people died as a result of these policies, more than a hundred and it's not just in Philadelphia.  Baltimore had 348 murders last year.  That's the most since 1993 and at a per capita level, it's the deadliest year on record in Baltimore. In 2014, Dallas had only 116 homicides this year after the far left, John Creuzot promise not to prosecute thefts valued at less than 750 bucks.  The murder rate went up to over 200.   In Charlotte, North Carolina, 57 homicides recorded last year -- 57.  This year, Charlotte reached that number before the end of June and then just kept going.  The city finished with 108 murders on the year.  That's the most since the early 1990s. How about Washington, the nation's capital?  Well in 2012, D.C. had just 88 murders.  Even two years ago, there were only 116, but this year, 2019, 166 murders.  See a trend?  You should because it's everywhere. We could spend half the show resetting the stats for city after city -- St. Louis, Raleigh, Seattle, Louisville, Cincinnati -- we could go on and on.   The point is across the country, in city after city, murder rates have surged dramatically compared with just five years ago.  This is happening. These are not fake statistics.  They're the most real.  And even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe. San Francisco, for example, facing an epidemic of shoplifting and car robberies, it has made life unbearable for many taxpayers.  We've got a series on that running next week, which you won't want to miss.  The bottom line is, normal people don't want criminal justice reform.  They want criminal justice enforcement.  They've always wanted that.  So why aren't they getting it? Heather Mac Donald has thought a lot about this question.  She is the author of the book, \"The Diversity Delusion,\" a frequent guest on the show, and she joins us tonight.  Heather, thanks so much for coming on.",

As for this idea that cash bail affects the poor.  Listen, in New York City, only seven percent of misdemeanor arrestees have any kind of bail set for them.  And that's because they have long felony arrest records and only 0.6 percent of misdemeanor arrests, these are actually in jail.

Iraqi television has just confirmed that Qasem Soleimani, a former general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Commander of the Quds Force has been killed in a rocket attack apparently initiated by the United States near the Baghdad airport, along with the top official in the Iraqi Shiite militia.  Now, what were they doing in Iraq?  Unclear. But his death comes several days after tensions kind of came out into the open in that country.  Last week, if you've been following this, you know, an American civilian contractor was killed by militants in Iraq.  The U.S. government blamed that attack on Iran and it retaliated with strikes. In response, protesters blockaded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.  It's basically where we were when the show started tonight. Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States is prepared to launch additional preemptive military strikes against Iranian interests in the region, which apparently are what we are seeing right now. Now, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but America appears to be lumbering toward a new Middle East war.  And we have to say it's one that official Washington has wanted for decades. For example, disgraced National Security adviser, John Bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with Iran and tonight, Bolton may be finally getting his wish.  Should you be happy about that?  That's the question. Well, the last time we took John Bolton's advice in the region, Iran became far more powerful than it was before, before we took John Bolton's advice. Why?  Because things were never quite as simple as they claim they are in Washington. In this case, the very people demanding action against Iran tonight, the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of America now in progress from the south.  The millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally; the torrent, more significantly of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of Americans -- nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed. Pay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us.  The real threat is Iran.  Well, they're liars.  And they don't care about you.  They don't care about your kids.  They are reckless and incompetent.  And you should keep all of that in mind, as war with Iran looms closer tonight.

They're just -- they're sent there.  So the question the President, who I think rightfully ran in 2016, against the Bush legacy.  The question is, does he want to re-invade Iraq? I understand there are people in his Cabinet that are selling him that Iran is not Iraq?  But the fact of the matter, Iran is quite similar to Iraq.

I think it was AOC's Chief of Staff who said the New Green Deal was really not about climate change, but changing the American economy along socialist lines.  This had nothing to do with climate change or our fires, Tucker. We've only gone up about one degree in a century in California.  That's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed.  What it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought. We never harvested them for green reasons and the underbrush took over and then, PG&E which was at one time as you remember as a Californian, the best utility in the United States.  It's ossified.  It's calcified.  It's over regulated.  It's got all these green mandates.  It's got to use expensive energy production. It doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when I was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now. And then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA.  So people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in California. And when you have infrastructure -- infrastructure that is rated about the worst in the nation, our highways and bridges, and it's hard to get to these places.  The freeways are packed.  We haven't built a major reservoir since New Melones Dam in 1983.  So it's a kind of a perfect storm. And you know, Tucker when state and local officials can't solve existential problems, they blame other reasons and when they can't deal with homelessness and then you banned plastic bottles at San Francisco Airport.

But we must be honest and tell you there was another factor at play and that was ideology.  Thomas was only on the street in the first place because politicians long ago decided to side with criminals over normal people in New York. By the time he began stabbing strangers in the synagogue, Thomas had already been arrested seven times, in some cases for violent offenses like assault, resisting arrest and killing a police animal. Now, despite all of that, the only jail time Thomas ever received was in 2013 on a drug offense, somehow he was able to kill a police animal and never go to jail. In other words, Grafton Thomas gave us plenty of warning.  The people in charge of protecting us just decided to ignore those warnings.

They're just turning them around right through a turnstile.  I think it's - - this is a demonstration of how the city is going to implode if they don't fix it and fix it fast because you're going to continue to have people like this out on the streets."

      "utterance": "It's depressing.  Bernie Kerik, thanks so much for that. As you just heard, New York City appears to be doing everything that it can to create more Grafton Thomas's.  A New Year's Day new bail laws went into effect in New York State.  Those aren't going to help. Pretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included.  What does it mean?  It means the crimes like burglary, stalking, petty assault, many drug offenses, even some types of arson and robbery are no longer bail crimes. In the words of Governor Andrew Cuomo himself, the guy behind this, 90 percent of criminal defendants will now be back on the street right after being arrested. Habitual offenders will find it even easier than ever to commit more crimes immediately after getting caught.  With no bail constraining them, there is no incentive to show up for court, so of course, many will simply disappear and reoffend. Who benefits from this?  It's hard to see who benefits from it, except the people getting out of jail. Last week, New York resident Tiffany Harris allegedly assaulted three Orthodox Jewish women in Brooklyn.  Harris was arrested, charged and released.  On Sunday she was arrested and charged with another assault and she was released again. On New Year's Eve, guess what she did?  She got arrested for a third time. This time she is finally being kept in custody.  That's New York. But Democratic presidential candidates have made it clear that if they take power in Washington this fall, they will make the rest of the country every bit as inviting for criminals.  Watch this."

      "utterance": "Is this what the country wants or needs?  Is this a peaceful place where law-abiding citizens feel safe and protected and ought to be, increasingly it's not. For about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class.  Eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging.  They're also demanding shorter prison sentences, fewer cops in quote, \"over policed neighborhoods,\" whatever that is, voting rights for violent criminals in prison and more. Now, often these policies enjoy support from guilt-ridden Republicans who have forgotten who they represent.  The year 2019 just ended and so now, we can bring some data to this conversation and fully assess the human toll of these policies. We have the numbers.  Here's what they are.  In Philadelphia, a city we've taken a close look at in the show under the direction of Soros funded DA, Larry Krasner, the city recorded 359 murders for the year.  That's the most in more than a decade. In other words, people died as a result of these policies, more than a hundred and it's not just in Philadelphia.  Baltimore had 348 murders last year.  That's the most since 1993 and at a per capita level, it's the deadliest year on record in Baltimore. In 2014, Dallas had only 116 homicides this year after the far left, John Creuzot promise not to prosecute thefts valued at less than 750 bucks.  The murder rate went up to over 200. In Charlotte, North Carolina, 57 homicides recorded last year -- 57.  This year, Charlotte reached that number before the end of June and then just kept going.  The city finished with 108 murders on the year.  That's the most since the early 1990s. How about Washington, the nation's capital?  Well in 2012, D.C. had just 88 murders.  Even two years ago, there were only 116, but this year, 2019, 166 murders.  See a trend?  You should because it's everywhere. We could spend half the show resetting the stats for city after city -- St. Louis, Raleigh, Seattle, Louisville, Cincinnati -- we could go on and on. The point is across the country, in city after city, murder rates have surged dramatically compared with just five years ago.  This is happening. These are not fake statistics.  They're the most real. And even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe. San Francisco, for example, facing an epidemic of shoplifting and car robberies, it has made life unbearable for many taxpayers.  We've got a series on that running next week, which you won't want to miss. The bottom line is, normal people don't want criminal justice reform.  They want criminal justice enforcement.  They've always wanted that.  So why aren't they getting it? Heather Mac Donald has thought a lot about this question.  She is the author of the book, \"The Diversity Delusion,\" a frequent guest on the show, and she joins us tonight.  Heather, thanks so much for coming on."

But we if we get a rise in crime, like we did in the 90s, it is going to swing back again.  Right now, we are living off of the law enforcement reforms that said policing matters, that incarceration matters, and we've gotten lazy, and the elites are back in the saddle, you know, and it's going to take a lot of thousands of more black lives lost to criminals who should be in jail before this gets turned around."

As for this idea that cash bail affects the poor.  Listen, in New York City, only seven percent of misdemeanor arrestees have any kind of bail set for them.  And that's because they have long felony arrest records and only 0.6 percent of misdemeanor arrests, these are actually in jail. In fact, most people are put on the streets anyway.  And so this bail reform law is a solution in search of a non-problem that is only going to create more crime."

The irony, though, is that Julian Castro actually can't speak Spanish.  He is just totally fraudulent.  Now, there's nothing wrong with not being able to speak Spanish.  Actually, that's not a crime. In fact, if anything, Castro could have celebrated that is proof that immigrants assimilate into American study as they have for hundreds of years.  That's a good thing.  We used to be for that. But the vision of actual assimilation has no currency in the modern Democratic Party, where people are constantly divided up by skin color, nationality, gender and language.

Convention speech back in 2012 and he became the candidate of tomorrow, but he was a candidate of tomorrow for so long that it became yesterday. He never was able to get a foothold.  And the two things that you point out, the two major policy positions on abortion and on immigration, he never got enough support that those policies were actually scrutinized. If you think of someone like Elizabeth Warren and Medicare-for-All, that got the full treatment, but Julian Castro, ever since 2012 thought that he was going to be on that stage, maybe the nominee?  I think that he will, though, be on the VP shortlist, even if he really doesn't deserve to be, but his name will be on the list.

Now, one thing that happened last week, the taxpayers are going to bail out a lot of the coal pensions because they were mismanaged by the executives, not the workers, but by the executives and guess then who gets on the hook for that?  The taxpayers.

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "We have an unexpected Fox News alert for you, something that has just happened in Iraq.  The situation there, heating up very quickly without any debate here in Washington. Iraqi television has just confirmed that Qasem Soleimani, a former general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Commander of the Quds Force has been killed in a rocket attack apparently initiated by the United States near the Baghdad airport, along with the top official in the Iraqi Shiite militia.  Now, what were they doing in Iraq?  Unclear. But his death comes several days after tensions kind of came out into the open in that country.  Last week, if you've been following this, you know, an American civilian contractor was killed by militants in Iraq.  The U.S. government blamed that attack on Iran and it retaliated with strikes. In response, protesters blockaded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.  It's basically where we were when the show started tonight. Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States is prepared to launch additional preemptive military strikes against Iranian interests in the region, which apparently are what we are seeing right now. Now, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but America appears to be lumbering toward a new Middle East war.  And we have to say it's one that official Washington has wanted for decades. For example, disgraced National Security adviser, John Bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with Iran and tonight, Bolton may be finally getting his wish.  Should you be happy about that?  That's the question. Well, the last time we took John Bolton's advice in the region, Iran became far more powerful than it was before, before we took John Bolton's advice. Why?  Because things were never quite as simple as they claim they are in Washington. In this case, the very people demanding action against Iran tonight, the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of America now in progress from the south.  The millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally; the torrent, more significantly of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of Americans -- nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed. Pay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us.  The real threat is Iran.  Well, they're liars.  And they don't care about you.  They don't care about your kids.  They are reckless and incompetent.  And you should keep all of that in mind, as war with Iran looms closer tonight. Curt Mills is a senior writer at the \"American Conservative.\"  He joins us now.  So Curt, this is unfolding, even as we speak.  Where could it go from here?"

Iran, I think is a problem for the U.S. and its allies in the region.  But it is not an existential threat, like China or Russia.  China or Russia, particularly China would love to see another decade or two of Americans my age, dying in the sand for no particular purpose."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, that's exactly it.  It's not that anyone I think in the United States has particular affection for Iran or trust in its government, much, much less the Revolutionary Guard or the Kurds forces.  Of course not. But it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in Washington describes the threat that I think makes sensible people nervous, that Iran is the greatest threat we face.  I mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLS",
      "utterance": "It's a joke.  It's a joke.  I mean, I think the real question is, why do we still have troops there?  So you see the Baghdad embassy protests.  And to be clear, this is not just an embassy.  This is a fortress.  It's been a fortress since we took out Saddam in 2003 and American troops there, if we're not going to re-annex, the country are effectively hostages. They're just -- they're sent there.  So the question the President, who I think rightfully ran in 2016, against the Bush legacy.  The question is, does he want to re-invade Iraq? I understand there are people in his Cabinet that are selling him that Iran is not Iraq?  But the fact of the matter, Iran is quite similar to Iraq. We're talking about Iraq, 16 years later, it's still Iraq. In order to counter Iran, I think the choice is clear.  The President should contain Iranian influence in the region.  We should avoid a hot war, which we are barreling towards at all costs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So my sense of it is, the President doesn't seek war and he is wary of it, particularly in an election year, but I think he was elected on the promise that he would avoid wars except when absolutely necessary. But there are a lot of people around him and certainly in the city of Washington who have been preparing for this, agitating for it, Bolton is one of many for an awfully long time and you wonder if it's possible that he might be outmaneuvered by them and that we might find ourselves moving toward war despite what the President wants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MILLS",
      "utterance": "Right.  So I think the President of the United States' convictions on this matter are sincere, but I think it's relevant, particularly extremely relevant matters of war and peace and life and death, who he staffs his administration with. I know, Bolton is a bugbear for you.  But in some ways, Bolton because he is so flamboyant, and so infamous and notorious.  He actually was a bit of a problem for the Iran Hawk Crusade, more middleweight, more circumspect managers like Robert C. O'Brien, Bolton's successor might actually be more effective at Trojan horsing, what I think would be a tragedy in the Middle East. Iran is not Iraq, it's twice as big.  It'd be twice as bad.  We're weaker than we were 16 years ago.  If President George W. Bush struggled to win reelection in 2004, if Trump does, he is cooked."

California saw major wildfires this year and according to the \"Nation\" magazine, there's a clear culprit -- private homeownership is the problem. And we're quoting now, \"The idealization of individual homeownership created the scorching landscapes we face today.  Individual homeownership should be seriously questioned.\" Banning private homeownership?  Will that stop wildfires?  It would fix the environment.  How about building fewer shopping malls?  No one ever thinks of that.  No, it won't.  It will make the government more powerful.  It'll make regular people less happy and less free.  And of course, that is the point. Victor Davis Hanson is a lifelong Californian.  He is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and we're happy to have him tonight.  Professor, thanks a lot for coming on.  Do you think that wildfires besetting your state mean that people should not be allowed to own their own homes?"

I think it was AOC's Chief of Staff who said the New Green Deal was really not about climate change, but changing the American economy along socialist lines.  This had nothing to do with climate change or our fires, Tucker. We've only gone up about one degree in a century in California.  That's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed.  What it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought. We never harvested them for green reasons and the underbrush took over and then, PG&E which was at one time as you remember as a Californian, the best utility in the United States.  It's ossified.  It's calcified.  It's over regulated.  It's got all these green mandates.  It's got to use expensive energy production. It doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when I was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now. And then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA.  So people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in California. And when you have infrastructure -- infrastructure that is rated about the worst in the nation, our highways and bridges, and it's hard to get to these places.  The freeways are packed.  We haven't built a major reservoir since New Melones Dam in 1983.  So it's a kind of a perfect storm. And you know, Tucker when state and local officials can't solve existential problems, they blame other reasons and when they can't deal with homelessness and then you banned plastic bottles at San Francisco Airport. We can't deal with utility or wildfire damage, then you say climate change did it and we've got to become socialists."

      "speaker": "PRAGER",
      "utterance": "No, it's -- it is less free.  There's no question.  And you could -- there's an interesting proof.  Read the reviewers in the mainstream media, not to mention left wing media, on how they have contempt for the film. When the film features liberal after liberal, including President Obama, speaking about what's going on, on campuses, but they can't even acknowledge that this is going on when they see the film, which is about the suppression of speech."

I mean, the comedic community and I feel a lot of my cohorts in the comedy world are starting to push back against it because they're at their saturation level.  And I feel like the group that started this thing is starting to double down on it, starting to really work it harder.' It's sort of the same subject is racism.  As racism fades from our society, a certain group is tripling down their efforts to make sure it's alive and well, or at least we think it's alive and well."

      "utterance": "I think he is right about the comedic community.  That's correct.  Outside of that, I don't think it's true.  San Francisco 49'er color announcer -- and I'm not sure you could use that term any longer -- simply said in describing the Baltimore Ravens quarterback who is a terrific quarterback and who is black and he said, you know, there might be the slight half second advantage in a handoff because the ball is black and the uniform is black and he is black.  So the offensive line doesn't see it quite as quickly. And the guy was said, you're a racist.  And unless he apologized profusely as in Mao's China in the Cultural Revolution, he would have lost his job."

      "speaker": "PRAGER",
      "utterance": "Well, I won't -- I don't know what Adam's position is on this.  But I think -- first of all, apologizing means that you think you were wrong.  I don't know how people live with themselves when they are right, and they publicly announced that they were wrong. It's so humiliating that I personally couldn't do it."

But for guys who do announcers for the 49'ers, what are they to do?"

But our corporate cousin, \"The New York Post\" says, for now Maxwell is untouchable with the source saying, quote, \"Ghislaine is protected.  She and Jeffrey were assets of sorts for multiple foreign governments.  They would trade information about the powerful people caught in his net -- caught at Epstein's house.\" Adding, quoting here, \"She is not in the U.S.  She moves around.  She is sometimes in the U.K., but most often in other countries such as Israel, where her powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.\" And separately, we should note, a friend of Ghislaine Maxwell tells \"The Sun\" newspaper that she has enough dirt on those powerful contacts that she expects to avoid any prosecution at all -- Tucker."
