I'm Greg Gutfeld with Lisa Boothe, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and she once was stranded on a Cheese-it, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" Well, stock up on the noisemakers, silly hats and Xanax: The 2020 election is only 838 days away.  A new poll shows that 3 out of 4 Democrats believe it's time for a fresh face. Can you blame them? Check out their ghosts of candidates past: Biden, Hillary, Bernie -- a cross between \"The Three Stooges\" and \"Cocoon.\" The only way to get out that vote is to deliver walkers door to door while yelling fire.  Biden, he thinks Amtrak is a success. It loses a billion a year. Hillary, everyone loves a rematch, but everyone also loves a winner -- the only thing she's won is ridicule. It's less a rematch and more of remake of \"Bride of Chucky.\" And Bernie, a relic pushing another relic called socialism. He's likable but his beliefs are toxic. He's like those delicious berries you pick that poison your whole tribe.  And we can't forget Liz, can we? But as someone who is 2 percent Native American, I have reservations:",

We've seen that come into fruition this primary -- a primary time where we hadn't really seen that before. But I think the bigger problem for Democrats is President Obama had really focused on identity politics for eight years, and with that, you saw a narrowing of the Democratic Party. Republicans were able to take advantage of that during the midterm election. And President Trump was, as well, being able to pick up these Democrat strongholds that hadn't gone for Republican in quite some time.

They kind of cut their nose off despite their face a few times. But it translated into electoral success. The Democrats energy, I wouldn't call it at the level of a tea party. I mean, right now, they have small rallies, there's no great speaker, and there basic message is I hate Trump. It's not really around a policy. And the policy that it is around is either abolishing ICE or we want socialism, and their tactics have backfired, chasing people out of restaurants, yelling horrible things at people.

And they lose with Gore and Kerry and Hillary. So, like you've said, they want someone that's gonna punch Trump square in the face. And they don't want to do this Michelle Obama thing where, you know, Trump goes low, we go high. They're ready to get in the mud but there's problems with that. The only person I can see really going toe to toe with him verbally is Biden. And I would not call Biden a fresh face. Also, when you get in the mud with Donald Trump, you never really get out. He's a brawler and he wins ugly."

And now they're not as much because you have this progressive wing of the party that is supercharged up. We've seen that come into fruition this primary -- a primary time where we hadn't really seen that before. But I think the bigger problem for Democrats is President Obama had really focused on identity politics for eight years, and with that, you saw a narrowing of the Democratic Party. Republicans were able to take advantage of that during the midterm election. And President Trump was, as well, being able to pick up these Democrat strongholds that hadn't gone for Republican in quite some time. So I think this pushed to the left focusing on things like abolishing ICE only further narrows the party which hurts them and is a negative impact heading into 2020."

I mean, right now, they have small rallies, there's no great speaker, and there basic message is I hate Trump. It's not really around a policy.

I look at Trump's behavior as somebody who didn't see what he did wrong, and it is so obvious. His reaction to the reaction was like, what did I do? This is just what I do. I've been talking about this for two years about working with people, working with Russia, might make a better world if you know for prosperity and peace if you work with these people. In his head, it is a business transaction. What he's doing is what -- I've got to build this casino in Atlantic City. I've got to go talk to Sammy, the bull, so I can make sure everything goes well.

But attending religious services or having faith, I do think that that adds to happiness. But also, conservatives, they're pretty happy with the country. They like the Constitution. They don't think it should be changed. So liberals tend to really want to change all of those things. Like, we're talking about a living Constitution. Like, no, conservatives are quite happy with what we have. And so I think that's probably -- it leads to it. But I'm not exactly sure. Maybe conservatives might have more dogs."

Because if you think that life is about something bigger than you, then you're going to be more outwardly focused, as opposed to inward. And then, two, I think Republicans are very self-reliant in the sense of we believe that we create our own success. We don't look to the government. We don't look, you know, for outside resources to get ahead. And so I think when you have that sort of mentality, of \"if I want something, if I want to do better life, I'm going to accomplish it on my own.\" That would bring a better sense of fulfillment and satisfaction and happiness."

You will never be happy. You have to have -- you have to treat -- but happiness is really weird. Because it's really about long-term satisfaction. And they do these studies, and they find that people are satisfied relative to others. Meaning, like, you could be happy at 5'8\". But if all of you were 5'10\", I would be unhappy. So it's -- it's status relative. And that's why maybe conservatives might be happier, is that religion helps mitigate the envy and the dissatisfaction that happens with status inequality. If you -- if you don't believe in God -- and I won't say where I am on this because then I'll get letters, but status inequality is unexplained. Like, if you're in a godless society and you can't explain why on Instagram everybody is having a better time than you and you don't have a community and you don't have friends that you can talk to or a higher power, all you have is envy.

But the big personal drama came when I was on the field. Take a look behind me if you will. You see those dark clouds? I just made it to the Nationals dugout before the rains came, but then came the deluge. It was an epic rain. For an hour, a hard rain, and as you can see, it flooded the dugout and stranded our TV crew in there. We couldn't get out. But then the sun came out, and the all-stars put on their own thunder and lightning show. Eight home runs. What a great time."
