Pompeo is on the way in, as is the country's first woman to head the Central Intelligence Agency, Gina Haspel, who has been basically Pompeo's right-hand person since he took over the job. In a moment, Congressman Peter King; Former States Department Official, Marie Harf; and Lieutenant Colonel Michael Walsh, all weigh in on the huge developments today.  Now, Gina Haspel briefly ran a CIA black site in Thailand where al-Qaeda operatives were waterboarding. After that, there were tapes that were destroyed. She has a lot of support from very prominent members of the Bush and Obama intel agencies and a lot of support on the hill as well. But she will no doubt face some grilling questions during the course of her confirmation. So, beyond all the drama of the day, here's the big question: what does all this tell us about where the Trump presidency's policy is going now? In an increasingly dangerous world, amid growing threats to our national security, what do all these changes actually signal about what is on the president's mind?

But her nomination was also quickly opposed by some lawmakers, human rights groups, and a few religious organizations. Haspel, of course, ran one of the first CIA black sites in Thailand called 'Cats Eye,' where Al Qaeda suspects like Usama bin Laden, Top Lieutenant Abu Zubaydah, were subjected to harsh interrogation tactics. Zubayda himself was waterboarded 83 times. Gina Haspel was also among a group of CIA officials involved in the decision to destroy videotapes of those interrogations.

If they don't get their way they get rowdy. And I've got spit on a couple of times. I've got people throwing punches at me a couple times. And I decided when it comes to weapons, not to sell weapons to them. Obviously, I didn't think they would be ready for it and I didn't want anything to happen, you know, that being on my conscience. And it has been my store policy from day one not to sell weapons to kids under 21.",

A slur of current and former officials praised her as an effective leader who would stand up to pressures that the Trump administration places on a spy agency. But her nomination was also quickly opposed by some lawmakers, human rights groups, and a few religious organizations. Haspel, of course, ran one of the first CIA black sites in Thailand called 'Cats Eye,' where Al Qaeda suspects like Usama bin Laden, Top Lieutenant Abu Zubaydah, were subjected to harsh interrogation tactics. Zubayda himself was waterboarded 83 times. Gina Haspel was also among a group of CIA officials involved in the decision to destroy videotapes of those interrogations.

But it seemed that he and the president weren't always on the same wavelength. I don't think anybody expected it to happen today, but yet it did happen.

They think she really has guts, she's smart. She is going to stand with the troops. She's going to do what has to be done, and she will do it in a way that's going to make the agency very proud. So, I think the president made an outstanding selection with her, again, this is based on virtually everyone that I know who has worked with her, who knows about her, and they've nothing but the highest remarks for her. Mike Pompeo, former CIA Director and Tank Commander, and West Point, number one in his class, as the secretary of state; to have a Gina Haspel at the CIA.

Gary Cohn left; we saw Hope Hicks, you know, one of the president's top aides leave. Now, you've got this changing of the guard as secretary of state -- another move at CIA -- and perhaps more to come there's a lot of criticism that this reflects instability at the White House.

As far as others in the administration, again, I don't know what's going to happen from one day to the next. The president does have his own style of getting things done. But, again, if it turns out the way today's changes have worked out with Mike Pompeo and page Haspel --"

      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "Yes. Listen, we had 73 witnesses in; over 300,000 pages of documents were analyzed, and none of that showed any collusion whatsoever. There comes a time where you have to say enough is enough. And if anything comes up, if anything unexpected arises, that's one thing. But as of now, based on everything we've seen from all these key witnesses, and following all the leads and everything else, so far, there's been absolutely no evidence of collusion. We're talking about the office of president of the United States here. And the longer this hangs out there, somehow indicating that there's something to it when we know there's nothing to it. We're doing the office of the president disservice and the country disservice. So, by wrapping it up now, as far as the collusion aspect, we are doing the right thing."

They are looking forward, from the folks I've talked to today and my former colleagues, to having a career officer running that agency. She will have to answer questions about her policies on detainee's interrogation going forward. But certainly, nothing she's done in the past is disqualifying.

You know, I don't give a lot of credence to the connecting of the dots on the Russia piece. You know, if you gave that credence, then, you know, Nikki Haley, the U.N. ambassador, has been incredibly tough on Russia, is putting a finger in their chest for what they're doing in Syria in terms of bombing hospitals."

I personally think it was one of the worst diplomatic agreements in modern American history. Mike Pompeo is on record as a congressman saying that in an interview with Bret Baier, he said so as CIA director. And I think, you know, time is up for the deal. The Iranians have supported terrorism all over the Middle East, are holding Americans hostage as we speak. Last week was the 11th anniversary of Bob Levinson; you had his family on this show.

Looks kind of quiet at both the headquarters at this moment. But we are only about 45 minutes away from starting to get some numbers in this race in Pennsylvania 18. Our election experts Larry Sabato, Marc Thiessen and Mo Elleithee, break down what we are watching tonight in Pennsylvania moments away. But first, this news out of Austin where there have been deadly bombings. The police chief has now released the new information about the package bombings and the massive manhunt that intensifies tonight.

They say that all three explosions, though, they do believe, by all indications of what they've got so far are linked. A $65,000 reward is being offered for anyone who can offer information that leads to an arrest in this case that clearly has the city on edge wondering when the next explosion could happen. In the last 24 hours, police received almost 300 calls about suspicious packages. I mean, you can imagine how on edge everybody in the community is about opening anything. Police have also now identified two of the victims: 17-year-old, Dreland Mason, who brought in a package and opened it inside his house found on front steps; and 39-year-old Anthony House. Mason's mother and another woman are also being treated for serious injuries at the hospital. Here is the police chief who we spoke with the other night updating today. He's Brian Manley.

His mother is in stable condition right now. And the additional victim from yesterday, a 75-year- old Hispanic female who will remain unnamed, is still in critical condition with life-threatening injuries. We are just not going to ignore the fact that the three victims that were targeted specifically that we know of were all people of color. We cannot ignore that."

Police have still been very careful not to describe the packages in extreme detail because only the person who dropped them off or the people who were victimized are going to know that information. So, for the time being, police are asking everybody in this area to be very vigilant and to be on the lookout for anything that looks suspicious. They're saying these bombs can fit in any type of packaging. So, anything that is out of the ordinary needs to be reported as soon as possible. As you saw earlier, we've had 265 reports of suspicious packages so far in the 24 hours after the blast yesterday. So, police are working all over this city to try to nail these down."

Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said that, you know, to make these bombs, to transport them, to get them to a house without detonating on their own is a feat in itself and that it requires some sophistication and skill level.

Their relatives and uncles were, you know, involved in a lot of, you know, activities in the area, including, you know, one was a dentist, the other was mentor to U.T. students.

And I have been working with Dreland since the fall of this year, I've watched him as he grew up coming through our ranks and watching him as a little boy and watching him this year as a senior in high school. As you said, he's been accepted into like a studio at U.T. I remember seeing Dreland, you know, in this orchestra, you have kids at high technical level, and that's already given that the kids are going to be able to play. Every once in a while, you meet -- you see a kid that just has this spark. When Dreland appeared -- you know, in some sense he was kind of -- he was kind of incandescent like, you know, a Rembrandt painting where the light just sort of comes out of him. You know, he's in the room and his little spirit had -- was there and along with the technical proficiency he had, he was a young man that was, I think, really headed for -- he could -- I think I could've accomplished anything he wanted to. We have people, alumni of this orchestra like the first bassoonist of the Metropolitan Oprah New York City was a member of this orchestra; the principle clarinet organ symphony was a member of this orchestra. There are many string players that are in really big orchestras and university teachers. I think Dreland was once of those students --"

These -- the governor and the various mayors are engaging in crimes, not just civil offenses, but crimes such as obstruction of justice, accessory after the fact, aiding and abetting fugitives. And until they're actually prosecuted, this is going to continue. You know, I've got clients I represent who don't do nearly as offensive things as these politicians have done and they're charged. So why hasn't Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland charged when she tells the undocumented criminals to get out of town before ICE hits there when she knows ICE is coming. You know that's no different than a get-away driver driving bank robbers after the fact."

He was very forceful on this a couple of days ago, Cesar, when he was there just saying that, you know, for a mayor to say that they're going to basically let people go or tell them to leave when these ICE agents are sweeping in.

They're saying that in this instance immigration customs enforcement and the Trump administration are aggressively targeting immigrants across the spectrum. People with violent criminal records, but people who are just there living their lives working for their families. That is at stake on what's going on. So it was mentioned, well, they're committing crimes. California does have the right to protect its residents. It is their right, as a state, to push against a federal government when they're being overbearing and they're pretty much interfering in the state's right to protect its own residents."

And when you look at the statistics in terms of the numbers of people who are on federal assistance who are illegals in the state of California, one set of numbers said you could basically pay for the wall in a couple of years, David, if you just lower the number of people who are coming in and presenting a financial burden to the state."

      "speaker": "WOHL",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know what also could happen is the federal funding that is cut from California could be diverted to the wall, to build the wall. And I'm telling you right now, it's that serious, Martha. In all due respect, Cesar, I have a client whose fiance was killed by an illegal alien who had been deported five times. Got in a car while intoxicated and killed her. Now, he should have been deported. The sanctuary cities in the state made it so the feds couldn't deport him. And now, he has a monthly visit to her grave instead of a marriage. You can't say that this is the federal government interfering with a state's rights to keep their residents in this state. This is an outrage. It's criminal behavior. And Jerry Brown and the mayors, Eric Garcetti and Libby Schaaf, have to be put in jail to send a strong message then so be it."

He tried to -- he didn't argue, but he said, you know, it's within my rights, and I said I understand that but it has been our store policy and to prevent that from happening when it comes to our store and -- I didn't make much of it at the time.

Our power panel, Larry Sabato, Marc Thiessen, and Mo Elleithee, on what to watch for tonight in Pennsylvania. We'll be right back."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Fox News alert, we've got high drama tonight in Pennsylvania, where the polls are about to close in about 11 minutes this evening. And the battle is in the 18th congressional district in Western Pennsylvania. A look now at the campaign headquarters for Republican Rick Saccone, looks kind of quiet, as they get ready to wrap up. As we've said the polls are going to close at 8 O-clock. This -- and then Democrat Conor Lamb is on the right-hand side, he's in South Pointe, Pennsylvania, or he will be. So this contest has been flush with money that has poured in from the outside, very expensive race. Both parties view the result as in some respects a referendum on President Trump and his success up to this point. And a preview of what we may see when we get rolling in the November midterms. So the season has essentially begun. Let's bring in our panel, Larry Sabato is director of the University of Virginia's center for politics, Marc Thiessen is an American Enterprise Institute scholar and a Fox News contributor, and Mo Elleithee is executive director at Georgetown University institute of politics and public service. Gentlemen, welcome. Good to have all of you here. So this is a race in a district, Larry, that won't exist the next time around, right?"

    {
      "speaker": "LARRY SABATO, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. Won't even exist, as you noted, spending millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars to win essentially a one year term, but it's symbolic. It's a special election in a district that was heavily pro-Trump, plus 20 percent pro-Trump in 2016, where the Democrat had a real shot to win. That's not to say he's the favorite. Simply to say he has a shot to win. And the last turnover we had in any house special election was 24 elections ago back in November of 2012. So it doesn't happen very often in this heavily gerrymandered age that you have a turnover."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Marc, when you look at the breakdown in this district of Republicans to Democrats there are slightly fewer Republicans and they are enough -- who don't belong to either party that you could swing this race. So obviously, it's going to come down as it often does to people who are in that, you know, who are not necessarily deeply aligned with the party, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And it's a conservative district. But I agree completely with Larry that Conor Lamb has got a chance to win. But the reason he's got a chance to win because he's a political unicorn. He's a pro-life, pro-gun, pro-fracking, anti-Pelosi Democrat, which means he's basically to voters a Republican. And this is, you know, this is not something that -- if Democrats were to replicate this all over the country and put up a bunch of pro-life, pro- gun, pro-fracking Democrats in middle America they'd win a lot of elections. But they're not going to do that. And you can see that in the case of -- in Illinois recently where the DNC refused to endorse a seven-term incumbent Democratic congressman named, Dan Lipinski, for the simple reason that he's pro-life. The head of the DNC recently said that we'll refuse to say whether pro-life Democrats were welcome in his party. So, if Democrats wanted to replicate this, I'd be worried but they're not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. So Mo, there's not a lot of room in your party for a lot more Conor Lambs, it sounds like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "There is a lot of room in the Democratic Party for a lot of different people who are running against Donald Trump. Look, I mean, Donald Trump is the reason why this race has becomes as competitive as it is. He won the district by 20 points. But we have seen in every special election since the 2016 election, Democrats over performing. Even in those districts where they are falling short, the energy is behind the Democratic candidates, and they're doing better than they ever have in these districts. The place to watch here tonight are the suburbs, the Pittsburgh suburbs. That's where a lot of congressional races are going to be fought over the course of the next year. And how the Republican does in those districts where polling is showing Donald Trump hemorrhaging support. Hemorrhaging support. If in the suburbs he gets shellacked, then that is a huge red flag for the Republican Party heading into the midterms."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And when you look at the whole state, look at the Philadelphia area and the suburbs are going to be very important as we move forward in the course of these midterms. Larry, when you look at this also, you've got to talk about candidates, candidate quality. And you think about Alabama and what happened to Doug Jones, was the victor over Roy Moore there. And now you've got this candidate who, according to some reports, the president himself has said is pretty lackluster, although he cheered him on the other night when he was there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Beware of your friends. Your enemies you know what to expect from. It's your friends that will get you. And, look, party is central. There's no question about that. But we forget candidate quality really does matter. And the point that Marc made should be underlined. Regardless of whether Conor Lamb wins or not he's going to be highly competitive in a district that shouldn't even have been close. Why? He's a really good candidate, and he has some moderate views, and he made it clear he doesn't embrace Nancy Pelosi. You know, hello, Democratic Party, when you have suburban districts that are red or purple, this is the kind of candidate that you really ought to put up, assuming you actually want to win a majority."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And you know -- and Marc, to underline your point as Larry rightly suggests, you know, moving forward, Tom Perez has suggested that he doesn't want any more of these kinds of candidates."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "No, that's exactly right. These are exactly the kind of candidate Democrats should be trying to run in states that Trump won by, in some cases, by double digits, if they want to win back middle Americans. Instead, they're focused on being the resistance and getting the coast. But also this candidate, the Republican candidate, isn't just bad, he's offensive. He said Democrats hate America and hate God. It's hard -- if you lose to somebody like that it's bad."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I've got to get Mo in. Mo, I've got 10 seconds."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Look, I think what you're seeing here is Democrats nominating a candidate who fits their district, and Republicans nominating a candidate who fits the Trump White House. And I think that's what it comes down to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "We'll see. We're going to watch. Very tight. So we don't know what's going to happen. Stick around. Quick break. Thank you, gentlemen. We'll be right back."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So about 15 seconds away from the polls closing in Pennsylvania. Live coverage right here tonight on Fox News as the results comes in. We'll be watching, as Rick Saccone's headquarters, and we're going to Conor Lamb's headquarters up in just a second. Have a great night everybody. We'll be watching. Tucker is up next."
