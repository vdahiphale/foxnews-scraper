But he's not getting to $4 trillion to $6 trillion, wouldn't get to the number, about $1 trillion is what we hear on Capitol Hill from moderate Democrats. What about all of that? Let's bring in our panel, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" Jonathan Swan, national political reporter for \"Axios,\" and Trey Gowdy, former Congressman from South Carolina.  Jonathan, the White House had kind of a muddled week on messaging on this, had to walk back over the weekend where the president is or isn't. When you listen to Manchin there and also saying he is not for adjusting the filibuster even down from 60 votes to 55, what is the plan of attack here from the White House point of view? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": It's really hard. Everything has to go almost beyond perfectly for them to get these two bills through. And when I talk to White House officials and people close to the White House who are advising the White House, when you have honest conversations with them that are not on the record for public consumption, they're pretty bearish about the reconciliation package. It's just hard to imagine a package that gets through the Senate with Joe Manchin, you just spoke to him, with his vote that can then be signed off on by the most progressive members of Nancy Pelosi's House. It's just a really big gap between the House progressives and Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. And I don't know what kind of political magic can bridge that gap, and nor do the people I talk to.",

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes, and I think Senator Manchin showed how he is able to be elected as a Democrat in such a Republican state with his moderation and his approach there. People are not making it easy for Joe Biden to have success here, but he's part of the reason why he's not having success. His campaign and his inauguration were all about how he was going to be a unifier, how he was going to bring people together. And as Senator Manchin was talking tonight about how important it is to get a few people from another party on your side when you're passing legislation, Joe Biden should not have so much trouble doing this. He finally, in fact, did get people for the infrastructure bill, immediately sabotaged it. Nancy Pelosi isn't helping because of her ultimatums as well, but it really gives lie to this idea that Joe Biden was somehow a moderate or a unifier when he can't even get something is widely liked as an infrastructure bill passed.",
