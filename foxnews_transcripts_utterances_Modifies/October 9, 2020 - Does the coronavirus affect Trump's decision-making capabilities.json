It's a Category 3 storm. No way of telling how it will end up. What we do know is, later tonight, it will likely hit the Louisiana coast. And for some of the people hit there, the third time, by the way, in as many months, this is only five weeks after Hurricane Laura.  Thousands evacuated for that one. And, by the way, they still haven't been able to get back to their homes. Thousands more are told right now that they will have to consider that as well. So, where do all those people go?  The latest right now from Steve Harrigan following developments in Lafayette, Louisiana -- sir.",

As far as that goes, the situation here, you're really putting your finger on when you say this place has been hit twice in six weeks, almost the exact same path, and more than 10,000 people really still in hotels from that storm Laura six weeks ago.  There are still tarps on buildings. There's still debris lining the road. And you can see the traffic jams during the day, people trying to get out on I-10, get out any way they can. You see these people. Sometimes, it's older people with pets, it's women with small children.  It is a tough thing to do to try and get out of a hurricane that's on the way. Some people in Cameron Parish right along the coast, they're going to try and ride it out. At least 100 people there will try and ride it out.   The roads are going to get flooded and rescue is going to be very difficult. Already, aid is pouring into the area, several hundred electric workers ready from Duke power for when those power outages do come. Urban search- and-rescue teams, more than 500 team members, they're highly skilled in rescuing people from collapsed buildings and also from floodwater. National Guard too, they have got everything, helicopters, boats, high- water vehicles. It's going to be an incredibly dangerous and difficult 24 hours in a place that's been through it just a few weeks ago -- Neil, back to you.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it was a Category 3, down to a Category 2. It continues to weaken a little bit.   We talked yesterday. I mentioned that the water in the Northern Gulf has is cooler. Temps are like into the maybe 77 to 78 degrees. And so that isn't strong enough to really sustain an incredibly strong hurricane. You're seeing that in these last few hours before the center makes landfall. Also, we're starting to see some storm shear that's beginning to break down just a little bit on that western side. These are all good things. But what's about to happen in towards the state of Louisiana, because you want to see a weakening storm, and that is what we have on hand here.  Take a look at this. This year so far, we have had nine named storms make landfall, four of those hurricanes, five of them as tropical storms. This will be our fifth hurricane and our 10th storm of the year, which is just incredible in this busy season that we have actually had to deal with them on the U.S. shore. This is what the radar image looks like. We have seen some winds gusting up towards 70 miles an hour. Right now, we have got 56 in Galveston and 51 in Lake Charles. That 51 in Lake Charles, it's one of the spots that's the most populated area that saw the big impacts from Hurricane Laura just about six weeks ago.  One other thing we're going to watch, we will see this all night long and even into the day to tomorrow, is tornado concerns. So, here, where you see this yellow, tornado watches in effect. And that's very far away from the center of the storm all the way -- includes parts of Mississippi, includes New Orleans, all the way down Plaquemines Parish.  So we're going to watch that throughout the evening. This is the official track of the storm. Continues to pull off towards the north and then the northeast here, and in that path, we're going to see kind of a narrow little sliver, a lot of areas, maybe four to eight inches of rain. A couple little spots, maybe we will see 12 to 15 inches of rain. Notice we will see that across parts of the Central Appalachians, and then across the Tennessee River Valley as well by the time we get in towards later tomorrow and into Sunday.  So, a lot ahead still here to go, Neil. Right now, we're about to see our 10th landfalling storm of this 2020 hurricane season. Absolutely unreal.",

We're taking this -- we're approaching this storm just like we did with Hurricane Laura, as a regional approach.   But the residents -- our residents here in Lafayette Parish, in the Acadiana region, we're very -- we're very used to these storms. We're not necessarily used to them coming back to back to back, like they have been this hurricane season.  But we have a voluntary evacuation in place. That's been in place for a couple of days now here in our parish. Some surrounding parishes also had some voluntary and a few mandatory evacuation orders in place. But for everyone listening out there here locally, it's still time to secure your -- secure your belongings outside. If there's anything out there that could potentially be -- become debris, we want to make sure that we hunker those down and we secure those. Think Halloween, for example. There's a lot of people here that just put up Halloween decorations. Now's the time, if you forgot that, because you -- we don't ordinarily prepare for hurricanes during Halloween.

Our next story right now is, what's happened to that? It was considered dead and gone, when the president just ripped it up and said, we will wait to continue this until after the election, then an enormous pivot, and now everyone scrambling, with a more generous package that has the two sides not all that far apart.

That means the White House has moved up a couple hundred, maybe $300 billion, from $1.6 trillion as to where they were before this. Larry Kudlow broke the news earlier today on FOX Business in an interview live with Stuart Varney, saying there was a meeting in the Oval Office between President Trump, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, in which the president gave the green light to that new plan, the new offer from the White House.  This afternoon, Mnuchin held a phone call with the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, in which they discussed the details of the new White House offer. However, the goalposts here, Neil, certainly moving for President Trump over the last several days, as, as that phone call was occurring between Pelosi and Mnuchin, the president was on the phone with Rush Limbaugh for a couple hours.

Each chapter of the book addresses a different constitutional liberty, one on free speech, one on religious liberty, one on the Second Amendment. And it tells war stories. It brings the reader inside the court, behind the scenes, on the big landmark cases, many of which I personally helped litigate. And it's designed to bring them alive.

The reason is simple. Their hard left base wants to do this. If they win, they will pack the court, which will destroy its independence, which will make it a political institution even worse than it is now. But they recognize that is a wildly unpopular decision, so they don't want to admit it to the American people. And I got to say, there's something weird about Joe Biden standing up and saying, I'm not going to tell the voters before you vote whether I'm willing to destroy one of the pillars of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, one of the pillars of our society. There's something fundamentally dishonest to the voters about it. And it's because their answer to that, as I said, is yes.",

So, if you break down the president's symptoms, I believe that it was reported he was experiencing congestion and some fatigue on October 1, Thursday. So that would make tomorrow 10 days since symptom onset. The last I heard, the fever was spiking the following Friday. I don't know if he has had a fever since then. He was started on dexamethasone the following day on Saturday. Dexamethasone can actually suppress a fever. It has antipyretic effects. So I'd be really curious to hear if he was spiking a fever between that Friday morning and the Saturday afternoon once he started dexamethasone. But, that being said, the president's position and the president himself have reported that his symptoms have improved and that, in his words, he's feeling great. So, that being said, that possibly tomorrow may be the end of his isolation. Another way that you could end isolation sooner is having two negative COVID tests sequentially greater than 24 hours apart. However, that being said, a negative test is not actually -- is not actually necessary for someone to end isolation. As we know, nonviable virus particles can be detected in someone up to even 30 days after infection. It doesn't mean they're contagious anymore. They just still are harboring some of that virus.",

Winds have dropped down about five miles an hour, so it's 105 miles per hour, but, still, a Cat 2 can be deadly, quite destructive. And so that's why people are ordered mandatory evacuated from this area. FEMA tweeted out these two photos today, showing its arsenal of relief trucks, a bunch of 18-wheelers, a bunch of boats, all to deliver 1.6 million MREs, 1.5 million liters of water as well. All of this is anticipated for after the storm. And, remember, it was just six weeks ago deadly and destructive Category 4 Hurricane Laura carved almost the same path as what is forecast tonight, extremely bad luck. And check out the newest tool for the FOX News hurricane arsenal. It's called the FOX storm cam, which is a big hard plastic waterproof box, a bunch of technology inside, and, of course, the camera that can shoot out of a peephole. So this can be placed anywhere. Here is a live look of ours currently down in Lake Arthur. It's broadcasting this scene there. And if the hurricane was a Cat 4, and it was too dangerous for our crews, this will always be able to provide you, the viewer, with the latest technology. Pretty cool stuff, Neil.",

It's a Category 3 storm. No way of telling how it will end up. What we do know is, later tonight, it will likely hit the Louisiana coast. And for some of the people hit there, the third time, by the way, in as many months, this is only five weeks after Hurricane Laura. Thousands evacuated for that one. And, by the way, they still haven't been able to get back to their homes. Thousands more are told right now that they will have to consider that as well. So, where do all those people go? The latest right now from Steve Harrigan following developments in Lafayette, Louisiana -- sir."

As far as that goes, the situation here, you're really putting your finger on when you say this place has been hit twice in six weeks, almost the exact same path, and more than 10,000 people really still in hotels from that storm Laura six weeks ago. There are still tarps on buildings. There's still debris lining the road. And you can see the traffic jams during the day, people trying to get out on I-10, get out any way they can. You see these people. Sometimes, it's older people with pets, it's women with small children. It is a tough thing to do to try and get out of a hurricane that's on the way. Some people in Cameron Parish right along the coast, they're going to try and ride it out. At least 100 people there will try and ride it out. The roads are going to get flooded and rescue is going to be very difficult. Already, aid is pouring into the area, several hundred electric workers ready from Duke power for when those power outages do come. Urban search- and-rescue teams, more than 500 team members, they're highly skilled in rescuing people from collapsed buildings and also from floodwater. National Guard too, they have got everything, helicopters, boats, high- water vehicles. It's going to be an incredibly dangerous and difficult 24 hours in a place that's been through it just a few weeks ago -- Neil, back to you."

      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, it was a Category 3, down to a Category 2. It continues to weaken a little bit. We talked yesterday. I mentioned that the water in the Northern Gulf has is cooler. Temps are like into the maybe 77 to 78 degrees. And so that isn't strong enough to really sustain an incredibly strong hurricane. You're seeing that in these last few hours before the center makes landfall. Also, we're starting to see some storm shear that's beginning to break down just a little bit on that western side. These are all good things. But what's about to happen in towards the state of Louisiana, because you want to see a weakening storm, and that is what we have on hand here. Take a look at this. This year so far, we have had nine named storms make landfall, four of those hurricanes, five of them as tropical storms. This will be our fifth hurricane and our 10th storm of the year, which is just incredible in this busy season that we have actually had to deal with them on the U.S. shore. This is what the radar image looks like. We have seen some winds gusting up towards 70 miles an hour. Right now, we have got 56 in Galveston and 51 in Lake Charles. That 51 in Lake Charles, it's one of the spots that's the most populated area that saw the big impacts from Hurricane Laura just about six weeks ago. One other thing we're going to watch, we will see this all night long and even into the day to tomorrow, is tornado concerns. So, here, where you see this yellow, tornado watches in effect. And that's very far away from the center of the storm all the way -- includes parts of Mississippi, includes New Orleans, all the way down Plaquemines Parish. So we're going to watch that throughout the evening. This is the official track of the storm. Continues to pull off towards the north and then the northeast here, and in that path, we're going to see kind of a narrow little sliver, a lot of areas, maybe four to eight inches of rain. A couple little spots, maybe we will see 12 to 15 inches of rain. Notice we will see that across parts of the Central Appalachians, and then across the Tennessee River Valley as well by the time we get in towards later tomorrow and into Sunday. So, a lot ahead still here to go, Neil. Right now, we're about to see our 10th landfalling storm of this 2020 hurricane season. Absolutely unreal."

So, to all of our first responders out here working very hard, we have worked the couple -- last couple days of reaching up to storm, reaching up to the storm, to make sure that our utility systems are up and working, our roads are clear, our first responders out there able to get to people in need."

And that was a doozy. How are your folks holding up? What are you telling them, to evacuate, to hunker down? What?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILLORY",
      "utterance": "Yes, being hit with Laura just about six weeks ago definitely adds some obstacles. Now, our parish was on the further -- the Eastern part of Hurricane Laura. We did feel the effects, but we didn't get the brunt of it, like our neighbors did in Calcasieu and Cameron Parish. Our prayers are still with them. Our relief efforts are still with them. We're taking this -- we're approaching this storm just like we did with Hurricane Laura, as a regional approach. But the residents -- our residents here in Lafayette Parish, in the Acadiana region, we're very -- we're very used to these storms. We're not necessarily used to them coming back to back to back, like they have been this hurricane season. But we have a voluntary evacuation in place. That's been in place for a couple of days now here in our parish. Some surrounding parishes also had some voluntary and a few mandatory evacuation orders in place. But for everyone listening out there here locally, it's still time to secure your -- secure your belongings outside. If there's anything out there that could potentially be -- become debris, we want to make sure that we hunker those down and we secure those. Think Halloween, for example. There's a lot of people here that just put up Halloween decorations. Now's the time, if you forgot that, because you -- we don't ordinarily prepare for hurricanes during Halloween. But that could turn into some deadly debris."

Our next story right now is, what's happened to that? It was considered dead and gone, when the president just ripped it up and said, we will wait to continue this until after the election, then an enormous pivot, and now everyone scrambling, with a more generous package that has the two sides not all that far apart.

Tyler Goodspeed, who is the acting CEA chair ,is just on FOX Business right now saying it is closer to $1.9 trillion. So you sort of get the range that the White House is in right now. That means the White House has moved up a couple hundred, maybe $300 billion, from $1.6 trillion as to where they were before this. Larry Kudlow broke the news earlier today on FOX Business in an interview live with Stuart Varney, saying there was a meeting in the Oval Office between President Trump, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, in which the president gave the green light to that new plan, the new offer from the White House. This afternoon, Mnuchin held a phone call with the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, in which they discussed the details of the new White House offer. However, the goalposts here, Neil, certainly moving for President Trump over the last several days, as, as that phone call was occurring between Pelosi and Mnuchin, the president was on the phone with Rush Limbaugh for a couple hours.

For this and other provisions, we are still awaiting language from the administration, as negotiations on the overall funding amount continue.\" Neil, pair that with what came out of Kentucky today from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. He said that the differences right now between both sides are -- quote, unquote -- \"vast.\" And he also predicted, at least in his belief, that he does not believe there is going to be a deal between now and Election Day.

Now, whether they're concluded by Election Day, and she's voted to become the next justice on the United States Supreme Court, that, we don't know.

Obviously, I didn't know there was going to be a Supreme Court vacancy in October. But what I did know is, there was, of course, going to be a presidential election in November. And, in my view, the single most important issue on the ballot is the judiciary and the Supreme Court. And what this book does, \"One Vote Away,\" is, it lays out the constitutional liberties that are hanging in the balance. Each chapter of the book addresses a different constitutional liberty, one on free speech, one on religious liberty, one on the Second Amendment. And it tells war stories. It brings the reader inside the court, behind the scenes, on the big landmark cases, many of which I personally helped litigate. And it's designed to bring them alive. A lot of people know the Supreme Court's important, but they don't necessarily understand what's going on, what it's about. And this is designed to be readable."

But I'm wondering here, because you have expressed your doubts in the past and relayed them about Judges Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, how can we be so sure that, in Amy Barrett, we have a true conservative?

Republicans are terrible at this. We bat less than .500. And many of the worst judicial activists in history were put on the bench by Republicans, people like Earl Warren, and Bill Brennan, and John Paul Stevens, and David Souter, Harry Blackmun, the author of Roe vs. Wade. All of those were Republican appointees. And what I do is examine what worked and what didn't. And there's a pattern. If you look at those justices who stayed faithful to their oath, people like Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito, my former boss, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, they all had served in the executive. They all had defended conservative principles, defended the Constitution. And here's the critical piece Neil. They all had faced withering press criticism. They'd been pounded and stayed strong.

And I congratulated the vice president on a fantastic debate two days ago, where he put the question, not once, twice, he put it four times to Kamala Harris, and she consistently refused to answer it, just like Joe Biden did the week before. The reason is simple. Their hard left base wants to do this. If they win, they will pack the court, which will destroy its independence, which will make it a political institution even worse than it is now. But they recognize that is a wildly unpopular decision, so they don't want to admit it to the American people. And I got to say, there's something weird about Joe Biden standing up and saying, I'm not going to tell the voters before you vote whether I'm willing to destroy one of the pillars of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, one of the pillars of our society. There's something fundamentally dishonest to the voters about it. And it's because their answer to that, as I said, is yes."

The big question is, does everyone else show up and vote? And that's actually why I wrote the book \"One Vote Away,\" is, it's designed -- if you're a voter at home, and, for one reason or another, maybe you're not thrilled with Donald Trump, you might not like what he says or what he tweets, and you're trying to think, gosh, do I vote or not, this book is designed to make the case to you that, if you care about your fundamental liberties, if you want to preserve your religious liberty, if you want to preserve your right to free speech, if you want to preserve the Second Amendment, there are four votes that have been on the Supreme Court to take those rights away. And if Joe Biden wins, we are facing a loss of our fundamental liberties. And this book is designed to make that very real by helping you understand just how close the court is to destroying those rights. And I will tell you, Neil, it's been amazing. The book has become the number one bestseller in the country on Amazon. And I think that's because people want to understand what's going on with the court. What are the stakes in this election? What are the stakes in the confirmation battle over Judge Barrett? And this book -- you don't have to be a lawyer to enjoy this book."

Does he think Biden and Harris are going to win, and Democrats are going to prepare for a possible transfer of power to grease the skids for a President Harris?

I'm a die-hard Houston Rockets fan. I have been my entire life. And it breaks my heart to see the NBA. I think they are doing enormous damage to their business by just insulting many of their fans by turning basketball games -- no one wants to turn on a sports game and hear this lefty political lecture, which, by the way, is completely self-righteous and doesn't actually address any of the issues.

But it's not good -- it's not good for the viewers, and it's not good for the league. I think sports should be fun to watch. And much of their political commentary is very superficial and uninformed.

      "speaker": "SAPHIER",

The CDC guidelines recommend you could end isolation when you have a positive COVID-19 test, when you are greater than -- or when you are at minimum 10 days since symptom onset, over 24 hours fever-free, and also your symptoms are improving, not necessarily gone, as we know a lot of those COVID symptoms can linger, such as cough, shortness of breath, and even some people report a brain fog. So, if you break down the president's symptoms, I believe that it was reported he was experiencing congestion and some fatigue on October 1, Thursday. So that would make tomorrow 10 days since symptom onset. The last I heard, the fever was spiking the following Friday. I don't know if he has had a fever since then. He was started on dexamethasone the following day on Saturday. Dexamethasone can actually suppress a fever. It has antipyretic effects. So I'd be really curious to hear if he was spiking a fever between that Friday morning and the Saturday afternoon once he started dexamethasone. But, that being said, the president's position and the president himself have reported that his symptoms have improved and that, in his words, he's feeling great. So, that being said, that possibly tomorrow may be the end of his isolation. Another way that you could end isolation sooner is having two negative COVID tests sequentially greater than 24 hours apart. However, that being said, a negative test is not actually -- is not actually necessary for someone to end isolation. As we know, nonviable virus particles can be detected in someone up to even 30 days after infection. It doesn't mean they're contagious anymore. They just still are harboring some of that virus."

Dexamethasone is a low-level steroid, which some people can report having some hyperactivity. It can also raise your blood sugar.

So, Jason, I will just ask you just up front, what is the problem with just answering that question? Is it fear of ticking off the extreme progressive part of the party, or just sitting on a lead and playing it carefully, or both? What is it?"

We don't know what's going on. No one really knows. So it's not time to really make these kinds of projections yet, when we don't have the answers to what's going on immediately.

And the reason why I'm concerned about maybe it's because this ticket is concerned about not looking like they're too in bed with the progressives, but some of the progressives have upped the ante a bit, calling for a People's Charter for free public health care, full student debt cancellation, reallocating police funding without calling it defunding the police.

He's more Joe Manchin than he is Ilhan Omar. He's more Jon Tester or Mark Warner than he is Rashida Tlaib or AOC. He already agrees with certain elements of the People's Charter, like free COVID testing, a ban on evictions and foreclosures during the pandemic. But there are certain things they're not going to get. And that is, you're not going to get universal free health care, Medicare for all.

It is people who were in -- Democrats, old-school Democrats in Western Pennsylvania, old-school Democrats in Ohio, the moderate wing of the party. I think those are the people that he is most going to going to cater to, because that's who he is. He hasn't changed who he is in 47 years. I don't expect him to change and become Bernie Sanders overnight. And Bernie Sanders got defeated by Joe Biden. As much as I love Bernie Sanders, he lost. And you're not going to get defunding the police when you have, as the president, the person who was the architect of the COPS program, which threw money at police programs. So I really don't think that Joe Biden is going to change. He's going to listen to progressives. He's going to see where there's agreement, but going to reject some of those things."

FEMA tweeted out these two photos today, showing its arsenal of relief trucks, a bunch of 18-wheelers, a bunch of boats, all to deliver 1.6 million MREs, 1.5 million liters of water as well. All of this is anticipated for after the storm. And, remember, it was just six weeks ago deadly and destructive Category 4 Hurricane Laura carved almost the same path as what is forecast tonight, extremely bad luck.

It's called the FOX storm cam, which is a big hard plastic waterproof box, a bunch of technology inside, and, of course, the camera that can shoot out of a peephole. So this can be placed anywhere.

      "utterance": "So, let's talk about your race, Senator. You were one of those, and might still be, for all I know, vulnerable Republicans up for reelection. And then the news of your opponent, who was leading, depending on the vote, by six to eight points, then Cal Cunningham had to publicly apologize for an affair, the texts of which were released to the blogosphere. And the rest, of course, is history. There haven't been polls since then. But many argue now that your seat is looking secure. Do you think your seat is looking secure?"

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, I thought my seat was looking secure on Friday afternoon, before the revelations came out. I mean, Cal Cunningham has premised this whole campaign on truth and honor. And what he's done is not been completely honest with the voters of North Carolina, and has covered up an affair that included a veteran, a veteran of the Army's wife. And he's now tried to admit to it, but not completely. I really feel sorry for his family, that -- what they're going through right now. But when you premise your entire campaign on truth and honor, and what you were was untruthful and dishonorable, the people of North Carolina need to understand that. Cal Cunningham will say anything to get elected. He has said anything to get elected. He lost in 2010. He changed his positions on things. So, I don't think that we can trust him. And I think that this is a very important thing for the people of North Carolina to understand before they cast their ballot."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, we did reach out to Cal Cunningham. We have yet to hear back. But the big issue in North Carolina in general -- and it's a tough one for the president -- is, they're not feeling this economic boom that he talks about, maybe that you talk about. Real quickly, are you worried about that; there's a disconnect here?"

    {
      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that there may be. But I do believe that people know the economy we had before COVID hit our shores. And I believe that the voters of North Carolina rely on Republicans, like I did when I was speaker of the House in North Carolina, to recover an economy that had been destroyed by Democrat leadership for nearly 20 years. I think that the voters, at the end of the day, in that clarity of moment that they will have when they cast their ballot, they're going to vote for President Trump, and they're going to vote for Thom Tillis."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we will see what happens, Senator. Meanwhile, look after your health. Get well. Get better. Very good seeing you again. You look fine. So, Thom Tillis, the Republican of North Carolina, on the Senate Judiciary Committee. We will be exploring all of this and everything tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Until then, we have got \"The Five.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
