This story out of Indiana and Illinois at the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, where he died two weeks ago, and a gruesome discovery was made in his house, and in his garage. They found the remains of more than 2,200 unborn children.  Klopfer described as Indiana's most prolific abortion doctor. Got his license pulled from him in 2016. Tonight, the White House is calling for a full criminal investigation. Saying that they are horrified by the news which echoes back to the atrocities of Doctor Kermit Gosnell.  You probably remember his story. He was the Philadelphia abortion doctor, whose so-called house of horrors stored fetal remains in his home in glass jars. I mean, it's just beyond, beyond the ability to understand.  In 2013, he was found guilty of murdering infants who were born alive after botched procedures. He now serves three consecutive life sentences. In a moment, I'm joined by South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who is among those leading the charge in Washington to protect life. But first, the breaking news on this story tonight from our correspondent Trace Gallagher. Good evening, Trace.",

He lost his medical license in 2016 for numerous violations including the use of unqualified staff, not filing reports of abortions for girls 13 or younger, and not providing pre-abortion counseling. Klopfer was not licensed in any other state, including Illinois. And authorities say there is no evidence that abortions were conducted on his Illinois property, where the medically preserved remains were found.  So, there is a reason to believe, the remains are from Indiana which means they would have been illegally transported across state lines. Now, the attorney general's in both Illinois and Indiana are launching a joint investigation to find out if Klopfer was involved in the illegal storing, hiding or selling of fetal remains.   Here is the Indiana A.G. on \"Fox News @ Night\". Watch.",

Buttigieg applauded the ruling, but when a woman's support center which counsels pregnant women and teens tried to open next door to the abortion clinic, Buttigieg denied the zoning permit, saying it would lead to violence and harassment. Critics called the decision purely political. And breaking right now moments ago, Mayor Buttigieg gave his first comments on the findings of the 2,000 plus fetal remains, calling it disturbing. But adding, \"I also hope it doesn't get caught up in politics at a time when women need access to health care.  Mayor also welcomes an investigation. Martha.",

Here is what we know, in 2011, we had over a million abortions. The fact that we've had 938,000 is still 938,000 kids who will never walk on this earth. So, I don't want to dive into whether we should celebrate or not celebrate a small reduction. Certainly, we should be thankful that we have fewer abortions today than we had in 2011.  But here is the question. The question is simply this. Because of science, our friends on the left want to talk about science in the environment. Here is what we know from a scientific perspective on life. At 20 weeks, we know the child fear -- feels pain. Why not get your country together on the left and the right and say, we'll take science, and we'll say, at 20 weeks, we cannot have any abortions beyond that point. Why not have confidence that every year, we will see that number of weeks move back and back? I'm a believer that we should defend and protect life at conception. I am willing to have a fight on that issue. But there are things that we can't fight about. We can't fight about infanticide. It's just not possible to have a logical reasonable conversation on that topic.   But we should not be talking about allowing late-term abortions as we're having that discussion on the left today.",

      "speaker": "GEN. JACK KEANE, RET., SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST",
      "sentences": "Yes, certainly. Well, I think Secretary Pompeo laid the framework out quite accurately. This is not just an attack on the largest oil fields in the Middle East or on one of our allies, Saudi Arabia, it is clearly an egregious act of war attacking the world's economy. And since post-World War II, Martha, a core national interest of the United States has been to safeguard and maintain the oil flow in the Middle East in support of a stable world economy that depends on it. Iran is attacking that world economy to destabilize it and also to demonstrate that they're in control of the Middle East oil flow, not the Arab nations who own that oil and those who are distributing it. So essentially, given that reality, we need to respond. I think the first thing is we got to fix the air defenses out there that were so vulnerable and did not protect Saudi Arabia. Maybe we can help not there but also in the other Arab Gulf states.   Second thing is declassify all the evidence. I believe the administration is working on that with our Intelligence Community. Go to the U.N. with that evidence and the American people. Lay it out so they can see it. And the U.N. General Assembly's meeting next week, all the presidents are coming in, at least most of them, that's a golden opportunity to further isolate Iran politically, diplomatically, and economically. Get maybe someone to sign up for sanctions which are working by the way. But then also, build a coalition here. It's not just about Saudi Arabia in the United States to conduct a limited military attack likely on military and economic targets. But here's the key. The key is the focus must be robust enough to impose cost that deters Iran from continuing this behavior. And if we don't act or if we don't act strong enough, it's guaranteed that Iran will continue. And if we do -- if we -- go ahead.",

And the difficulty is the Iranians are just notorious for making bad judgments, bad calculations, miscalculating, and they're doing that now. They all -- they need to listen carefully what the president said. He doesn't want war with Iran. Having said that, sometimes you get pulled into something and have to do something that you don't necessarily want to do.  The Iranians are very, very close to that. Look, this was such a deliberate and overwhelming use of military force that it is very hard to look the other way. The President has added some additional sanctions. There's going to be more done in the future. There's no doubt about that. But the Iranians think to be very, very careful here. They should not weigh what we've done or not done so far as weakness.

I know there is a distinction between blackface in America which has all the historical pain that is wrapped into that.

This story out of Indiana and Illinois at the home of Dr. Ulrich Klopfer, where he died two weeks ago, and a gruesome discovery was made in his house, and in his garage. They found the remains of more than 2,200 unborn children. Klopfer described as Indiana's most prolific abortion doctor. Got his license pulled from him in 2016. Tonight, the White House is calling for a full criminal investigation. Saying that they are horrified by the news which echoes back to the atrocities of Doctor Kermit Gosnell. You probably remember his story. He was the Philadelphia abortion doctor, whose so-called house of horrors stored fetal remains in his home in glass jars. I mean, it's just beyond, beyond the ability to understand. In 2013, he was found guilty of murdering infants who were born alive after botched procedures. He now serves three consecutive life sentences. In a moment, I'm joined by South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who is among those leading the charge in Washington to protect life.

He lost his medical license in 2016 for numerous violations including the use of unqualified staff, not filing reports of abortions for girls 13 or younger, and not providing pre-abortion counseling. Klopfer was not licensed in any other state, including Illinois. And authorities say there is no evidence that abortions were conducted on his Illinois property, where the medically preserved remains were found. So, there is a reason to believe, the remains are from Indiana which means they would have been illegally transported across state lines. Now, the attorney general's in both Illinois and Indiana are launching a joint investigation to find out if Klopfer was involved in the illegal storing, hiding or selling of fetal remains.

Pro-choice advocates, then, circumvented the state, filed suit in federal court and won. Allowing the abortion clinic to open in South Bend. Buttigieg applauded the ruling, but when a woman's support center which counsels pregnant women and teens tried to open next door to the abortion clinic, Buttigieg denied the zoning permit, saying it would lead to violence and harassment. Critics called the decision purely political. And breaking right now moments ago, Mayor Buttigieg gave his first comments on the findings of the 2,000 plus fetal remains, calling it disturbing.

And to have a doctor who happens to be the governor of Virginia suggest that perhaps, infanticide, somehow some ways to be legal, just -- it hurt my heart and it frustrated me. And as a legislator, I felt my responsibility was to speak out loud and clear that we are not talking about pro-choice or pro-life, we're talking about being pro-child.

And this is a headline from The New York Times that says, that, \"America's abortion rate has dropped to its lowest rate ever.\" And, \"New research suggests that contraception and fewer pregnancies may be more responsible for the decline than state laws that are restricting abortion.\" And they go in this piece, you know, to back that up with a number of facts related to states that have and adopted stricter laws. And the fact that actually in those days, they've actually seen the abortion numbers rise a little bit. What do you think about that?"

Here is what we know, in 2011, we had over a million abortions. The fact that we've had 938,000 is still 938,000 kids who will never walk on this earth. So, I don't want to dive into whether we should celebrate or not celebrate a small reduction. Certainly, we should be thankful that we have fewer abortions today than we had in 2011. But here is the question. The question is simply this. Because of science, our friends on the left want to talk about science in the environment. Here is what we know from a scientific perspective on life. At 20 weeks, we know the child fear -- feels pain. Why not get your country together on the left and the right and say, we'll take science, and we'll say, at 20 weeks, we cannot have any abortions beyond that point. Why not have confidence that every year, we will see that number of weeks move back and back? I'm a believer that we should defend and protect life at conception. I am willing to have a fight on that issue. But there are things that we can't fight about. We can't fight about infanticide. It's just not possible to have a logical reasonable conversation on that topic. But we should not be talking about allowing late-term abortions as we're having that discussion on the left today."

That's the framework within which we would provide the President options. Very important words there from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The general said that Trump had not issued orders for any action, so those are the voices that are around the president as all of this is being discussed. Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane says that we have a major crisis on our hands and that we must retaliate against Iran with a limited strike. General, good to see you tonight. Why is that what you believe and what in that introduction does that tell you about the different strategic options that are being perhaps even argued over at this point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GEN. JACK KEANE, RET., SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Yes, certainly. Well, I think Secretary Pompeo laid the framework out quite accurately. This is not just an attack on the largest oil fields in the Middle East or on one of our allies, Saudi Arabia, it is clearly an egregious act of war attacking the world's economy. And since post-World War II, Martha, a core national interest of the United States has been to safeguard and maintain the oil flow in the Middle East in support of a stable world economy that depends on it. Iran is attacking that world economy to destabilize it and also to demonstrate that they're in control of the Middle East oil flow, not the Arab nations who own that oil and those who are distributing it. So essentially, given that reality, we need to respond. I think the first thing is we got to fix the air defenses out there that were so vulnerable and did not protect Saudi Arabia. Maybe we can help not there but also in the other Arab Gulf states. Second thing is declassify all the evidence. I believe the administration is working on that with our Intelligence Community. Go to the U.N. with that evidence and the American people. Lay it out so they can see it. And the U.N. General Assembly's meeting next week, all the presidents are coming in, at least most of them, that's a golden opportunity to further isolate Iran politically, diplomatically, and economically. Get maybe someone to sign up for sanctions which are working by the way. But then also, build a coalition here. It's not just about Saudi Arabia in the United States to conduct a limited military attack likely on military and economic targets. But here's the key. The key is the focus must be robust enough to impose cost that deters Iran from continuing this behavior. And if we don't act or if we don't act strong enough, it's guaranteed that Iran will continue. And if we do -- if we -- go ahead."

That's one of the reasons that we needed that kind of security. This is their problem. It is not ours.

Iran is trying to destabilize that, force recessions on people, and possibly even worse. We know what that means in the United States in terms of the suffering it caused. That is why for 70 years this has been a core national interest of the United States even though we are independent of our own energy. And that is why we have to stop this behavior. Diplomatically it hasn't worked. So obviously we have to apply some level of force to do that. Not a comprehensive attack on all of Iran's military which would lead to war. We're smart enough to avoid that. But we must act responsibly if we intend to stop the disruption of the world economy."

But we have a commander in chief and he has said he does not want war with Iran and the Saudi Arabians have said the same thing. The unfortunate part of all this is Iran continues to push the envelope. I don't think we're there yet but it's very, very close. And the difficulty is the Iranians are just notorious for making bad judgments, bad calculations, miscalculating, and they're doing that now. They all -- they need to listen carefully what the president said. He doesn't want war with Iran. Having said that, sometimes you get pulled into something and have to do something that you don't necessarily want to do. The Iranians are very, very close to that. Look, this was such a deliberate and overwhelming use of military force that it is very hard to look the other way. The President has added some additional sanctions. There's going to be more done in the future. There's no doubt about that. But the Iranians think to be very, very careful here. They should not weigh what we've done or not done so far as weakness. Any reasonable forbearance needs to be put in that category. But this president should not be mistaken for someone who's weak and unable to respond. I haven't helped them. If they -- if they get on the wrong side of him and do something further, that gives us no choice."

I was with a handful of other people from the Hill, plus the Secretary of State, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, CIA, and all those people, and these things are not -- just jumped into. People are talking about this. This is going to be very thoughtful. I saw a president that was incredibly thoughtful as we all discussed and gave our point of views to how -- what the response should be to the drone. We're in that same stage right now. Obviously, this is broader and that we've got to engage allies in this like Saudi Arabia. That's what's going on right now. I wouldn't put it in terms of there's daylight.

It was I guess last Sunday when both Mollie Hemingway, a contributor here and a senior editor the Federalists and our own Howard Kurtz pointed out on the air that -- and on Twitter is that this crucial detail that the alleged victim doesn't remember the alleged incidents had been left out of the New York Times story on the -- on that book excerpt, based on that book excerpt. So that was our -- that was you know, our initial role in this and we commented about it ever since. It was pursuant to that or at least after that, that the times then appended to the story and editor's note. And what is this claim that weed that we twisted events based on? It's based on the fact that the -- that the editor's note was in the form of just that and not formally a correction? There is a distinction without a difference if I ever saw one. So the idea that that news -- that journalist from The New York Times who participated in this would now be whining about Fox News after the colossal screw-up that she and her partner made seems to me to be kind of amazing at this stage."

And when Christine Blasey Ford was asked, you know, who could verify her account of this event that happened that night -- you remember and you recall, of course, her story was very hard to prove or disprove because she couldn't remember exactly what happened, exactly what the date was, and many other of the kind of details you could use to pin something like that -- she cited Leland Kaiser as someone who could verify for her. Well, Leland Kaiser said at the time that while she believed Christine based on Christine's word, she didn't have any recollection of the event and didn't witness it, didn't even know she'd ever met Brett Kavanaugh. Well, subsequently, we now know, she told the FBI when she was interviewed that she didn't have any recollection of ever witnessing such an event. She has since told the FBI, we now know, that she now doesn't believe Christine Blasery Ford's story, which blows up the one witness, really, that was supposed to be the one who could verify that original allegation.

First of all, on the impeachment issue, what did you think of the hearing yesterday and do you agree with Nancy Pelosi or with the members of the \"The Squad\" on this?"

I thought Corey was very competitive but the House Democrats got what they wanted out of that. That is he admitted that the president ordered him to direct Attorney General Sessions to, you know, basically stop the investigation. But as you well know, the calls for impeachment, 137 Democrats are in favor of it, 92 Democrats believe that Congress should do its job in terms of oversight and accountability. Six are unclear. One former Republican member, as you know, Justin Amash, agrees with those 137 Democrats. So --"

No, the truth of the matter is that I don't like to do this name-calling, finger-pointing. I've been in this world now almost 60 years, and I appreciate the contributions of all Americans. I want to try to bring people together. I believe in racial reconciliation. Have I called the president out on the birtherism (ph)? Yes. Have I called him out on Mexicans and rapists? Yes. Have I called him out? Absolutely. The president understands the frustration that many of us have when he sometimes go on Twitter and do his thing, and we will call him out, but I believe that this president, like every American citizen and every soul in this universe, should be given an opportunity to come forward and try to bring all of us together as Americans. The second thing is I don't want to energize his base. I don't want to tell people out there that, you know, I have some profound personal disagreement with this president. No, it is about the policies that I dislike, but there are policies when I like what the president is doing. Martha, you know I will say that as well. I am a free, liberated woman about to turn 60 at the end of the year."

This video should be an eye- opener for all these parents to get involved at a local level and see -- look into the policies at their child's school and get involve. Don't put your kid in an unsafe environment, and talk to your kid. They're the first ones that see disturbed kids at school."

      "speaker": "POLLACK",
      "utterance": "No. The kids -- you know, talk to your children, talk to the school resource officer, talk to the teachers, and really get involved. That's what parents need to do. Don't leave it up to politicians to make your school safe. Just know that you do have options. Look into the policies that are in my book, \"Why Meadow Died\" and see if they are at your school. Listen to your kids because they really know and there's nothing that we wouldn't do for our kids. This video, parents, this is a real eye-opener."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And at the end, they say, know the signs, understand, know your school, as you've been saying. I encourage everybody to read \"Why Meadow Died\" and look into the policies that have left a lot of kids who don't belong in the schools and should be incarcerated, not there, and that's really I think such a significant point that you've made. Before I let you go, these sweatshirts that are being pushed by the fashion company, they have one that has a guy -- let's put it up on the screen. He is wearing the Stoneman Douglas high School sweatshirt and it's got bullet holes in it. And this is supposed to be some sort of fashion statement."

But what bothers me more is after every mass shooting, when Democrats pushed that gun control agenda before even looking into the facts, that's more bothering to me and with no real solutions."

This photo was obtained by Time and it shows him in brown face at a 2001 event. They say that he was attending an \"Arabian Nights\"-themed gala at the private school where he was teaching in 2001. Here now, \"Wednesdays with Watters,\" Jesse Watters, host of \"Watters World\" and co-host of \"The Five.\" He is in an election on October the 21st. The timing on this may be related."

And it is even worse, I think, than the Virginia governor, Northam, because this was in 2001 and he was a teacher at the school. Northam was 84 and he was a student. Now, it's such incredibly bad judgment to do this. I don't know what he was thinking. Apparently he was the only one who did anything to his face at this party. I know there is a distinction between blackface in America which has all the historical pain that is wrapped into that. The French-Canadian, they have him in brown face because he's trying to imitate someone from Aladdin at the party. I guess that's maybe a little bit different, but not different enough to not hurt him. This is going to hurt him big time. A part of me thinks he's going to survive."

He's running against a conservative, Andrew Scheer. He's at 37 percent in the polls right now. But my guess, given what we saw here in Virginia, is that he's going to try to ride this out. His own people came out and confirmed that it is indeed him."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "It is indeed him. He's going to address the Canadian nation tonight about this. We will see if he can think quickly on his feet because he's probably had to scramble. Remember, every single national Democrat in America told Northam to drop out of the race."
