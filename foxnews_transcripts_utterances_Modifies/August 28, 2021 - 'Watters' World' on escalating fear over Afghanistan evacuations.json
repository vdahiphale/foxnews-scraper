      "sentences": "Welcome to WATTERS' WORLD, I'm Jesse Watters. This is a FOX News Alert: President Joe Biden issuing a warning just hours ago that an attack is highly likely in the next 24 to 36 hours at the Kabul Airport. Fear growing by the minute as Americans still try to escape the Taliban takeover. The ongoing evacuation flights likely won't be enough to get all Americans out by Tuesday's deadline. And if another attack happens like the ISIS-K bombing, so many more won't be able to make it out alive. Thirteen U.S. service members were killed in that attack. The Department of Defense just released their names. They served in the Marine Corps, Navy, and Army. The service members were killed. Here they are. Army Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss; Marine Corps Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz, Marine Corps Corporal Daegan Page, Marine Corps Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Marine Corps Sergeant Nicole Gee, Marine Corps Sergeant Johanny Rosariapichardo, Marine Corps Corporal Humberto Sanchez, Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Darin Taylor Hoover, Marine Corps Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum, Marine Corps Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, Navy hospitalman Maxton Soviak, Marine Corps Corporal Hunter Lopez, and Marine Corps Lance Corporal Dylan Merola. Our hearts are with their families during this very tough time. Thursday was by far the worst day of Joe Biden's presidency, an avoidable tragedy and the deadliest day for American forces in Afghanistan in 10 years. Biden botched the Afghan withdrawal and now innocent people are paying the price. Biden refused to extend the August 31st deadline to get Americans out of Afghanistan, and U.S. troops have now begun withdrawing from Kabul with 350 Americans still trying to get out and that's just according to the State Department, a department with a pretty bad track record here. U.S. military last night carrying out a drone strike against an ISIS-K planner. Two ISIS-K targets were killed and one was wounded. The President saying today this strike won't be the last. There's a lot of questions about this and we're going to have a report in just a minute. The Taliban is blocking Americans from getting to the airport, and Biden is boxed in, letting it happen. We're working with the Taliban how. Biden is saying we may even have given the Taliban a list of names to let through checkpoints, or a kill list, as most people fear.",

Officials say those two ISIS fighters were part of a cell plotting more attacks to kill more U.S. troops at the airbase in Kabul ahead of President Biden's August 31st deadline. Earlier today at The Pentagon, John Kirby called those ISIS targets quote, \"planners and facilitators.\" Words normally reserved for low ranking fighters, Jesse. A U.S. military reaper drone launch from Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE carried out the strike in Nangarhar Province where that ISIS branch in Afghanistan is based, not far from the border with Pakistan as you can see here. The drone fired a missile at a car killing the two fighters and wounding a third. Back to nomenclature, The Pentagon officials are not calling these fighters leaders. That was notable, Jesse. I'm told the targets were not on any U.S. military kill. This is the same part of Afghanistan where President Trump ordered the MOAB, the mother of all bombs dropped on ISIS not long after taking office. The SEAL raid to kill bin Laden was launched from this area as well. President Biden approved the strike less than two days of the suicide attack that killed those 13 U.S. troops and wounded 20, over 160 Afghan civilians were killed, Afghans desperate to escape their country following the Taliban takeover. The drone mission launched a few hours before another warning from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to tell all Americans to leave immediately. There's about 3,500 U.S. troops on the ground right now at the airport in Kabul, Jesse. They will be gone on Tuesday and the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan there for nearly 20 years will end -- Jesse.",

      "sentences": "All of the above, Jesse. First, thanks for talking about my Marines and, and the families are just going through terrible grief right now and that's a tough job when you have to be KKO as they call it. The person who goes and tells the wife, she's now a widow, and the kids, they are now orphans. So without going into the stupidity of how we got here, or compromising the people on the ground, here's a very brief summary of what's happening on the ground, and where things are likely to be going in the days ahead. Thirteen flag-draped coffins arrived at Dover Air Force Base this morning. I'm told the President has a card in his pocket to remind him of the pain that people are suffering. Someone from the White House should have at least met the aircraft even though the formal presentation with the families is set for tomorrow. For this entire day, a group of brave and exhausted Americans have been trying to get hundreds of pre-manifested men, women, and children, including American citizens and to get them out through a gate at the Kabul Airport. And while the incompetent and political military establishment and The Pentagon couldn't get it out, out of the way itself, it took the President of the United States to authorize the gate to be opened. And because of our inaction and giving up authority and control to the Taliban, they're now issuing orders to our remaining assets at the airport. And if anybody thinks that every American who wants to get out has gotten out, they are dead wrong. That fact is, and you just kind of alluded to this a few minutes ago, what's going to happen in the aftermath is Americans who've already been selected and high value targets of our allies are going to be kept as hostages to make sure that a MOAB, as you just mentioned, or a Jaden doesn't land on the presidential palace and take them out. In other words, we've offered them money, we've offered them recognition, all that stuff is being talked about. But what they mostly want is to be able to humiliate this President. Here's a little brief timeline. First of all, even before the bomb went off that killed 13 Americans, we ended up with a Turks who got there first and we're supposed to stay after we left to cover our exits as it would, be they were gone. Question remains: where they warned to get out before that? Don't know that, I'm just wondering. At 12:11, today, the Chief Counsel of the White House reported that the President had to be briefed before in order to open the gate was in, and the Taliban leadership came to the airport to hold a formal meeting at the airfield. Reports from local sources said that the gate is going to close for good at 0400 tomorrow. That may or may not happen. What we do know that isn't going to happen is that there is not going to be a delay in the execution of the final lift out of the town. The Marine Corps, by the way, is already out. The 82nd and a few handful of others are the only forces on the on the ground right now at that airport. So, what are the sources says, the payment -- the payment for passing through a checkpoint is hold on, because I've got -- this is encrypted comms from these guys. The current payment for getting through the wickets, all of the checkpoints that Taliban have established is $1,500.00.",

The bottom line of it is, this President is taking orders from the Taliban. This President will do whatever they tell him. And you've got to wonder why. I'll give you a couple of theories, because right now we know that in Kabul, you've got members of the Pakistani Intelligence Service, the ISI and the People's Republic of China, and they're collecting up U.S. gear, moving it across the packed border, and they're going to export it for exploitation to the PRC. Here is another thing. Everybody keeps talking nowadays about the Taliban and al-Qaeda and Haqqani and ISIS all being different. They're not. In fact, on any given moment, the person pointing a firearm at an American could well be any part of any one of those organizations. And I guess the thing that bothers me most about this thing is that we don't know whether the President is competent or not. So, one of the rumors is that there's a cell of his supporters, some of them in the media, some of his closest advisers, probably Schumer, who are actually actively thinking now it's time to invoke the 25th Amendment because that's one of the reasons why you see, so often he's being contradicted by people who basically, he's the Commander-in-Chief and they're out there contradicting what he is saying.",

We knew this was coming. The U.S. Embassy warned everybody months ago to leave as soon as possible. Don't travel, we can't help you. The Taliban's rapid advance across the country started in May and more warnings from State to leave due to uncontrollable violence were issued.

I think the one thing that people haven't talked about enough and you alluded to it, Jesse, not three weeks ago, maybe a month ago, the headlines were American veterans and organizations are trying to get people home that have SIVs who are Americans and the State Department is dragging its feet. As a matter of fact, this story actually goes back even to before Biden took office, and this is bureaucracy, it is red tape, it is embassies being shut down for coronavirus. The point there is how does an administration tell us now there was no other way to do this and that we had to have chaos and by chaos, I mean, 13 dead heroes and nearly 200 Afghan dead civilians and we're talking children. People that now would die tomorrow, to stand in front of and save and damn near dead in Afghanistan. They are human beings even if they're not United States citizens. All right, they're dead. They're dead and they call that chaos and they said it was unavoidable. Any other text I got before I sat down here from a group text of Marines, everyone from mid-grade officers to mid-grade enlisted was, man, I wonder who those poor guys were in that truck? Now, I'm not saying I'm going to come in here saying there's some conspiracy theory that we didn't actually take out and ISIS-K fighter, but that's where veterans are, that's where their belief and confidence is that that was just something to get the heat off. And that's a bad place to be because if veterans in this country think that way, what do our enemies think? Did that do what it needed to? That strike was to put anyone who might attack us on pause, not to prevent it, but to psychologically put them on pause. It wasn't even our retaliation. And if our veterans aren't even really buying in, what did that do to our enemies? And so we shouldn't even have to be in that spot to begin with. And so to the men and women in Kabul, my hat's off to you, brothers and sisters. I walked down on bombs and I don't know that took the courage it takes to be in Kabul right now. And I love you.

Fear growing by the minute as Americans still try to escape the Taliban takeover. The ongoing evacuation flights likely won't be enough to get all Americans out by Tuesday's deadline. And if another attack happens like the ISIS-K bombing, so many more won't be able to make it out alive. Thirteen U.S. service members were killed in that attack. The Department of Defense just released their names. They served in the Marine Corps, Navy, and Army. The service members were killed. Here they are. Army Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss; Marine Corps Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz, Marine Corps Corporal Daegan Page, Marine Corps Lance Corporal David Lee Espinoza, Marine Corps Sergeant Nicole Gee, Marine Corps Sergeant Johanny Rosariapichardo, Marine Corps Corporal Humberto Sanchez, Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Darin Taylor Hoover, Marine Corps Lance Corporal Rylee McCollum, Marine Corps Lance Corporal Kareem Nikoui, Navy hospitalman Maxton Soviak, Marine Corps Corporal Hunter Lopez, and Marine Corps Lance Corporal Dylan Merola. Our hearts are with their families during this very tough time. Thursday was by far the worst day of Joe Biden's presidency, an avoidable tragedy and the deadliest day for American forces in Afghanistan in 10 years. Biden botched the Afghan withdrawal and now innocent people are paying the price. Biden refused to extend the August 31st deadline to get Americans out of Afghanistan, and U.S. troops have now begun withdrawing from Kabul with 350 Americans still trying to get out and that's just according to the State Department, a department with a pretty bad track record here. U.S. military last night carrying out a drone strike against an ISIS-K planner. Two ISIS-K targets were killed and one was wounded. The President saying today this strike won't be the last. There's a lot of questions about this and we're going to have a report in just a minute. The Taliban is blocking Americans from getting to the airport, and Biden is boxed in, letting it happen. We're working with the Taliban how. Biden is saying we may even have given the Taliban a list of names to let through checkpoints, or a kill list, as most people fear."

The date was movable if they didn't, and Trump's deal didn't include abandoning Bagram Air Base and pulling air support. Biden says nobody saw the Taliban takeover coming. Another lie. The Embassy, the State Department, the Intel guys warned everybody all summer, and Biden ignored them. Now, the enemy is armed to the teeth. Marines are dead and we're facing a hostage crisis, just so Joe Biden could stage a photo-op on 9/11 and claim he won the war. Now, our allies don't respect him, our enemies don't fear him, and the American people don't trust him. How long we're stuck with Biden? Only time will tell. But we're only eight months in.

      "utterance": "Well, Jesse, The Pentagon is refusing to say who exactly it killed in that drone strike in eastern Afghanistan. Officials say those two ISIS fighters were part of a cell plotting more attacks to kill more U.S. troops at the airbase in Kabul ahead of President Biden's August 31st deadline. Earlier today at The Pentagon, John Kirby called those ISIS targets quote, \"planners and facilitators.\" Words normally reserved for low ranking fighters, Jesse. A U.S. military reaper drone launch from Al Dhafra Air Base in the UAE carried out the strike in Nangarhar Province where that ISIS branch in Afghanistan is based, not far from the border with Pakistan as you can see here. The drone fired a missile at a car killing the two fighters and wounding a third. Back to nomenclature, The Pentagon officials are not calling these fighters leaders. That was notable, Jesse. I'm told the targets were not on any U.S. military kill. This is the same part of Afghanistan where President Trump ordered the MOAB, the mother of all bombs dropped on ISIS not long after taking office. The SEAL raid to kill bin Laden was launched from this area as well. President Biden approved the strike less than two days of the suicide attack that killed those 13 U.S. troops and wounded 20, over 160 Afghan civilians were killed, Afghans desperate to escape their country following the Taliban takeover. The drone mission launched a few hours before another warning from the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to tell all Americans to leave immediately. There's about 3,500 U.S. troops on the ground right now at the airport in Kabul, Jesse. They will be gone on Tuesday and the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan there for nearly 20 years will end -- Jesse."

      "utterance": "All of the above, Jesse. First, thanks for talking about my Marines and, and the families are just going through terrible grief right now and that's a tough job when you have to be KKO as they call it. The person who goes and tells the wife, she's now a widow, and the kids, they are now orphans. So without going into the stupidity of how we got here, or compromising the people on the ground, here's a very brief summary of what's happening on the ground, and where things are likely to be going in the days ahead. Thirteen flag-draped coffins arrived at Dover Air Force Base this morning. I'm told the President has a card in his pocket to remind him of the pain that people are suffering. Someone from the White House should have at least met the aircraft even though the formal presentation with the families is set for tomorrow. For this entire day, a group of brave and exhausted Americans have been trying to get hundreds of pre-manifested men, women, and children, including American citizens and to get them out through a gate at the Kabul Airport. And while the incompetent and political military establishment and The Pentagon couldn't get it out, out of the way itself, it took the President of the United States to authorize the gate to be opened. And because of our inaction and giving up authority and control to the Taliban, they're now issuing orders to our remaining assets at the airport. And if anybody thinks that every American who wants to get out has gotten out, they are dead wrong. That fact is, and you just kind of alluded to this a few minutes ago, what's going to happen in the aftermath is Americans who've already been selected and high value targets of our allies are going to be kept as hostages to make sure that a MOAB, as you just mentioned, or a Jaden doesn't land on the presidential palace and take them out. In other words, we've offered them money, we've offered them recognition, all that stuff is being talked about. But what they mostly want is to be able to humiliate this President. Here's a little brief timeline. First of all, even before the bomb went off that killed 13 Americans, we ended up with a Turks who got there first and we're supposed to stay after we left to cover our exits as it would, be they were gone. Question remains: where they warned to get out before that? Don't know that, I'm just wondering. At 12:11, today, the Chief Counsel of the White House reported that the President had to be briefed before in order to open the gate was in, and the Taliban leadership came to the airport to hold a formal meeting at the airfield. Reports from local sources said that the gate is going to close for good at 0400 tomorrow. That may or may not happen. What we do know that isn't going to happen is that there is not going to be a delay in the execution of the final lift out of the town. The Marine Corps, by the way, is already out. The 82nd and a few handful of others are the only forces on the on the ground right now at that airport. So, what are the sources says, the payment -- the payment for passing through a checkpoint is hold on, because I've got -- this is encrypted comms from these guys. The current payment for getting through the wickets, all of the checkpoints that Taliban have established is $1,500.00."

The bottom line of it is, this President is taking orders from the Taliban. This President will do whatever they tell him. And you've got to wonder why. I'll give you a couple of theories, because right now we know that in Kabul, you've got members of the Pakistani Intelligence Service, the ISI and the People's Republic of China, and they're collecting up U.S. gear, moving it across the packed border, and they're going to export it for exploitation to the PRC. Here is another thing. Everybody keeps talking nowadays about the Taliban and al-Qaeda and Haqqani and ISIS all being different. They're not. In fact, on any given moment, the person pointing a firearm at an American could well be any part of any one of those organizations. And I guess the thing that bothers me most about this thing is that we don't know whether the President is competent or not. So, one of the rumors is that there's a cell of his supporters, some of them in the media, some of his closest advisers, probably Schumer, who are actually actively thinking now it's time to invoke the 25th Amendment because that's one of the reasons why you see, so often he's being contradicted by people who basically, he's the Commander-in-Chief and they're out there contradicting what he is saying."

We knew this was coming. The U.S. Embassy warned everybody months ago to leave as soon as possible. Don't travel, we can't help you. The Taliban's rapid advance across the country started in May and more warnings from State to leave due to uncontrollable violence were issued. Intel warnings flashing that mass desertions were occurring in the Afghan Army and Taliban was closing in on Kabul. So did our Commander-in-Chief just ignore the Intel? Do nothing about it? And then tell the American people a rapid Taliban takeover was unlikely -- while that exact thing was happening? Joining me now retired Army Infantry Captain Sean Parnell, and FOX News contributor and retired Marine Corps bomb tech, Joey Jones.

They are making it impossible for our people to evac that country. And now this nation, America, the world's lone superpower is poised to leave Afghanistan leaving thousands of people behind, hundreds of American citizens. And yes, I'm tough on Joe Biden, right? My noncommissioned officers as a young lieutenant, were tough on me. Why? Because leaders, commanders make decisions. And God forbid if they make bad decisions, they could get people killed. If a Commander-in-Chief, a President of the United States makes a bad decision, they could get thousands of people killed. So, we've got a President of the United States right now that could barely make it through a conversation with the Prime Minister of Israel without looking like he's falling asleep with one of our greatest allies, how is he supposed to handle our greatest adversaries in the Chinese Communist Party or the Taliban on the battlefield right now?

I think the one thing that people haven't talked about enough and you alluded to it, Jesse, not three weeks ago, maybe a month ago, the headlines were American veterans and organizations are trying to get people home that have SIVs who are Americans and the State Department is dragging its feet. As a matter of fact, this story actually goes back even to before Biden took office, and this is bureaucracy, it is red tape, it is embassies being shut down for coronavirus. The point there is how does an administration tell us now there was no other way to do this and that we had to have chaos and by chaos, I mean, 13 dead heroes and nearly 200 Afghan dead civilians and we're talking children. People that now would die tomorrow, to stand in front of and save and damn near dead in Afghanistan. They are human beings even if they're not United States citizens. All right, they're dead. They're dead and they call that chaos and they said it was unavoidable. Any other text I got before I sat down here from a group text of Marines, everyone from mid-grade officers to mid-grade enlisted was, man, I wonder who those poor guys were in that truck? Now, I'm not saying I'm going to come in here saying there's some conspiracy theory that we didn't actually take out and ISIS-K fighter, but that's where veterans are, that's where their belief and confidence is that that was just something to get the heat off. And that's a bad place to be because if veterans in this country think that way, what do our enemies think? Did that do what it needed to? That strike was to put anyone who might attack us on pause, not to prevent it, but to psychologically put them on pause. It wasn't even our retaliation. And if our veterans aren't even really buying in, what did that do to our enemies? And so we shouldn't even have to be in that spot to begin with. And so to the men and women in Kabul, my hat's off to you, brothers and sisters. I walked down on bombs and I don't know that took the courage it takes to be in Kabul right now. And I love you.

That whole rap being woke, total joke now when you see what goes down in the rest of the world. For years, we listened to people complain about how bad the U.S. is, that the people are oppressed here. America is so evil. Men are toxic. Really? The Marines are literally rescuing immigrant babies from death. Compare America to Afghanistan. Bill Maher hit it right on the head. Listen."

I don't want to hear about micro aggressions when people are getting their heads chopped off in Afghanistan. That whole thing right out in my -- it is done."

      "utterance": "Bill Maher is often crude. He is often vulgar, but he says things that need to be said, and I am so proud of him for just taking on the far left, the America hating left, that thinks that everything that happens in this country is horrible. And he pointed out that there are so many great things in this country that don't exist anywhere else. The opportunity to come here because you want a better life and to be able to get a better life. And he talked about how that people all over the world live in squalor. They live without basic fundamental human rights, women are treated like dirt and property. And those things are foreign to us here in America. It's just remarkable that Bill Maher took on his own constituency in one sense, and basically told them where to sit."

College is now a battlefield with COVID. Kids are going back to college and a police officer intrudes into a classroom. Student not wearing a mask, he goes into a classroom and he is basically kicking this kid out. He is hoisting him out into the hallway, physically bringing him out in the hallway now. This is what we're going to have to deal with in this next semester."

    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is a little disconcerting that this has risen to the level of getting the police involved and pulling the kid out of the classroom. If the college has imposed a mask law, and perhaps they have, they have a right to do that. But if they have a kid that is not obeying it, flunk him, throw him out of school, but you don't haul him down the hall with handcuffs by a person with a gun for not wearing a mask. There are just, I think, more temperate ways to deal with somebody who is belligerent. I get on airplanes every week, Jesse, and I've got to wear a mask. Do I enjoy it? No. But if I want to fly, that's what I've got to do. So you know, I'm not going to make a big scene about it. But honestly, this idea of a cop going into a classroom and pulling a student down the hall by his feet has to be one of the most outrageous overreactions there. There are certainly better ways to deal with somebody who just doesn't want to wear the mask at school."
