Breaking tonight, there is renewed optimism that the Trump administration and House Democrats may agree on a last-minute coronavirus relief package before the election. Today's negotiations ended about an hour ago without conclusion, but a promise of another round tomorrow on specifics.  Right now, President Trump is on his way to a campaign stop in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania. The event in Erie begins at the top of the hour.  Earlier today, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi continued their narrowed differences, they narrowed them further just on how much to spend, how to do it. The question is can the president get Senate Republicans to go along with the big plan that may be agreed to.  Wall Street reacting favorably so far even on the prospect of a deal. The Dow ending up 113, it was up 350 early in the day. The S&P 500 finished ahead 16, the NASDAQ was up 37-1/2. Now, to the nitty-gritty of the talks, chief White House correspondent John Roberts standing by with the very latest on the North Lawn. Good evening, John.",

The end result is no one can feasibly challenge Google's dominance in search and search advertising.

Fox News has learned the litigation is the result of a broad investigation into Google's business practices. Officials quickly lasered in on the company's alleged anti-competitive practices.   90 percent of all web searches in America are done through Google search engine, that's because Google allows companies like Apple to include its search engine in its products for free.

The agency says 66 percent of those are being attributed to COVID-19. Researchers in the United Kingdom are preparing to infect healthy young volunteers with the virus that causes COVID-19. It's the first known use of the controversial technique to study this particular disease, and potentially, speed up the development of the vaccine. All this occurs as European authorities battle infection spikes with new lockdowns and other measures. The director of National Institutes of Health tells NPR that he is guardingly optimistic, one of the vaccine options will pass safety and efficacy standards by the end of the year, but it's very unlikely to happen before the election. The Justice Department is putting up to 3 million toward the creation of a national training center for law enforcement agencies to prevent the use of excessive force.  Officials say they hope the Minneapolis police force will be the first to take advantage of the resource. Police there have been under pressure to reform since the May 25th death of George Floyd, which touched-off mass demonstrations against police brutality around the nation. With so many more people voting by mail this election cycle, there is increasing scrutiny on how those signatures are verified and which ballots are rejected.

The Trump administration is welcoming the Russian offer and says the U.S. is ready to quickly reach an agreement. The widow of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is suing the Saudi crown prince and more than 20 accused co-conspirators over the murder of her husband. The plaintiff's lawyers say they will seek information from American officials to help prove Khashoggi's death was ordered by the top of the Saudi leadership hierarchy.

The blue states, the red states, these are all states that we kind of know how they're going to go based on the polls, where they've gone before, the gray states are the battleground states where this race will be won or lost. Now, take the average of polls tonight, 14 days from the election. And factor in how Donald Trump performed in the average of polls 14 days from the election in 2016. A number of these states he outperformed those averages. Understand that Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton, but let's put that caveat in there and give him that, that bump depending on how he performed then. If that is the factor that we're looking at, he wins tonight in Florida, in Georgia. He outperformed by three points in North Carolina, he would win by one there. He'd win overwhelmingly actually in Ohio, in Iowa, in Texas. In 2016, Donald Trump outperformed the average of polls by almost seven points -- a little bit more than seven points, actually in Wisconsin. May not be that way this time, let's just say it is based on the polls. Also tonight, based on the average of polls right now, Joe Biden would win in Nevada, in Arizona, and Minnesota. He would win Michigan and New Hampshire. Based on the average of polls tonight, considering that Donald Trump did outperform slightly in Pennsylvania, Joe Biden still would win Pennsylvania by one point, and that would mean he'd be the 46th president of the United States. That's one what-if scenario. A lot can change in 14 days. Obviously, the other thing we're watching is control of the Senate, and it is hanging on a knife's edge. Right now, the balance of power in the Senate: 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats. There's two Independents, who caucus with the Democrats. But control could flip based on a number of key races that Republicans are behind in right now. Let's take first a look at Iowa, and there is the incumbent Joni Ernst, trailing the Democrat in the recent polls by, you know, almost five points there. You've got in the state of Arizona, another key race. You saw Martha McSally out there with the president yesterday, but she's trailing Kelly, the Democratic opponent.

It's an independent agency, and there's a lot of tension between the FBI and the White House. For the FBI to say that this is not Russian disinformation I think is important. And when you have the FBI, DOJ, and other agencies, DNI, saying that it's not disinformation, you would think that the mainstream media would then at least take some interest in the story.

AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\":  We know there are a couple of things. First of all, we've had almost 30 million people already vote, and so as the pool of voters continues to shrink, last-minute issues don't have the same sort of resonance. The other issue, of course, is that Ukraine and the question of Hunter Biden's relationship with Ukraine and his father were obviously vetted pretty heavily by a Republican Senate, and they found that there maybe were some questions there, but found nothing to suggest that this was -- what we're hearing about right now is credible. No one else has been able to authenticate this. We're not seeing that those emails are being shared widely among other news sources. So to just take this story and a couple of folks and run with it, I don't think you're going to see that. The other issue is, too, is this just feels like we are just back in 2016 redux, the president wanting to make the race once again a case about change versus corruption.

He's seen in a much more favorable light than Hillary Clinton, who had to defend her relationship with that email server and the Clinton Foundation for almost the entire campaign.",

But what's really interesting, we had a poll come out today from ABC/\"Washington Post\" in North Carolina when they asked voters in North Carolina whether Cunningham's scandal, his affair, was very important to them or important to them at all, 26 percent said yes. But when asked if Tillis's support for Trump important to you, more than half of voters, 56 percent, said yes. Is control of the Senate most important issue for you, 81 percent said yes.

The end result is no one can feasibly challenge Google's dominance in search and search advertising. Barr adds this is a monumental case for the Department of Justice and, more importantly, for the American consumer. Fox News has learned the litigation is the result of a broad investigation into Google's business practices. Officials quickly lasered in on the company's alleged anti-competitive practices. 90 percent of all web searches in America are done through Google search engine, that's because Google allows companies like Apple to include its search engine in its products for free.

The agency says 66 percent of those are being attributed to COVID-19. Researchers in the United Kingdom are preparing to infect healthy young volunteers with the virus that causes COVID-19. It's the first known use of the controversial technique to study this particular disease, and potentially, speed up the development of the vaccine. All this occurs as European authorities battle infection spikes with new lockdowns and other measures. The director of National Institutes of Health tells NPR that he is guardingly optimistic, one of the vaccine options will pass safety and efficacy standards by the end of the year, but it's very unlikely to happen before the election. The Justice Department is putting up to 3 million toward the creation of a national training center for law enforcement agencies to prevent the use of excessive force. Officials say they hope the Minneapolis police force will be the first to take advantage of the resource. Police there have been under pressure to reform since the May 25th death of George Floyd, which touched-off mass demonstrations against police brutality around the nation.

The Trump administration is welcoming the Russian offer and says the U.S. is ready to quickly reach an agreement. The widow of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is suing the Saudi crown prince and more than 20 accused co-conspirators over the murder of her husband. The plaintiff's lawyers say they will seek information from American officials to help prove Khashoggi's death was ordered by the top of the Saudi leadership hierarchy.

The blue states, the red states, these are all states that we kind of know how they're going to go based on the polls, where they've gone before, the gray states are the battleground states where this race will be won or lost. Now, take the average of polls tonight, 14 days from the election. And factor in how Donald Trump performed in the average of polls 14 days from the election in 2016. A number of these states he outperformed those averages. Understand that Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton, but let's put that caveat in there and give him that, that bump depending on how he performed then. If that is the factor that we're looking at, he wins tonight in Florida, in Georgia. He outperformed by three points in North Carolina, he would win by one there. He'd win overwhelmingly actually in Ohio, in Iowa, in Texas. In 2016, Donald Trump outperformed the average of polls by almost seven points -- a little bit more than seven points, actually in Wisconsin. May not be that way this time, let's just say it is based on the polls. Also tonight, based on the average of polls right now, Joe Biden would win in Nevada, in Arizona, and Minnesota. He would win Michigan and New Hampshire. Based on the average of polls tonight, considering that Donald Trump did outperform slightly in Pennsylvania, Joe Biden still would win Pennsylvania by one point, and that would mean he'd be the 46th president of the United States. That's one what-if scenario. A lot can change in 14 days. Obviously, the other thing we're watching is control of the Senate, and it is hanging on a knife's edge. Right now, the balance of power in the Senate: 53 Republicans to 47 Democrats. There's two Independents, who caucus with the Democrats. But control could flip based on a number of key races that Republicans are behind in right now. Let's take first a look at Iowa, and there is the incumbent Joni Ernst, trailing the Democrat in the recent polls by, you know, almost five points there. You've got in the state of Arizona, another key race. You saw Martha McSally out there with the president yesterday, but she's trailing Kelly, the Democratic opponent.

One senior administration official telling us that the FBI and DOJ do concur with the Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe's assessment that Hunter Biden's laptop and the emails in question are not a part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Also one official telling us that the FBI is not investigating this as Russian disinformation. Those are little new developments that we're getting in this story that continues to evolve and we try to get to the authenticity of all of it. Let's bring in our panel, Bill Bennett, former Education Secretary, host of \"The Bill Bennett Show\" podcast, Amy Walter, national editor of the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon.\" Matthew, I want to start with you. We've seen, obviously we've been covering, going through each one of these emails, we have got authenticity on a couple of them from people in the email chain who said they got it at the time. The confirmed that. We are going piece by piece in this, but now this information about the FBI and what is and is not happening, how do you take it? MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\":  I think the FBI news is particularly important, because the FBI, as we know, is not stocked full of Trump flaks, right. It's an independent agency, and there's a lot of tension between the FBI and the White House. For the FBI to say that this is not Russian disinformation I think is important. And when you have the FBI, DOJ, and other agencies, DNI, saying that it's not disinformation, you would think that the mainstream media would then at least take some interest in the story. But you see how intimidated they are, Bret, by Joe Biden's snappish response to the CBS reporter who asked about it.

And this stuff is explosive and it is ugly. It may be the president will refer to Joe Biden as \"the big guy,\" which is how he's identified in one of these emails during the debates. But attention has to be paid to this kind of thing because Joe Biden and Hunter Biden -- maybe criminal conspiracy, maybe not, but this really stinks to high heavens, and the media has to pay attention to it if it's not too late."

But the politics of this, as you're in a closing argument 14 days before an election, how do you think that plays? AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\":  We know there are a couple of things. First of all, we've had almost 30 million people already vote, and so as the pool of voters continues to shrink, last-minute issues don't have the same sort of resonance. The other issue, of course, is that Ukraine and the question of Hunter Biden's relationship with Ukraine and his father were obviously vetted pretty heavily by a Republican Senate, and they found that there maybe were some questions there, but found nothing to suggest that this was -- what we're hearing about right now is credible. No one else has been able to authenticate this. We're not seeing that those emails are being shared widely among other news sources. So to just take this story and a couple of folks and run with it, I don't think you're going to see that. The other issue is, too, is this just feels like we are just back in 2016 redux, the president wanting to make the race once again a case about change versus corruption. But Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton, and the last few months here of the campaign, Joe Biden's overall favorable rating have been actually, or the last few weeks, have actually been ticking up. He's seen in a much more favorable light than Hillary Clinton, who had to defend her relationship with that email server and the Clinton Foundation for almost the entire campaign."

You think they'd be ignoring them? I don't think so. Let's look into it. Your job is to put sunlight on things that are ugly, and they are not doing it."

      "utterance": "OK, let's talk about campaign events that are happening or not happening. If you take a look at the schedule here, the president is on this barnstorming tour, obviously the debate is Thursday night, but you look at the calendar of what's happening day-to-day and these different rallies. There was a Biden event in North Carolina, but then there was what's called a lid, in other words, the press is told that's it for the rest of the week. You're not going to see Joe Biden or hear from him until the debate on Thursday. Today in a fundraising email, the Biden campaign put out this email, and one of the lines of struck me. It said, quote, \"We don't want to look back on this moment and wish we had done more.\" Matthew, you look at that schedule, there's a lot to do more with."

      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "Right, or at least to have the candidate present. I've never heard of a candidate taking this amount of time off in the final two weeks of a campaign. But from Biden's perspective, of course, he doesn't need to be present because he's winning. But I wonder if there's a little overconfidence there. I think it's very interesting, Bret, that Barack Obama is going to Philadelphia to try to enthuse voters, particularly in the cities, to go out for Joe Biden, because you do see, I think, a certain lack of enthusiasm among many voters for Joe Biden the person. And I think the worry from Democrats is that might lead to similar turnout from 2016 among key groups."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We should point out, Amy, that Senator Kamala Harris is out and about doing different events, but it is pretty unique. Debates, they pull candidates off the trail, but this close to Election Day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALTER",
      "utterance": "There's been nothing about this election that has been even close to normal. And it is true that, look, the Biden campaign is not counting on rallies to turn out the voters. What they are counting on is Donald Trump, and he turns out their voters, and he motivates them. And so the president at every one of these rallies does help to motivate his folks, keep them enthused, keep them interested in going out to the polls. But in this case every action doesn't have an equal and opposite reaction. We've seen in polling throughout the president's time in office that it also really engages the other side exponentially. And so for Joe Biden and the campaign, going out and doing a couple of small events is not going to garner the kind of intensity that the antipathy to President Trump will do."

Is that where we are, that this possibly could get done before Election Day with Nancy Pelosi and a Steve Mnuchin and Senate Republicans, most importantly?"

      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "It's possible but unlikely. If I can just say a word, Hamilton, not the star of the show on Broadway but the real one, said the most important thing in the executive is energy, energy in the executive. Is it really prudent, does it really make sense to take off the last week before the election like a kindergarten kid with your sippy cup lying down taking a nap? One thing that Donald Trump has is energy, and those crowds are enormous. And I think it's a pretty good predictor. Joe Biden is not taking advantage of the situation. People are worried in his campaign how much prep does he need to say come on, man. He's already good at that line down."

      "utterance": "I think they are very untied. A lot of people think, oh, are they tied with Trump, meaning tied together. I think that's highly overrated. I probably helped some. I don't think I heard anybody. But I don't view them as being tied together, I never did. I think that you can have very separate. I could do fantastically well in a state, and we could have a Senate candidate that does unbelievably badly."

      "utterance": "Bret, I'm watching the Senate race in Colorado between Cory Gardner, the Republican, and John Hickenlooper, the former governor now running as the Democrat. I think this race is exemplary of where we are on a nationwide scale. Gardner is a great campaigner. If this is were a personality contest he would win in a landslide. He's just a better candidate than Hickenlooper is. But because of population change in Colorado and the suburbs swing away from the Republican Party, it looks like he's in trouble in November."

      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "He's been able to pull together coalitions before. Maybe in this case it means that he needs to separate himself a little bit from President Trump, but I think in a blue nation on election night, Gardner would probably be in trouble."

    {
      "speaker": "WALTER",
      "utterance": "I'm sticking with the theme that Matthew brought up, which there used to be an all politics is local theme to Senate races and House races, but now all politics is national. I'm looking at the North Carolina Senate race between Republican incumbent Thom Tillis. Like Cory Gardner, he's a freshman who came in in 2014. He's up against Cal Cunningham now, the Democrat. Cal Cunningham got into a bit of hot water about a week or so ago. Texts came out that he was sharing with a woman who is not his wife. But here's what's really interesting -- and there was talk that was going to hurt his chances in the Senate race. But what's really interesting, we had a poll come out today from ABC/\"Washington Post\" in North Carolina when they asked voters in North Carolina whether Cunningham's scandal, his affair, was very important to them or important to them at all, 26 percent said yes. But when asked if Tillis's support for Trump important to you, more than half of voters, 56 percent, said yes. Is control of the Senate most important issue for you, 81 percent said yes. So this is one of those races where the nationalist going to trump the local."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We should point out, there is also a poll out today that has that race tied, also the presidential race tied there. We were looking at the Real Clear Politics average of polls over recent weeks. Bill?"

    {
      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "Yes, since I'm sitting in North Carolina, just a word, one other thing about Cunningham. He wasn't just sleeping with another man's wife. That man served in the military with Cunningham, and the code of military justice applies here. He may be court-martialed for his behavior. In North Carolina, they remember a guy named John Edwards, that duplicity, I don't think they want to do that again."

      "utterance": "Amy beat me to the punch in North Carolina. Michigan is the one I'm looking at, and that's going to be very interesting. John James is in a challenging position. He's the young, black Republican, and Gary Peters is the establishment Democrat, and James is closing the gap and the enthusiasm is great. The thing I would say there is you remember the Republican convention, there was a real effort to reach out to black America. And if there's any increase in the polls of support for Donald Trump among black American, black men, it looks like they may support him more, three, four point, it could make a huge difference in the final result. This could be a game changer, we could have a new star, too."
