Vice President Pence as you just saw, saying he has great hope for great progress in expanding coronavirus testing throughout the country. The vice president just finished briefing the media in the White House briefing room.  The House has approved an emergency spending bill as two more Americans die from the virus. We'll have details shortly. In the presidential race, you can call it consolidation Wednesday after a dramatic Super Tuesday for Democratic presidential candidates. But we begin tonight leading off with a rare and stern rebuke from the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court to the Senate minority leader.  It comes as the high court jumps back into the abortion debate. Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\", Shannon Bream, has the specifics, and it was rare.

You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\" Well, that prompted this response from Chief Justice John Roberts, \"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All members of the court will continue to do their job without fear or favor, from whatever quarter.\" And just moments ago, a spokesperson for Schumer said his comments, \"we're a reference to the political price Senate Republicans will pay for putting these justices on the court, and a warning that the justices will unleash a major grassroots movement on the issue of reproductive rights against the decision.\"   Only then accused Roberts of not taking -- of taking sides for not calling out President Trump for his comments last week. The Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor should have to recuse themselves after they made comments about the president.

In 2016, the Supreme Court struck down similar portions of a Texas law. Justice Ginsburg questioned the real aim of the Louisiana law and noted how challenging it can be for an abortion provider to gain the necessary hospital privileges. \"Abortion providers will never, if that's -- if they're not also doing obstetrics and gynecology, they will never qualify because their patients don't go to the hospital.\"",

Its second-largest point game ever even when the coronavirus concerns are growing, it makes you question what's really been driving the market volatility? Well, the virus definitely spurred selling, but fears happened to coincide roughly with Bernie Sanders, winning the Nevada caucus. Wall Street worrying that he was looking like the front runner. But after Super Tuesday in Biden's upward momentum, investor's takeaway is that Joe Biden is back in the game and a Bernie Sanders nomination is not a slam dunk.  Now, with Mike Bloomberg also dropping out today pledging his support to Biden, a market assessment is clearing the field as a good thing. But what's ironic is that Sanders would be the one that Wall Street things would be easier for Trump to beat. At the same time, Biden's more moderate approach would be what the market would want if a Democrat were to take the White House. Also, being digested at this time, the emergency half-point rate cut from the Fed yesterday. Well, it's not a cure off for the market, it definitely will lend some support. Healthcare stocks rallying today, and that's because the market is less concerned about Medicare-for-All, that's a Sanders' proposal. And big tech was hired too because Sanders has been vocal about severely regulating and even breaking up technology companies. Still, there's an amber light flashing, and that's the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury notes still hovering at all-time lows. So, as investors buy stocks, they buy bonds too for protection, and it's a sign that the volatility may not be over just yet, Bret.",

Japan's government has opened part of the last town that had been off- limits due to radiation since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, nine years ago. It's considered a symbolic move showing the region's recovery ahead of the Tokyo Olympics if they are going forward.

He says that if you speak in any way about judges, like a judge should recuse himself or herself because of a conflict of interest that that is inappropriate, and yet here he is actually threatening these people. But more than anything, I think the problem should be that what we should expect of Supreme Court justices is that they faithfully interpret the law and the Constitution. This is an issue of whether the Constitution prohibits basic standards of care for abortion clinics. Chuck Schumer thinks that he would like the court to have a particular outcome that is extraconstitutional.

And politics, there is nothing wrong with a little rough politics, but this is not the kind of politics that the American people signed up for it. And Democrat or Republican, pro-choice or pro-life, it was wrong of Senator Schumer to say that. I'm glad the chief justice shot back.

It comes as the high court jumps back into the abortion debate. Fox News chief legal correspondent and anchor of \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\", Shannon Bream, has the specifics, and it was rare. Good evening, Shannon."

      "speaker": "SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's the right word for this, Bret. And it started when the Senate's top Democrat Chuck Schumer said this at a rally outside the Supreme Court as the justices were hearing a heated abortion case inside, \"I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\" Well, that prompted this response from Chief Justice John Roberts, \"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All members of the court will continue to do their job without fear or favor, from whatever quarter.\" And just moments ago, a spokesperson for Schumer said his comments, \"we're a reference to the political price Senate Republicans will pay for putting these justices on the court, and a warning that the justices will unleash a major grassroots movement on the issue of reproductive rights against the decision.\" Only then accused Roberts of not taking -- of taking sides for not calling out President Trump for his comments last week. The Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor should have to recuse themselves after they made comments about the president. And it all comes against with backdrop of a high profile abortion case argued today."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "From the moment Donald Trump won the presidency, the left has been warning that his appointments to the Supreme Court would be aimed at one thing, overturning Roe v. Wade. Today, the justices including two appointed by the president, heard the case of a Louisiana law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics. In 2016, the Supreme Court struck down similar portions of a Texas law. Justice Ginsburg questioned the real aim of the Louisiana law and noted how challenging it can be for an abortion provider to gain the necessary hospital privileges. \"Abortion providers will never, if that's -- if they're not also doing obstetrics and gynecology, they will never qualify because their patients don't go to the hospital.\""

      "speaker": "NANCY NORTHUP, PRESIDENT, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "But there's a chance that justices may never get to the merits of the case. That's because none of the plaintiffs to the case are patients, instead, they're an abortion clinic and group of anonymous doctors fighting the Louisiana requirements. Justice Alito spent several minutes questioning whether those doctors could appropriately challenge the very regulatory framework supporters say was designed to protect the health and safety of clinic patients, \"You think that if the plaintiff actually has interests that are directly contrary to those of the -- those individuals on whose behalf the plaintiff is claiming to sue, nevertheless that plaintiff can have standing? Pro-life advocates argue this case isn't about overturning Roe v. Wade, but instead about protecting women who do seek abortions."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And he said you will pay the price. I mean, really the only remedy that he would have to go after them at this point would be an impeachment. Other than that, it sounded threatening enough to the chief justice that he thought it was something that needed to be addressed. He very rarely does this, as we've noted. Now, he did say something to brush back President Trump, when President Trump referred to a judge as an Obama judge, because he'd been appointed by President Obama. The chief then, saying, we don't have Obama judges, or Trump or Bush judges. We're all just trying to do a neutral job and that's what the judiciary does. So, another rare statement from him today, we don't get them often. Bret."

Its second-largest point game ever even when the coronavirus concerns are growing, it makes you question what's really been driving the market volatility? Well, the virus definitely spurred selling, but fears happened to coincide roughly with Bernie Sanders, winning the Nevada caucus. Wall Street worrying that he was looking like the front runner. But after Super Tuesday in Biden's upward momentum, investor's takeaway is that Joe Biden is back in the game and a Bernie Sanders nomination is not a slam dunk. Now, with Mike Bloomberg also dropping out today pledging his support to Biden, a market assessment is clearing the field as a good thing. But what's ironic is that Sanders would be the one that Wall Street things would be easier for Trump to beat. At the same time, Biden's more moderate approach would be what the market would want if a Democrat were to take the White House. Also, being digested at this time, the emergency half-point rate cut from the Fed yesterday. Well, it's not a cure off for the market, it definitely will lend some support. Healthcare stocks rallying today, and that's because the market is less concerned about Medicare-for-All, that's a Sanders' proposal. And big tech was hired too because Sanders has been vocal about severely regulating and even breaking up technology companies. Still, there's an amber light flashing, and that's the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury notes still hovering at all-time lows. So, as investors buy stocks, they buy bonds too for protection, and it's a sign that the volatility may not be over just yet, Bret."

Turkish authorities say one person was killed and five wounded by fire coming from the Greek side. In assertion, the Greek government strongly rejects as fake news. Japan's government has opened part of the last town that had been off- limits due to radiation since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, nine years ago.

All members of the court will continue to do their job without fear or favor from whatever quarter.\" A Schumer spokesperson responded, saying \"women's health care rights are at stake, and Americans from every corner of the country are in anguish about what the court might do to them. For Justice Roberts to follow the right wing's deliberate misinterpretation of what Senator Schumer said while remaining silent when President Trump attacked Justices Sotomayor and Ginsburg last shows Justice Roberts does not just call balls and strikes.\" So let's begin there with our panel, Bill McGurn, columnist for \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" former Tennessee Congressman Harold Ford Jr., currently chairman of RX Saver.

Check the tape. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": He clearly threatened, and it was a violent threat, and that's wrong to do that. It is also incredibly hypocritical. He says that if you speak in any way about judges, like a judge should recuse himself or herself because of a conflict of interest that that is inappropriate, and yet here he is actually threatening these people. But more than anything, I think the problem should be that what we should expect of Supreme Court justices is that they faithfully interpret the law and the Constitution. This is an issue of whether the Constitution prohibits basic standards of care for abortion clinics. Chuck Schumer thinks that he would like the court to have a particular outcome that is extraconstitutional. And that threat to the Constitution is actually worse than any threat that he might be making."

However, you can't incite violence. And one can make the case, whether he meant it or not, he is encouraging a kind of activity. The appropriate thing for young Justin Goodman, the press secretary, would have been, look, he didn't mean that. What he meant was this. But they almost sound like they doubled down on this. And politics, there is nothing wrong with a little rough politics, but this is not the kind of politics that the American people signed up for it. And Democrat or Republican, pro-choice or pro-life, it was wrong of Senator Schumer to say that. I'm glad the chief justice shot back. And I hope if there are times where he's not calling balls and strikes, that Senator Schumer will call the chief justice and say please say something about this.

He not only won South Carolina but he won it big. Then he gave a very vigorous victory speech where he looked good, and then he went into Super Tuesday, the great benefit without a debate in between where he might embarrass himself. So it was a perfect storm. And it completely flipped the narrative. A week ago if we were on here we would be saying how the moderates are splitting up the vote and giving it to Bernie.

He probably had a more legitimate argument a few years ago when the superdelegates were able to vote early, advantaged Secretary Clinton. I was for Secretary Clinton then. Make the case for why you think your message is best and your narrative and your ideas are the best America. Stop playing the victim. You want to talk about victims in this country, people who are struggling to pay their light bill. My friends and family back in Tennessee dealing with devastation of a tornado. Those are the victims, not you because you're concerned that a few people got out of the race. Lay out where you want to take the country. Let Democrats have a choice.

Coming out of Nevada I think people really thought that they were in a bad place. They needed to do something big and they did it. It wasn't just that Biden had to win South Carolina, he had to win big. Clyburn coming out and saying we really need to have as much of the vote here as possible was huge.

His challenge was how he performed in the debates. I think people saw these ads and they were looking for something different. And for whatever set of reasons, I thought he did a great job with you the other night down in Virginia, you and Martha, he was fantastic. If he had done that in the debates, we might be having a different conversation. Five days ago Joe Biden's campaign was not only on life support, we were all just ready to go to church and say it is going to be over here very soon. Now he's the frontrunner. But we have got a ways to go. If you are Bernie Sanders, don't be a crybaby. Lay out what you want to do for the country. And if Democrats see fit to support you, they will.

Which is why if you're Sanders, why didn't make the case today why you should be president, not how you were beat up on and done wrong by some Democrats? Biden, also, to your point, the anti-Sanders thing is about his ideas. It is nothing against him personally. So Biden now has to understand he has to deliver a message. The economy is moving in a good direction. How do you make the case that earning, owning, and working are good things, and Democrats can produce for people? That is the challenge for Democrats. And if Biden can do that, he can beat Sanders. If not, Sanders will remain a formidable force in the race."
