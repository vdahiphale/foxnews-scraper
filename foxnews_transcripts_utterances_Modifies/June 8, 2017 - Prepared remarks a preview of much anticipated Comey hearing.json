It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We're just 13 hours away from one of the most highly anticipated Senate hearings in recent memory. Tomorrow, former FBI Director James Comey will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss his private conversations with President Donald Trump. It will be the first time Mr. Comey has spoken publicly since the President fired him on May 9th. We are already getting a preview about what to expect from Mr. Comey.  And chief national correspondent Ed Henry has the details from the White House tonight. Ed, what do we say?",

      "sentences": "Well, good evening, guys. A pretty good day for President Trump today because top Intel officials testified and sort of a preamble to this on The Hill and suggested that the commander-in-chief did not improperly pressured them to interfere with this Russia probe and the teaser we are getting of James Comey's testimony tomorrow -- backs up the commander-in-chief's account that then FBI director told him several times he was not under investigation.  And even when Comey will detail his February Oval Office meeting with the President where Mr. Trump asked that he let the probe of General Michael Flynn go, Comey and top advisors did not share this with FBI agents. Comey says, because, quote, \"We also concluded that given that it was a one-on- one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account.\" Signaling that even he admits it's a high bar to prove obstruction of justice. But even so, there could be real political damage to this president as Comey testifies about their January dinner, for example. He is going to testify, quote, \"A few minutes later, the President said I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. I did not move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence.\" Awkward and a bit dramatic perhaps from Comey which is why advisors for the President are telling me tonight they are bracing for two things tomorrow.  Number one, even if it turns out to be a nothing-burger, the mainstream media can build up the drama so much to make it look like it was devastating for the President and the other thing is, even if it turns out to be a relatively good day for the President, he can mess it up by live tweeting the hearing and making matters worse -- guys.",

So, if there were any other witness there, any other recording, there really isn't anything to contradict or provide an inconsistent statement to what the President said occurred in the conversation and by this way, multiple times, multiple occasions, he was assured in fact that he was not the subject of an investigation, so it shows them truthfulness on the part of the President and I think it diminishes any kinds of supposed, you know, motive or intent to say that oh, he wanted to fire Comey because, you know, he was under investigation by the Russians. So, at least in terms of the President, that gives him some cover there and validates his statement. So, I think that was important.",

Everybody out there on that table, said that there is no effort by anybody at the White House to influence any of their investigations. This post-story is fake news. It didn't happen. So, I think a lot of Democrats are sitting around just waiting for the next thing to happen because they don't have anything going on right now.",

The civil liberties faction who hate surveillance operate on a lie: that security infringes on freedom. No, security enhances freedom, which insures our survival. Especially now when we are at war with a disease. Now, libertarians love to twist the Ben Franklin quote when he said that, \"Those who would give up liberty to purchase safety deserve neither.\" It's not about surveillance. But a tax dispute over who pays for frontier defense in Pennsylvania. Ben would have been fine with the NSA. What civil libertarians miss is our enemies realize that our love of liberty makes us vulnerable to their apocalyptic goals. They use our dedication to freedom to infiltrate, kill and then inevitably rid us of that very same freedom. So, what's the answer? We must realize that the survival of liberty requires a coexisting exception, one that allows us to stop the attacks on said liberty. This co-existing exception should sit beside our rights. Think of it as a bouncer whose job is to stop those people whose belief systems run counter to our freedom. So these anti-terror programs are not in conflict with liberty but act as a tougher, more muscular pal, there to help, making sure that you are safe from dirty nukes, bio-terror and beheadings. Because it's hard to be free when you are dead. K.G., are you tired of hearing this security infringing freedom argument?

It's 9 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We're just 13 hours away from one of the most highly anticipated Senate hearings in recent memory. Tomorrow, former FBI Director James Comey will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss his private conversations with President Donald Trump. It will be the first time Mr. Comey has spoken publicly since the President fired him on May 9th. We are already getting a preview about what to expect from Mr. Comey. And chief national correspondent Ed Henry has the details from the White House tonight. Ed, what do we say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Well, good evening, guys. A pretty good day for President Trump today because top Intel officials testified and sort of a preamble to this on The Hill and suggested that the commander-in-chief did not improperly pressured them to interfere with this Russia probe and the teaser we are getting of James Comey's testimony tomorrow -- backs up the commander-in-chief's account that then FBI director told him several times he was not under investigation. And even when Comey will detail his February Oval Office meeting with the President where Mr. Trump asked that he let the probe of General Michael Flynn go, Comey and top advisors did not share this with FBI agents. Comey says, because, quote, \"We also concluded that given that it was a one-on- one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account.\" Signaling that even he admits it's a high bar to prove obstruction of justice. But even so, there could be real political damage to this president as Comey testifies about their January dinner, for example. He is going to testify, quote, \"A few minutes later, the President said I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. I did not move, speak or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence.\" Awkward and a bit dramatic perhaps from Comey which is why advisors for the President are telling me tonight they are bracing for two things tomorrow. Number one, even if it turns out to be a nothing-burger, the mainstream media can build up the drama so much to make it look like it was devastating for the President and the other thing is, even if it turns out to be a relatively good day for the President, he can mess it up by live tweeting the hearing and making matters worse -- guys."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes, and that's why the attorney came out and made these the President feels vindicated because what so far that we have been able to review and that prepared statement which is quite detailed is that the statements are consistent with what the President said transpired between the two of them. So, if there were any other witness there, any other recording, there really isn't anything to contradict or provide an inconsistent statement to what the President said occurred in the conversation and by this way, multiple times, multiple occasions, he was assured in fact that he was not the subject of an investigation, so it shows them truthfulness on the part of the President and I think it diminishes any kinds of supposed, you know, motive or intent to say that oh, he wanted to fire Comey because, you know, he was under investigation by the Russians. So, at least in terms of the President, that gives him some cover there and validates his statement. So, I think that was important."

So, as far as it goes, saying that it was concerning. That was it. But never did he feel that this was something that he had to do or was compelled, you know, to do.

I don't think so. I think he is going to stick to his script and exactly what he said today which is based on his accounts that he took. That were right after contemporaneous in time with his conversations with the President. So, there you, that suggests reliability, and credibility. And you are hearing it from the man himself. This is what happens. These are the facts. And I will also tell you subjectively what I felt at the time, which was that he didn't feel that any other action should be taken going forward, that he didn't find any wrongdoing on the part of the President and he didn't think that the President was trying to end an investigation or, you know, influence him in that way."

Of course these guys don't want to go up there and say what their private conversations were with the commander-in-chief, in front of the entire world. That's obvious. Today was just another nail in the coffin for this so-called Russian-Trump conspiracy. Everybody out there on that table, said that there is no effort by anybody at the White House to influence any of their investigations. This post-story is fake news. It didn't happen.

But a tax dispute over who pays for frontier defense in Pennsylvania. Ben would have been fine with the NSA. What civil libertarians miss is our enemies realize that our love of liberty makes us vulnerable to their apocalyptic goals. They use our dedication to freedom to infiltrate, kill and then inevitably rid us of that very same freedom. So, what's the answer? We must realize that the survival of liberty requires a coexisting exception, one that allows us to stop the attacks on said liberty. This co-existing exception should sit beside our rights. Think of it as a bouncer whose job is to stop those people whose belief systems run counter to our freedom. So these anti-terror programs are not in conflict with liberty but act as a tougher, more muscular pal, there to help, making sure that you are safe from dirty nukes, bio-terror and beheadings.

When the initial surveillance was unveiled or reported, I think it was The New York Times who broke that story -- it was huge news and civil libertarians were furious and there were protests on the streets and President Bush was a tyrant, shredding the constitution and then President Obama expanded the program.

President Obama talking about the Paris Accords, we need to give our children a fighting chance. It's not predictable, cheap happy clich, that the left always uses.

It will have almost negligible effects on the climate over a hundred years so actually if you vote against the Paris accord, you are trying to give children a fighting chance. And if you are for the Paris accord, you want children to die. How do you feel?"
