      "sentences": "But we're here. We are here. Yes. Oh my god. Happy glorious, Monday. It's day one of our second week of the no- audience shows. I guess we really should lower ticket prices. This is getting ridiculous. Yes. Well, it's one of the great moments in education. Apparently a mother in Texas has been accused of putting her son who tested positive for COVID in the trunk of her car to prevent him from -- or her from being exposed to his virus. So that's kind of awesome. Throwing your kid in the trunk of your car like a set of jumper cables. You know, I think we finally found a woman who can be Julie Banderas for mother of the year. Now, she faces charges of child endangerment. The woman in Texas not Julie, but don't give up yet. Don't give up yet, Banderas. It could still happen for you. Yes, still tonight. But after she received -- after she arrived to the COVID tested site with her 13-year-old boy in the back of her car, that raised some concerns. According to the arrest warrant, she brought her son to the drive-through site, told the director of health services that our brat was in the trunk so she wouldn't get exposed while driving. When the police were alerted, that kid was in the trunk. He was freed unharmed. No word if the kid's name is Jack. Just look over at Kat, she doesn't know what I'm referring to. Now, you might think, you know, let's hope this lady's not around other kids. Which is what you usually think about when you're talking about CNN producers. But here you'd be wrong. She's a high school English teacher, but has now been placed on administrative leave, which means she gets paid to watch the Hallmark Channel. And worse, this trend of isolation in odd places seems to be catching on.",

      "sentences": "Fact is we're living in a time where teachers unions are happily sacrificing the education, health and safety of children in order to protect themselves. The claimants (INAUDIBLE) dangerous to go back to class. And that would be true if we were talking about the violence, but they're not. They're using COVID as an excuse to lounge at home watching The View. Day drinking until Joy starts looking human. Meanwhile, for the fourth consecutive day, Chicago public schools have canceled classes as unions refuse to agree when to bring the teachers back into the classroom. Even though everyone from nurses, to cashiers, to truck drivers, to exotic dancers, Julie, have been back in work for months. Some of us doing all four of those jobs in the same day. But maybe the teacher staying at home is a good thing, right? There's anything we got out of remote learning, it's that a student's chances of learning is remote. And why is that? Well, our education system is the only system exempt from the one tool that makes all of us better. That's competition. Well, our education system and late night talk show hosts. Thanks to me, there's really no competition there either. Patting myself on the back but my arms are short. Lacking competition, the schools and their unions are free to do whatever the hell they want. Students be damned. And if your family doesn't like it, you can't take your business elsewhere. Imagine if this kind of mentality existed in other arenas, not just public schools. Well, in fact, it does. See the Department of Motor Vehicles or Cuba. Neither known for their short lines and highly motivated workforce. Fact is when you only have one choice to pick from, that choice benefits the entity that's offering it. It's like being the best looking man at Fox News. It's not that you're handsome, but you're handsome by default. Or maybe you live in a small town with only one cable company. Good luck if it goes out during the storm. The cable company will be in no rush to fix it because well, who are you going to go to if you're unsatisfied? But if there are two cable companies, it's amazing how much faster (BLEEP) gets done. Now instead of waiting for the cable guy from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. they got it down to 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. And that's the public school system for you. They can abandon your kids because where are you going to go? Teach them yourself with that hour you have free between your day job as a cashier at Wal-Mart or your night job stripping in nude prudes? Politicians don't care. They work to defeat school choice while enjoying that choice for their sniffling offspring. Yes, they're precious buffy gets decent instructors and actual books to read, instead of metal detectors, mask mandates, and barely literate teachers who can't be fired. But to our leaders, a bad education is like high crime. If it's not their problem, then it's no problem at all. Well, it's time to change that. As one famous Democrat said, never let a crisis go to waste. I believe it was Britney Spears. And even she knows more about education. She's 40 years old and still fits into a Catholic schoolgirl outfit. That's something we both have in common. But the pandemic has exposed an educational system in crisis. So this is a perfect time for a new movement. A parental Tea Party that stops paying into systems that poison your children intellectually. while the teachers sit at home poison themselves with Doritos. It's time to fund the students and not the schools. And then the schools will fight for the student's money. But deny those school boards your tax cash and watch them wither and drop away like a frozen word from Bette Midler's neck. Competition will make all schools and all teachers better. They may not want it the way your kid didn't want spinach, but it wasn't up to him. So let's jam it down their throat and watch the benefits take hold. Competition makes it so it's not up to them. It's up to you, the parent. And that's the only solution we really have left. Aside from locking kids in the trunk of a car with their laptop and a bag lunch which is my kind of homeschooling.",

So my whole thing is that you're not incentivizing these schools to make the right choices, you're incentivizing them to be better or for these teachers to actually teach. You're enabling them to have this type of indoctrination and shut down when they want because they have ultimate control. So I believe in the idea that the money should follow the child. It shouldn't be based on if you live in a certain neighborhood, or you have a certain community that you're in that you're forced go to these schools, they should really be about what is best for your child.

American Airlines is getting called out online for responding to a woman who complained about a pilot who had a Let's Go Brandon sticker on his luggage. It all started after she tweeted a picture of it, asking if the airline accepts, \"Cowardly rhetoric on their crew luggage when they're in uniform.\" And that she and other passengers were disgusted. Now what the airline could have done was nothing or said, so what, just get on the plane, you stupid, silly lady. But instead American responded, thank you for bringing this to our attention. And we want to get this to the right team. Please D.M. any additional details. Stupid people. The women then posted screenshots of her conversation with the airline reps where of course, she complained some more accusing the pilot of supporting insurrection against the U.S. government. Yes. Now stickers or violence. Then despite being assured that an internal review of the pilot would occur, which trials, she kept complaining. Now some people on Twitter already pointed out it's hard for the airline to justify censoring a Let's Go Brandon sticker when they endorse a Black Lives Matter pin for staffers and having a similar option for those who want to express support for law enforcement. Also, Let's Go Brandon is a joke, a joke making fun of the embarrassing arrogant frequently clueless codgers currently shuffling around the White House. Thinking let's go Brandon is a violent call to action. It's like expecting Julie Banderas to do something nice for other people. It's just a stretch. That was totally unnecessary, but it was in there in the prompter. Which means this is where we're headed. Complaining about anything and everything.",

What's scary, that lady is a Supreme Court justice yet it appears she has the B.S. detector have a cat lady who thinks astrology is a science.

The 20-year-old Henig says he refused hormone therapy, so he could continue competing on the woman's team. I guess as a woman. Talk about pro-choice. One of the many shocked parents in the stands commented: \"Everything is messed up. I can't wrap my head around this. The N.C.-two A, N.C.-two A? Double A, whatever. To battery. Seems to need to do something about this. They need to put science into the decision and discussion. So, how do we follow the science when we're in uncharted waters, literally? I've read this story five times and I'm still not sure what just happens. Who won a guy or a girl? Also, since when is swimming as sports? And why can't dolphins participate? The whole thing smacks of speciesism, what do you think dolphin? Is this fair? You don't get that on \"FACE THE NATION\", Kat. Is it time to ban all sports, including swimming, even though swimming probably isn't a sport, but we should ban it just in case?",

If you put me into a fight, into any women's sports, regardless of me taking testosterone, I'm going to dump you know, demolish competition.

This is getting ridiculous. Yes. Well, it's one of the great moments in education. Apparently a mother in Texas has been accused of putting her son who tested positive for COVID in the trunk of her car to prevent him from -- or her from being exposed to his virus. So that's kind of awesome. Throwing your kid in the trunk of your car like a set of jumper cables. You know, I think we finally found a woman who can be Julie Banderas for mother of the year. Now, she faces charges of child endangerment. The woman in Texas not Julie, but don't give up yet. Don't give up yet, Banderas. It could still happen for you. Yes, still tonight. But after she received -- after she arrived to the COVID tested site with her 13-year-old boy in the back of her car, that raised some concerns. According to the arrest warrant, she brought her son to the drive-through site, told the director of health services that our brat was in the trunk so she wouldn't get exposed while driving. When the police were alerted, that kid was in the trunk. He was freed unharmed. No word if the kid's name is Jack. Just look over at Kat, she doesn't know what I'm referring to. Now, you might think, you know, let's hope this lady's not around other kids. Which is what you usually think about when you're talking about CNN producers. But here you'd be wrong. She's a high school English teacher, but has now been placed on administrative leave, which means she gets paid to watch the Hallmark Channel. And worse, this trend of isolation in odd places seems to be catching on."

      "utterance": "Fact is we're living in a time where teachers unions are happily sacrificing the education, health and safety of children in order to protect themselves. The claimants (INAUDIBLE) dangerous to go back to class. And that would be true if we were talking about the violence, but they're not. They're using COVID as an excuse to lounge at home watching The View. Day drinking until Joy starts looking human. Meanwhile, for the fourth consecutive day, Chicago public schools have canceled classes as unions refuse to agree when to bring the teachers back into the classroom. Even though everyone from nurses, to cashiers, to truck drivers, to exotic dancers, Julie, have been back in work for months. Some of us doing all four of those jobs in the same day. But maybe the teacher staying at home is a good thing, right? There's anything we got out of remote learning, it's that a student's chances of learning is remote. And why is that? Well, our education system is the only system exempt from the one tool that makes all of us better. That's competition. Well, our education system and late night talk show hosts. Thanks to me, there's really no competition there either. Patting myself on the back but my arms are short. Lacking competition, the schools and their unions are free to do whatever the hell they want. Students be damned. And if your family doesn't like it, you can't take your business elsewhere. Imagine if this kind of mentality existed in other arenas, not just public schools. Well, in fact, it does. See the Department of Motor Vehicles or Cuba. Neither known for their short lines and highly motivated workforce. Fact is when you only have one choice to pick from, that choice benefits the entity that's offering it. It's like being the best looking man at Fox News. It's not that you're handsome, but you're handsome by default. Or maybe you live in a small town with only one cable company. Good luck if it goes out during the storm. The cable company will be in no rush to fix it because well, who are you going to go to if you're unsatisfied? But if there are two cable companies, it's amazing how much faster (BLEEP) gets done. Now instead of waiting for the cable guy from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. they got it down to 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. And that's the public school system for you. They can abandon your kids because where are you going to go? Teach them yourself with that hour you have free between your day job as a cashier at Wal-Mart or your night job stripping in nude prudes? Politicians don't care. They work to defeat school choice while enjoying that choice for their sniffling offspring. Yes, they're precious buffy gets decent instructors and actual books to read, instead of metal detectors, mask mandates, and barely literate teachers who can't be fired. But to our leaders, a bad education is like high crime. If it's not their problem, then it's no problem at all. Well, it's time to change that. As one famous Democrat said, never let a crisis go to waste. I believe it was Britney Spears. And even she knows more about education. She's 40 years old and still fits into a Catholic schoolgirl outfit. That's something we both have in common. But the pandemic has exposed an educational system in crisis. So this is a perfect time for a new movement. A parental Tea Party that stops paying into systems that poison your children intellectually. while the teachers sit at home poison themselves with Doritos. It's time to fund the students and not the schools. And then the schools will fight for the student's money. But deny those school boards your tax cash and watch them wither and drop away like a frozen word from Bette Midler's neck. Competition will make all schools and all teachers better. They may not want it the way your kid didn't want spinach, but it wasn't up to him. So let's jam it down their throat and watch the benefits take hold. Competition makes it so it's not up to them. It's up to you, the parent. And that's the only solution we really have left. Aside from locking kids in the trunk of a car with their laptop and a bag lunch which is my kind of homeschooling."

You know, we put in billions and billions of dollars into COVID prevention, all these schools, and yet, we're still being shut down and the school board to be able to run autonomously without any parental input. So my whole thing is that you're not incentivizing these schools to make the right choices, you're incentivizing them to be better or for these teachers to actually teach. You're enabling them to have this type of indoctrination and shut down when they want because they have ultimate control. So I believe in the idea that the money should follow the child. It shouldn't be based on if you live in a certain neighborhood, or you have a certain community that you're in that you're forced go to these schools, they should really be about what is best for your child.

It all started after she tweeted a picture of it, asking if the airline accepts, \"Cowardly rhetoric on their crew luggage when they're in uniform.\" And that she and other passengers were disgusted. Now what the airline could have done was nothing or said, so what, just get on the plane, you stupid, silly lady. But instead American responded, thank you for bringing this to our attention. And we want to get this to the right team. Please D.M. any additional details. Stupid people. The women then posted screenshots of her conversation with the airline reps where of course, she complained some more accusing the pilot of supporting insurrection against the U.S. government. Yes. Now stickers or violence. Then despite being assured that an internal review of the pilot would occur, which trials, she kept complaining. Now some people on Twitter already pointed out it's hard for the airline to justify censoring a Let's Go Brandon sticker when they endorse a Black Lives Matter pin for staffers and having a similar option for those who want to express support for law enforcement. Also, Let's Go Brandon is a joke, a joke making fun of the embarrassing arrogant frequently clueless codgers currently shuffling around the White House. Thinking let's go Brandon is a violent call to action. It's like expecting Julie Banderas to do something nice for other people. It's just a stretch. That was totally unnecessary, but it was in there in the prompter. Which means this is where we're headed. Complaining about anything and everything."

They also reported she's suffering from confusion and incoherent speech. But that has nothing to do with COVID. Now, if you'll remember, she blamed the criticism she faced on Republican's deranged sexual frustration and being mad that they can't date her. Yes, that's why. So, maybe COVID infected or out of jealousy, who knows? Now, you have to stay six feet away, perverts, but doctors recommend staying so far away, you can't hear her either. So, from our clueless Cupid to a justice who's just playing stupid last Friday, during the hearing, Biden's vaccine mandates Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, \"We have over 100,000 Children, which we've never had before in serious condition and many on ventilators.\" Well, that's not true. It's not even close. And we have no idea where she got that crazy number. What's scary, that lady is a Supreme Court justice yet it appears she has the B.S. detector have a cat lady who thinks astrology is a science. But not to be outdone, Justice Breyer, claimed masks in vaccines would prevent all cases of COVID. This when the massive vaccinated are seeing more breakthrough cases than the southern border.

I've read this story five times and I'm still not sure what just happens. Who won a guy or a girl? Also, since when is swimming as sports? And why can't dolphins participate? The whole thing smacks of speciesism, what do you think dolphin? Is this fair? You don't get that on \"FACE THE NATION\", Kat.

It's something that's tested for the Olympics to ensure that it's free and fair competition. But, but when you're talking about biological men who are competing in women's sports, you're basically already creating an unfair advantage. You know, and I have a good friend of mine two-time UFC Heavyweight Champ Frank Mir, he has gone on and on about the fact that I don't care what you tell me or what you try to explain. If you put me into a fight, into any women's sports, regardless of me taking testosterone, I'm going to dump you know, demolish competition. So, bottom line is, this is just, you know, unfair competition. And it's weird for the left to support this when they talk about you know, they want more equality for women.
