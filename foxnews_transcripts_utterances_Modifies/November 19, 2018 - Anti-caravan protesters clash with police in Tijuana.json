      "sentences": "Thank you. So, yes, you're seeing, as markets go up, they eventually have to go down.  And like you mentioned, you saw the Dow close in negative territory, the Nasdaq closing for the second day down in a row.  And what is moving these markets, what's moving the Dow, more specifically, is three particular stocks. That would be Boeing, Visa and Apple, like you mentioned. The reason why you're seeing Visa down, that could fall into the tech category, as well as an investigation from Brazil on Friday coming out looking into that company. Boeing, there's also an investigation into that company around a deadly crash that killed over 180 people. And last, but not least, let's talk about Apple and the concerns over Apple and the iPhone demand. Have we hit the point of saturation?  There are concerns. There was a report actually coming out today saying that Apple reduced orders for three new iPhones that it unveiled in September. These are the latest phones. And you're already seeing a reduction in orders.   And then you have suppliers that are issuing concerns too about future shipments for iPhones. And so that's been weighing heavily on the stock.  You have analysts across the board that are saying, hey, you know what, it's going to be a time -- a tough time for Apple going forward, because we potentially could see iPhone demand drop. And why is that? Why are we seeing this market downturn? There's not one particular reason, but there are several that we can focus on, the first one being slowing growth across the globe. And we're seeing that with home sales. We're seeing that with the price of oil. We're seeing that with iPhone demand. Then, the big question, have we hit peak earnings, the top of the cycle?  Everybody loves to debate that. And I know you can weigh in on that too, Charles.   And then higher interest rates. Will the Fed continue with that? We must take into account that the U.S. dollar is climbing higher, which makes oil more expensive, which makes U.S. products more expensive. And then you have got the trade concerns. This past weekend, at APEC summit, an Asian summit, there was no communicate signed between the United States and China. So there's a lot of pressure for relations to improve between both countries. And we may as well on, last, but not least, the price of oil, which has seen itself fall quite low over the past few days. It's up today $56.76, the reason being is this concern of slowing demand and the fact that the Iran sanctions are in place, but there's a lot of countries -- eight countries, to be specific -- that have exemptions and can continue to do business with Iran -- back to you.",

It's just really good here in the United States. Where we're not seeing good data is from overseas. So, most of what we're seeing is bad. So you got bear markets breaking out all over the place in places like China. You have got industrial production in China down, pointing in the wrong direction, and overall just the sentiment overseas is not good.

But when you're priced to perfection, especially in the Nasdaq and Nasdaq types, you're going to get hit on any slowdown. And let me be clear. Demand is down. Inventory is up. You're going to have to clear that inventory in a whole host of technology companies before things can get going again.  So, I think this is going to go on at least into the first quarter and we will reevaluate.

One thing we should point out too, Charles -- this is brand new from the White House -- they have said that they are going to restore the hard pass of CNN's correspondent Jim Acosta, and they are laying down some rules now for how the press has to conduct itself during press conferences.  It says here: \"A journalist, when called upon to ask a question, will ask a single question and then will yield the floor to other journalists. At the discretion of the president or other White House official taking questions, a follow-up question or questions may be permitted, and where a follow-up has been allowed and asked, the questioner will then yield the floor.  Yielding the floor includes, when applicable, physically surrendering the microphone to the White House staff for use by the next questioner.  Failure to abide by any of the rules one to three may result in suspension or revocation of the journalist's hard pass.\" The president says that it is regretful that it has to come out with these rules, but that what happened in that East Room press conference on November the 7th has really kind of forced their hand here.  You know, Charles, up until now, all of these interactions that the press has had with the president had been self-regulating, but the White House now stepping in, feeling the need to issue some sort of rules of engagement here between the media and the president, which really is kind of a shame.",

The two banks, I hear, that are in her crosshairs is Wells Fargo, for one, and Wells Fargo for obvious reasons, California Bank. she doesn't believe they serve her district very well in minority and poor communities through lending and banking activities, branch-building in these communities. She represents, as you know, South Central L.A. The other bank, I hear, that's in her crosshairs firmly, and this may fit in with what she said about looking at international banks, is Deutsche Bank. Why is Deutsche Bank in her crosshairs? Quite simply, that was Donald Trump's bank. And from what I understand, those are the two places she's really going to focus on. Now, is she going to just let banks go run free and not -- and not have to do what she wants? No. She can hold hearings. But, remember, Charles, she can't regulate. I mean, this is a -- she's just -- she can -- she can hold hearings, she can embarrass, but she can't regulate.

So her big -- her big focus is, from what I understand, is on those two banks, for the reasons I pointed out, Wells Fargo because she thinks they're lousy in terms of CRA and giving back to the community. Whether that's true or not, I have no idea. I can just tell you that's what I'm hearing from her people. And Deutsche Bank, because it was Donald Trump's bank.

But gone are the days where you wait for Black Friday or Cyber Monday to actually get those deals. Often, these stores will offer them some sort of incentive weeks ahead of the big days. But here you go. Here are the stores that open, some of the major stores open on Thanksgiving Day. Wal-Mart will open at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, Target 5:00 p.m., Macy's at 5:00 p.m. But there are big stores that are saying, nope, it is a day for families.  Some are staying closed on Thanksgiving Day, including Costco, Dillard's, Home Depot, Lowe's, Marshalls, and Nordstrom, just some of those stores that say, no, we want our employees and shoppers, for that matter, to stay at home. But a lot of people are not going to do it. And, by the way, there is one store that is closed on Thanksgiving day And on Black Friday. That would be REI, the outdoors specialists, who say, get outside, enjoy the great outdoors. And they don't mean standing in line at a store. We could say that bottom line is, what kind of numbers are we looking at?  Last year, some $5 billion was spent in the 24 hours of Black Friday.  Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday this year, Charles, the average shopper is expected to spend a minimum of $420. And, by the way, Cyber Monday could eclipse Black Friday. Cyber Monday, you go online for all those deals. And sometimes you can do a better deal on Cyber Monday than you can on Black Friday -- $7.25 billion is expected to be spent on Cyber Monday, which is actually one week from today. So, Charles, I know you got your list. I know you got your strategy in place. Get out there and save some money.",

      "utterance": "Thank you. So, yes, you're seeing, as markets go up, they eventually have to go down.  And like you mentioned, you saw the Dow close in negative territory, the Nasdaq closing for the second day down in a row. And what is moving these markets, what's moving the Dow, more specifically, is three particular stocks. That would be Boeing, Visa and Apple, like you mentioned. The reason why you're seeing Visa down, that could fall into the tech category, as well as an investigation from Brazil on Friday coming out looking into that company. Boeing, there's also an investigation into that company around a deadly crash that killed over 180 people. And last, but not least, let's talk about Apple and the concerns over Apple and the iPhone demand. Have we hit the point of saturation? There are concerns. There was a report actually coming out today saying that Apple reduced orders for three new iPhones that it unveiled in September. These are the latest phones. And you're already seeing a reduction in orders. And then you have suppliers that are issuing concerns too about future shipments for iPhones. And so that's been weighing heavily on the stock.  You have analysts across the board that are saying, hey, you know what, it's going to be a time -- a tough time for Apple going forward, because we potentially could see iPhone demand drop. And why is that? Why are we seeing this market downturn? There's not one particular reason, but there are several that we can focus on, the first one being slowing growth across the globe. And we're seeing that with home sales. We're seeing that with the price of oil. We're seeing that with iPhone demand. Then, the big question, have we hit peak earnings, the top of the cycle?  Everybody loves to debate that. And I know you can weigh in on that too, Charles. And then higher interest rates. Will the Fed continue with that? We must take into account that the U.S. dollar is climbing higher, which makes oil more expensive, which makes U.S. products more expensive. And then you have got the trade concerns. This past weekend, at APEC summit, an Asian summit, there was no communicate signed between the United States and China. So there's a lot of pressure for relations to improve between both countries. And we may as well on, last, but not least, the price of oil, which has seen itself fall quite low over the past few days. It's up today $56.76, the reason being is this concern of slowing demand and the fact that the Iran sanctions are in place, but there's a lot of countries -- eight countries, to be specific -- that have exemptions and can continue to do business with Iran -- back to you."

Is -- should we be concerned about a dramatic slowdown in our economy?"

      "speaker": "KEVIN CARON, WASHINGTON CROSSING ADVISORS",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, I mean, you should you should be thinking about -- you should be thinking about how the U.S. economy would respond to a slow slowing global economy, because the data that's coming in throughout the last two or three weeks on the U.S. economy is red hot, whether you're looking at industrial production, whether you're thinking about employment, whether -- all of the data that we have seen. It's just really good here in the United States. Where we're not seeing good data is from overseas. So, most of what we're seeing is bad. So you got bear markets breaking out all over the place in places like China. You have got industrial production in China down, pointing in the wrong direction, and overall just the sentiment overseas is not good. So, it's a -- it's worrisome if that continues, because, ultimately, I don't think we can disassociate from the rest of the world completely."

Just remember Germany and Japan just announced contracting quarters, yet Europe topped out months and months and months ago. So I suspect you're going to see in the next quarter our numbers head south too. I don't think we're going in any type of recession. But when you're priced to perfection, especially in the Nasdaq and Nasdaq types, you're going to get hit on any slowdown. And let me be clear. Demand is down. Inventory is up. You're going to have to clear that inventory in a whole host of technology companies before things can get going again. So, I think this is going to go on at least into the first quarter and we will reevaluate. But leave no doubt that guidance for a lot of companies are on their way down right now and will continue for at least another quarter or so."

You know, Charles, up until now, all of these interactions that the press has had with the president had been self-regulating, but the White House now stepping in, feeling the need to issue some sort of rules of engagement here between the media and the president, which really is kind of a shame."

What we saw in the midterms is that the American people are interested in a message of moving forward, not divisive messages about immigrant caravans and this Stephen Miller/American carnage view of America. What they want is young, exciting, progressive people to come into office and to move the ball forward."

      "speaker": "PATILLO",
      "utterance": "No. This is why Hollywood needs to stay in Hollywood sometimes. I'm a Georgia native. And, frankly, the film industry is here because of the tax incentives that they are being provided and by having a business- friendly -- a business-friendly atmosphere in the state. So, if they want to boycott something, boycott what's going on in their own state and leave the South alone. But as far as what Abrams is saying by not conceding, I think that it's important for us to set up an electoral commission in Georgia, where you don't have the secretary of state who's overseeing the election also being the candidate for governor in that state. I think that's a completely reasonable set of rules to put in place."

But what Democrats want and need is a fighter.  They want somebody who's not going to just lay down and roll over.

They're used to having migrants come there, but they're not used to them being quite so disorderly and aggressive. And the problem is, is that if the United States doesn't let them in, in a speedy fashion, if the president holds the line and says we're going to do -- we're not just going to capitulate and let everyone in, they could be there a while. And that could cause some real quality of life problems, some public safety problems and other issues. Even those migrants who may be perfectly fine people who are just taking the opportunity to get to the United States, they don't have shelter or food, and they're going to need support from somebody. So this is going to be a very difficult situation for that city. And I -- and I think it's understandable that they are upset and complaining to their federal government."

But the migrants themselves simply want to get to the United States. They know that, if they make an asylum claim, that they're likely to be released into the country for years to come, indefinitely. And they don't -- we know from past experience with the other Central American migrants that half of them who get in on the basis of an asylum claim never even bother to fill out the asylum application.

And I can tell you that, when you have Santa Ana wind conditions, you have drought conditions with respect to very dry fuel, and a fire start, it's virtually impossible for any fire department or multiple agencies to put a fire like that out. Basically, fire departments do their best to first protect life. And that involves evacuation, and then do their best to protect property. And that really involves just protecting structures. But in terms of actually attacking and getting a liner on the firewall, we do our best.

And we saw how well Steve Bannon did. He tried to primary some candidates, in some cases successful, in some cases not, and those didn't work now. Now, for example, Justice Democrats, any candidates they ran in areas that were Republican- held, those candidates failed. I think your average voter is rejecting identity politics. And so the Democratic Party is kind of in a bit of a problem right now, because they have a lot of young people who - - who embrace identity politics, and they want to take their turn against the establishment.

She's going to pick our spots on stuff that matters politically. The two banks, I hear, that are in her crosshairs is Wells Fargo, for one, and Wells Fargo for obvious reasons, California Bank. she doesn't believe they serve her district very well in minority and poor communities through lending and banking activities, branch-building in these communities. She represents, as you know, South Central L.A. The other bank, I hear, that's in her crosshairs firmly, and this may fit in with what she said about looking at international banks, is Deutsche Bank. Why is Deutsche Bank in her crosshairs? Quite simply, that was Donald Trump's bank. And from what I understand, those are the two places she's really going to focus on. Now, is she going to just let banks go run free and not -- and not have to do what she wants? No. She can hold hearings. But, remember, Charles, she can't regulate. I mean, this is a -- she's just -- she can -- she can hold hearings, she can embarrass, but she can't regulate. She has very few regulatory -- I mean, Dodd-Frank, the way it's interpreted now, in a very loose fashion the Federal Reserve, which is run by a Trump appointee, by the Treasury Department, is not going to be -- is not going to be changed by her. There's nothing that she can do. So her big -- her big focus is, from what I understand, is on those two banks, for the reasons I pointed out, Wells Fargo because she thinks they're lousy in terms of CRA and giving back to the community. Whether that's true or not, I have no idea. I can just tell you that's what I'm hearing from her people. And Deutsche Bank, because it was Donald Trump's bank. There's always been a lot of suspicion among Democrats that Deutsche Bank is -- has strong ties with Russian -- with Russians and Trump.

The Justice Department, on the other hand, points to the fact that these kind of temporary appointments have been going on since George Washington was president, up to and including Barack Obama. And they also say the president complied with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which gave the president the power to do this. I don't think anybody could predict how the Supreme Court's going to going to rule on this issue. But Clarence Thomas, however, has raised doubts about the constitutionality of that federal law."

He didn't have access to any of the information that the special counsel has. And the statements that he's made actually seem to be factually true. And I will just give you a quick example. He said at one point -- he's been criticized for this -- that there doesn't seem to be any obstruction of justice charge to be had here. Well, look, it's the longtime policy the Justice Department that a sitting president can't be criminally indicted or charged.

But gone are the days where you wait for Black Friday or Cyber Monday to actually get those deals. Often, these stores will offer them some sort of incentive weeks ahead of the big days. But here you go. Here are the stores that open, some of the major stores open on Thanksgiving Day. Wal-Mart will open at 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, Target 5:00 p.m., Macy's at 5:00 p.m. But there are big stores that are saying, nope, it is a day for families.  Some are staying closed on Thanksgiving Day, including Costco, Dillard's, Home Depot, Lowe's, Marshalls, and Nordstrom, just some of those stores that say, no, we want our employees and shoppers, for that matter, to stay at home. But a lot of people are not going to do it. And, by the way, there is one store that is closed on Thanksgiving day And on Black Friday. That would be REI, the outdoors specialists, who say, get outside, enjoy the great outdoors. And they don't mean standing in line at a store. We could say that bottom line is, what kind of numbers are we looking at?  Last year, some $5 billion was spent in the 24 hours of Black Friday.  Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday this year, Charles, the average shopper is expected to spend a minimum of $420. And, by the way, Cyber Monday could eclipse Black Friday. Cyber Monday, you go online for all those deals. And sometimes you can do a better deal on Cyber Monday than you can on Black Friday -- $7.25 billion is expected to be spent on Cyber Monday, which is actually one week from today. So, Charles, I know you got your list. I know you got your strategy in place. Get out there and save some money."

When you're talking about international travel, it's not law. There are treaties. And the treaties define -- define airlines' liability. Throw out notions of breaches of care, negligence, all of that fancy mumbo jumbo. Once you get into that plane and those doors close, you are in the care and custody of the -- of the airline. On an international flight, as long as there is an accident, which is also specifically defined -- some unexpected occurrence, through no fault of the passenger -- you don't have to prove negligence. So the fact that you have this unexpected, unusual occurrence, this man sitting next to a much bigger man, big man in the middle, smaller guy on the -- on the side, he gets hurt. It's a link in the chain. The airlines knew about it. They -- he complained. The stewardess did nothing. The flight attendant did nothing. You got a case."

I don't think that you can remove the causation and the duty of care notion. I do think that, at the end of the day, this is a tort claim for negligence. At the end of the day, what he's alleging is that British Airways should have foreseeably and reasonably known that being sat next to an overweight passenger was going to actually cause him physical harm, not just discomfort. We know the airline probably anticipated the discomfort, since they keep making these seats a whole lot smaller."
