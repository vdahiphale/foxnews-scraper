But, first, Judge Brett Kavanaugh is now about to face the fight of his and his family's life. Why? Last night, the president of the United States nominated him to the highest court of the land and despite his impressive credentials, sound originalist philosophy and, by the way, experience at one of the toughest federal courts in America, predictably Democrats, their friends on the left, the mainstream media, they have already ramped up all of their attacks. We're going to show you the worst of the worst and explain why this is so predictable, the smear campaign. By the way, it would have been waged against anybody regardless of who the president nominated.  And in moments, we'll do something the mainstream media will never do. We'll actually review Judge Kavanaugh's impressive background and will remind Democrats about something they seem to be forgetting -- yes, elections 2016, they have consequences and tonight the president kicks off his all-important trip to Europe, tensions are high, protests are erupting all over the continent, which is a sign that America -- yes, when it projects strength, Europe apparently hates us. But when America's weak they love policies of appeasement and they revered Obama.  We have some major breaking news also tonight around the deep state. We will break all of this down in tonight's very, very important breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "What you just heard is a very different philosophy than the judicial activism that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats love and cherish. Now, Judge Kavanaugh's record is long, his background impeccable his academic record is off the charts, his philosophy seems extraordinarily intelligent, very sound. Educated at Yale, he clerked for the outgoing Justice Anthony Kennedy. He worked in the office of solicitor general. He served as an associate counsel in the office of the independent counsel, Ken Starr.  He was also a senior associate counsel to President George W. Bush. He argued cases before the Supreme Court. He taught courses at Harvard and Yale and Georgetown and Notre Dame, and his opinions have been extensively published in academic journals and he has served in the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit for more than a decade, where his opinions were often endorsed by the United States Supreme Court. In 2016, during a speech at George Mason University, Kavanaugh spoke extensively about the importance of constitutionalism and he praised upon the late Justice Antonin Scalia. He said, what did Justice Scalia stand for as a judge? It's not complicated but it is profound and worth repeating often, that the judge's job is to interpret the law not to make the law or make policy.  Now, remember the structure of the Constitution -- separation of powers and federalism -- are not near matters of etiquette or architecture, but are at least as essential to protecting individual liberty as the individual rights guaranteed in that text.  Now, this is the exact language you'd want to hear if you want an originalist on the court and frankly from any judge in America. That is what every judge should practice. The job of the judiciary is to interpret the constitutional law, separation of powers, due process, limits on government and, of course, inalienable human rights. The judiciary should respect co-equal branches of government. That is the job of a judge in America. That is what it means to be an originalist, textualist, a constitutionalist.  By the way, that is what Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito clearly understand who they are and what it is they revere, our Constitution.   But to the Democratic Party, their friends in the left-wing media, none of this matters. Judge Kavanaugh's impressive track record and resume doesn't seem to matter at all. Kavanaugh's fair and just philosophy that doesn't matter, because the left in this country, they want what's called the judicial activist. In other words, someone will throw the Constitution to the wind and write laws and legislate from the bench someone who will even use international law, not our Constitution, as a basis for their findings. But most of all, Democrats want anybody not tapped by President Trump who you the American people elected. In fact, they are actually attacking President Trump's pick before they even knew who it was and they would have attacked anybody that he chose. Now, take a look at how members of the left war already sharpening their spears before the president's announcement last night. Take a look.",

This is an orchestrated smear campaign, so predictable, so coordinated, so filled with hate, demagoguery. It's kind of almost funny except for the fact that their actions have real consequences.  Many protestors became so aggressive last night at the Supreme Court of the United States that even our own Shannon Bream was actually forced to move her show inside because she felt threatened in that environment.

The nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come and will morph our Supreme Court into a political arm of the right-wing Republican Party. Sounds like Ted Kennedy and he sounds like those that attack Justice Thomas.   Very predictable, I told you this was coming.  Many top Democratic senators are now urging their colleagues in red states, red state Democratic senators to throw justice and logic to the wind. They want them to risk their political futures just by voting against Kavanaugh. Now, it's important to remember, elections do have consequences and I've said this many, many times, the 2018 midterms, this November, will be the most important midterms in the history.  Now, look at these six senators from red states that are up for re- election. They're in a bit of a bind right now. What are they going to do? Senator Manchin, West Virginia, Heitkamp, North Dakota, Nelson, Florida, Donnelly, Indiana, McCaskill, Missouri, Tester, Montana -- are you going to stick with the far left of your party like you pretty much always do? Are you going to vote as a bloc again? Or you're going to try and save your career and do what is only an election year conversion?  Now, it's very important to remember, all of you, the six of you, are supposed to serve the people of your state, but it appears you all serve Chuck Schumer and company and America's watching.  And as I said earlier, Justice Kavanaugh is about to face the fight of his life, what he and his family will have to endure, it is sick, and by the way, in the end, Justice Kavanaugh is qualified. His experience, impeccable. His judicial philosophy is sound. His intellect, keen, and he should be quickly confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  We're going to have more on this throughout the show. But now, let's turn our attention to Europe. The president now has officially kicked off his visit ahead of a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and, of course, an all-important summit with NATO. This is where President Trump will negotiate with our allies that they pay their fair share for their national defense. We're not the world's piggy bank any longer, and sadly, Western Europe's love affair with the American presidency actually died because the appeaser in chief, Barack Obama, left office.  Now, instead, President Trump is facing widespread protests across the continent this is just one more reminder that many in Western Europe prefer weakness not a strong America. For example, remember Obama's feckless apology tour that was revered by all the leaders in Europe? You may remember a lot of this.",

President Obama goes abroad and the world is happier for it. Obama connects with young Europeans. Now, compare that love fest to the treatment -- let's go back to Ronald Reagan what he received. Like President Trump, Reagan led the world with American exceptionalism and the concept of peace through strength. And by the way, Europe was not loving Reagan during an early trip to Europe. Reagan was met by thousands of protesters. This happened all across the continent. In London, West Berlin, Reagan was even, quote, jeered during a speech at the European parliament in France.  And, of course, Reagan's policies ultimately ushered in the end of the Cold War, brought down the Berlin Wall, pushed the Soviet Union out of many Eastern European countries, but if history tells us anything, Europe apparently doesn't learn. And here we are today with more animosity towards a sitting U.S. president because he projects America as a force for good and strength in the world. Now, the protest that we will see in Europe all week are exactly the same as Reagan faced. The parallels are uncanny. Now, this is the greatest tribute that America is now back and strong and actually leading on the world stage, the apology tour is over. Tomorrow, the show will be hitting the road. That's right. Hannity we will be broadcasting live from Europe as we continue to monitor the president's important trip and tomorrow night will be that our cover at all for you. We hope you'll join us. Now, let's turn our attention to the deep state tonight. Disgraced former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, she has been subpoenaed to appear before a closed- door session in the House of Representatives tomorrow, and sources are telling FOX News tonight, she does plan to comply with that subpoena, although I guess anything could happen. We'll keep you posted on everything we learned from that hearing.   Also this week, Page's one-time boyfriend, Trump-hating FBI agent at the center of it all, Peter Strzok, will testify in public this Thursday before the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees. This could be one of the most contentious hearings in years. We will be covering that. And according to a brand-new report tonight from John Solomon, the FBI was reportedly in possession of -- get this -- three different versions of the now infamous dirty dossier the Clinton bought and paid for, phony, debunked, oppo research based on Russian lies put together by a foreign national. Now, we know this phony dossier was used as the basis for the initial investigation of the Trump-Russia collusion witch-hunt and it was the bulk of information to get a FISA warrant not once but four times. Rod Rosenstein signing the last one. John Solomon will be here tonight with the report. Also, we're learning that the Lieutenant General Michael Flynn sentencing hearing has now mysteriously been delayed again -- what is another bizarre move by Robert Mueller's witch hunt. And meanwhile, Flynn is now pleading for his case to be wrapped up. And according to a report from our own Sara Carter, Mueller's so-called pit bull, Andrew Weissmann, may have actually leaked details surrounding Mueller's investigation to the \"Associated Press\". That is a problem. You're not allowed to do that.  And as we speak, Paul Manafort, not convicted of a thing, is sitting 23 hours a day in solitary confinement in a federal prison over a 2005 tax case. And breaking this week, we have more news from the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, and he is now calling for a probe of 42 Obama era officials to determine the role that they played in targeting the Trump campaign to influence our election. We'll have more on this in a moment. First, joining us now, the reaction to all the breaking news, the author of the book \"Why We Fight\", FOX News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, NRATV contributor Dan Bongino.  Let's go to the hysteria. The fact that we actually have the left XX, fill in the blank, we're going to use the same words no matter who Donald Trump picks is pretty revealing, but it's also 101 of the Democratic Party. Smear, besmirch, slander, lie, racist, sexist, misogynist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, dirty air and water, killed children and grandma. It's all the same, Dr. Gorka.

They got one version from the liberal journalist David Corn, a Trump protagonist and one from Senator McCain that came from the Steele people and one from Glenn Simpson who testified he didn't give a version of the dossier to the FBI. So they have three different versions and they're talking about it. And I was thinking about how to explain this and why this is important. In the intelligence world it's called circular reporting. It's a real problem. It corrupts the intelligence process. But if I went to Amazon and I bought your book a few days ago and then three later it comes and then three days later it comes again, and then maybe a week later it comes again, the fourth time it comes again. You are going to check your credit card and make sure you weren't being charge for it. You're going to call Amazon and say why do you keep sending me this here? The FBI doesn't do that. In fact, it gets more and more excited about investigating Trump even though they know it's a fruit of a single tree that comes from a political motive of Hillary Clinton defeating -- trying to defeat Donald Trump. It's bad intelligence work. That's what everybody I've interviewed inside the intelligence community is telling me today.",

But, first, Judge Brett Kavanaugh is now about to face the fight of his and his family's life. Why? Last night, the president of the United States nominated him to the highest court of the land and despite his impressive credentials, sound originalist philosophy and, by the way, experience at one of the toughest federal courts in America, predictably Democrats, their friends on the left, the mainstream media, they have already ramped up all of their attacks. We're going to show you the worst of the worst and explain why this is so predictable, the smear campaign. By the way, it would have been waged against anybody regardless of who the president nominated. And in moments, we'll do something the mainstream media will never do. We'll actually review Judge Kavanaugh's impressive background and will remind Democrats about something they seem to be forgetting -- yes, elections 2016, they have consequences and tonight the president kicks off his all-important trip to Europe, tensions are high, protests are erupting all over the continent, which is a sign that America -- yes, when it projects strength, Europe apparently hates us.

      "speaker": "BRETT KAVANAUGH, SUPREME COURT NOMINEE",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "What you just heard is a very different philosophy than the judicial activism that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats love and cherish. Now, Judge Kavanaugh's record is long, his background impeccable his academic record is off the charts, his philosophy seems extraordinarily intelligent, very sound. Educated at Yale, he clerked for the outgoing Justice Anthony Kennedy. He worked in the office of solicitor general. He served as an associate counsel in the office of the independent counsel, Ken Starr. He was also a senior associate counsel to President George W. Bush. He argued cases before the Supreme Court. He taught courses at Harvard and Yale and Georgetown and Notre Dame, and his opinions have been extensively published in academic journals and he has served in the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit for more than a decade, where his opinions were often endorsed by the United States Supreme Court. In 2016, during a speech at George Mason University, Kavanaugh spoke extensively about the importance of constitutionalism and he praised upon the late Justice Antonin Scalia. He said, what did Justice Scalia stand for as a judge? It's not complicated but it is profound and worth repeating often, that the judge's job is to interpret the law not to make the law or make policy. Now, remember the structure of the Constitution -- separation of powers and federalism -- are not near matters of etiquette or architecture, but are at least as essential to protecting individual liberty as the individual rights guaranteed in that text. Now, this is the exact language you'd want to hear if you want an originalist on the court and frankly from any judge in America. That is what every judge should practice. The job of the judiciary is to interpret the constitutional law, separation of powers, due process, limits on government and, of course, inalienable human rights. The judiciary should respect co-equal branches of government. That is the job of a judge in America. That is what it means to be an originalist, textualist, a constitutionalist. By the way, that is what Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito clearly understand who they are and what it is they revere, our Constitution. But to the Democratic Party, their friends in the left-wing media, none of this matters. Judge Kavanaugh's impressive track record and resume doesn't seem to matter at all. Kavanaugh's fair and just philosophy that doesn't matter, because the left in this country, they want what's called the judicial activist. In other words, someone will throw the Constitution to the wind and write laws and legislate from the bench someone who will even use international law, not our Constitution, as a basis for their findings. But most of all, Democrats want anybody not tapped by President Trump who you the American people elected. In fact, they are actually attacking President Trump's pick before they even knew who it was and they would have attacked anybody that he chose. Now, take a look at how members of the left war already sharpening their spears before the president's announcement last night. Take a look."

The nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh will threaten the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come and will morph our Supreme Court into a political arm of the right-wing Republican Party. Sounds like Ted Kennedy and he sounds like those that attack Justice Thomas. Very predictable, I told you this was coming. Many top Democratic senators are now urging their colleagues in red states, red state Democratic senators to throw justice and logic to the wind. They want them to risk their political futures just by voting against Kavanaugh. Now, it's important to remember, elections do have consequences and I've said this many, many times, the 2018 midterms, this November, will be the most important midterms in the history. Now, look at these six senators from red states that are up for re- election. They're in a bit of a bind right now. What are they going to do? Senator Manchin, West Virginia, Heitkamp, North Dakota, Nelson, Florida, Donnelly, Indiana, McCaskill, Missouri, Tester, Montana -- are you going to stick with the far left of your party like you pretty much always do? Are you going to vote as a bloc again? Or you're going to try and save your career and do what is only an election year conversion? Now, it's very important to remember, all of you, the six of you, are supposed to serve the people of your state, but it appears you all serve Chuck Schumer and company and America's watching. And as I said earlier, Justice Kavanaugh is about to face the fight of his life, what he and his family will have to endure, it is sick, and by the way, in the end, Justice Kavanaugh is qualified. His experience, impeccable. His judicial philosophy is sound. His intellect, keen, and he should be quickly confirmed by the U.S. Senate. We're going to have more on this throughout the show. But now, let's turn our attention to Europe. The president now has officially kicked off his visit ahead of a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and, of course, an all-important summit with NATO. This is where President Trump will negotiate with our allies that they pay their fair share for their national defense. We're not the world's piggy bank any longer, and sadly, Western Europe's love affair with the American presidency actually died because the appeaser in chief, Barack Obama, left office. Now, instead, President Trump is facing widespread protests across the continent this is just one more reminder that many in Western Europe prefer weakness not a strong America. For example, remember Obama's feckless apology tour that was revered by all the leaders in Europe? You may remember a lot of this."

Issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam. In Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, we've seen Muslim majority countries elect a woman to lead. Meanwhile, the struggle for women's equality continues in many aspects of American life."

President Obama goes abroad and the world is happier for it. Obama connects with young Europeans. Now, compare that love fest to the treatment -- let's go back to Ronald Reagan what he received. Like President Trump, Reagan led the world with American exceptionalism and the concept of peace through strength. And by the way, Europe was not loving Reagan during an early trip to Europe. Reagan was met by thousands of protesters. This happened all across the continent. In London, West Berlin, Reagan was even, quote, jeered during a speech at the European parliament in France. And, of course, Reagan's policies ultimately ushered in the end of the Cold War, brought down the Berlin Wall, pushed the Soviet Union out of many Eastern European countries, but if history tells us anything, Europe apparently doesn't learn. And here we are today with more animosity towards a sitting U.S. president because he projects America as a force for good and strength in the world. Now, the protest that we will see in Europe all week are exactly the same as Reagan faced. The parallels are uncanny. Now, this is the greatest tribute that America is now back and strong and actually leading on the world stage, the apology tour is over. Tomorrow, the show will be hitting the road. That's right. Hannity we will be broadcasting live from Europe as we continue to monitor the president's important trip and tomorrow night will be that our cover at all for you. We hope you'll join us. Now, let's turn our attention to the deep state tonight. Disgraced former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, she has been subpoenaed to appear before a closed- door session in the House of Representatives tomorrow, and sources are telling FOX News tonight, she does plan to comply with that subpoena, although I guess anything could happen. We'll keep you posted on everything we learned from that hearing. Also this week, Page's one-time boyfriend, Trump-hating FBI agent at the center of it all, Peter Strzok, will testify in public this Thursday before the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees. This could be one of the most contentious hearings in years. We will be covering that. And according to a brand-new report tonight from John Solomon, the FBI was reportedly in possession of -- get this -- three different versions of the now infamous dirty dossier the Clinton bought and paid for, phony, debunked, oppo research based on Russian lies put together by a foreign national. Now, we know this phony dossier was used as the basis for the initial investigation of the Trump-Russia collusion witch-hunt and it was the bulk of information to get a FISA warrant not once but four times. Rod Rosenstein signing the last one. John Solomon will be here tonight with the report. Also, we're learning that the Lieutenant General Michael Flynn sentencing hearing has now mysteriously been delayed again -- what is another bizarre move by Robert Mueller's witch hunt. And meanwhile, Flynn is now pleading for his case to be wrapped up. And according to a report from our own Sara Carter, Mueller's so-called pit bull, Andrew Weissmann, may have actually leaked details surrounding Mueller's investigation to the \"Associated Press\". That is a problem. You're not allowed to do that. And as we speak, Paul Manafort, not convicted of a thing, is sitting 23 hours a day in solitary confinement in a federal prison over a 2005 tax case. And breaking this week, we have more news from the House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, and he is now calling for a probe of 42 Obama era officials to determine the role that they played in targeting the Trump campaign to influence our election. We'll have more on this in a moment. First, joining us now, the reaction to all the breaking news, the author of the book \"Why We Fight\", FOX News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, NRATV contributor Dan Bongino. Let's go to the hysteria. The fact that we actually have the left XX, fill in the blank, we're going to use the same words no matter who Donald Trump picks is pretty revealing, but it's also 101 of the Democratic Party. Smear, besmirch, slander, lie, racist, sexist, misogynist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, dirty air and water, killed children and grandma. It's all the same, Dr. Gorka. We never get any variation of that theme."

But let them continue to do so. There's no realization that this does not play well outside the bubble. This is great in Hollywood. This is great in New York. This is great in, you know, the DNC's cocktail parties in Georgetown. But it doesn't resonate with the American people. They have a narrative which is ideologically driven, and whatever the president does, they will attack him and sooner or later, this will bear certain political consequences for them. My concern is that they're upping the ante on the things that are truly undemocratic. Yes, they'll smear us. They smear you, me, whoever they pick it to be the next associate justice, but the issue is when it comes to harassment and the use of violence. There's no equivalent of Antifa on the right, doesn't exist, does not exist."

You know, Sean, Trump is Duncan on the left and the media on a daily basis now and they've gone from derangement now to sheer panic and here's why -- it's because of what you just said, precisely because of it. The left doesn't have an agenda, Sean. There is absolutely no popular mandate for enormous government, high taxes, government-controlled health care and complete government control of education. There is zero popular mandate for that. Why does this Supreme Court thing matter? Why have they now adjusted to their new outrage campaign? Because, Sean, they can't legislate. They have to legislate from the bench where they only have to convince one person. Who? A judge, because they can't convince the American people that this crap agenda they have is real. Remember, liberalism stinks for liberals too. Don't forget that, Sean."

They try to use the courts for. A real judge respects that the legislative branch has their job and their job is to take the exact text and the Constitution's exact text and see where the line is. It's not their job to legislate."

It is - - you know, that's their short circuit to get what they want. But it's also the intimidation and the harassment I think -- you know, Pruitt's resignation is also a function of they don't have a mandate, they don't have an agenda, but that's why it's so important what Kavanaugh said last night. He only made two substantive statements. He talked about the women in his life, his inspiration, but he only said two things -- judges don't legislate and a SCOTUS judge interprets the Constitution."

Just all you have to do is listen to Senator Ben Cardin, who on Face the Nation the other day said that the nominee for the Supreme Court was coming from an extremist organization. The Federalist Society! Members of which included, John Roberts, Nino Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito and Neil Gorsuch. When a United States senator says something as stupid and as ignorant and as uninformed as that that's why people are treating Alan Dershowitz the way they are at the cape. It's an embarrassment.

And for the country at large it was a huge spectacle and it kind of gave you the signal who is guilty. You are discovering that at the very senior levels of the FBI and I believe of the Justice Department under Obama you had a level of corruption that makes it very dangerous for them to show up and to actually testify. And so I think their lawyers legitimately under our system are saying to them, you need to protect yourself. You cannot go under oath and start talking about this stuff or you are going to create or you either going to reveal information that will put you in jail, or you are going to end up committing perjury.

Lisa Page was the top attorney for Andrew McCabe, the deputy director of the FBI, and the boyfriend Peter Strzok who is at the heart of all of this. She's involved in the text messages.

Three days later she was exonerated, but he had been building the exoneration case since May. This happened in July. On top of that he was at the heart of the start of what is the phony Russia case.

Meanwhile, every person in the Clinton team, no matter what they have done has basically been ignored. Exonerated. Allowed to go free. Now, I mean, if you want to see how sick the system is look at the way they are treating Paul Manafort and look at the way they treated Hillary's aides including the guy who took a hammer to break up the smart phones and to bleach bit to destroy the memory of the computers.

By the way, two weeks away now, \"The Russia Hoax: The Elicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\" Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett. OK. So let me get this straight. As the Nunes memo pointed out. As the Grassley-Graham memo pointed out the bulk of information for the FISA warrant was that phony Clinton bought and paid for dossier with Russian lies put together by a foreign national. Multiple versions, none of them verified but all used to present to the court and spread by people like John Brennan?"

They got one version from the liberal journalist David Corn, a Trump protagonist and one from Senator McCain that came from the Steele people and one from Glenn Simpson who testified he didn't give a version of the dossier to the FBI. So they have three different versions and they're talking about it. And I was thinking about how to explain this and why this is important. In the intelligence world it's called circular reporting. It's a real problem. It corrupts the intelligence process. But if I went to Amazon and I bought your book a few days ago and then three later it comes and then three days later it comes again, and then maybe a week later it comes again, the fourth time it comes again. You are going to check your credit card and make sure you weren't being charge for it. You're going to call Amazon and say why do you keep sending me this here? The FBI doesn't do that. In fact, it gets more and more excited about investigating Trump even though they know it's a fruit of a single tree that comes from a political motive of Hillary Clinton defeating -- trying to defeat Donald Trump. It's bad intelligence work. That's what everybody I've interviewed inside the intelligence community is telling me today."

      "utterance": "Yes, look, the dossier never gets old. I read it 100 times. I never fail to break out in laughter. I mean, it's a work of pure fiction. A bad novelist who continues to rework his twaddles. So, multiple versions of it. No wonder there were so many people involved in this propagating this thing and contributing to it. You know, Clinton acolytes Sydney Blumenthal and Cody Shearer. You got John Brennan who pretends to be the CIA director but he is Hillary Clinton lackey and sycophant. And then you've got Glenn Simpson who this is going to end badly for him. I've read through his testimony twice now."

Failure to act is a criminal act. But her lawyers know that the D.C. courts are filled with liberal judges. They don't have a backbone. They're not going to go after her for defying a lawful subpoena so she's thumbing her nose that--"

This gets to the hearth of the second part, which is first state they allowed Hillary who broke laws to get away it with it and the fix was in.

You know, when you think about it instead of having sources in Moscow telling them that they were including with Russia all they have is Hillary Clinton and journalist that they're kind of combing over to put together this very thin case. And there is this enormous. They are trying to do it before the election. And that's the most scary about this, the electoral pressure they used."

By the way, right after the show, we are headed to London and then Helsinki. We will be covering the president's meetings with European leaders in his high-stakes one-on-one summit with Vladimir Putin. And we also will be covering everything that's going on here. So there is a big news week. And we'll be watching the protests. That's because America is showing strength, a good thing. And by the way, NATO needs to pay its fair share and Vladimir, here we go.
