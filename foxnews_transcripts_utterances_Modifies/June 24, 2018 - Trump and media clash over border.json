Another error was that Trump said it was Democrats who brought us to this point. It's actually a bipartisan failure. It is a failure of both Republicans and Democrats to actually do what needs to be done to have a sensible immigration policy.  But that doesn't change the fact that what is actually happening here, there has been a failure of media coverage too, beginning with -- at the very start of this, they were saying that the children are being separated from parents willy-nilly.  This was not about people immigrating to the country, this is about people crossing the border illegally. And when they are caught, then they are separated for law breaking. That is actually a pretty common thing that happens for domestic or this other situation. Just a failure to accurately report this. And also a failure on (INAUDIBLE), I think. One of the things you get from what you just showed in the intro was everybody treats it as if treating illegal crossing of a border as a criminal offense is outrageous, when point of fact, majority of Americans think that illegal border crossing should be treated as a criminal offense, and only 19 percent of Americans think that we should have a catch and release program that treats this as just a civil offense.",

Same thing happened with the first and second iteration of the Trump travel ban. We all thought the administration has sort of learned that at the very minimum before you roll out a policy or you start discussing a policy, in this case, you got to have your internal house of cards in order.

And you also have political interests on certain parties where they appreciate illegal immigration as well.  And what gets left out are the American people who actually want strong border enforcement. I just want to say really quickly, on that Time magazine cover, it was a perfect encapsulation of the media narrative on the story and it was completely built on a lie. And the way that it was lying is really influential as well because what we had when they actually learned the story, reported by a British tabloid, not an American media outlet, that this was a mother who had previously come to this country and been deported, that she abandoned other children and a husband without telling them to take her child on a very dangerous journey that she allegedly paid a lot of money to go on this dangerous journey. And only then after being caught, then requested asylum. This is actually a narrative that supports what opponents of our old immigration enforcement policy are saying.

Mollie, mainstream media are constantly accusing the president of lying for insisting he couldn't change the practice of family separation. Congress had to do it, it is the Democrats' fault.

And then when Congress doesn't act, then they do executive orders. I personally have a problem with executive orders to handle immigration policy. Another error was that Trump said it was Democrats who brought us to this point. It's actually a bipartisan failure. It is a failure of both Republicans and Democrats to actually do what needs to be done to have a sensible immigration policy. But that doesn't change the fact that what is actually happening here, there has been a failure of media coverage too, beginning with -- at the very start of this, they were saying that the children are being separated from parents willy-nilly. This was not about people immigrating to the country, this is about people crossing the border illegally. And when they are caught, then they are separated for law breaking. That is actually a pretty common thing that happens for domestic or this other situation. Just a failure to accurately report this. And also a failure on (INAUDIBLE), I think. One of the things you get from what you just showed in the intro was everybody treats it as if treating illegal crossing of a border as a criminal offense is outrageous, when point of fact, majority of Americans think that illegal border crossing should be treated as a criminal offense, and only 19 percent of Americans think that we should have a catch and release program that treats this as just a civil offense."

Same thing happened with the first and second iteration of the Trump travel ban. We all thought the administration has sort of learned that at the very minimum before you roll out a policy or you start discussing a policy, in this case, you got to have your internal house of cards in order. They disagreed over whether this was a law or presidential policy, whether the president can unilaterally address it, and whether it was morally acceptable.

They missed the story that the reason why these women and children were leaving their countries is because Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras are the three most dangerous countries on earth.

And you also have political interests on certain parties where they appreciate illegal immigration as well. And what gets left out are the American people who actually want strong border enforcement. I just want to say really quickly, on that Time magazine cover, it was a perfect encapsulation of the media narrative on the story and it was completely built on a lie. And the way that it was lying is really influential as well because what we had when they actually learned the story, reported by a British tabloid, not an American media outlet, that this was a mother who had previously come to this country and been deported, that she abandoned other children and a husband without telling them to take her child on a very dangerous journey that she allegedly paid a lot of money to go on this dangerous journey. And only then after being caught, then requested asylum. This is actually a narrative that supports what opponents of our old immigration enforcement policy are saying. And because we are not telling the truth about the situation, I totally agree with what Richard is saying, we are not telling the truth about the situation in Central America. We are not talking about how the previous policy incentivized child trafficking."

What (INAUDIBLE) I think were the very few pictures that emerged including of that girl but others and the audio of crying kids at these facilities that was leaked to ProPublica.

Will this policy even be upheld because there is a court decree involved? So, it could even be overturned by the courts. So, my sense is, there are a lot of legitimate questions still to be answered.

So even though the president has now delivered his own version of a quick fix in the form of an executive order, the media is saying, you know what, we don't entirely believe this is going to solve the problem.

I don't buy the president's tweet, and my personal interpretation is he was sticking it to the fake news media and how dishonest they are.

She said we need to do --I'm trying to do everything in my power, I am paraphrasing here, to make sure that we reunite these families as fast as possible, is what she said when she went down there. Gillian is right. She is the only member of this family that went down to the border.

And so I think the bellicosity of rhetoric is used as a (Inaudible) or a device to negotiate that. So I think they're being unfair to him on that.

I was delighted to see him on George Stephanopoulos a week ago. He's a television star, OK. This guy has (Inaudible) in so many genres of his life. There is no need for him to be sticking to one network or a few anchors. Let's go the full spectrum of people. There are a lot of moderates and independents that really love what the President is doing in the country and are going to vote him. And he needs those people if he wants to win an electoral landslide, because I predict that if he gets an electoral landslide in 2020, he'll have a much bigger, broader legislative mandate over the next four years of the Presidency.

Fonda also saying Sarah Sanders should have her children taken away and be deported to Arkansas. Kirstjen Nielsen should be put in a cage naked and be whipped by passersby. I hate reading this stuff, all this renewing a debate about crude and inflammatory rhetoric in the Trump era. Joining us now Sara Fischer, a media reporter for Axios. So these Peter Fonda tweets are so sick in my view, taking aim at a 12 year old boy and others, that even though he apologized for what he called highly inappropriate vulgar comments.

The immigration fallout -- (Inaudible) 21st Century Fox is planning to sell its entertainment assets to Disney, which is (Inaudible) Comcast bid, upping its offer to $70 billion. Let me put up some of these entertainment folks. Steven Levitan, he's the guy who created Modern Family, produced by Fox's studio, says he's disgusted to work at a company that has (Inaudible) whatsoever to do with Fox News. Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy says he's embarrassed to work for 21st Century Fox. He was rebutting something that Tucker Carlson said about the rest of the media. Judd Apatow, who worked for Fox 16 years ago, tweeted, let's put it up, if every Fox star and show runner said this policy was evil and protested to the Murdoch family, it would make a huge difference in the national debate. So beside the fact that it was Murdoch's New York Post and Wall Street Journal-led editorial, he's harshly against the family separation policy. What do you make of this harsh criticism from Hollywood types?"

Here, one is that as you mention with that merger, I mean it does give potentially some of the entertainment folks, people who are within 21st Century Fox's entertainment assets that would be separated from Fox News a little bit of maybe potentially freedom to think that they can criticize the news arm that they will be separated from. But again, any time the Hollywood elite come out and they take some issue against you know Trump policies or etcetera, it further creates the divide between the Hollywood elitism versus the standard every day people that's been sort of the hallmark of the Trump presidency."

It is actually common when people break the law that they might be separated from their children, and the children who were separated were not jailed but put in you know facilities run by the Health and Human Services agency. To compare HHS to Auschwitz is so deeply problematic and so insensitive to the actual situation at hand.

And point the fact there are moral costs to not enforcing the bored and there are moral costs to separating children. This is a really complicated topic.

He was a powerful journalistic force, not just on this network but as a writer for the Republic and then the Washington Post and Time Magazine and was a newspaper columnist. I would read a Krauthammer piece and say, man, I wish I had written that. Once (Inaudible) he didn't like about his stances on major boost on the Iraq war and he called that we have a forceful exchange of views. Now whether he was coining the term the Reagan Doctrine or Bush Derangement Syndrome, it was his intellectual firepower that helped shape modern conservatism. He was a strong critic of candidate Donald Trump but occasionally praised him as President. It's no surprise that Krauthammer's liberal antagonists have joined in praising him. But he skewered his targets with aggressive arguments and a sharp wit, never falling into that nasty, shouting, corrosive finger in the eye style debate that is so popular among many of today's pundits.
