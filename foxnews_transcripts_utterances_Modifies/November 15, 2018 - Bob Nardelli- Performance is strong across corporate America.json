      "sentences": "Hi, Neil. Good afternoon. The counting room and recounting room here in Palm Beach County, as you can see right now, is devoid of people. The machine recounting has stopped.  And unless that federal judge this hour rules in favor of a Democratic House candidate who has petitioned to eliminate the deadline for Palm Beach County, just so that this county can finish recounting all the races, which could take another three or five days, if that doesn't happen, then the recount is over.   As far as Palm Beach County's numbers go that they just submitted to the secretary of state, those are from last week, the ones they submitted on Saturday, so actually not recounted numbers that went from Palm Beach County, which could be the only county in the state, it's still not official yet, that failed to meet at 3:00 deadline. Now, on these tables that are now set up -- and you see all the papers out there -- what's going to be next here is going to be the hand recount order by the secretary of state. They followed the numbers as they did after the first round of counting. That is for the Florida Senate race and here in Palm Beach County, Florida House District 89. They will have 40 people at these tables, papers in front of them and pens. On those pages, they will have to go through all of the undervotes and the overvotes. So these are ballots where somebody filled out all the bubbles or connected the arrows on the ballot form, but in one race, they didn't do that.  So that's an undervote. So they will then go through, the people here, and see whether there was any kind of marking on the ballot to indicate who they chose. And then they would decide, OK, we think that was actually an intentional vote, even though the machine didn't notice it.   The overvotes are where somebody actually voted for more than one candidate. So there will be looking at those as well. So the number of ballots that would be recounted by hand for the Senate race and the local House race here in Palm Beach County substantially, significantly smaller than the total number of county ballots from Election Day that were just recounted here until two nights ago, when their old and outdated machines broke down. Also, 4:00, Tallahassee, the race between Jim Bonfiglio -- he is the Democrat -- and his Republican opponent, Mike Caruso, that is separated, the total, by just 37 votes. Obviously, that's going to be within the hand recount margin.  So everybody's on hold to see what the federal judge decides at the hearing, which is happening right now in Tallahassee, whether Palm Beach County alone will get an extension to finish the recount, or whether it's over for all the state, for all the counties, and now we move on to the hand recounts. All right, Neil?",

But, today, they did submit those election results to the secretary of state a few minutes ahead of the 3:00 p.m. deadline.  The results, as they read them out to us a few minutes later, show that between Election Day and the recount, Rick Scott lost 606 votes, but Bill Nelson lost more than 1,300. And Brenda Snipes, the election supervisor, did come out to say that not every vote was included in the total. There were a few dozen included in a batch that had some duplicates. But they couldn't figure out which ones were duplicates. So they went ahead and submitted them all to avoid having any voters feel disenfranchised.   That is a big concern in the court system today too. Judge Mark Walker has issued a few big rulings today, some celebrated by one side, some celebrated by the other. After initially giving Florida voters whose ballots have been flagged as having issues with signatures until Saturday night to fix them, Judge Walker then ruled that a Democratic motion to blow out the 3:00 p.m. deadline today wasn't going to fly because nobody told him how much he should extend it by. There are also some new questions this afternoon about Judge Walker and whether or not he might want to recuse himself, Neil, because some recently located FEC data has emerged to show that his wife has in the past donated to some of Bill Nelson's campaigns -- Neil.",

The first lady's gotten a little more news lately. She was complaining about the deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel -- I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. She said that she wasn't really helping out, put out a statement to that effect, that she shouldn't be working in the White House. And now she's not. Ms. Ricardel has been reassigned.

In the meantime, take a look at the corner Wall and Broad, where we had stocks down -- or stocks up -- I apologize -- up better than 200 points.  We were down for a good chunk of the day on growing concerns about what's happening in Britain. Brexit seems to be breaking apart right now. And everything was going south, that is, certainly for the British pound vs. the dollar, and even for the British markets earlier on, as Theresa May tries to hang on to our prime ministership. But everything changed on a report that broke that the administration was very close to discussing the grounds of a truce with the Chinese ahead of the G20 summit and what that could mean. And then everything started a reverse because the understanding was that maybe they cobbled together the broad outline of a trade deal with the Chinese. Keep in mind the president is going to meet -- be meeting with President Xi Jinping of China for this summit.  Let's go to Ashley Webster at the New York Stock Exchange.

Could take three or five more days to complete their recount. We will see what the judge says in that. But as far as Senator Nelson goes, because the machines here Tuesday and broke down and they lost a day's worth of counting, and in the end, 3:00 this afternoon, Palm Beach County failed to meet the deadline to get the recount complete. So the original vote numbers from last week, which were submitted on Saturday to the secretary of state, that's what Palm Beach County is now going to have to go with. Well, Nelson wants all of those ballots for the entire county here in Palm Beach to be hand recounted. And we will see what the secretary of state decides about that. I'm sure that will be heard in federal court by the same judge. Also, Senator Nelson took a couple of losses today. He was hoping that the deadline could be just eliminated, and everybody could count until everybody got the recount completed. That was denied as well. So, Senator Nelson, Governor Scott in a very tight race, so tight, it's only 0.14 percent of a difference with Scott in the lead. So everyone fully expects -- and we're expecting a order from the secretary of state any minute to order every county to now do a hand recount in those counties of the ballots, only the ballots that were undervotes are undervote -- or overvotes. And so the number of ballots they will have to go through is dramatically different. The deadline for having that done will be on Sunday.

And in fact, if anything, Governor Scott actually picked up some votes in this process. That wasn't expected. And, obviously, that was a development that Democrats didn't plan on. Palm Beach is a separate issue here, but the same really continues, that the numbers that the Democrats are hoping to pick up, both on the gubernatorial battle and in the Senate battle, and even, by extension, into the agricultural commissioner's battle, where they're really narrow, all these races are narrow, again, within the quarter point gap, the overall number has not changed. In other words, it would take a Herculean leap right now in both the governor and potentially the senatorial battles for the math to change.

You know, I was fortunate enough to be a governor of my state of West Virginia, and I enjoyed support from as many Republicans as I did Democrats. It was a wonderful time. But that doesn't happen in these national races, because they believe that Washington captures us and changes us. Maybe it changes some, Trump not changing me. But with that being said, I think the National Secretary of State Association should basically put people and get its act together and help the states that have continuing troubles. Florida has had perpetual troubles. And they have been deciding in some -- clear back to 2000, George W. Bush and Al Gore.

Michael Dell's trying to take his company public. It went private. And Carl Icahn had essentially been questioning the wisdom of that move, launched a proxy battle against it. He's withdrawn litigation against Dell, terminated the proxy contest. So it would seem to be a victory for full speed ahead for Michael Dell, a company that he started in his dorm room making computers for some of his friends and buddies, and it grew a little bit, to go ahead and go back to being a publicly traded company.

That means there's going to be some carryover delays and problems probably all the way into tomorrow morning. So check your flights. Temperature-wise, though, we're right here, freezing in New York, warming up in D.C. So, where we had some snow earlier, starting to see some rain move in. And that will be the case for a lot of areas along the coast, starting as snow. Eventually, it moves over in towards some rain. But interior sections will be all snow all the time. And that's we're going to see some spots probably up to about 10 inches of snow here. We're only in towards mid-November. Here at Central Park, heavy snow, out at La Guardia, heavy snow, Newark, heavy snow. That's why we're seeing those delays. But the last couple radar images here, you are starting to see that warmer air start to get in the area, and that's where we will see it switch over to some rain. Winter storm warnings in effect all across interior sections, just kind of like a classical nor'easter. And when we put the future radar in motion, you will notice tonight temps in Philadelphia 45, New York 40, Boston 37.  So it warms up along the coast. That transition to rain also means it's going to be very slushy. And right before that happens, we're going to see almost everybody see a really quick downpour of some heavy snow. And that's going to cause some problems along the roadways. A lot of Connecticut, by the way, mostly snow all the way through. Want to show you this. Behind this, cooler air starts to come in.

He's the same judge who just called the state the laughingstock of the world. This is \"Your World,\" and welcome to it. I'm Neil Cavuto. More on the legal fallout from all of that in just a moment. First, Fox team coverage with Peter Doocy in Broward County on the final vote going on there, and the count still goes on there. And Phil Keating  on Palm Beach, still very much up in the air. We begin with Phil -- Phil."

      "speaker": "PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. Good afternoon. The counting room and recounting room here in Palm Beach County, as you can see right now, is devoid of people. The machine recounting has stopped.  And unless that federal judge this hour rules in favor of a Democratic House candidate who has petitioned to eliminate the deadline for Palm Beach County, just so that this county can finish recounting all the races, which could take another three or five days, if that doesn't happen, then the recount is over. As far as Palm Beach County's numbers go that they just submitted to the secretary of state, those are from last week, the ones they submitted on Saturday, so actually not recounted numbers that went from Palm Beach County, which could be the only county in the state, it's still not official yet, that failed to meet at 3:00 deadline. Now, on these tables that are now set up -- and you see all the papers out there -- what's going to be next here is going to be the hand recount order by the secretary of state. They followed the numbers as they did after the first round of counting. That is for the Florida Senate race and here in Palm Beach County, Florida House District 89. They will have 40 people at these tables, papers in front of them and pens. On those pages, they will have to go through all of the undervotes and the overvotes. So these are ballots where somebody filled out all the bubbles or connected the arrows on the ballot form, but in one race, they didn't do that. So that's an undervote. So they will then go through, the people here, and see whether there was any kind of marking on the ballot to indicate who they chose. And then they would decide, OK, we think that was actually an intentional vote, even though the machine didn't notice it. The overvotes are where somebody actually voted for more than one candidate. So there will be looking at those as well. So the number of ballots that would be recounted by hand for the Senate race and the local House race here in Palm Beach County substantially, significantly smaller than the total number of county ballots from Election Day that were just recounted here until two nights ago, when their old and outdated machines broke down. Also, 4:00, Tallahassee, the race between Jim Bonfiglio -- he is the Democrat -- and his Republican opponent, Mike Caruso, that is separated, the total, by just 37 votes. Obviously, that's going to be within the hand recount margin. So everybody's on hold to see what the federal judge decides at the hearing, which is happening right now in Tallahassee, whether Palm Beach County alone will get an extension to finish the recount, or whether it's over for all the state, for all the counties, and now we move on to the hand recounts. All right, Neil?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so there would be a hand recount in those three races, for governor, for Senate, for agricultural commissioner, again, regardless of what happens here, whether they make an extension for Palm Beach, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEATING",
      "utterance": "Correct. Without a doubt, these numbers aren't going to change enough most likely to disavow any expected hand recount. So that's going to happen. Whether anybody else can get involved in Tallahassee and persuade this judge to allow Palm Beach County to finally get back to work and recounted here, we will see this hour ago most Libya."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK, Phil, thank you very, very much, Phil Keating. Now to Peter Doocy in Broward County, which just didn't make today's 3:00 p.m. deadline. That surprised a lot of folks, I guess, huh, Peter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Very early today. Neil, this is the county, Broward, where officials were still finding boxes of ballots or loose ballots days after the election. But, today, they did submit those election results to the secretary of state a few minutes ahead of the 3:00 p.m. deadline. The results, as they read them out to us a few minutes later, show that between Election Day and the recount, Rick Scott lost 606 votes, but Bill Nelson lost more than 1,300. And Brenda Snipes, the election supervisor, did come out to say that not every vote was included in the total. There were a few dozen included in a batch that had some duplicates. But they couldn't figure out which ones were duplicates. So they went ahead and submitted them all to avoid having any voters feel disenfranchised. That is a big concern in the court system today too. Judge Mark Walker has issued a few big rulings today, some celebrated by one side, some celebrated by the other. After initially giving Florida voters whose ballots have been flagged as having issues with signatures until Saturday night to fix them, Judge Walker then ruled that a Democratic motion to blow out the 3:00 p.m. deadline today wasn't going to fly because nobody told him how much he should extend it by. There are also some new questions this afternoon about Judge Walker and whether or not he might want to recuse himself, Neil, because some recently located FEC data has emerged to show that his wife has in the past donated to some of Bill Nelson's campaigns -- Neil."

      "utterance": "All right, I'm sorry I wasn't clear. But just to be -- in getting the final ballots here, did the numbers change? I know it's heavily Democrat. Of course, Nelson had a bigger lead there, a substantial lead. Did the final numbers then favor Rick Scott? In other words, had more votes than was earlier thought than the substantial votes that Nelson already had?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOOCY",
      "utterance": "So, statewide, as the counties are still coming in -- and we still have not heard officially from the secretary of state in Tallahassee that a hand recount is about to start and at what time it's going to start. But the numbers that are coming in from all these different machine -- a couple dozen -- dozen different machine recounts show that the Scott lead has extended a little bit, but less than 1,000 for now."

Election law attorney Brian Silber. Brian, that is an important distinction because obviously in these counts, it's very important for the losing candidate to see if he can gain some ground, whether the gubernatorial battle, the Senate battle, the agricultural commissioner battle. And then we have these 4,000 or so absentee and other ballots where they have to verify signatures. So if -- I know there's going to be a hand count as well, but a lot of things have to go Senator Nelson's way even if you got all of those ballots that are -- signatures are being checked. It wouldn't be enough to close the gap at this point."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SILBER",
      "utterance": "So the very first thing that you have to realize is, in a manual recount, we're not counting every single ballot that was cast. That is not the situation. We are limited strictly to manually looking at those ballots that the machines cannot read. And the reason why they can't read them is because they're an overvote or an undervote. All that machine does is read penciled-in ovals. That's it. It's a Scantron machine. So when it gets a check, a dot, something not registered, that's when a human has to come in and look at it. And that's the part that's going to be the manual recount."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK. So, when Broward County officials seem to be indicating to us, for example, the Democratic county, that the sway in these numbers doesn't seem -- and I know what you're saying about process -- it's a very good point and a reminder to us -- but a lot of people are looking, what will change in this process as it moves to the hand count, and verifying signatures and all that? But that they are saying, at least in their county, that the numbers have not starkly moved one way or the other. Then it gets to the hand recount.  Assuming that doesn't change, the final numbers come in statewide by November 20, when all this has to be finalized, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SILBER",
      "utterance": "That's correct. And, in my experience, having handled a recount in the past, this just summer -- this summer, in fact, the electronic recount is almost perfect.  When we redid about -- it must have been about a quarter million votes, the numbers came back exact. They didn't even change by one single vote."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

This was a well-scheduled and telegraphed, planned event on the part of the first lady to address cyber-bullying at a family Online Safety Institute annual conference put on by the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C. The first lady's gotten a little more news lately. She was complaining about the deputy national security adviser, Mira Ricardel -- I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. She said that she wasn't really helping out, put out a statement to that effect, that she shouldn't be working in the White House. And now she's not. Ms. Ricardel has been reassigned. But, again, whether there is an opportunity here for the first lady to take questions, we will take you to that when it becomes possible. In the meantime, take a look at the corner Wall and Broad, where we had stocks down -- or stocks up -- I apologize -- up better than 200 points.  We were down for a good chunk of the day on growing concerns about what's happening in Britain. Brexit seems to be breaking apart right now. And everything was going south, that is, certainly for the British pound vs. the dollar, and even for the British markets earlier on, as Theresa May tries to hang on to our prime ministership. But everything changed on a report that broke that the administration was very close to discussing the grounds of a truce with the Chinese ahead of the G20 summit and what that could mean. And then everything started a reverse because the understanding was that maybe they cobbled together the broad outline of a trade deal with the Chinese. Keep in mind the president is going to meet -- be meeting with President Xi Jinping of China for this summit. Let's go to Ashley Webster at the New York Stock Exchange. Talk about getting whipsawed on this stuff, huh?"

But I want to focus, if I can, on Brexit, because we for so much of the session, certainly through two-thirds of it, were dealing with all these headlines and the effort by the U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to try and salvage and sell this withdrawal plan she's put together that nobody seems to like, including her own Cabinet. So, as you can see, she spent some time on the floor of the Houses of Parliament today, saying this is the best deal we can get, maybe we can change it for the better down the road, but this is the best deal you're going to get. But people on both sides of the aisle say, this is a terrible deal. Well, later on this afternoon, the U.K. prime minister held a press conference and addressed the country. And she basically said, look, this is the best deal. It's now up to the U.K. Parliament to approve it. Take a listen."

The future of Theresa May would then be very much in doubt. And then there would be questions of whether there should be another vote.  But bottom line, this Brexit deal, this divorce has taken years to bring to fruition, and it's far from over. It's very messy indeed. And that does have an impact on the markets -- Neil."

I mean, they're both going to have things that they can go back to their constituents and say, look, we have got a good deal here.

I think we got a lot of goes-ins and goes-outs. But I think, overall, we have a strong economy, a lot of concern with these external events. We have got the Fed rate.

As Bob was speaking, we're getting an urgent coming in concerning this Palm Beach County move to continue right now and give state authorities what they have from the ballots they tried to count. They didn't get them all counted. Well, now Senator Nelson's attorney, they're suing Palm Beach County and the Florida secretary of state, saying they should first do that job before handing off any other job. They're ticked. The heat is on. And it's still a week-plus after the election. More after this."

They had some of machine irregularities. Well, Senator Nelson's people have responded that say they're going to sue now over this. \"We have sued Palm Beach County and the Florida secretary of state to require a hand count of all ballots in the county, due to systematic machine failure during the machine recount.\" And back and forth we go. Phil Keating in Riviera Beach, Florida, what does this mean now?"

      "utterance": "Well, the federal judge up in Tallahassee that has been handling all of these lawsuits filed by not only the Nelson campaign, the Governor Scott campaign, as well as some other groups, he's trying to assume them all. Actually, right now in Tallahassee, that judge is hearing arguments to allow Palm Beach County to actually resume the machine recount just for this county alone. Could take three or five more days to complete their recount. We will see what the judge says in that. But as far as Senator Nelson goes, because the machines here Tuesday and broke down and they lost a day's worth of counting, and in the end, 3:00 this afternoon, Palm Beach County failed to meet the deadline to get the recount complete. So the original vote numbers from last week, which were submitted on Saturday to the secretary of state, that's what Palm Beach County is now going to have to go with. Well, Nelson wants all of those ballots for the entire county here in Palm Beach to be hand recounted. And we will see what the secretary of state decides about that. I'm sure that will be heard in federal court by the same judge. Also, Senator Nelson took a couple of losses today. He was hoping that the deadline could be just eliminated, and everybody could count until everybody got the recount completed. That was denied as well. So, Senator Nelson, Governor Scott in a very tight race, so tight, it's only 0.14 percent of a difference with Scott in the lead. So everyone fully expects -- and we're expecting a order from the secretary of state any minute to order every county to now do a hand recount in those counties of the ballots, only the ballots that were undervotes are undervote -- or overvotes. And so the number of ballots they will have to go through is dramatically different. The deadline for having that done will be on Sunday. So there will be a hand recount for the Senate race here, but Senator Nelson wants a machine recount of all of the ballots as well."

The oddity is, in the counting that we're getting, is there was nothing that narrowed that gap between Senator Nelson and Governor Scott statewide. And in fact, if anything, Governor Scott actually picked up some votes in this process. That wasn't expected. And, obviously, that was a development that Democrats didn't plan on. Palm Beach is a separate issue here, but the same really continues, that the numbers that the Democrats are hoping to pick up, both on the gubernatorial battle and in the Senate battle, and even, by extension, into the agricultural commissioner's battle, where they're really narrow, all these races are narrow, again, within the quarter point gap, the overall number has not changed. In other words, it would take a Herculean leap right now in both the governor and potentially the senatorial battles for the math to change. It's an issue, I'm sure, that came up at the White House today, as the president was meeting with GOP leadership. John Roberts at the White House right now. Hey, John."

But the president also with a number of other things on the agenda today, as he met with the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Senator John Thune and Senator Richard Shelby. Among the things they talked about, the pending judicial nominations that the president wants to get through, as well as appropriations, including border security funding, wall funding, disaster relief funding, the farm bill and prison reform. The judicial nominations jumped back up on the radar screen after Arizona Senator Jeff Flake complained about the appointment of Matt Whitaker as the interim attorney general, fearing that the Mueller investigation would be in some jeopardy as a result, and saying that he would vote against the president's judicial nominations until and unless the Senate took up legislation to protect the Mueller investigation.

The president could have a major immigration reform bill that works and gives him a legacy that no other president has ever had. Just adopt the 2013 bipartisan bill, and he can make that happen.

But that doesn't happen in these national races, because they believe that Washington captures us and changes us. Maybe it changes some, Trump not changing me. But with that being said, I think the National Secretary of State Association should basically put people and get its act together and help the states that have continuing troubles. Florida has had perpetual troubles. And they have been deciding in some -- clear back to 2000, George W. Bush and Al Gore.

He's withdrawn litigation against Dell, terminated the proxy contest.

That means there's going to be some carryover delays and problems probably all the way into tomorrow morning. So check your flights. Temperature-wise, though, we're right here, freezing in New York, warming up in D.C. So, where we had some snow earlier, starting to see some rain move in. And that will be the case for a lot of areas along the coast, starting as snow. Eventually, it moves over in towards some rain. But interior sections will be all snow all the time. And that's we're going to see some spots probably up to about 10 inches of snow here. We're only in towards mid-November. Here at Central Park, heavy snow, out at La Guardia, heavy snow, Newark, heavy snow. That's why we're seeing those delays. But the last couple radar images here, you are starting to see that warmer air start to get in the area, and that's where we will see it switch over to some rain. Winter storm warnings in effect all across interior sections, just kind of like a classical nor'easter. And when we put the future radar in motion, you will notice tonight temps in Philadelphia 45, New York 40, Boston 37.  So it warms up along the coast. That transition to rain also means it's going to be very slushy. And right before that happens, we're going to see almost everybody see a really quick downpour of some heavy snow. And that's going to cause some problems along the roadways. A lot of Connecticut, by the way, mostly snow all the way through. Want to show you this. Behind this, cooler air starts to come in.

But, Kat, one of the things that has come up in this process is that what ballots they have counted have actually tipped in the Republican candidate's favorite, particularly in that senatorial race with Rick Scott, and I think the Nelson people were hoping -- they won that Broward County, for example, Palm Beach County, by overwhelming numbers. But that they were hoping that would certainly pick up votes there, and they didn't. What are we to glean from that?"

      "utterance": "Well, that's certainly obviously what they were hoping, and not the case. Republicans are going to win on this issue. But I just think that bigger focus needs to be, we need to make sure there isn't the same mess in 2020 as there is here. There's problems with..."

      "utterance": "That's the issue. There's problems in lots of states here. In New York, there's problems with wet ballots and those kinds of things. But we know New York is going to go blue. So it's not as big of an issue. When it happens in Florida, it's this big national story. They have issues with, for example, old machines causing problems. They shouldn't have old machines when they know that there could potentially be an issue coming up like this, and they will need to have to deal with it in a timely manner."

      "utterance": "What do you think of this and the back and forth? I mean, let's say Scott wins legitimately. Still, it's a close vote. That DeSantis wins legitimately, still a close vote. But is there going to be an asterisk then next to the winner's name forever until the end of time?"

      "speaker": "JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I'm not completely sure. I think whatever happens in Georgia, there's going to be an asterisk there, the case that Stacey Abrams and her people are making against Brian Kemp, which is more reliant on voter fraud -- sorry -- voter disenfranchisement and voter repression throughout the early voting period and then on Election Day, is a lot stronger than what's going on here."

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Well, no, no -- well, that's the accusation, that he -- I mean, there were hundreds of thousands of people removed from the voter rolls in Georgia over the course of Brian Kemp's tenure there. So that's the accusation there. I think, in terms of the asterisk, as long as these lawsuits are filed, and it goes the distance, and they give them the amount of days that it takes to satisfy what Marc Elias, who is Bill Nelson's lawyer, is asking for, I think there will always be people who say it has an asterisk, but, generally speaking, I mean, Florida does elect Republicans, and by slim margins. And this happens there all the time."

      "utterance": "Of course. But -- so, we were talking about out this on Saturday morning. The idea that ballot is designed in such a way that Bill Nelson could have lost out on up to 3 percent of his vote because of name placement is so ludicrous. That has to be changed by 2020. And I don't know why Election Day isn't a national holiday."

    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "OK. All right, Kat, what do you think, blue wave, or how do you size it up?"
