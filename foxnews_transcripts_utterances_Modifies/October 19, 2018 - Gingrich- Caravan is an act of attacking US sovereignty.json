      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle\" live tonight from Washington. President Trump is holding a huge rally at this moment in Mesa, Arizona, which we'll bring you in just moments. Newt Gingrich, Dinesh D'Souza, Matt Schlapp, Raymund Arroyo, Corey Lewandowski will be joining me to comment throughout this hour. And remember, Mesa is just 150 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, a location where more than 5,000 migrants, of course, have their sights on. And today the Mexican government perhaps fearing retribution from President Trump, tried to block the group from crossing into the Mexico-Guatemala frontier, but as you can see here, the crowd broke down the gates and started streaming in.  Police using pepper spray were able to finally stop the rest of the caravan, but not after many got through. Now, \"The Ingraham Angle\" spoke exclusively tonight with a Mexican official who told us the following -- the migrants are using women and some pregnant and children at the front of this line in an effort to intimidate the Mexican police, so obviously they're not going to use force against women and children.  And the same official relayed to us that there are currently 1,000 Mexican federales at its border with Guatemala. Reinforcements are being sent in as we speak. And many the police are telling the source that many of the people inside the caravan grew violent today, injuring 67 Mexican police officers who themselves have no weapons except shields and they do have some batons if things get bad and tear gas.  The official closed his conversation with \"The Ingraham Angle\" saying the following, \"We will not allow our country to be literally invaded from the south. It is critical now to take a stand because if this model is the immigration model going forward, you will see a caravan of this size coming every week.\" So Mexico has its own interest in stopping these caravans from flying through Mexico. And now what you see right here is not from the caravan, but take a look at this video Fox News obtained. This is yesterday morning at 3:30 a.m. in Yuma, Arizona. Now, you can see four different groups of illegals climbing over the border wall, dropping right into the United States. And as President Trump said last night, this could be the election of the caravan.  And I wanted to bring in right now former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Newt, thanks for being here tonight, a big night. Let's start with this caravan issue. The president said this, you know, this could be the election of Kavanaugh and the caravan. Kavanaugh, we understand because of fairness and due process and men feel like they're being targeted unfairly. Why is this caravan issue important both to Mexico and of course to the United States?",

They don't need two -- one foot. We have the greatest people, ICE, Border Patrol, law enforcement.  And the law doesn't allow us to throw them the hell out. We have to take them, we have to write them up, and then we say, come back in three years for a court case. In the meantime, they're released into our society. And you know what the percentage of people that come back for the case? Three percent. No, you're wrong. He said zero. You were slightly off, three percent. Three percent show up three years, four years, five years later. It's a disgrace and the Democrats do it. And we don't have enough votes, we don't have enough Republicans to override their (inaudible) because they do stick together. And remember this. They're only sticking together because they want to make sure that I and we don't get what they know our country needs. But I think they may be forced politically to do it because I've got to tell you, anybody that votes for a Democrat now is crazy when you look at what's coming up. It's crazy. Got to be crazy. The Democrats don't care about what their extremist immigration agenda will do to your communities, your hospitals. How about your hospitals are being overrun? Your schools. California, they wants to give you free education, free healthcare, open borders. I mean, we could have 10 million people move to California. This is the craziest thing. So here's what we do. Let's get these people out of there. There's something wrong. They're cuckoo. The Democrats don't care that a flood of illegal immigration is going to totally bankrupt our country because all the Democrats want is power. And don't forget, everybody that comes across the border, for the most part, they're going to vote Democrat. They're not voting Republican. They're going to vote Democrat. So nobody said they are stupid, but it's bad for our country, but they're going to vote Democrat no matter what we do, they will be voting Democrat and they understand that. That's why Democrats support programs like catch and release. That's why Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare, free healthcare, and free education, give them a driver's license -- give them a driver's license. Next thing you know, they'll want to buy them a car. Then they'll say the car is not good enough. We want -- how about a Rolls-Royce. We want a Rolls-Royce. Made not in America. So therefore, I hope that's not what we do.  That's why Democrats want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. How about in California, where illegal immigrants took over the town council and now the town council is run by illegal immigrants in the town? I mean, is this even believable? You tell this stuff. It is sick. That's why Democrats want to abolish ICE, the most brave people. These people -- I wouldn't want their job. Nobody up here wants their job. I can tell by looking. They go into the toughest situations. We call them nests. Nests of very bad people. They don't like using guns. They would much rather use knives because it's much painful and slower. These are really bad people. And ICE goes in there and it's like a day at the office. No problem. And they free towns, like in Long Island. They liberate towns. It's like liberation from a war. They liberate towns. And the Democrats think that ICE isn't nice. We have to get rid of ICE. We cherish Ice and we cherish Border Patrol and we cherish our law enforcement. The casualties in the Democrats' open borders crusade are innocent American families and lives. And we have some of these incredible people with us tonight. Democrat immigration policies allow poisonous drugs, vicious gang members and MS-13 killers to pour into our country. And we have done a great job. We have removed thousands of MS-13. Get them the hell out -- thousands -- thousands and thousands. And Democrat sanctuary cities release dangerous predators out of s jail and straight into your community.",

And what we've seen from this president is the lowest unemployment rate for African-Americans and Hispanics and women in record number of years, in literally most people's lifetimes. And so the influx of illegal immigration into our country is not going to help us. It's not going to solve a problem. This is something that we need to control. And it goes back to what Ronald Reagan said some 30 years ago. A country that doesn't control or can't control its borders isn't a country at all.

President Trump is holding a huge rally at this moment in Mesa, Arizona, which we'll bring you in just moments. Newt Gingrich, Dinesh D'Souza, Matt Schlapp, Raymund Arroyo, Corey Lewandowski will be joining me to comment throughout this hour. And remember, Mesa is just 150 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, a location where more than 5,000 migrants, of course, have their sights on. And today the Mexican government perhaps fearing retribution from President Trump, tried to block the group from crossing into the Mexico-Guatemala frontier, but as you can see here, the crowd broke down the gates and started streaming in. Police using pepper spray were able to finally stop the rest of the caravan, but not after many got through. Now, \"The Ingraham Angle\" spoke exclusively tonight with a Mexican official who told us the following -- the migrants are using women and some pregnant and children at the front of this line in an effort to intimidate the Mexican police, so obviously they're not going to use force against women and children. And the same official relayed to us that there are currently 1,000 Mexican federales at its border with Guatemala. Reinforcements are being sent in as we speak. And many the police are telling the source that many of the people inside the caravan grew violent today, injuring 67 Mexican police officers who themselves have no weapons except shields and they do have some batons if things get bad and tear gas. The official closed his conversation with \"The Ingraham Angle\" saying the following, \"We will not allow our country to be literally invaded from the south. It is critical now to take a stand because if this model is the immigration model going forward, you will see a caravan of this size coming every week.\" So Mexico has its own interest in stopping these caravans from flying through Mexico. And now what you see right here is not from the caravan, but take a look at this video Fox News obtained. This is yesterday morning at 3:30 a.m. in Yuma, Arizona. Now, you can see four different groups of illegals climbing over the border wall, dropping right into the United States. And as President Trump said last night, this could be the election of the caravan. And I wanted to bring in right now former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Newt, thanks for being here tonight, a big night. Let's start with this caravan issue. The president said this, you know, this could be the election of Kavanaugh and the caravan. Kavanaugh, we understand because of fairness and due process and men feel like they're being targeted unfairly. Why is this caravan issue important both to Mexico and of course to the United States?"

They don't like to control the border. They don't like to stop immigration. In fact, Stacy Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia said she regarded the undocumented and the documented as equal so she is basically saying you get here illegally you are part of her majority coalition.

A lot of, I think Americans and I noticed this on radio today. They give to various organizations, international organizations that help children in need, including in Central America, like food for the poor, all these great organizations. They say, look, we have a lot of problems here. We're compassionate people. We do not want to feel like we're bad people or horrible people because we don't want to say, anyone who wants to come in can come in.

They live 10 in a house. And it's good for some of these construction work crews in D.C., most of them speaking Spanish, hardworking people.

It takes $7,000 a person. That's a $35 million project (ph). Now, who's paying for it?

And we want to become a country that's welcoming to people who want to obey the law and play by the rules. And I think this whole notion of jobs versus mobs is real. And you've seen it here at home with Democratic mobs. You're seeing it now trying tp come up from Guatemala with a mob and this is a very serious question. You've had some very strange comments.

Well, if word went out worldwide, get to California and they'll take care of your healthcare, the sheer cost of that would break the American system. And I think we need to understand, these are folks who don't have a clue about the real world. What they're focused on is power. They want power over you and me.

They stick together better than the Republicans. The one thing they do, and they stick -- they don't want us to have the victory of a wall, even though we've got much more money for our military. Many, many times more. We got money. But they don't want us to have the wall even though they know it's the right thing. They will fight to the death because they don't want us to have the wall, but we started the wall anyway. And we're going to get that done. We're going to get it done. And now it's as a point, when you look, it's really at a point, when you look at what's pouring over in these caravans. When they start saying, we don't want to change those immigration laws that are so bad, catch and release, we don't want to change visa lottery. Think of visa lottery. They pick names out of a hat. Visa lottery. Think about it. Do you think that this country or whichever country it is, are they going to put their finest in there? I don't think so. I don't think so. Chain migration, you come over and then they have -- we had a guy on the Westside Highway. He goes down the highway. He's going 60, 70 miles an hour. Radical Islam. Terrible. Makes a right turn into a park, kills nine people -- badly injures that nobody ever talks about. People that are running along the beautiful Hudson River because they want to stay in shape, they end up going home six months later with no legs, with no arms because of people like this, sick people. These are sick people. And they has allowed, this guy had 22 people. He brought in his mother, his father, his brother, his sisters, his aunts, his uncles, because of Democrats' policy. That's called chain migration. It's a chain. It sounds so good, like right out of school. Sounds so beautiful, the chain. Everyone comes together. Nope. We're ending it, folks. And the Democrats don't want to do it, but we're ending it, folks. And catch and release, how about that? That's my favorite. Catch. You catch a damn killer. You catch a bad hombre. You catch a bad one. You take the name. And we're supposed to bring them to court, but we have hundreds of thousands of people. And it's all my fault. You know why? Because we, I, you, altogether we've made this country so strong, economically so good, jobs, everything, that everybody wants to come in. So it's my fault. But you know what we're not letting them in. We're only going to let people in based on merit. We need people to come in based on merit. So you have catch and release. They put one foot. They don't need two -- one foot. We have the greatest people, ICE, Border Patrol, law enforcement. And the law doesn't allow us to throw them the hell out. We have to take them, we have to write them up, and then we say, come back in three years for a court case. In the meantime, they're released into our society. And you know what the percentage of people that come back for the case? Three percent. No, you're wrong. He said zero. You were slightly off, three percent. Three percent show up three years, four years, five years later. It's a disgrace and the Democrats do it. And we don't have enough votes, we don't have enough Republicans to override their (inaudible) because they do stick together. And remember this. They're only sticking together because they want to make sure that I and we don't get what they know our country needs. But I think they may be forced politically to do it because I've got to tell you, anybody that votes for a Democrat now is crazy when you look at what's coming up. It's crazy. Got to be crazy. The Democrats don't care about what their extremist immigration agenda will do to your communities, your hospitals. How about your hospitals are being overrun? Your schools. California, they wants to give you free education, free healthcare, open borders. I mean, we could have 10 million people move to California. This is the craziest thing. So here's what we do. Let's get these people out of there. There's something wrong. They're cuckoo. The Democrats don't care that a flood of illegal immigration is going to totally bankrupt our country because all the Democrats want is power. And don't forget, everybody that comes across the border, for the most part, they're going to vote Democrat. They're not voting Republican. They're going to vote Democrat. So nobody said they are stupid, but it's bad for our country, but they're going to vote Democrat no matter what we do, they will be voting Democrat and they understand that. That's why Democrats support programs like catch and release. That's why Democrats want to give illegal aliens free welfare, free healthcare, and free education, give them a driver's license -- give them a driver's license. Next thing you know, they'll want to buy them a car. Then they'll say the car is not good enough. We want -- how about a Rolls-Royce. We want a Rolls-Royce. Made not in America. So therefore, I hope that's not what we do. That's why Democrats want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. How about in California, where illegal immigrants took over the town council and now the town council is run by illegal immigrants in the town? I mean, is this even believable? You tell this stuff. It is sick. That's why Democrats want to abolish ICE, the most brave people. These people -- I wouldn't want their job. Nobody up here wants their job. I can tell by looking. They go into the toughest situations. We call them nests. Nests of very bad people. They don't like using guns. They would much rather use knives because it's much painful and slower. These are really bad people. And ICE goes in there and it's like a day at the office. No problem. And they free towns, like in Long Island. They liberate towns. It's like liberation from a war. They liberate towns. And the Democrats think that ICE isn't nice. We have to get rid of ICE. We cherish Ice and we cherish Border Patrol and we cherish our law enforcement. The casualties in the Democrats' open borders crusade are innocent American families and lives. And we have some of these incredible people with us tonight. Democrat immigration policies allow poisonous drugs, vicious gang members and MS-13 killers to pour into our country. And we have done a great job. We have removed thousands of MS-13. Get them the hell out -- thousands -- thousands and thousands. And Democrat sanctuary cities release dangerous predators out of s jail and straight into your community."

First of all, you can sort of see why she and her clever consultants would have said if you're ever going to run for president, you've got to prove that in fact you have not been lying about whether or not you're Native American, not just Native American, whether or not you're Cherokee. So then she goes off and first of all the timing again is terrible because it exactly fits the wrong thing. Talk about it the week after the election. Then she goes off anyway because (inaudible) and they take the test and the test comes back and basically says that most Americans are at least as much native American as she is and that there is zero possibility that you could prove that she is Cherokee based on that test. And in fact, the indications seem to be that if she has any Native American blood, it's actually Latin American, not North American. And knew things she's kind of smarter then she does this thing and it's just beyond dumb. I mean, she's going to go from Pocahontas -- I have no idea what Trump's new name term is going to be, but I'm confident that he's already working on it.

And now they move to this, which is a horde of people moving inexorably to the United States. It's the fundamental job of any government to protect its own citizens. If we think about why, in liberal theory, why do we have a government at all, its primary duty is to protect us from foreign and domestic thugs. And here we have a group of foreign people moving towards our border, who knows how much drugs, who knows what crime, and to cheer this on as if it were some kind of boon to the United States, I don't think it makes any sense.

But, Corey, the president won on the issue of immigration. That was, I think, above all else, that was the issue that he won on. I want to put up a graphic for you. This is effect on communities of immigration in the United States. And it's going to surprise a lot of people. Immigration change made by community, made it worse, white voters says immigration has made it worse, 58 percent, black voters 45 percent said that immigration change has made their community worse, Hispanic voters, 44 percent of them, say it has made their community worse, other 51 percent.

And the reason the numbers are so staggering, whether you're in the African-American community, the Hispanic community, or any other community is when you have people pouring across the border and taking jobs away from people here illegally, it has an economic impact on those people who are here legally, who are American citizens, who want to go to work. And what we've seen from this president is the lowest unemployment rate for African-Americans and Hispanics and women in record number of years, in literally most people's lifetimes. And so the influx of illegal immigration into our country is not going to help us. It's not going to solve a problem. This is something that we need to control. And it goes back to what Ronald Reagan said some 30 years ago. A country that doesn't control or can't control its borders isn't a country at all.
