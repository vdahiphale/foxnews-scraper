It's probably the most influential. Its results shape the way we understand the world. Most of us assume that on some level it is honest, Google search. But what if it's not honest? What if Google is secretly corrupting its search results to influence votes? Tonight we have exclusive evidence that that may in fact be happening at Google. We'll have the report for you in a minute. Don't miss that.  We also have a can't-miss championship edition of Final Exams, Shannon Bream and Katie Pavlich for the belt coming up as well.  But first tonight, the claim against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that he committed some kind of sexual assault, while a student in high school, has metastasized into something different, something ugly, and something threatening to all of us.  We've learned remarkably little about Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Ford in the past week despite a lot of words on their behalf. The facts of the case are still sparse and they're murky. But we've learned a disturbing amount about the Left and what it's willing to do in order to maintain control of this country. Watch a clip from today in which New York Senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, explained why she knows Brett Kavanaugh is guilty. Watch.",

      "sentences": "So try to ignore the yelling there and the theatrics and the pure demagoguery of the moment and focus instead on Kirsten Gillibrand's reasoning to the extent that there is any.   \"I believe her because she's telling the truth.\" Or put it another way, it's true because it is. Now, in logic class, they call this circular reasoning which isn't actually reasoning at all. Instead, it's simply a demand that you believe something because someone else is asserting it. Children talk this way. You think you a U.S. senator would be embarrassed to. But it's the second part of Gillibrand's statement that you ought to pay attention to because it's scary. Kavanaugh hasn't called for yet another FBI investigation into himself. Therefore, Senator Gillibrand says he did it. Is that the reaction of an innocent person, she thunders? It is not.  Well not since the McCarthy era almost 70 years ago have lawmakers talked like this in this country. Unless you call for an FBI investigation of yourself, you're guilty of a crime. Even Joe McCarthy himself never said anything like that. It was too reckless even for him.   And now, one of the Democratic Party's leading presidential candidates casually drops the line at a press conference and the media hardly notice. So, apparently that's the new standard in Washington. OK. Well let's start with Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand was a friend of Harvey Weinstein's. Here's a picture of the two of them together. Weinstein has been credibly accused of rape. Did Kirsten Gillibrand know about Weinstein's sexual assaults? Was she an accessory to them?  We've asked those questions before on this show but we never got an answer. Why hasn't Gillibrand demanded an FBI investigation into herself to clear that up? Is that the reaction of an innocent person? By her standards, it's not. So bring on the FBI. Let them interview Kirsten Gillibrand under oath, maybe surprise her at her home at dawn with a search warrant.  And while they're at it, they should take a very close look at her relationship with Bill Clinton, another accused rapist. No doubt the Senator will beg for an investigation into that too assuming she's innocent. If she hesitates, press charges.  This is lunatic. Sober liberals understand that it is. Democrats don't want Brett Kavanaugh on the court because they disagree with him and that's understandable, by the way. They're angry that the Republican Senate refused to vote on Barack Obama's last Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. That's understandable too. But what's happening now is dangerous in a way that has nothing to do with politics. It's a threat to the civil liberties of every American, no matter who you voted for in 2016. Extremism has exploded on the Left and nobody is trying to contain it.  Here's one particularly jarring example of that. This is Congressman John Garamendi of California. We know him well. He's one of the few House Democrats willing to come on this show.   We don't usually agree with Garamendi but we've always found him to be a decent and reasonable person, always. Here's what he just said about the Kavanaugh allegations.",

Are they inherently less fair or less decent because of the way they look? Garamendi is implying exactly that. So, how is that different or better than anything George Wallace ever said? Well it's not, except that suddenly this filth is everywhere, so you hardly even notice it. The last thing this country needs right now is more racial division.   Democrats are pushing it anyway. They're using allegations that have literally nothing to do with race at all. But splitting the country into tiny warring groups is useful to them. It helps them maintain their power and so they're happy to do it. Men against women, Black against White, divide and conquer whatever it takes. In the end, it's unlikely that we'll ever know conclusively what happened between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Ford 36 years ago, if anything at all. But it's crystal clear what's happening right now.  This is a power grab. It is hurting the country destroying our centuries' old traditions of justice and empowering morons and demagogues. We ought to shut it down right now.  And yet, and this is late-breaking news, just seconds before airtime we learned that this may go on and on. Republicans on the Hill tonight are considering delaying the hearing scheduled for Monday. At this point, Brett Kavanaugh will be testifying by himself to some future date. Because of the rules of the Senate, that would push back the vote on Kavanaugh by at least a week, if not more, which is, of course, the whole point, to drag the country through this pointless charade, this circus, which divides us and hurts us and degrades our standards of justice simply for political ends. That's where we are. Ian Samuel is a Professor at Indiana University Law School and he joins us tonight. Professor, I'm glad you're here as a law professor. I - I want to ask you about what Senator Gillibrand said today.   She's a lawyer as well, I believe. And she said that the new standard is unless you call for an FBI investigation into yourself you are by definition guilty. Is that a legal standard that you recognize?",

That exclusive is next. The news has been overwhelming tonight. A very special break from the madness are two-time all champ - all-time champions face off in the ultimate Final Exam.

      "sentences": "Tonight, we have a development in our ongoing exclusive investigation into the behavior of Google. There are new emails first obtained by this show. Now Google, as you know, is the most powerful company in the history of the world. Virtually all human information flows through its software. And for that reason, Google shapes much of how the world understands reality. At the heart of Google's business is its search engine which has a virtual monopoly on search in this country and others. Google search succeeds because it is blindingly efficient but also because it is perceived as honest. When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come to the top. The process is straightforward and democratic. That's what most people think. That's how it's perceived and that's why the world trusts Google.  But what if Google was lying to you? What if the results that you got were secretly weighted to get you to vote a certain way, to believe a certain thing? That would affect a lot of people and a lot of votes. In fact, it would be impossible to have a real democracy under circumstances like that. A small number of incredibly rich people would be in charge of everything including your perceptions. Well that is a major concern for all of us because Google is a very political company. We recently showed you email evidence of the Google effort to collude with a Left-wing group in support of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Now tonight, we have internal documents that show that Google employees discussed corrupting the company's search engine to push propaganda on hundreds of millions of unsuspecting users. Here's what happened. Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued his now-famous travel ban. Almost immediately after that, Google employees began plotting ways to undermine the President's Executive Order. On January 29th, a Google Product Marketing Manager named Mackenzie Thomas sent an email to a group of fellow employees. \"There is a large brainstorm going on throughout the marketing org\" she wrote, brainstorming about how to respond to Trump's order. Among Thomas' ideas was \"To actively counter algorithmically biased results for search terms such as Islam, Iran, Mexico, Latino and so forth.\"  In other words, Google employees wanted to alter the search results to make them more positive in certain cases for political reasons. Thomas also suggested promoting links for making donations to organizations fighting the travel ban. This, of course, would be completely dishonest and unethical behavior. But Thomas' colleagues at Google seemed to approve of it strongly. Product Manager Rami Banna , for example, replied this way. \"We're absolutely in Mackenzie, anything you need. We'll put together a list of orgs with Meryl and HL team.\" Another employee named Stacey Chen added that group she thought Google should promote included the ACLU, the defect - the Immigration Defense Project, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and the National Immigration Law Center. All of those groups were at the time agitating against the President's immigration ban. Even at least one person on the chain seemed to realize how dangerous and out of the ordinary this conversation was. A Google employee called Clement Wolf commented that \"He was very much in favor of Google stepping up\" but was wondering \"How partisan we want to be on this? To the extent of my knowledge, we'd be breaching precedent if we only gave highlights access to organizations that support a certain view.\" We contacted Google about these remarkable emails and the reply to us is here in full. \"These emails were just a brainstorm of ideas, none of which were ever implemented. Google has never manipulated its search results or modified any of its products to promote a particular political ideology - not in the current campaign season, not during the 2016 election, and not in the aftermath of President Trump's Executive Order on immigration. Our processes and policies would not have allowed for any manipulation of search results to promote political ideologies.\" Left unanswered by Google was why anyone would believe that statement for a second. Nor did Google say anything about the employees on that email chain. Presumably, they still work at Google which is remarkable.  If you ran a bank and caught your tellers brainstorming about how to rob the vault, would they still work for you? Remember that Google fired an engineer called James Damore last summer almost instantly. The CEO flew back from family vacation to fire him. Why? Because Damore was caught expressing mildly conservatives ideas in a private memo. Here, Google employees are plotting to subvert our entire public conversation secretly. But that's fine with Google. It shouldn't be fine with any of us or with the U.S. Congress. Google executives are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill next week. The scheduled topic is privacy. But it would be nice if at least one elected representative asked about this because it's much scarier than anything Russia ever attempted. Peter Schweizer wrote \"Clinton Cash.\" He now has a fantastic new documentary called \"The Creepy Line\" about big tech and he joins us tonight. Are you surprised by this?",

I also complained back in May about the DFL's failure to investigate harassment of a gay - gay man in the 8th Congressional District. He wrote a very detailed email describing very explicit harassment in 2016 that was just swept under the rug. And I finally wrote the DFL Chair Ken Martin, and that man went public with that. And he - of course, Ken Martin's been furious with me. And I complained about that not being investigated. And then Ken Martin started sending me emails saying he's got to, you know, starting to consider legal action if I keep complaining about this. Well, you know, my answer to this is that both political parties need to focus on cleaning up their own act before they start attacking the other party. There's a lot of covering up going on and sexual harassment, abuse, and all of these problems are being covered up by the Democrats as well as the Republicans.

It's probably the most influential. Its results shape the way we understand the world. Most of us assume that on some level it is honest, Google search. But what if it's not honest? What if Google is secretly corrupting its search results to influence votes? Tonight we have exclusive evidence that that may in fact be happening at Google. We'll have the report for you in a minute. Don't miss that. We also have a can't-miss championship edition of Final Exams, Shannon Bream and Katie Pavlich for the belt coming up as well. But first tonight, the claim against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that he committed some kind of sexual assault, while a student in high school, has metastasized into something different, something ugly, and something threatening to all of us. We've learned remarkably little about Brett Kavanaugh or Christine Ford in the past week despite a lot of words on their behalf. The facts of the case are still sparse and they're murky. But we've learned a disturbing amount about the Left and what it's willing to do in order to maintain control of this country.

Now, in logic class, they call this circular reasoning which isn't actually reasoning at all. Instead, it's simply a demand that you believe something because someone else is asserting it. Children talk this way. You think you a U.S. senator would be embarrassed to. But it's the second part of Gillibrand's statement that you ought to pay attention to because it's scary. Kavanaugh hasn't called for yet another FBI investigation into himself. Therefore, Senator Gillibrand says he did it. Is that the reaction of an innocent person, she thunders? It is not. Well not since the McCarthy era almost 70 years ago have lawmakers talked like this in this country. Unless you call for an FBI investigation of yourself, you're guilty of a crime. Even Joe McCarthy himself never said anything like that. It was too reckless even for him. And now, one of the Democratic Party's leading presidential candidates casually drops the line at a press conference and the media hardly notice. So, apparently that's the new standard in Washington. OK. Well let's start with Kirsten Gillibrand. Gillibrand was a friend of Harvey Weinstein's. Here's a picture of the two of them together. Weinstein has been credibly accused of rape. Did Kirsten Gillibrand know about Weinstein's sexual assaults? Was she an accessory to them? We've asked those questions before on this show but we never got an answer. Why hasn't Gillibrand demanded an FBI investigation into herself to clear that up? Is that the reaction of an innocent person? By her standards, it's not. So bring on the FBI. Let them interview Kirsten Gillibrand under oath, maybe surprise her at her home at dawn with a search warrant. And while they're at it, they should take a very close look at her relationship with Bill Clinton, another accused rapist. No doubt the Senator will beg for an investigation into that too assuming she's innocent. If she hesitates, press charges. This is lunatic. Sober liberals understand that it is. Democrats don't want Brett Kavanaugh on the court because they disagree with him and that's understandable, by the way. They're angry that the Republican Senate refused to vote on Barack Obama's last Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. That's understandable too. But what's happening now is dangerous in a way that has nothing to do with politics. It's a threat to the civil liberties of every American, no matter who you voted for in 2016. Extremism has exploded on the Left and nobody is trying to contain it. Here's one particularly jarring example of that. This is Congressman John Garamendi of California. We know him well. He's one of the few House Democrats willing to come on this show. We don't usually agree with Garamendi but we've always found him to be a decent and reasonable person, always. Here's what he just said about the Kavanaugh allegations."

Are they inherently less fair or less decent because of the way they look? Garamendi is implying exactly that. So, how is that different or better than anything George Wallace ever said? Well it's not, except that suddenly this filth is everywhere, so you hardly even notice it. The last thing this country needs right now is more racial division. Democrats are pushing it anyway. They're using allegations that have literally nothing to do with race at all. But splitting the country into tiny warring groups is useful to them. It helps them maintain their power and so they're happy to do it. Men against women, Black against White, divide and conquer whatever it takes. In the end, it's unlikely that we'll ever know conclusively what happened between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Ford 36 years ago, if anything at all. But it's crystal clear what's happening right now. This is a power grab. It is hurting the country destroying our centuries' old traditions of justice and empowering morons and demagogues. We ought to shut it down right now. And yet, and this is late-breaking news, just seconds before airtime we learned that this may go on and on. Republicans on the Hill tonight are considering delaying the hearing scheduled for Monday. At this point, Brett Kavanaugh will be testifying by himself to some future date. Because of the rules of the Senate, that would push back the vote on Kavanaugh by at least a week, if not more, which is, of course, the whole point, to drag the country through this pointless charade, this circus, which divides us and hurts us and degrades our standards of justice simply for political ends. That's where we are. Ian Samuel is a Professor at Indiana University Law School and he joins us tonight. Professor, I'm glad you're here as a law professor. I - I want to ask you about what Senator Gillibrand said today. She's a lawyer as well, I believe.

She said if you don't ask for an FBI investigation into yourself that is an indication that you are guilty. And let me just suggest the obvious which is that is insane, that is a third world standard, that is an un-American standard, and it's hard for me to believe that an elected U.S. senator would say something like that in public.

And so the idea is if you've had dinner with somebody who has unsavory views or unpopular views, you can be fired. And we've seen people fired recently from - for that very thing. Guilt by association is not the same as guilt.

We have internal documents that show Google employees plotting to use the company's search engine, the very core of its business, which has a monopoly on search in this country, to undermine the Administration's immigration policy without telling you, secretively and dishonestly. That exclusive is next. The news has been overwhelming tonight. A very special break from the madness are two-time all champ - all-time champions face off in the ultimate Final Exam. They are, as you know, Shannon Bream and Katie Pavlich, coming up. Internal Google emails reveal employees discussing manipulating search results after Trump's travel ban; insight from Peter Schweizer, producer of 'The Creepy Line.'"

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Tonight, we have a development in our ongoing exclusive investigation into the behavior of Google. There are new emails first obtained by this show. Now Google, as you know, is the most powerful company in the history of the world. Virtually all human information flows through its software. And for that reason, Google shapes much of how the world understands reality. At the heart of Google's business is its search engine which has a virtual monopoly on search in this country and others. Google search succeeds because it is blindingly efficient but also because it is perceived as honest. When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come to the top. The process is straightforward and democratic. That's what most people think. That's how it's perceived and that's why the world trusts Google. But what if Google was lying to you? What if the results that you got were secretly weighted to get you to vote a certain way, to believe a certain thing? That would affect a lot of people and a lot of votes. In fact, it would be impossible to have a real democracy under circumstances like that. A small number of incredibly rich people would be in charge of everything including your perceptions. Well that is a major concern for all of us because Google is a very political company. We recently showed you email evidence of the Google effort to collude with a Left-wing group in support of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Now tonight, we have internal documents that show that Google employees discussed corrupting the company's search engine to push propaganda on hundreds of millions of unsuspecting users. Here's what happened. Shortly after taking office, President Trump issued his now-famous travel ban. Almost immediately after that, Google employees began plotting ways to undermine the President's Executive Order. On January 29th, a Google Product Marketing Manager named Mackenzie Thomas sent an email to a group of fellow employees. \"There is a large brainstorm going on throughout the marketing org\" she wrote, brainstorming about how to respond to Trump's order. Among Thomas' ideas was \"To actively counter algorithmically biased results for search terms such as Islam, Iran, Mexico, Latino and so forth.\" In other words, Google employees wanted to alter the search results to make them more positive in certain cases for political reasons. Thomas also suggested promoting links for making donations to organizations fighting the travel ban. This, of course, would be completely dishonest and unethical behavior. But Thomas' colleagues at Google seemed to approve of it strongly. Product Manager Rami Banna , for example, replied this way. \"We're absolutely in Mackenzie, anything you need. We'll put together a list of orgs with Meryl and HL team.\" Another employee named Stacey Chen added that group she thought Google should promote included the ACLU, the defect - the Immigration Defense Project, the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee and the National Immigration Law Center. All of those groups were at the time agitating against the President's immigration ban. Even at least one person on the chain seemed to realize how dangerous and out of the ordinary this conversation was. A Google employee called Clement Wolf commented that \"He was very much in favor of Google stepping up\" but was wondering \"How partisan we want to be on this? To the extent of my knowledge, we'd be breaching precedent if we only gave highlights access to organizations that support a certain view.\" We contacted Google about these remarkable emails and the reply to us is here in full. \"These emails were just a brainstorm of ideas, none of which were ever implemented. Google has never manipulated its search results or modified any of its products to promote a particular political ideology - not in the current campaign season, not during the 2016 election, and not in the aftermath of President Trump's Executive Order on immigration. Our processes and policies would not have allowed for any manipulation of search results to promote political ideologies.\" Left unanswered by Google was why anyone would believe that statement for a second. Nor did Google say anything about the employees on that email chain. Presumably, they still work at Google which is remarkable. If you ran a bank and caught your tellers brainstorming about how to rob the vault, would they still work for you? Remember that Google fired an engineer called James Damore last summer almost instantly. The CEO flew back from family vacation to fire him. Why? Because Damore was caught expressing mildly conservatives ideas in a private memo. Here, Google employees are plotting to subvert our entire public conversation secretly. But that's fine with Google. It shouldn't be fine with any of us or with the U.S. Congress. Google executives are scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill next week. The scheduled topic is privacy. But it would be nice if at least one elected representative asked about this because it's much scarier than anything Russia ever attempted. Peter Schweizer wrote \"Clinton Cash.\" He now has a fantastic new documentary called \"The Creepy Line\" about big tech and he joins us tonight. Are you surprised by this?"

Then you're going to step back and say \"No, we were just having a brainstorming session.\" It - it speaks to the culture of the company. And the culture of the company is they are prepared to put their thumb on the scale and shift the debate in favor of the direction that they want to go."

But for about last 20 years, the murder rate has gone down. Now, sadly, it is rising again. But it's not surprising. For years, the Left has been denouncing the cops as bigots, all of them. Just the other day, Senate Candidate Beto O'Rourke in Texas called police \"The new Jim Crow,\" and claim they shoot people just because of the color of their skin. So, think to yourself and be honest. Would you want to be a cop right now? Who would want to be a cop? Why would you want to risk your life to protect the public for very little pay while some moron like Beto O'Rourke who's never even met you, knows nothing about you, calls you a bigot? It's because of the uniform you wear. It wouldn't be worth it for you probably. It's not worth it for a lot of people. For that, among other reasons, American cities are becoming less safe, much less safe, in some cases. Yesterday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions went to Chicago. It's one of the city's hardest hit by this trend. He laid out very clearly why more Americans are getting killed in big cities. Watch."

If you're older than 35 you may remember when America's great cities depopulated essentially, practically destroyed by blight. That was definitely true here in Washington, certainly in New York City. They recovered and real estate boomed and lots of people became happy and didn't die because they became safer. What happens when they get dangerous again as they are?

The reason is right now the Left has very little way to attack me other than take things out of context or just flat-out lie. I'm not going to fit in anybody's blue box or anybody's red box. I'm a conservative who believes very, very strongly in faith and family, God and country, and service before itself. That's why I went off to serve my country in Iraq.

The former Bush Ethics Lawyer became a Democrat in response to the rise of Donald Trump. Now he says he's being threatened by his new party, the Democrats, for asking questions about Keith Ellison. He's the DNC Deputy Chair accused of abuse by an ex-girlfriend. Richard Painter joins us tonight. Richard, I wish we had more time. We've got completely squeezed by all this news. But lay out for us this story. You've asked questions about Ellison. What was the response you got from your party?"

      "utterance": "Well, first, I think they're trying to run the clock to the election instead of having an investigation. It's been weeks. I also complained back in May about the DFL's failure to investigate harassment of a gay - gay man in the 8th Congressional District. He wrote a very detailed email describing very explicit harassment in 2016 that was just swept under the rug. And I finally wrote the DFL Chair Ken Martin, and that man went public with that. And he - of course, Ken Martin's been furious with me. And I complained about that not being investigated. And then Ken Martin started sending me emails saying he's got to, you know, starting to consider legal action if I keep complaining about this. Well, you know, my answer to this is that both political parties need to focus on cleaning up their own act before they start attacking the other party. There's a lot of covering up going on and sexual harassment, abuse, and all of these problems are being covered up by the Democrats as well as the Republicans. And, you know, I find that very, very disappointing what happened here."

We'll be back tomorrow 8 p.m., the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink, all of which are everywhere and hurting our country. Good night from Washington.
