There are supporters in Pennsylvania outside his home. And, as you can hear, there are protesters as well. Bill Cosby will give his very latest thoughts on all of that. He was informed of this decision about three hours ago and was told, Mr. Cosby, you're a free man. Alex Hogan with the latest developments, following this story very, very closely and what happened.

Well, what we know so far, as we take a look at this story, the 83-year-old has left prison, released around 2:30 today, after nearly three years behind bars. Pennsylvania's highest court overturning his sexual assault conviction, arguing that the prosecutor violated the agreement of a previous prosecutor in the case to not charge the actor. This all comes after today's release of this 79-page court opinion, part of it calling the arrest \"an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution that was forgone for more than a decade.\" While supporters are celebrating the news -- we could hear them earlier, many of them clapping outside of his home, including the actor's former co- star. She was tweeting about it, as well as his spokesperson there, seen in this video making a statement today.",

It's a punch in the gut to these victims.\" While some of these women did provide testimony, their cases would not hold up in court because of the statute of limitations. And I spoke to several of them outside of the courthouse back in 2018, who say it was very painful sharing their story, but it was worth it to see justice. Now, the court case itself, of course, focuses around Andrea Constand. She's a Temple University employee. And her lawyers are telling us that they are going over these 79 pages of opinion before they make a statement.

They said that, like, technically, all the I's didn't get dotted in terms of perfecting that agreement in front of the court. But once somebody detrimentally relies on that kind of a promise and gives up information, and essentially becomes a witness against himself, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, that's really the end of the story.

Detectives are working around the clock to confirm the status of every single name that's attached to these condos. It's a slow and methodical process. There are still search-and-rescue crews right now. Officials say they have gone through three million pounds of concrete so far at the collapse site, but no one has been found alive since a few hours after the collapse last Thursday.

The sons were running that, essentially, while the president was in office, although the president still kept his name on the door, obviously. Let's get a little breadth here, I mean, just get a little sense of the breadth of this investigation and what it's turned up. They -- there was 100 subpoenas, from what I understand, issued as part of this thing. That's not just the Trump Organization, but to affiliated parties, banks, you name it. Three million pages of documents five years. Vance's office, Cy Vance, the district attorney of Manhattan, was trying to build a case that -- along the lines with Michael Cohen, the former Trump fixer, said before Congress. He said that Trump would inflate his assets to get better insurance company -- coverage, deflate its assets, to get -- to pay less taxes, he did it on purpose. And Mr. Cohen said it was fraud, and they have all the information, and Allen Weisselberg knows all about it. Allen Weisselberg came back after a lot of pressure from the Justice Department, from the Manhattan DA's office and said, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no fraud here. I'm not cooperating on any of this stuff. And that's where we are. And so the case that came out of this -- and, by the way, at FOX Business, we were first to report that Cy Vance essentially -- not essentially -- he set up a task force of dozens of forensic accountants and lawyers that are experts in tax law to develop a really serious tax fraud case, along the lines of what Michael Cohen said. One of the ways they want to do that is to get Weisselberg to flip. One of the ways to try to get Weisselberg to flip is not on the most serious thing in the world. I mean, this perk thing -- and I know people are going to say you should pay taxes on clothes or whatever, an apartment he has. And why should he get a free apartment and the average guy not?

In a civil case, where really the only thing at stake is money, they only have to prove it by what's known as a preponderance of the evidence, meaning it's more likely than not that it occurred. So it's a very low burden. It's the same thing that happened in O.J. He won the criminal case, but he lost the civil. But, in this case, Mr. Cosby settled his civil case.",

Pennsylvania's highest court overturning his sexual assault conviction, arguing that the prosecutor violated the agreement of a previous prosecutor in the case to not charge the actor. This all comes after today's release of this 79-page court opinion, part of it calling the arrest \"an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution that was forgone for more than a decade.\" While supporters are celebrating the news -- we could hear them earlier, many of them clapping outside of his home, including the actor's former co- star.

Now, the court case itself, of course, focuses around Andrea Constand. She's a Temple University employee.

And, instead, the new district attorney who came in and for political aims went forward with the prosecution, the problem was that they had gotten a statement from Cosby under the idea that he -- it would never be used against him. And the court of appeals correctly said that just should not have occurred."

They said that, like, technically, all the I's didn't get dotted in terms of perfecting that agreement in front of the court. But once somebody detrimentally relies on that kind of a promise and gives up information, and essentially becomes a witness against himself, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, that's really the end of the story. There were other aspects of this that disturbed the court of appeals as well and the Supreme Court. But that's the main one, Neil. And it really puts a harpoon in this case."

Unfortunately, Cosby's lawyers were complaining about this from the beginning, indicating that the statements that they were using against him were gotten unfairly, which is exactly what the Supreme Court decided was indeed the case. The lawyers also complained that the additional evidence from unrelated cases that was allowed in front of this jury should not have come in. But the Supreme Court didn't even have to get to that question because of the complete damage caused by the essential -- the lie and the reliance upon that lie by the original district attorney."

And this sort of like epitomized in and the MeToo movement, whatever, that he would be sort of the poster child for this abuse on the part of celebrities and those in power. So he's a free man now.

I don't know that that's anything but cold comfort to the 60 women who are involved here. And I guess the one thing that you can say about this, Neil, is that, at least in our present moment, you're much less likely to have women who don't feel confident that they can report this kind of behavior because no one will hear them. So, hopefully, you won't have the Bill Cosby cases that can't be brought because all the allegations are too stale in the future."

But the irony here is that it's for things like, well, not paying taxes on benefits and perks, such as a corporate-provided apartment, other benefits that normally and in the past would not elicit this kind of reaction or certainly this kind of punishment, which has Charlie Gasparino wondering as well. We do know, Charlie, that Allen Weisselberg, the CFO in question, has not been cooperative with the authorities here, who probably wanted him to serve up Donald Trump or any information like that. And, even here, he seems to figure that whatever charges are going to be filed against him, he can beat. But update us."

They want them to serve up Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. As you know, they are the principals who run the Trump Organization, the real estate, golf course, country club empire that the former president has. The sons were running that, essentially, while the president was in office, although the president still kept his name on the door, obviously. Let's get a little breadth here, I mean, just get a little sense of the breadth of this investigation and what it's turned up. They -- there was 100 subpoenas, from what I understand, issued as part of this thing. That's not just the Trump Organization, but to affiliated parties, banks, you name it. Three million pages of documents five years. Vance's office, Cy Vance, the district attorney of Manhattan, was trying to build a case that -- along the lines with Michael Cohen, the former Trump fixer, said before Congress. He said that Trump would inflate his assets to get better insurance company -- coverage, deflate its assets, to get -- to pay less taxes, he did it on purpose. And Mr. Cohen said it was fraud, and they have all the information, and Allen Weisselberg knows all about it. Allen Weisselberg came back after a lot of pressure from the Justice Department, from the Manhattan DA's office and said, I don't know what you're talking about. There's no fraud here. I'm not cooperating on any of this stuff. And that's where we are. And so the case that came out of this -- and, by the way, at FOX Business, we were first to report that Cy Vance essentially -- not essentially -- he set up a task force of dozens of forensic accountants and lawyers that are experts in tax law to develop a really serious tax fraud case, along the lines of what Michael Cohen said. One of the ways they want to do that is to get Weisselberg to flip. One of the ways to try to get Weisselberg to flip is not on the most serious thing in the world. I mean, this perk thing -- and I know people are going to say you should pay taxes on clothes or whatever, an apartment he has. And why should he get a free apartment and the average guy not? I get that. But let's be real clear here. These cases are few and far between. I can't find any in a major setting."

That's where, before the tour at the wall, the president and governor held a roundtable with those members of Congress and a lot of sheriffs and local leaders. And I will tell you, President Trump did not hold back on his admonition for the previous administration as it relates to the crisis at the border.

Governor Abbott saying to the media that fentanyl is up, the seizures and overdoses up some 2000 percent compared to this time last year. Here locally, in the Rio Grande Valley sector, it's ground zero for the surge in migrants. And that's why you saw the governor and former president in this location. We have learned, Neil, in the last 24 hours, there were 2,429 apprehensions, which is a 544 percent increase from this time last year. What is new, what was announced, you ask, about what the governor plans to do, not a whole lot, except he did say, standing in front of a section where the Trump wall had stopped being built, that it's time to seal up the border. We will have to find out exactly what he plans to do to build Texas' own wall. One thing's for sure, though. The folks here, particularly those Republican members of Congress, many from Texas like August Pfluger, Ronny Johnson (sic), they definitely want something done, because this state is definitely feeling the brunt of the humanitarian crisis -- Neil."

Brandon Judd is the Border Patrol Union president, joins us again. Brandon, on the wall issue, that might prove a lot easier said than done. How would it be coordinated, if the governor gets his way and starts building this, because so much of the land he's talking about is technically federal land?

It's proven in the past in many different locations, like San Diego, California; El Paso, Texas; even in Arizona. The wall has been extremely effective in deterring illegal immigration and the flow of drugs that comes across into our country.

They radio in any traffic that they see. And then we're able to direct our agents to those locations where the illegal activity is taking place. And it's extremely effective. It allows us to put more of our manpower in the field. So we always welcome as many National Guardsmen as we can possibly get."

      "speaker": "BELKIN",
      "utterance": "The reality is, there's a different burden of proof in a civil suit and a criminal suit. And I think people don't always get that. In a criminal case, where your liberty and sometimes your very life is at stake, the state has a very high burden of proof. They have to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. In a civil case, where really the only thing at stake is money, they only have to prove it by what's known as a preponderance of the evidence, meaning it's more likely than not that it occurred. So it's a very low burden. It's the same thing that happened in O.J. He won the criminal case, but he lost the civil. But, in this case, Mr. Cosby settled his civil case."

      "utterance": "All right. Now, he's an 83-year-old man .He's at home right now. I don't know how much of his wealth from a decades-long career remains. But this isn't as much a legal, as just your own thought question here, guys. And, Nicole, to you on what Bill Cosby does right now. Does he get his life back together? How does he resume whatever normal is now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEBORDE",
      "utterance": "I think he does his best to spend time with family and to try to recoup some of the time that he lost being in custody and make up for that with the family members he's been away from. So I think that he will likely stay to himself and just try to get back to what normal life he can."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Ken, I also wonder how this will change going forward when such cases do come up. Now, of course, I believe, when all of this was going on, it was near the height of the MeToo movement. So there was a great rush and attention to all of this sort of stuff. But, obviously, there were stumbles here on the part of the prosecution in handling that. And I'm wondering what lessons we can learn from this in future such cases, because I have reason to believe there will be more cases down the road, just handled very differently."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BELKIN",
      "utterance": "I mean, I can think of one case that's coming down the road quite quickly, which is Harvey Weinstein's appeal over his New York invasion. The reality is -- and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court made note of this in their decision -- there is a trend in the judiciary to allow character witnesses to come in, meaning people that testify about the character of a defendant. Really, that testimony, for as long as I have been practicing law and was taught law, was considered irrelevant. It's not probative of what actually happened on the night in question. It doesn't make it more or less likely that Mr. Cosby did this that a few other people came in and said some bad things about him. And we need to get away from that as a trend. It makes our judicial system less fair."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, guys, I want to thank you both very, very much. Again, for those waiting to hear from Bill Cosby, he didn't really speak, but lawyers and colleagues did in his defense and in complete support. He's going to spend some time with his family and enjoy life. We will have more after this."

We know 16 dead at the time being, 147 still unaccounted for. Enter this next fellow. Philip Zyne lives in the Champlain Towers North. It's a sister building. There's another one east about. But this particular building, a lot of -- there's some controversy about it, whether those who live there should have evacuate. It's left up to their own discretion. But, Philip, very good to have you. You have noticed problems in your own building. So, tell me what you have noticed."

      "speaker": "ZYNE",
      "utterance": "Actually, I think our building is very well-maintained. I have really never noticed any significant problems with the building. However, just like everything else, once a building collapses near you a block away, you start noticing little tiny things. And, really, I haven't noticed anything major, but every now and then, you will see a crack here, a little bit of water leakage here. So now that we know what happened to the other building, we're paying much more attention to this. And if we see anything like that, we're certainly reporting it to the board and to the management right away."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZYNE",
      "utterance": "I really do. It's a concern, obviously. The first time, when we heard this building fell, we know it's a similar building. It was built like a year or two before ours. It's the same engineer, same architect, same developers. The design of the building is somewhat similar. So, naturally, we were concerned. But we wanted to make sure that we had a thorough evaluation of our structure and our building. And, again, I have always felt safe here. I never saw any major issues in the building. I did hear -- we have heard that the building in the south tower that failed was not well-maintained."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZYNE",
      "utterance": "There were a lot of issues over there that apparently we have never had over here. And so I never really was too worried about it. I thought the odds of that happening right away at the same time as the other was practically infinitesimal. But you always concern yourself. So that's why we think we need a thorough, complete examination of this building and all the others on the coast to make sure that the same problems that were in the south tower don't exist elsewhere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, how many other residents who normally stay there are indeed still staying there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZYNE",
      "utterance": "I don't have the exact number. We have 111 or 113 units in this building. I heard from various people that about 25 percent of the building had evacuated shortly after the collapse of the other building. There was some mixed signals from the city, saying whether they felt the building was safe, whether we should stay, whether we should evacuate. So I think, initially, a lot of people were a little concerned. And they left. We have heard that some have come back to the building. So, I'd say, overall, right now, maybe 20 to 25 percent of the building has evacuated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, we don't have a whole lot of time. You have been very helpful, Philip. One of the things I heard, that is a condo board in the case of the south tower, that the president that board had warned residents, look, we have got some major fixes here, going to cost about $15 million. It'd be $100,000 per unit assessment. Did that affect other towers? Or was that just a south tower issue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZYNE",
      "utterance": "That was just the south tower. We are completely different association. We have different management over here."

      "utterance": "I see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZYNE",
      "utterance": "We have also been going through the 40-year certification process, and we did have an assessment over the last couple of years of about $10,000 to $15,000, which has been used to repair different things in the building. But everything looks like it's going well. So we're happy so far."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "How are you personally holding up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZYNE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's very difficult. My wife especially has three or four people in the building there that she was close to that are still unaccounted for. We have another six or eight acquaintances we knew. We don't know them close, but we knew of them. And they're unaccounted for."
