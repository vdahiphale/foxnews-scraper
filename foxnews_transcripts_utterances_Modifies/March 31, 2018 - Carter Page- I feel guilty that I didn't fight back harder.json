They will on this show.  When the Donald speaks or takes action, the media immediately criticizes him but they necessity give him credit when his words or actions create a positive result.  Take a look at what happened on trade. President Trump started slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and the media went nuts.",

Thanks to corporate tax cut, and that's a McFlurry of good news.  So, when you hear the press criticize Trump's unconventional style, pause a minute and let the results speak for themselves.

You have had these bad cops, I call them, these rogue top officials at the top of the FBI who have besmirched this agency. And we need to help that agency get its reputation back. We need to fix this, so it doesn't happen again. So, we need a commission that can do that. On the other hand, an Inspector General does a report. Let's say he comes up and he condemns these people. For what then? You know, most of them are already gone. Are they going to make a referral to the public integrity section of the Criminal Division?

Mueller keeps asking for his investigation to be expanded and expanded and expanded and Rosenstein keeps expanding it. But here is the problem, Jeff Sessions recused himself as to matters involving the campaign. That's it. He is the Attorney General of the United States, Rosenstein does not have the power outside of the recusal that Sessions gave to expand Mueller's investigation. He is not the Attorney General when it comes to tax issues or whether or not somebody filed as a foreign agent under the Foreign Acts Act. And all of these other matters that Mueller is bringing up, he doesn't have the constitutional authority to do it because Rosenstein doesn't have the constitutional authority to be Attorney General for all these other matters.",

If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does it make a sound? The same question can be asked about President Trump's success. If the media doesn't report it, will anybody hear about it? They will on this show. When the Donald speaks or takes action, the media immediately criticizes him but they necessity give him credit when his words or actions create a positive result. Take a look at what happened on trade. President Trump started slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and the media went nuts."

That was a Hillary Clinton special, I hate to say it. This will produce 200,000 jobs. She was right, but it was for them, it wasn't not for us. So, we've redone it."

Great news for the American workers in Michigan and South Korea would have to limit its steel exports in America by 30%. This in exchange for Trump temporarily dropping the threat of steel tariffs. The Washington Post reported, \"It marks the first successful renegotiation of a trade deal for the Trump administration.\" By the way, that line was buried near the bottom of the story, not even worthy of a headline. Turning to China, after the fire and fury threats against North Korea and 60 billion in tariff slapped on Chinese exports, little rocket man traveled to Beijing for constructive talks with his puppet master. America and North Korea are now hopefully on the cusp of historic talks that could lead to peace on the peninsula."

Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level since 1973. That's almost half a century ago, and the unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since 2000. Remember when the media said the Trump tax cut wouldn't help the little guy? McDonald's just announced it would spend $150 million on college tuition for thousands of its fast food employees. Thanks to corporate tax cut, and that's a McFlurry of good news. So, when you hear the press criticize Trump's unconventional style, pause a minute and let the results speak for themselves.

The man questioning this from the beginning, the host of our new program, \"Life, Liberty & Levin,\" Mark Levin joins me now. Okay, so Mark, do you think this is the swamp running out the clock or are we moving in the right direction with this investigation? MARK LEVIN, HOST, \"LIFE, LIBERTY & LEVIN\": Look, I would prefer a special counsel. I would also prefer quite frankly, a commission. I have talked about this, Dershowitz and others have talked about this. So, you have a criminal investigation going on to determine that side of the ledger. And then on the other side, we really need to fix this. I mean, we can't have elections where you have the director of the FBI, the deputy director of the FBI leaking all over the place. We have the head of counterintelligence Strzok and his girlfriend, Page involved in these sorts of shenanigans. This is a big problem, and the abuse of the FISA court. I have never heard of anything like this before. And I speak as somebody who has served in the Justice Department, worked with the FBI. The problem right now is the FBI does all kinds of things to protect the people in this country - domestic and foreign. You have had these bad cops, I call them, these rogue top officials at the top of the FBI who have besmirched this agency. And we need to help that agency get its reputation back. We need to fix this, so it doesn't happen again. So, we need a commission that can do that. On the other hand, an Inspector General does a report. Let's say he comes up and he condemns these people. For what then? You know, most of them are already gone. Are they going to make a referral to the public integrity section of the Criminal Division? We have a special counsel now roaming all over the country looking for excuses for why he exists. And here, I can't think of a better situation where you would have a special counsel focused on investigating the top levels of the FBI, the top levels of the Department of Justice, the top levels of the intelligence agencies and any all relationships with the White House."

      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Not only should the Attorney General who is an old friend of mine, not only should Jeff Sessions quickly appoint a special counsel and even though the Inspector General is doing his thing, but on top of the Inspector General. But the existing special counsel, you know Paul Manafort's lawyers have filed very important papers in court raising the constitutionality of what's taking place with the Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and special counsel Mueller. Mueller keeps asking for his investigation to be expanded and expanded and expanded and Rosenstein keeps expanding it. But here is the problem, Jeff Sessions recused himself as to matters involving the campaign. That's it. He is the Attorney General of the United States, Rosenstein does not have the power outside of the recusal that Sessions gave to expand Mueller's investigation. He is not the Attorney General when it comes to tax issues or whether or not somebody filed as a foreign agent under the Foreign Acts Act. And all of these other matters that Mueller is bringing up, he doesn't have the constitutional authority to do it because Rosenstein doesn't have the constitutional authority to be Attorney General for all these other matters."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

There is a great piece out here now that shows that the Obama White House's fingerprints were all over this surveillance of the Trump campaign from the very beginning. We had Harry Reid talking to Obama's CIA director, Brennan, and in my estimation, kind of legitimizing the entire investigation backwards. And tell me what you found out about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "Well, what I saw kind of underscores what I have been thinking too. How is it possible when you have a FISA court applications - extensions of the FISA applications, the Director of the FBI involved, the Attorney General of the United States involved. , the intelligence agencies involved, you have the national security adviser unmasking individuals. You have the Ambassador to the UN unmasking individuals, how in the hell is it possible if the only person on the face of the earth that doesn't know about this is Barack Obama? On top of this, this stuff was in the newspaper. The leaks were in the newspaper that the FISA court and all of the other activity. You are telling me the president of the United States is sitting there saying, \"Hey,\" all this stuff is swirling around him, swirling around his different departments and he's not briefed on it? I don't believe that for two seconds."

So, he never had any culpability when there was a problem. If you have evidence that Harry Reid is involved in trying to move forward an investigation of the Trump campaign and you have the Obama CIA director coordinating with the senator from Nevada, and then we see leaks coming out about the investigation, and when that hits the press, those press reports were then used in the FISA application. It looks to me like this entire investigation was cooked up from the beginning in order to justify the surveillance. Is that what you believe?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "I believe it was cooked up with that dossier, with the Clinton campaign and the DNC, and I believe Reid was approached by Brennan to put pressure to push the investigation. I believe all of this stuff was going on under the radar. And that is why you need a commission. That is why you need a special counsel. I mean, we'll stick with the Inspector General for now, but it's really the job of somebody outside the agencies, outside the department. I don't get my kicks out of the special counsels, but there are times when that's absolutely necessary and the same with the Commission, real top former public officials who can sit down and figure out what the hell took place here and how to fix it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, because this Inspector General can't compel certain people from the State Department to come and testify and he can't issue any sort of subpoenas that can force people to do what he wants to do what he wants to do. That would be under the umbrella of a special counsel, so it's a good step in the right direction, but in a way, it's almost toothless. You have a show on Saturday night that is kicking butt in the ratings called."

He was counsel to Reagan when he was governor and we're going to talk about issues like this -- the FISA court, what took place, that's my hope and to get into this, what do you think is taking place with the FBI and the government generally.

When you are trying to apply for government assistance, when you are going to college, when you are getting a student loan, they ask specific questions like this. And it is in our Constitution that the census be done every 10 years. So, if you are a resident, you are supposed to fill out your form. And then, I don't understand why these states are trying to aid and abate some of these illegal aliens? Because they don't want us to know who is exactly in our country. This is what I think should happen. If you do not fill out that census form as a resident, you should get fined or let the law take its course."

Listen, I was eating some jelly beans just the other day and it only had five black jelly beans in there. Was I supposed to feel like that was racist and call the Jelly Bean Company to say, \"Listen, you didn't add enough jelly beans in this bag.\" Or when I drink my milk, I drink a lot of white milk because I eat a lot of cereal. I don't put chocolate milk at my cereal. So, does that mean that I am racist? So, I wish people would get off this whole thing about being racist, everything has to be racist. Everything is not racist and what you can do, you can tell Heineken to make a dark beer and then cast Diamond and Silk in the commercial. We will do it for them."

She can't do anymore. Uh-uh. When you pay for places. She can't do that anymore. And people keep asking us why are you all so hard on Hillary? I have to be hard on her because listen, she called us deplorable. She made us look like we were racist and now she is saying that, \"Oh, it's because of a man that you voted, it's about the man.\" That's why I have to come down hard on her."
