Three others are injured, one quite seriously. The shooter, we are told, is in grave condition.  As Bret said, we're also expecting a news conference by hospital officials on the conditions of those other victims. When that happens, of course, we will bring it to you live.  Welcome, everybody, busy news day. I'm Neil Cavuto.  FOX News correspondent Christina Coleman first near Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, with the very, very latest.

From what we know right now, at least six students, six students were found in the quad area of the school injured this morning shortly after 7:30, when the shooting was reported.  A 16-year-old female student and a 14-year-old male student have both died, according to authorities. Deputies say today was the suspect's 16th birthday and he is in grave condition.   An L.A. County sheriff's deputy says detectives reviewed video, and it clearly shows the suspect withdrew a handgun from his backpack and injured five people, and then shot himself in the head. Again, he is listed in grave condition. The suspect's mother and girlfriend are being questioned by authorities. Students are also being interviewed by law enforcement, possible witnesses there. Deputies say the suspect's weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, was found at the scene here at Saugus High School. The FBI and ATF are also investigating. An L.A. County deputies says there rumors the suspects may have posted -- the suspect may have posted threats on social media. So they're looking into that, doing a social media scrub of where he might have been online.   And L.A. County has sent staff to Saugus High School around this area to provide mental health resources to people here. Some of the students were crying as they were escorted out of the building this morning after the shooting that has rocked this very tight-knit community.",

We have been able to liberate vast territories, millions of people living under the control of ISIS, a brutal terrorist organization. And this has been possible not least because of the use of infrastructure, bases in Turkey. So -- and Turkey also plays an important role, for instance, in Afghanistan. They are one of the lead nations there, with a significant presence in Afghanistan in a military operation which is a direct result of an attack on the United States 9/11, showing that NATO allies are standing together with United States also in Afghanistan. So, again, it's not easy. It is a serious issue.

A 16-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy died in the shooting, and the shooter is in grave condition. Our FOX affiliate KTTV says the shooter is on the track team, that he runs the 800 and 1,600, and that he was always very quiet and somewhat antisocial. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that people in the shooter's neighborhood say he was a Boy Scout, comes from a great family and that his dad, who recently died of a heart attack was an avid hunter and had a large collection of guns. It's unclear where the handgun used in the shooting came from. Investigators say they are now in the process of scouring the shooter -- the shooter's social media footprint to see who he was texting, and that -- what posting there is to see who else may have been involved in this -- Neil.",

From what we know right now, at least six students, six students were found in the quad area of the school injured this morning shortly after 7:30, when the shooting was reported. A 16-year-old female student and a 14-year-old male student have both died, according to authorities. Deputies say today was the suspect's 16th birthday and he is in grave condition. An L.A. County sheriff's deputy says detectives reviewed video, and it clearly shows the suspect withdrew a handgun from his backpack and injured five people, and then shot himself in the head. Again, he is listed in grave condition. The suspect's mother and girlfriend are being questioned by authorities. Students are also being interviewed by law enforcement, possible witnesses there. Deputies say the suspect's weapon, a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun, was found at the scene here at Saugus High School. The FBI and ATF are also investigating. An L.A. County deputies says there rumors the suspects may have posted -- the suspect may have posted threats on social media. So they're looking into that, doing a social media scrub of where he might have been online. And L.A. County has sent staff to Saugus High School around this area to provide mental health resources to people here. Some of the students were crying as they were escorted out of the building this morning after the shooting that has rocked this very tight-knit community."

He may stop at the cameras to talk for just a little bit, but with the tragedy there in Santa Clarita, he may not want to talk about anything else other than that. Just a few minutes ago, the vice president, who is at the NASA Ames Research facility in Mountain View, California, offered his condolences and on behalf of the president to the victims and the families of the dead.

The current polls show that Rispone is running about two points behind Edwards, again, the run-off election Saturday. The president would like to take back Louisiana for the Republican Party.

      "utterance": "Well, I think it is important that we stand together in NATO, despite differences. It's obvious that, when we are 29 allies from both sides of the Atlantic, we don't agree on all issues. There actually are some serious differences between allies on issues like trade, on climate change, and other issues. But the strength of NATO is that, despite these differences, we have always been able to unite around our core task to defend and protect each other, based on NATO's main idea, one for all and all for one. And that's making Europe safer, but also the United States. It's a great advantage for the United States to have so many friends and allies, as they have in NATO."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I only say that because of his interest in purchasing Russian arms and S-400s, and now wanting to add to that with F-35s from the United States. A number of senators, including five who met with the president yesterday and President Erdogan in the same room, expressed alarm at that. Do you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOLTENBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, I have discussed this issue many times with President Erdogan. I also discussed it today with President Trump. And I have also expressed my concerns about the consequences of the Turkish decision to acquire Russian air defense system the S-400. But I also welcome the fact that the United States and Turkey are talking together to try to find a way to solve this issue. And we know that there are alternatives. We have the U.S. Patriot systems. I know that France and Italy, they have something called SAMP/T Air Defense System. And they're also discussing with them. So, we are looking into ways to solve this issue, because this is a serious disagreement, which causes concern in several NATO capitals and, of course, also in Washington. So it's an example that we don't always agree in this alliance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "We got into some of the specifics, senator -- about buying from the Russians, buying from the United States, that that really doesn't seem to indicate much NATO loyalty. Can you trust President Erdogan, especially if he seems to be playing both sides of the field?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOLTENBERG",
      "utterance": "As I said, I have expressed my concerns, and I have done so also in Ankara. At the same time, we have to realize or recognize that Turkey is an important NATO ally. You can just look at the map. Turkey is bordering Iraq and Syria. Turkey has been extremely important in the fight against ISIS. We have been able to liberate vast territories, millions of people living under the control of ISIS, a brutal terrorist organization. And this has been possible not least because of the use of infrastructure, bases in Turkey. So -- and Turkey also plays an important role, for instance, in Afghanistan. They are one of the lead nations there, with a significant presence in Afghanistan in a military operation which is a direct result of an attack on the United States 9/11, showing that NATO allies are standing together with United States also in Afghanistan. So, again, it's not easy. It is a serious issue. But we need to try to find a way to understand that, despite the disagreement on S-400 Russian air defense system, Turkey remains an important ally, and we have to try to keep Turkey in, because that's important for the whole NATO alliance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "General, I don't want you to divulge your conversations with the president of the United States, nor should you, in this venue. But I'm wondering if the president agreed that Erdogan's behavior does at least bear watching, that, sometimes, he can't even be trusted?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOLTENBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, Turkey is a NATO member. And we work together in many different military operations, as I said, in Afghanistan, but also, for instance, in the fight against ISIS. And we have made enormous progress in the fight against ISIS. Turkey is also important in dealing with the migrant and refugee crisis in Europe. We have a NATO naval presence in the GNC, where we have Turkish ships, E.U. -- or European -- ships from E.U. countries. Germany is leading that. And it helps to implement the agreement between Turkey and the European Union controlling the -- or stopping the illegal migration across the Aegean Sea from Turkey into Europe. So the fact is that we are working together with Turkey in many fields, in many areas, knowing that, on the issue of S-400, there is a serious disagreement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Are you convinced that he is done doing what he's doing in Northern Syria, or there is the fear that he will simply return? He plays it pretty shrewdly. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STOLTENBERG",
      "utterance": "The situation in Northern Syria is fragile and unpredictable. I welcome the fact that at least you have seen reduction in violence and that we also have seen clearly that there is strong support to the efforts of the global coalition, the U.S.-led global coalition, to uphold the gains we have made in the fight against ISIS. When -- that fight is not over. ISIS is still both in Syria and Iraq. And, also, that all NATO allies agree that we need to support the E.U. and efforts to find a political solution. The only long-term solution in Syria is a political agreement. And that's the reason why we support that so much."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. ANDY BIGGS, R-ARIZ.",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that she's trying to defend the dud of a hearing that happened yesterday. I mean, I think we had a bit of a breach of promise yesterday. We were promised all kinds of fireworks and a great case. And whatever it is they think that they have got is so obtuse, that they can't actually describe it. In fact, their witnesses themselves couldn't describe what they thought might be impeachable conduct. So I think this is a bit of kind of playing defense right now on the part of the speaker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Congressman, I'm wondering how you feel about, would the president have been interested in corruption in Ukraine if it weren't for the name Joe Biden? Would he have been just as eager to get to it if it were Joe Smith?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think so. I mean, we're going to find out, and I believe that we know already, that he was asking about corruption, he was asking about what other countries in the region, like France, like Germany, were doing to help fund Ukraine's -- the Ukrainians, to see if we might get an alleviation of corruption. In fact, if you get -- take anything out of Taylor and Kent's remarks yesterday is that they were trying to convince the president that Zelensky was the real deal in trying to fight corruption. So he definitely had a concern about corruption, which has been a longstanding U.S. policy going back to the NDAA Act of 2011, 2014, again in 2019."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So I guess it depends on what you hear and how you hear it. When William Taylor, the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, were questioned on this talked about directly or indirectly hearing of multiple calls on the part of the president to check up and follow on the status of that investigation, he was talking about the one of Biden. So that was what the take was there. Does that disturb you? Or does that say, wherever it leads, that's where you go, even though that could be a prospective opponent of the president's in the next election, and he's involving a sovereign government in the middle of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, there's two or three things there, Neil. First of all, Taylor and Kent have no direct knowledge of anything, as was pointed out. And, thankfully, they both admitted that the only thing they can tell us is what they have heard from other people who have heard it from other people, and that maybe mistakes were made. But what I took away..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, do you have information, Congressman, just to be clear, that there were not multiple calls or inquiries on the part of the president into this matter, whether it involved those men or others?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, what they testified to is that I think there were a couple of calls. But they don't know what happened on those calls. And they actually don't know who -- who made those calls. But one thing that they -- we do know is that there was an effort to stop corruption in the Ukraine, which both of them admitted is pervasive, longstanding, and it is the actual system of government there. And that's why we have a concern about corruption, especially since we're giving literally hundreds of millions of dollars every year to the Ukrainians."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, there's a significant number of people in the House pushing for impeachment. But don't be surprised -- I mean, seriously, when I say this, Neil, I really believe this, that after watching the hearing yesterday, if you are in a contested district, and you're a Democrat, first or second term, that President Trump won in 2016, you might be saying to yourself, I will not be here much longer if I vote for impeachment, based on what I heard out of Taylor and Kent. We will see where it goes, of course."

And, by the way, the hearings are not over, not by a long shot, but this former attorney general says impeachment is. Why does Matthew Whitaker say that? After this."
    },

And, tomorrow, they resume, as I mentioned before, with a cast of characters who's going to paint a picture, including from Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, of a president who was hell- bent on getting some dirt on his likely opponent in the next election. Much has been made as well about revealing the whistle-blower who started all of these revelations here and whether that person should be outed and exposed to the world. The former acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker stepping way back on this and saying, there simply is no there there, and this impeachment, even in the House, is going nowhere. He joins us right now, the former acting general."

We're dealing -- the reason that hearsay evidence is not admissible in federal court or state court is because it's not reliable. And these witnesses heard from somebody who heard from somebody who overheard a phone call that may have been somebody. It was -- it was -- it was -- I really -- I was concerned that this is the evidence that they're going to attempt to impeach the president. And I really think that, when the House of Representatives -- as Congressman Biggs was pointing out, once the House of Representatives actually takes this up, they're going to realize that not only do the American people see through this attempt, but that they have wasted a lot of time and taxpayer money on something that ultimately is not going to be successful."

And that surveillance video shows him walking into the quad at Saugus High School, pulling a .45-caliber handgun out of his backpack and opening fire, shooting five students, before turning the gun on himself. A 16-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy died in the shooting, and the shooter is in grave condition. Our FOX affiliate KTTV says the shooter is on the track team, that he runs the 800 and 1,600, and that he was always very quiet and somewhat antisocial. The Los Angeles Times is reporting that people in the shooter's neighborhood say he was a Boy Scout, comes from a great family and that his dad, who recently died of a heart attack was an avid hunter and had a large collection of guns. It's unclear where the handgun used in the shooting came from. Investigators say they are now in the process of scouring the shooter -- the shooter's social media footprint to see who he was texting, and that -- what posting there is to see who else may have been involved in this -- Neil."

And, remember, a lot of Republicans have said that her story doesn't add up, that she had a political agenda to grind against the president of the United States. That will no doubt be front and center tomorrow in the hearings. Also, very quickly, very quickly a lot of you are asking me about Steve Ballmer's USAFacts. It's a way to keep track of the money that Washington spends, the money in and money out. It is a site. It is an independent site that just follows the math. And it adds up to a lot of red.
