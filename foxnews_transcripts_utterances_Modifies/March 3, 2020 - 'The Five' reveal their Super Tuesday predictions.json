The future of the Democratic Party could very well be at stake tonight. The first Super Tuesday polls said to close two hours from now, the big story, the major showdown between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.  Millions of voters across 14 states are said to choose between Sanders' brand of socialism and Joe Biden's more moderate approach. But as we have seen, we could be in for some surprises, Michael Bloomberg on the ballot for the first time, and Elizabeth Warren still in the race. The fight for more than 1,300 delegates up for grabs taking a dramatic turn with Joe Biden picking up the endorsement of his former 2020 rivals. Will it make a difference?",

I think Biden did get a good bounce of South Carolina. I just can't figure out whether it is actually Joe-mentum balance or it's a never-Bernie balance.  Because right now, it looks a little manufactured when you see the slew of endorsements come in perfectly timed close to South Carolina, especially after you get the deep state endorsement where you get Susan Rice Brennan and James Comey endorsed Biden in 24 hours. Wow, that tells you pretty much everything you need to know.  Biden has been racking up all these endorsements, but he's also been racking up an alarming amount of gas, which tells me this. The man is obviously deteriorating, and the Democrats are taking full advantage of it. If Biden becomes president, is he really going to be the president? Is he going to be a figurehead and people behind the scenes pulling strings? That's what it looks like to me, because the Biden presidency is a restoration. Everybody gets their job back at the NSC, at the State Department, at the White House. They can control all the money and they can control all the power. They don't want a revolution with Bernie Sanders. They just want their power back. They want full control.  Bernie does not give them control because Bernie cannot be controlled. And that's why he is such a big threat. Right now, it looks like this was timed perfectly. And the difference between 2016 and now is Trump was unstoppable. Bernie Sanders is stoppable, because of the fact that he doesn't have as big of a movement, and because of the rules in the Democratic process.",

And so they're going to decide whether they think Joe Biden is a viable candidate on electability, or if they think that Bernie Sanders has more energy. And also, the issue that has been brought up a lot in recent days is has the DNC done enough to rebuild the trust with the Bernie wing of the party. And it's increasingly clear again that they have not. They claim that they were going to do conversations with the far left wing of the party that they were going to clean some of the rules up. They did change some things. But in terms of the results that came out of Iowa or the non-results moving into how we go with this.

So I think that's one thing. And the second thing is Texas. Can Joe Biden really match Bernie Sanders? There is a lot of early voting there also in California. And California is the be all and end all of what we're going to be watching tonight, because there are so many -- 400 plus delegates to be awarded. And right now, again, so much early voting and it favors Sanders. But what we have seen over the last few days is just an earthquake in terms of Democratic Party politics. And now, you have groups like 538, the predictors, even some of the folks here at FOX, saying it looks like not only could Joe Biden come close to holding down what Sanders can claim from California. In some cases, he might win the total delegate count for the night.  Because as Jesse was saying, you look at Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, the only state, by the way that Michael Bloomberg looks to have any chance to even get above the 15 percent at the moment is Oklahoma. So this is now -- the question is what happens to Warren? What happens to Bloomberg?

You don't want the guy anywhere near the White House. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is less coherent than Crazy Bernie. And he can't even survive a good news cycle without racking up gaffs. He doesn't know where he is, what numbers are coming out of his mouth, who he's even talking to. It is a lackluster candidate with a bad campaign. I have never seen a Joe Biden bumper sticker, have any of you? I've never seen a Joe Biden crowd. I mean, he can't get through an interview. The guy is slow, and he is slowing down. And it's not a good look for Joe. But the good news is, we get to watch the whole thing unfold. And it is a beautiful thing.",

And when he continually looks incompetent with basic things, when it comes to a one-on-one match up with Donald Trump, is going to have a hard time trying to make a case to people throughout the country who are liking the economy, who think that President Trump has done a decent job.  Who think he is a competent commander in chief. Joe Biden's going to have a very hard time doing that. When it comes to Bernie Sanders, I think that he is a threat as well. I don't think you can underestimate where he's going to go if her were to win the nomination, which is looking more like the convention as we go into tonight. But the coalition that he had coming out of Nevada is one that Republicans are looking. Latinos, young women, young people, and if the whole Democratic establishment would get behind him, he certainly would have more of a machine then he does right now.

When we see the media calling restrictions, travel restrictions, racist, that kind of virtue signaling creates fatalities. China was able to cut down the infections by being highly restrictive because they're a different kind of culture. But Bill Gates makes this point. The measures that can stop a pandemic might conflict with our do-good precious liberal assumptions. And a pandemic requires the strict parents, not the loving parent. And the thing about our government -- our government and our democracy is we've always had a really good combination of the strict and the loving, the respect for individuals but the rule of law.

The future of the Democratic Party could very well be at stake tonight. The first Super Tuesday polls said to close two hours from now, the big story, the major showdown between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Millions of voters across 14 states are said to choose between Sanders' brand of socialism and Joe Biden's more moderate approach. But as we have seen, we could be in for some surprises, Michael Bloomberg on the ballot for the first time, and Elizabeth Warren still in the race. The fight for more than 1,300 delegates up for grabs taking a dramatic turn with Joe Biden picking up the endorsement of his former 2020 rivals. Will it make a difference?"

I think Biden did get a good bounce of South Carolina. I just can't figure out whether it is actually Joe-mentum balance or it's a never-Bernie balance. Because right now, it looks a little manufactured when you see the slew of endorsements come in perfectly timed close to South Carolina, especially after you get the deep state endorsement where you get Susan Rice Brennan and James Comey endorsed Biden in 24 hours. Wow, that tells you pretty much everything you need to know. Biden has been racking up all these endorsements, but he's also been racking up an alarming amount of gas, which tells me this. The man is obviously deteriorating, and the Democrats are taking full advantage of it. If Biden becomes president, is he really going to be the president? Is he going to be a figurehead and people behind the scenes pulling strings? That's what it looks like to me, because the Biden presidency is a restoration. Everybody gets their job back at the NSC, at the State Department, at the White House. They can control all the money and they can control all the power. They don't want a revolution with Bernie Sanders. They just want their power back. They want full control. Bernie does not give them control because Bernie cannot be controlled. And that's why he is such a big threat. Right now, it looks like this was timed perfectly. And the difference between 2016 and now is Trump was unstoppable. Bernie Sanders is stoppable, because of the fact that he doesn't have as big of a movement, and because of the rules in the Democratic process."

But when it comes to these new endorsements that Joe Biden has received in recent days, it really -- you know, voters don't typically like to be told what to do, right? And so they're going to decide whether they think Joe Biden is a viable candidate on electability, or if they think that Bernie Sanders has more energy. And also, the issue that has been brought up a lot in recent days is has the DNC done enough to rebuild the trust with the Bernie wing of the party. And it's increasingly clear again that they have not. They claim that they were going to do conversations with the far left wing of the party that they were going to clean some of the rules up. They did change some things. But in terms of the results that came out of Iowa or the non-results moving into how we go with this. And then Joe Biden now having all these people backing with the full weight of the establishment, it tears open that wound that they have been trying to fix since the --"

She is the fake social justice warrior. He -- she is the artificial sweetener to Bernie's raw sugarcane. How is that? How is that? So her endorsement is likely a blemish on the blue dress that is Biden. Now, I have two more points. What kills me about Mayor Pete's endorsement, this was a guy who was super sanctimonious sat up -- stood on the debate stage and said, well, we look at this stage, all we see are white men. And where is the diversity, right? And then he endorses the whitest, oldest, most establishment male you could ever find. So he is a hypocrite --"

Lastly, to Jesse's point, the other problem for Joe is people see the ploy that he switched from trumping the evil nemesis to Biden -- to Bernie being the evil nemesis. So you kind of see a mob action forming against Bernie. And if you scare the establishment that bad, there's got to be something good about it. You're cool, even though you know that Bernie is, you know, not qualified, but the fact that he scares the establishment makes you like him."

      "utterance": "I wouldn't listen. Anyway, I think there are only a few things that you should really watch as you tune in tonight. And I hope you tune in because we're going to have some great coverage. But I think one on the more interesting things is whether or not Sanders can knock out Warren in Massachusetts, because if he beats her there, I don't know where she's got to go. So I think that's one thing. And the second thing is Texas. Can Joe Biden really match Bernie Sanders? There is a lot of early voting there also in California. And California is the be all and end all of what we're going to be watching tonight, because there are so many -- 400 plus delegates to be awarded. And right now, again, so much early voting and it favors Sanders. But what we have seen over the last few days is just an earthquake in terms of Democratic Party politics. And now, you have groups like 538, the predictors, even some of the folks here at FOX, saying it looks like not only could Joe Biden come close to holding down what Sanders can claim from California. In some cases, he might win the total delegate count for the night. Because as Jesse was saying, you look at Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, the only state, by the way that Michael Bloomberg looks to have any chance to even get above the 15 percent at the moment is Oklahoma. So this is now -- the question is what happens to Warren? What happens to Bloomberg? But the idea that this was going to be a knockout punch of a day, Super Tuesday that was going to settle this nomination is not true anymore, at least according --"

Biden reminds me that he's getting any younger, let alone wiser. And it makes you wonder what the endorsements from Amy, Pete, and Beto really mean. Is Joe leading a parade of enthusiastic support, or is this a gurney race to push Joe across the finish line on a stretcher? He faces a bigger challenge, though. He is a moderate by today's loony left standards. But his one and only idea is get rid of that orange mini. That is not a vision. That is a complaint. Meanwhile, Bernie is the outsider whose vision is strong despite being wrong. That's why he attracts the youth, the mad, and the crazy. In a world where we idealize the bold, the radical is just sexier than a bumbling moderate, even a radical with ear hair. It is not fair. It is not smart. But it's life. Maybe the Dems haven't thrown all their weight behind the fantasy of impeachment, they'd see this coming? Instead, the Dems are stuck with three voting choices, two cranky old men and sleeping in. I put my money on the snooze button. Dana, Dana, Dana, what did we learn from 2016 Rick Perry? Never start something you can't finish. Remember I got three things."

And everybody knows - - you can't blame the Democratic Party for rigging it against him. If I was a Democrat, I would rig the heck out of this thing. You don't want the guy anywhere near the White House. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is less coherent than Crazy Bernie. And he can't even survive a good news cycle without racking up gaffs. He doesn't know where he is, what numbers are coming out of his mouth, who he's even talking to. It is a lackluster candidate with a bad campaign. I have never seen a Joe Biden bumper sticker, have any of you? I've never seen a Joe Biden crowd. I mean, he can't get through an interview. The guy is slow, and he is slowing down. And it's not a good look for Joe. But the good news is, we get to watch the whole thing unfold. And it is a beautiful thing."

But I think that Amy Klobuchar -- Amy Klobuchar said explicitly that she was promised nothing, that she just wanted to do what she felt was the right thing to do in order to unify the party and prepare to defeat to Donald Trump. I will say this. I'm struck that President Trump and clearly your delight in these gaffs, indicate again the Republicans are most worried about Joe Biden. They don't want to run against him. That is why the president sent Rudy to the Ukraine to dig up dirt on, guess who, Joe Biden. And I have the feeling that Hunter Biden's name is going to bubble up any second. I see already that in Congress, they are planning more hearings. I think that what the right-wing is intent on is they like to mock Joe Biden. But I have to tell you again. Democrats do --- I'm going to use Dana's word, think that it is charming that he is authentic, right? That is something you value greatly, Jesse. The he is authentic. He is real.

He's the guy who's been in Washington for decades so he knows what he's doing and we can trust him to be someone who is reliable to be a commander in chief. And when he continually looks incompetent with basic things, when it comes to a one-on-one match up with Donald Trump, is going to have a hard time trying to make a case to people throughout the country who are liking the economy, who think that President Trump has done a decent job. Who think he is a competent commander in chief. Joe Biden's going to have a very hard time doing that. When it comes to Bernie Sanders, I think that he is a threat as well. I don't think you can underestimate where he's going to go if her were to win the nomination, which is looking more like the convention as we go into tonight. But the coalition that he had coming out of Nevada is one that Republicans are looking. Latinos, young women, young people, and if the whole Democratic establishment would get behind him, he certainly would have more of a machine then he does right now. So I would not underestimate his ability. And the Trump campaign's research on him as well, they are probably doing a lot on both Biden and Bernie Sanders."

And I think that because that the administration has done, I think, a pretty good job of explaining America has the best public health system in the world. We are doing what we can. We are trying to get ahead of it. We've have done some things already that have slowed it down. That gives space for somebody like the woman in Denver to make a joke, or to be able to say with sarcasm, or to be able to -- to kind of joke about it. Let me tell you.

We don't know that. The councilwoman should apologize. She should apologize right away, and people will probably accept it because it was not sarcasm. She was supporting the idea and it was a gross idea. The real challenge and Bill Gates has talked about this, is how our society views protective measures. When we see the media calling restrictions, travel restrictions, racist, that kind of virtue signaling creates fatalities. China was able to cut down the infections by being highly restrictive because they're a different kind of culture. But Bill Gates makes this point. The measures that can stop a pandemic might conflict with our do-good precious liberal assumptions. And a pandemic requires the strict parents, not the loving parent. And the thing about our government -- our government and our democracy is we've always had a really good combination of the strict and the loving, the respect for individuals but the rule of law. In this case, you need to be -- we need to be grounded. We need the strict parent to ground us if it's for a month or what. And the loving parent has to sit back and say you take this."

      "utterance": "Oh, yes. That's a great -- that's a great point. You think of somebody like Mayor Pete who didn't really get to have the bounce out of Iowa from the media because of that disaster. And then Bernie Sanders capitalizing on a New Hampshire and Nevada, and then Biden doing that now. So, Bernie states that he would do better than tonight or on the West Coast. And in California, we might not even know the results for a couple of weeks. So yes, I think that all makes a lot of sense. I'm watching tonight. I think that Bloomberg will not get number one anywhere. But I'm looking to see if he gets number two anywhere. So for example, can Bloomberg get number two in Virginia or Texas ahead of Bernie and what would that tell us? And then also, if you get to number two, after Bernie and beats Biden in a couple of places, that dynamic of those two battling it out might continue for a while."

And I think tonight maybe you'll see how strong Biden is or is not. I do agree with you that I think Bloomberg is soft as poll numbers. I think he'll underperform. To your point about Beto, I was thinking about this today. We have not seen Adam Schiff on television for a very long time."

That's what he did with impeachment. He convinced the Democratic Party to go on a really long road trip, and then he ditched you in a small town because he met some chick.

And he's like, you know what he is? He's like Mrs. Garrett in Facts of Life. When the girls are getting out of control, he comes downstairs, he says OK, this is how it's going to be.

The damage in Nashville which is just a great town, it's unbelievable. Take a look. Fox News Meteorologist Janice Dean estimated the city was hit by a tornado with winds possibly as high as 165 miles an hour. The historic Germantown neighborhood in Nashville, as well as the trendy East Nashville area, saw roofs torn off of homes, office buildings, trees uprooted. At one airport, you're looking at it now, the terminal and the planes were left looking like debris. It's hard to make sense of the pictures. Governor Bill Lee summed it up by calling the situation heartbreaking. President Trump is scheduled to visit the area on Friday."

Mine is a book -- wait, we'll have this. Dana's Book Club. Oh, there's Jasper. Everybody has missed him. This is a book you're going to want to get. It's called Pearls of Wisdom: Little Pieces of Advice that go a Long Way. This is advice from former First Lady Barbara Bush, the late former First Lady, and it was put together by Jean Becker, a longtime speechwriter for her and the chief of staff to George HW Bush's post-presidency. And she gathered all of this advice from about 100 friends, colleagues, children, grandchildren, put this all together. It's really wonderful. One of the pieces of advice is to choose happy, which I know all of us do. Right, Greg? Choose happy. Choose happy. It's a wonderful book. I think it makes a great like graduation gift, Mother's Day. I loved it, and I can't wait to read more of it. So that was my \"ONE MORE THING.\" Jesse?"
