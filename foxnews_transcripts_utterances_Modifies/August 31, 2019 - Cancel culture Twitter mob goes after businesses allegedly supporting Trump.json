They're also great at dispensing wisdom hugs and gardening tips, but not during Tucker because everyone has to shut up when Tucker is on. Still not convinced? Think about this, bub.  You recently built a wall playing Fortnite, but your grandpa strangled a Nazi on the beaches of Normandy. You call in sick from work after bad night of sushi. But your grandma beat polio then built your crib by hand, while smoking a pack of Lucky Strikes. You spend weekends drinking mimosas at Bottomless Brunch. But your great uncle illegally distilled his own moonshine in the bathtub. Shank Skanksters who wanted to steal it, then sold it to the cops for a massive profit.

But because the media and the Democrats will collude and refuse any result that they hate. But you'd think the media would have learned after all of this?"

I repeated statements a single source told me about the President's finances and loan documents with Deutsche Bank, saying if true, as I discussed, the information was simply not good enough. I did not go through the rigorous verification and standards process here at MSNBC before repeating what I heard from my source. I should not have said it on air or posted it on Twitter.

They're also great at dispensing wisdom hugs and gardening tips, but not during Tucker because everyone has to shut up when Tucker is on. Still not convinced? Think about this, bub. You recently built a wall playing Fortnite, but your grandpa strangled a Nazi on the beaches of Normandy. You call in sick from work after bad night of sushi. But your grandma beat polio then built your crib by hand, while smoking a pack of Lucky Strikes. You spend weekends drinking mimosas at Bottomless Brunch. But your great uncle illegally distilled his own moonshine in the bathtub. Shank Skanksters who wanted to steal it, then sold it to the cops for a massive profit.
