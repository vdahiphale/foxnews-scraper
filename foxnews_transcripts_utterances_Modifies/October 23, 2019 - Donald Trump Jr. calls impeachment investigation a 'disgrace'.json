      "sentences": "Hi, welcome to this busy news breaking edition of “Hannity,” reporting tonight from California. We're out on the West Coast. And tonight, we have breaking news on multiple fronts. In just moments, Senator Lindsey Graham, he will join us to respond to Susan Rice, calling him a piece of bleep.  But we start in the Washington swamp where House Republicans, they are today fighting back against this corrupt, secret behind closed doors, smoke-filled room, Venezuela-style impeachment coup attempt.  Just hours ago, a group of lawmakers literally stormed into yet another top-secret session of the corrupt Adam Schiff's kangaroo court. And once again, the cowardly, corrupt Schiff, the lying Adam Schiff, well, he was said to hold another secret impeachment hearing with secret testimony recorded only by his secret transcript. Republicans can't see it unless they have a Democratic minder.  But then the corrupt Schiff, well, he immediately halted the session when Republican lawmakers entered the room. Now, let this be a very clear warning to Schiff and Pelosi and Democrats everywhere, well, this secret Soviet-style impeachment attempt, this cannot stand. We do have a Constitution. We do have precedents. We do have something called due process.  Republicans who value the Constitution and the sovereignty of the American people, this is a fight worth fighting, an injustice worth overturning. And, by the way, every step of the way, every room in the U.S. Capitol, Republicans ought to have a right to be there. The president's attorneys have a right to be there. That's why it's illegitimate and unconstitutional. They are rightly tonight demanding transparency, due process, basic fairness, equal justice, and in answer to a very simple question. Well, what does the corrupt Adam Schiff have to hide? Let's take a look.",

      "sentences": "Now, it's obvious, the corrupt, cowardly Adam Schiff, he doesn't want you the American people to know the whole truth. He doesn't want you to watch this kangaroo court process.   Nothing can be further from the truth when he says, oh, we really want to be transparent. Now, this so-called impeachment inquiry is one big corrupt hoax, one big massive lie. And, by the way, coming up tonight, lawmakers who did in fact take the right step and storm Schiff's top-secret session, they will join us with more details. Let's be clear, we've said it a million times and I'll say it again: Congressman Adam Schiff is not trustworthy. We know he is a pathological liar. He lied about having top-secret evidence on the Trumpet Russia collusion. He promised that to us for two and a half years.  He lied when he said that evidence of collusion was right there in plain sight. No, it wasn't. He lied about not having any prior contact with the non-whistle-blower, hearsay whistle-blower. And we know now that his office in fact had contact with the whistle-blower and we believed was given advice from his office. That would make him and people in his office interior witnesses in this case.   It doesn't get any more corrupt and that's the real reason that he doesn't want this whistle-blower to testify. Well, if that happened, he would likely be exposed as having been a part of this hole, entire set up. And, by the way, let's not forget one other thing, big lie Adam Schiff, he lied about the transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukraine. In fact, that guy, the corrupt Schiff read a completely fictional transcript into the record during an official hearing. This guy lies over and over again because the truth does not fit what is a warped, vengeful, rage induced, psychotic anti-Trump narrative of his.  There was no collusion. There was no quid pro quo. We have the transcript. We don't need hearsay whistle-blowers. We don't care -- except what he did was wrong, he should have been honest about it. You know, we really don't care about the sham hearings he is running. What? He is going to come out of a hearing? You don't let Republicans in. You just selectively leak that which is favorable to you. You won't let Republicans see the entire transcript unless they have a Democratic staffer, a minder go in?  That is their job. They too have a due process rights. The president's attorney, yes, they should be in the room every single time.  Now, the president was freely and fairly elected and the Electoral College landslide, ever since he has been elected, he has been faithfully executing his sworn duty to the Constitution and to this country. One of those sworn duties detailed Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution requires that the president uphold the laws of the land. Well, that would include Ukraine election interference in 2016. That would include Biden using taxpayer dollars, $1 billion taxpayer dollars, shaking down Ukraine to get a prosecutor fired who we now know was investigating his son -- the same son who had no experience with gas, energy, oil, or the country of Ukraine. No experience, he's being paid millions of dollars. Prosecutors investigating him, Joe says, you got six hours. Six hours. You're not getting the money unless you fire that prosecutor -- we now know that was investigating his son.  So, that sounds to me like they were trying to buy favor and goodwill from the Bidens. Why on earth would you pay a kid that had no experience -- he's not a kid, he's 49 years old -- why would you pay the son of a vice president millions of dollars when he has zero experience and anything related to Ukraine or energy?   This was why it's so critically important that the administration and Republicans in Congress to their job. Get to the bottom of all of this, on top of what we have identified as the single biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern American political history. Now, we have an update. The inspector general's FISA report, well, we know it's finished, it's still not been released to the public. Now, we've seen delay after delay after delay after delay. Now, why? Well, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa tweeted, quote, well, all of the delays and all the excuses, why the Horowitz IG FISA report is in public yet after several months of anticipation, well, that leads me to be suspicious it's going to be deep-sixed by the deep state.  Now, tonight, I don't know why the findings are not yet public. I'm as angry as everybody else, because we already know what happened. We know there was premeditated thought on the FISA court because we know the bulk of information was the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for, dirty Russian dossier. Oh, so they can help her get elected in 2016?  And, by the way, what did we learn from that? That they never verified it and it was unverifiable. That would mean the deep state is protecting their own. We will find out, eventually we need to get to the truth. Now I'm told the first week of November. I guess I shouldn't hold my breath.   Now, thankfully, investigative reporter John Solomon, he'll join us in a few minutes with positive news about the FISA report. He has other breaking details about the origins of the Russia witch hunt. Now, that investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney John Durham. And it's now ongoing and is now expanding in size and scope because of new, explosive evidence. Tonight, FOX News is reporting this brand-new evidence goes uncovered during a recent trip to Rome with the Attorney General Bill Barr. He was there. Durham has been there.  Now, keep in mind, this probe is focused on whether or not the powerful tools of our intelligence community where weaponized against you, we, the American people and people associated with an affiliated with the Trump campaign. And whether or not intel officials at the highest level to circumvent U.S. law were outsourcing surveillance against innocent Americans by other countries.  In other words, they're getting the friends in the intel community in Italy and Australia and Great Britain to do things they couldn't do legally here. OK. Well, that would make you guilty of circumventing the laws. Now, both countries are now fully cooperating with the Durham probe. We can report that tonight. And according to a report from the \"Washington Examiner,\" we now have identified four notorious deep state figures are now wrapped up, up to their eyeballs in this investigation, including Obama's chief John Brennan, Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, fired FBI agent, the guy in the middle of it, Peter Strzok. Also, the author of Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier, that would be Christopher Steele himself. Now, this is big news tonight. And now, the walls seem to finally be caving in and we are going to get to the truth.   Now, one of these four men, what do they have in common? One, they all possess a rage and psychotic hatred for all things Donald Trump, and two, they should all be very, very nervous tonight because U.S. Attorney John Durham, the Attorney General Bill Barr, they're pushing to add to the truth. One other good sign is that Durham and his investigation is gaining serious traction.  You got Brennan's current colleague at MSDNC, that would be Area 51, Roswell Rachel Maddow, MSDNC, they're trying to spin the upcoming findings. They know it's going to be bad with a brand-new conspiracy theory. See, they were peddling conspiracy theories, lies, propaganda, misinformation, wrong, day after day, week after week, month after month. And it went on for years. And now, they're trying to prepare themselves for one the real truth is coming out. Let's take a look.",

Area 51, Roswell Rachel Maddow, at it again.   What will they learn? They don't care about learning. For them, it's an agenda. For them, it's about all things Democrat. For them, it's get rid of Trump anyway we can.  Truth? Well, that doesn't matter to her or anyone else frankly on that network. But still, someone might want to remind NBC's chief conspiracy theorist, that U.S. attorney John Durham is an investigator, long respected by both sides of the aisle. In fact he was previously appointed by two Democratic attorney generals to investigate highly sensitive cases. Remember Janet Reno? Well, she selected Durham to investigate corrupt law enforcement officials and their dealings with notorious gangster Whitey Bulger. Eric Holder appointed Durham himself to lead the DOJ's investigation into the use of enhanced interrogation techniques.   And Durham's ongoing investigation now into the origins of the Russian witch hunt is not a political stunt. It's a very real probe about real abuses of power. What happened in 2016 and beyond? If this continues to happen, you don't have a Constitution. You don't have a rule of law. You don't have equal justice under the law, and you don't have equal application of our laws. And there's got to be a reckoning any deep state, because if they keep doing this, they'll get you six ways, but Sunday, Chuck Schumer said. Were going to lose those constitutional protections that we thought we had in this country. Also breaking tonight, investigative reporter John Solomon, we go back to him. He has brand new evidence that Comey's FBI knew that the dirty Russian dossier was garbage. They knew it. But they used it anyway to willfully defraud a FISA court and obtain the warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associate by the name of Carter Page, which give them a backdoor into all things Trump world. That would be the Trump campaign transition and presidency.   Joining us with more, investigative reporter, FOX News contributor, John Solomon.  So, I use -- I said it differently, premeditated fraud on the FISA court.",

      "sentences": "We sure do tonight. If you remember, a few months ago, Sean, we broke out on your show the news that Christopher Steele, 11 days before the FISA warrant was obtained, made a secret visit to the State Department. He met with Kathleen Kavalec if you remember.  And her notes of that meeting showed all the things you just talked about, that he was talking about leaking to the media, he had an election day deadline, he was working for the Democrats -- all things that should have weighed in. But there was one mystery that was left when we last report it. There was a document that Kathleen Kavalec transmitted to the FBI two days after the meeting with Christopher Steele.  Tonight, I have obtained that document. It shows that Christopher Steele and the State Department bureaucrats were peddling what is now known to be a widely debunked conspiracy theory that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a secret computer connection at the Alfa Bank where they were secretly talking and coordinating the election. This theory peddled by Democrats all the way through the 2016, 2017 timeframe was not only knocked down by the FBI, it was knocked down by Robert Mueller. In fact, Robert Mueller during his testimony went out of his way to say, I don't believe this ever happened. It was bogus.  We now know that Christopher Steele and the State Department took that theory, sent it to the FBI ten days before the FISA warrant was obtained. Why is that important? It is clear evidence there should have been suspicion and a belief that they had derogatory information in Steele's credibility. They did not -- they should not have trusted Steele knowing that the FBI had already knocked this down once even before Steele peddled that in the State Department. This is a very big development. I put the document up on JohnSolomonReports.com. You can take a look at it and you will see exactly how crazy the theory was.",

Now, remember, according to the left, bad things are only bad if Donald Trump can be bludgeoned. That's it. Collusion, it's only bad if they can blame Trump. Foreign election interference only matters when it can be used to smear the Trump campaign. Quid pro quos are only bad if they could be used to bludgeon the president.  For Democrats, the media mob, everything is just a political game. No consistency, no truth, no intellectual honesty ever. The truth does not matter to them. Facts do not matter to them. Now, just as clearly also doesn't matter to them, the only thing that matters is beating Trump and I know they can't beat them so they have to try to impeach him.

If anything, a secondhand account of that telephone conversation. So, they actually received information from other people. Also, the chairman, former chairmen are saying that what they need to do is have the same access at the Democrats have to these witnesses, that they can keep it away in the American public. And they wanted to be a public, a public testimony. So, this is going to be very interesting. They warned Schiff that if you don't comply you are basically going against a due process of law.

Four days later, there's barely a retraction, oftentimes there wasn't even a retraction, they just leave it out there as though it was fact, even though it was total nonsense. This is a guy that was leaving my testimony every 30 minutes and then I get to read about it concurrently with those bathroom breaks on CNN seven, eight hours later. It's just nonsense and it's going on again. And I'm surprised that the media who has been so vocal about not wanting democracy to die in darkness, Sean, they don't want it to die in darkness, they're totally fine with this being and going on in total darkness. It's a disgrace. And what's happening right now—",

In just moments, Senator Lindsey Graham, he will join us to respond to Susan Rice, calling him a piece of bleep. But we start in the Washington swamp where House Republicans, they are today fighting back against this corrupt, secret behind closed doors, smoke-filled room, Venezuela-style impeachment coup attempt. Just hours ago, a group of lawmakers literally stormed into yet another top-secret session of the corrupt Adam Schiff's kangaroo court. And once again, the cowardly, corrupt Schiff, the lying Adam Schiff, well, he was said to hold another secret impeachment hearing with secret testimony recorded only by his secret transcript. Republicans can't see it unless they have a Democratic minder. But then the corrupt Schiff, well, he immediately halted the session when Republican lawmakers entered the room. Now, let this be a very clear warning to Schiff and Pelosi and Democrats everywhere, well, this secret Soviet-style impeachment attempt, this cannot stand. We do have a Constitution. We do have precedents. We do have something called due process. Republicans who value the Constitution and the sovereignty of the American people, this is a fight worth fighting, an injustice worth overturning. And, by the way, every step of the way, every room in the U.S. Capitol, Republicans ought to have a right to be there. The president's attorneys have a right to be there. That's why it's illegitimate and unconstitutional. They are rightly tonight demanding transparency, due process, basic fairness, equal justice, and in answer to a very simple question. Well, what does the corrupt Adam Schiff have to hide? Let's take a look."

Nothing can be further from the truth when he says, oh, we really want to be transparent. Now, this so-called impeachment inquiry is one big corrupt hoax, one big massive lie. And, by the way, coming up tonight, lawmakers who did in fact take the right step and storm Schiff's top-secret session, they will join us with more details."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Let's be clear, we've said it a million times and I'll say it again",
      "utterance": "Congressman Adam Schiff is not trustworthy. We know he is a pathological liar. He lied about having top-secret evidence on the Trumpet Russia collusion. He promised that to us for two and a half years. He lied when he said that evidence of collusion was right there in plain sight. No, it wasn't. He lied about not having any prior contact with the non-whistle-blower, hearsay whistle-blower. And we know now that his office in fact had contact with the whistle-blower and we believed was given advice from his office. That would make him and people in his office interior witnesses in this case. It doesn't get any more corrupt and that's the real reason that he doesn't want this whistle-blower to testify. Well, if that happened, he would likely be exposed as having been a part of this hole, entire set up. And, by the way, let's not forget one other thing, big lie Adam Schiff, he lied about the transcript of Trump's phone call with Ukraine. In fact, that guy, the corrupt Schiff read a completely fictional transcript into the record during an official hearing. This guy lies over and over again because the truth does not fit what is a warped, vengeful, rage induced, psychotic anti-Trump narrative of his. There was no collusion. There was no quid pro quo. We have the transcript. We don't need hearsay whistle-blowers. We don't care -- except what he did was wrong, he should have been honest about it. You know, we really don't care about the sham hearings he is running. What? He is going to come out of a hearing? You don't let Republicans in. You just selectively leak that which is favorable to you. You won't let Republicans see the entire transcript unless they have a Democratic staffer, a minder go in? That is their job. They too have a due process rights. The president's attorney, yes, they should be in the room every single time. Now, the president was freely and fairly elected and the Electoral College landslide, ever since he has been elected, he has been faithfully executing his sworn duty to the Constitution and to this country. One of those sworn duties detailed Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution requires that the president uphold the laws of the land. Well, that would include Ukraine election interference in 2016. That would include Biden using taxpayer dollars, $1 billion taxpayer dollars, shaking down Ukraine to get a prosecutor fired who we now know was investigating his son -- the same son who had no experience with gas, energy, oil, or the country of Ukraine. No experience, he's being paid millions of dollars. Prosecutors investigating him, Joe says, you got six hours. Six hours. You're not getting the money unless you fire that prosecutor -- we now know that was investigating his son. So, that sounds to me like they were trying to buy favor and goodwill from the Bidens. Why on earth would you pay a kid that had no experience -- he's not a kid, he's 49 years old -- why would you pay the son of a vice president millions of dollars when he has zero experience and anything related to Ukraine or energy? This was why it's so critically important that the administration and Republicans in Congress to their job. Get to the bottom of all of this, on top of what we have identified as the single biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern American political history. Now, we have an update. The inspector general's FISA report, well, we know it's finished, it's still not been released to the public. Now, we've seen delay after delay after delay after delay. Now, why? Well, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa tweeted, quote, well, all of the delays and all the excuses, why the Horowitz IG FISA report is in public yet after several months of anticipation, well, that leads me to be suspicious it's going to be deep-sixed by the deep state. Now, tonight, I don't know why the findings are not yet public. I'm as angry as everybody else, because we already know what happened. We know there was premeditated thought on the FISA court because we know the bulk of information was the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for, dirty Russian dossier. Oh, so they can help her get elected in 2016? And, by the way, what did we learn from that? That they never verified it and it was unverifiable. That would mean the deep state is protecting their own. We will find out, eventually we need to get to the truth. Now I'm told the first week of November. I guess I shouldn't hold my breath. Now, thankfully, investigative reporter John Solomon, he'll join us in a few minutes with positive news about the FISA report. He has other breaking details about the origins of the Russia witch hunt. Now, that investigation is being led by the U.S. attorney John Durham. And it's now ongoing and is now expanding in size and scope because of new, explosive evidence. Tonight, FOX News is reporting this brand-new evidence goes uncovered during a recent trip to Rome with the Attorney General Bill Barr. He was there. Durham has been there. Now, keep in mind, this probe is focused on whether or not the powerful tools of our intelligence community where weaponized against you, we, the American people and people associated with an affiliated with the Trump campaign. And whether or not intel officials at the highest level to circumvent U.S. law were outsourcing surveillance against innocent Americans by other countries. In other words, they're getting the friends in the intel community in Italy and Australia and Great Britain to do things they couldn't do legally here. OK. Well, that would make you guilty of circumventing the laws. Now, both countries are now fully cooperating with the Durham probe. We can report that tonight. And according to a report from the \"Washington Examiner,\" we now have identified four notorious deep state figures are now wrapped up, up to their eyeballs in this investigation, including Obama's chief John Brennan, Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, fired FBI agent, the guy in the middle of it, Peter Strzok. Also, the author of Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier, that would be Christopher Steele himself. Now, this is big news tonight. And now, the walls seem to finally be caving in and we are going to get to the truth. Now, one of these four men, what do they have in common? One, they all possess a rage and psychotic hatred for all things Donald Trump, and two, they should all be very, very nervous tonight because U.S. Attorney John Durham, the Attorney General Bill Barr, they're pushing to add to the truth. One other good sign is that Durham and his investigation is gaining serious traction. You got Brennan's current colleague at MSDNC, that would be Area 51, Roswell Rachel Maddow, MSDNC, they're trying to spin the upcoming findings. They know it's going to be bad with a brand-new conspiracy theory. See, they were peddling conspiracy theories, lies, propaganda, misinformation, wrong, day after day, week after week, month after month. And it went on for years. And now, they're trying to prepare themselves for one the real truth is coming out. Let's take a look."

      "speaker": "RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST",
      "utterance": "It really does seem like they are going to use the power of the U.S. Justice Department to help them make that case that the Democrats are the real source of the scandal here. What Barr and Durham appear to be doing here to try to boost the president's campaign, they are crossing a bit of a Rubicon in terms of what the U.S. government is for. And part of what we're going to have to figure out when this is all over is how we crossed back over it."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Oh, now after two -- two-plus years, two and a half years of lies, they are back at it. More conspiracy theories, more lies, more speculation, zero facts. There you have it. Area 51, Roswell Rachel Maddow, at it again. What will they learn? They don't care about learning. For them, it's an agenda. For them, it's about all things Democrat. For them, it's get rid of Trump anyway we can. Truth? Well, that doesn't matter to her or anyone else frankly on that network. But still, someone might want to remind NBC's chief conspiracy theorist, that U.S. attorney John Durham is an investigator, long respected by both sides of the aisle. In fact he was previously appointed by two Democratic attorney generals to investigate highly sensitive cases. Remember Janet Reno? Well, she selected Durham to investigate corrupt law enforcement officials and their dealings with notorious gangster Whitey Bulger. Eric Holder appointed Durham himself to lead the DOJ's investigation into the use of enhanced interrogation techniques. And Durham's ongoing investigation now into the origins of the Russian witch hunt is not a political stunt. It's a very real probe about real abuses of power. What happened in 2016 and beyond? If this continues to happen, you don't have a Constitution. You don't have a rule of law. You don't have equal justice under the law, and you don't have equal application of our laws. And there's got to be a reckoning any deep state, because if they keep doing this, they'll get you six ways, but Sunday, Chuck Schumer said. Were going to lose those constitutional protections that we thought we had in this country. Also breaking tonight, investigative reporter John Solomon, we go back to him. He has brand new evidence that Comey's FBI knew that the dirty Russian dossier was garbage. They knew it. But they used it anyway to willfully defraud a FISA court and obtain the warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associate by the name of Carter Page, which give them a backdoor into all things Trump world. That would be the Trump campaign transition and presidency. Joining us with more, investigative reporter, FOX News contributor, John Solomon. So, I use -- I said it differently, premeditated fraud on the FISA court."

    {
      "speaker": "SOLOMON",
      "utterance": "We sure do tonight. If you remember, a few months ago, Sean, we broke out on your show the news that Christopher Steele, 11 days before the FISA warrant was obtained, made a secret visit to the State Department. He met with Kathleen Kavalec if you remember. And her notes of that meeting showed all the things you just talked about, that he was talking about leaking to the media, he had an election day deadline, he was working for the Democrats -- all things that should have weighed in. But there was one mystery that was left when we last report it. There was a document that Kathleen Kavalec transmitted to the FBI two days after the meeting with Christopher Steele. Tonight, I have obtained that document. It shows that Christopher Steele and the State Department bureaucrats were peddling what is now known to be a widely debunked conspiracy theory that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had a secret computer connection at the Alfa Bank where they were secretly talking and coordinating the election. This theory peddled by Democrats all the way through the 2016, 2017 timeframe was not only knocked down by the FBI, it was knocked down by Robert Mueller. In fact, Robert Mueller during his testimony went out of his way to say, I don't believe this ever happened. It was bogus. We now know that Christopher Steele and the State Department took that theory, sent it to the FBI ten days before the FISA warrant was obtained. Why is that important? It is clear evidence there should have been suspicion and a belief that they had derogatory information in Steele's credibility. They did not -- they should not have trusted Steele knowing that the FBI had already knocked this down once even before Steele peddled that in the State Department. This is a very big development. I put the document up on JohnSolomonReports.com. You can take a look at it and you will see exactly how crazy the theory was."

Donald Trump, I bet, would have said yes. Now, no, they turned it on him. They used it against them. Try to use it to bludgeon him. Hillary Clinton, the same thing happened?"

Tonight, I have confirmed from six different sources, all who have seen documents in the last few weeks that in December of 2015, at the beginning of the election, Hillary Clinton was given a defensive briefing by the United States intelligence community about a foreign threat targeting her campaign. So, she got treated very differently. I cannot -- my sources cannot tell me which country was targeting Hillary Clinton because it remains classified.

Our country has a dark, shameful history with lynching and to even think about making this comparison is abhorrent and despicable.

Now, remember, according to the left, bad things are only bad if Donald Trump can be bludgeoned. That's it. Collusion, it's only bad if they can blame Trump. Foreign election interference only matters when it can be used to smear the Trump campaign. Quid pro quos are only bad if they could be used to bludgeon the president. For Democrats, the media mob, everything is just a political game. No consistency, no truth, no intellectual honesty ever. The truth does not matter to them. Facts do not matter to them. Now, just as clearly also doesn't matter to them, the only thing that matters is beating Trump and I know they can't beat them so they have to try to impeach him.

Jim Jordan, Congressman Devin Nunes, Mike McCaul calling for the fake whistle-blower to testify before Congress. Here with reaction to this news, FOX News contributor, Sara Carter, the author of the brand-new bestseller, it's called \"Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History\", FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett.

If anything, a secondhand account of that telephone conversation. So, they actually received information from other people. Also, the chairman, former chairmen are saying that what they need to do is have the same access at the Democrats have to these witnesses, that they can keep it away in the American public. And they wanted to be a public, a public testimony. So, this is going to be very interesting. They warned Schiff that if you don't comply you are basically going against a due process of law. So, either comply or this will be evidence that there is no due process here on the part of his committee, and I think that's really interesting.

Did they help pick the attorney? Did they advise to go to the inspector general? What role did he play here?

You can never be a fact witness and an investigator or prosecutor on your own case. Disqualification is mandatory and yet Schiff ignores it with impunity and remember, whistle-blower is not a whistle-blower under the whistle-blower law. Thus, he's not entitled to protection. He can be called as a witness and forced to testify. And if Democrats and the House won't do it, I would suggest that Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, start looking into this. Have him call the whistle-blower and in fact, have Lindsey Graham call Adam Schiff as a witness in this case, because he is a fact witness who was apparently lying about contacts with the so-called whistle-blower who was really just an anonymous informant who was peddling hearsay."

      "utterance": "Well, they should be sick of it, right. It's insane and you see the selective leaking by the only person who has any of the \"information\" is coming from there. Meanwhile, guys like Lee Zeldin are out there fighting. They're out there saying, hey I've been sitting in these meetings. This is fourth person heresy, this is not direct communications, it's a telephone game of nonsense proportions. But the media gets that first vibe, they get it directly from Schiff, they get to run with it as though it's fact. In a month, when they open up the process and everyone else sees it, they will have done the damage. That's why it's disgraceful, Sean, and the American public should be sick of this kind of crap. This shouldn't be going on here. If this was going on in a Banana Republic, we'd say that's pretty bad. It's going on in the United States of America, it's going on in Congress and it's enough."

All right, when we come back, you're not going to believe what our villain of the day said about you, that our Trump supporters, that's kind of worse than calling them deplorable. That is up next as we continue from Los Angeles."

By the 2040s, the white people will be the minority, and I think that there is some level of fear about that, probably in the way that white people in South Africa were afraid what's going to happen in - they'll and the black majority."
