      "sentences": "That they were. So how did that happen? Well, first ponder 50  Cent: rapper, businessman, shot more times than Dick Cheney's lawyer. But after he endorsed Trump, he folded faster than Marie Kondo on meth. When his crazy ex, Chelsea Handler chose to publicly humiliate him until he said he was backing Joe, which he did or so he swore.   This is what we call in layman's terms, lying to get the nut bag out of your house before she boils your cat, because you know when 50 is alone in that booth on Tuesday, he'll vote Trump. Trump offers the largest GDP jump in history. Joe offers the largest tax increase in history and discounts on Ovaltine. Mr. Cent ain't stupid. Well, he was stupid for dating Handler, but he did it so we wouldn't have to. So he'll vote Trump and so will a lot of people who also won't be saying so. That's the real story. Preference falsification, i.e. lying to escape the wrath of dolts.  50 Cent's lament is a microcosm for this is the first time in my life that you can't say who you're going to vote for. Well, unless it's Joe, but plant a Trump sign in your front yard, you know, some Medusa, who OD'd on \"The View\" on Valium will defecate on your front lawn. That's pure joy. And the media encourages such attacks: violence, vandalism, vows of retribution. That's why you can't trust the polls. It's like asking children the night before Christmas, if they've been naughty or nice.  You'll get a whole lot of nice and no naughty.  And voting Trump thanks to the media, it is very naughty. My advice: if one political faction tries to intimidate you into doing what they say, don't, because that's what we Americans do. It's also the rotten thing to do.  Yes, authentic radicals like Johnny Rotten endorsed Trump without pause. It says something when the most important rebel in recent history sees the same rebel instinct and Trump got to listen to him and not to poor Bruce Springsteen, who was born to run away, saying he will escape to Australia if Trump wins.   Once again, they never say Mexico. Mexico: beautiful, cheap, great beaches, yet it's never Mexico. Could it be the brown people, Bruce? I guess, the darkness on the edge of town wasn't so appealing after all. Meanwhile, the rappers love Trump -- Kanye, Ice Cube, 50 Cent, and now Lil Wayne. He is little. Why is that? Well, they are businessmen who work hard and understand that the only color that matters is green, and Trump makes the green grow for all. And that's why Trump is closer to the street than most pigeons.  Oh, you can hate him. Fine. But no one supporting him, including the man himself is threatening those who aren't. The other side, well, imagine running into this pack.  Video clip lays",

Now, you can't let the side that uses intimidation and fear win. Reward extortion, it'll repeat itself until America becomes Cuba minus the cigars.  The country will become a woke wasteland run by malicious cretins. Oddly voting against the Dems could save the Dems. It's an act of tough love for a party paralyzed by delusional psychosis. For their own good, they must lose. The left has been operating on fear for years. Now, they've goose stepped all the way to your doorstep.  Wear a red hat, you're punch, refused a chance at a diner, you're doxed.  So this isn't a vote about character or race. It's about freedom, the freedom to express yourself to rebel.

And of course, it takes the boldest people to step forward and say, you know what, screw it. I'm going to go with this guy. And by the way, I think you're right. I think 50 Cent is voting for Trump.

You need to work really hard to close that gap to be like, you know what, we've got four years of this, we've got to find a common ground.  I think that message needs to go out to everyone because regardless of who wins, we're still all Americans, and I think it's important to start acting like Americans towards each other, regardless of who wins.

And watching these guys, these rappers come out in favor of Donald Trump, because Donald Trump was talking about something, not the divided us, not finding irrelevant things about us that are different, but finding things that matter to all of us equally as you pointed out, the green and appealing to them. And of course, it takes the boldest people to step forward and say, you know what, screw it. I'm going to go with this guy. And by the way, I think you're right. I think 50 Cent is voting for Trump.

You need to work really hard to close that gap to be like, you know what, we've got four years of this, we've got to find a common ground.

How much of them are going to go with him or are going to work with him? They are doing anything they want to get elected, but we've often seen historically, when the Democrats get in, all bets are off. We saw this before when Barack Obama was President. He had the Senate, he had the House, and still couldn't get things done. Because there's two parties, a Socialist Party hiding in the Democratic Party, which is growing bigger and then you have the extreme ones that want us all to go ride cows off to lava pits.

And then once you do, we take it; if you won't let us take it, you get arrested, and no, you can't know what it's for just because it's your money doesn't make it your business.

It's all about what the special interest groups and the war machine wants because people in power like staying in power. I really hate this narrative that the left pushes that if I want small government, I don't want huge taxes. That means I want people to be sick, and I want people to be poor.

As of today, there have been 38,160 cases of COVID-19 in Oregon, with 390 new cases being reported today. Sadly, we are also reporting three deaths today, bringing the statewide total for COVID-19 related deaths to 608."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "That was terrifying. It turns out the clown costume was part of a discussion on celebrating Halloween safely during the pandemic -- they should have told us -- but that only sort of became clearer when she passed it off to her colleague."

      "utterance": "That's an adorable onesie. I was wondering where I left it. Anyway, they went on for a bit before the doctor finally acknowledged the clown get up. Now, as Oregon proceeds to become the most pathetically run state in American history, I'm thinking this doesn't do much to restore its reputation. It seems like the adults have left the building. Does that make sense, Mr. Antelope?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, it did make sense. Kat, I think -- okay, before we completely criticize this strange thing. In their defense, they did a better job of conveying the strange that David Lynch or John Waters ever could. I mean, that's 10 times worse than Pink Flamingos or scarier than Pink Flamingos."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",

Now, you are the face of a really, really bad production of, hey, this is going to be great. This is going to wow them. Here's the thing. If you're going to do things like this, run it by someone first. I'm willing to bet that this just came up like, hey, I've got a great idea. You know what else is a great idea? Sending a candy gram when you want to get a divorce. That's always fun."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "No, it does not. And you've got to remember, you know, angry leftists play the long game and so the idea of putting on a costume to terrify children is perfectly within their sort of means of operation. But all 2020, this entire year I've been convinced that it's entirely possible that we're actually in a horror film, and we don't know it and we're just it's just -- every chapter of it, it gets worse and worse and worse. And when I look at that clip, I'm like, okay, I'm not wondering anymore if we're in a horror movie. It's definitely a horror movie."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "They'll keep their distance if you aren't part of the resistance. This week, the Girl Scouts tweeted congrats to Amy Coney Barrett for becoming just the fifth woman ever to be appointed to the Supreme Court. Angry lefties had a meltdown over it, including some so outraged they vowed to never eat Thin Mints again. That's probably good. So the Girl Scout told them to piss off losers. Not really. They caved, deleted the post explaining, \"Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. is a nonpolitical, nonpartisan organization.\" Not true. \"We are neither red nor blue, but Girl Scout green. We are here to lift up girls and women.\" So they removed a tweet because they say they are nonpartisan. But isn't deleting it kind of partisan and really weak? Which is why I'm no longer going as a Girl Scout for Halloween. Although I looked great in that outfit. I put it together myself. All right, Kat, is this another example of how the woke won't take yes for an answer. The national organization, you know, echoes left-wing platitudes all the time and yet what's so -- so what happens is they get devoured by the woke-a-dile."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right, especially because there couldn't have been anything less political than that original tweet. I don't know if everybody else noticed. It wasn't just Amy Coney Barrett on that graphic. It was everyone who is or ever has been a Supreme Court justice who was a woman. And then they're saying, they are deleting it because they're not political? I didn't know you could do that. I didn't know you could do something and then say the reason you're doing it because you don't want to do that. I'm going to go home, right? I'm going to take like 10 shots of tequila to the face. And Cam is going to be like, what are you doing? I'm going to be like, well, I really recognize the importance of a sober mind and I think alcohol is poison."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Very good. Tyrus, it sucks to be a kid these days, right? Like -- would stripping them of their genders, their heroes, their organizations, their costumes, their schools -- I mean, this has got to be the worst time to be a young human being."

    {
      "speaker": "MURDOCH",
      "utterance": "Not my house, bro. My kids love life. I entertain them constantly. I mean, it's cool when your dad is a six eight monster who is extremely intelligent. So I don't know what you talking about. It's a regular plethora or a cornucopia of fun in my house. You know what makes me sad though, because I kind of wish the Girl Scouts were all my daughters, which is not impossible. But what I would have liked to do is for me to stand up to them and say, go to hell away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURDOCH",
      "utterance": "But here is the problem. I understand why I hate the fact that the Girl Scouts deleted it. But I understand why they did. They don't want the Girl Scouts cancelled. They don't want protests outside. They don't want little girls going to the doorsteps and trying to sell their cookies, which are phenomenal and have a have a bunch of grown adults screaming at them, calling them names. So I think it was unfortunately -- it was the better side of do we really want this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MURDOCH",
      "utterance": "Because they don't play by the same rules everyone else does and they have convinced the world that their little 10 percent of 10 percent on Twitter matters. So that's the sad part, because it wouldn't have just stopped. There could have been little girls crying, and someone telling them, I'm not buying your box of mints because you support the Supreme Court and she's like, I'm six, bruh. You know what I'm saying, like -- so, bring those minutes over here. They're good over here. The mints the best."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, Charlie, I'll tell you this, Tyrus doesn't mince words, because he is making a very important point, and that is if companies actually stopped taking this subgroup of a subgroup of a subgroup of a subgroup seriously, and we've decided to share the risk, you wouldn't to run away from this stuff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think isn't that the lesson that we've learned? You can't give into these people because they never stop. They keep coming at you. If it's not this, it's the next thing. And the only thing you can do is just -- you can't give in and then -- you know, that's why I think that I really do honestly believe that if President Trump manages to pull this thing out and win re-election, it will break more of them and it will be America not giving in to exactly this kind of madness, this kind of temper tantrum."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You know, Walter, could this girl scouts story be a lesson for all corporations. Don't bother trying to falsify your preferences. Just tell them to screw it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRN",
      "utterance": "Well, like Tyrus said, Girl Scouts are especially vulnerable sales people. A lot of them are under four feet tall, many under 50 pounds."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRN",
      "utterance": "And putting them out there on the front lines of the Woke Wars was probably not a good idea in the first place. I think the Girl Scouts should just probably shut out everything except cookies from now on. These poor kids don't deserve to be in the middle of this world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, basically what you're saying is shut up and bake. And that is so sexist, Walter, and I'm not even going to let you respond, because that's what we do in cable news. Final Thoughts next."
