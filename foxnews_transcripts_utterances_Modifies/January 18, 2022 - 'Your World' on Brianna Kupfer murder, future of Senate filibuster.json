Within hours of arriving there, she had been stabbed to death by a man the police say they believe is homeless. He had walked into the front of the store, was there for a couple of minutes, according to the police chief, attacked Kupfer, and then calmly walked away through a back alley.

Now, what they're looking at, Charles, is his clothes that he was wearing. As you can see, he had all black come on, and was pretty well-camouflaged. But there are other videos of him being in other stores in that area that they are also looking at. They're looking at the manner in which he walked.

Of course, this is not the first time that the NBA has been wrapped up in controversy regarding the Communist Party of China. The league has famously tiptoed around comments made by its players and executives supporting Chinese dissidents, like the Uyghurs and the Hong Kong protesters. The NBA has a huge foothold in China. Remember that. Basketball is extremely popular there, and the league has a large monetary incentive to keep the CCP happy. Now, think of this. The CCTV there has banned NBA games from its air, costing the NBA roughly $400 million. Now, there's a statement from the Golden Warriors distancing itself from its minority owner, who owns about a 10 percent stake, but choosing not to acknowledge the root of the controversy, saying -- quote -- \"As a limited investor who has no day-to-day operating functions with the Warriors, Mr. Palihapitiya does not speak on our behalf -- on behalf of our franchise,\" rather. Now, someone who did take it head on was Enes Kanter Freedom of the Boston Celtics, a human rights advocate himself, an outspoken critic of the CCP. He offered this scathing tweet. He said: \"When genocides happen, is it people like this that let it happen?\" So, of course, there is a debate here, right? You're going to have some who are going to call China and Xi Jinping out, and you're going to have others who are going to put profits over morality.

You had the tech heavy Nasdaq now down roughly 10 percent from recent peaks, which is what we call a correction in investing. And the reason? Well, concerns that the Federal Reserve and the Central Bank might be behind when it comes to reining in sky-high inflation. So Wall Street now expects the Fed to raise interest rates four times this year, which then spiked up 10-year Treasury yields to the highest in two years. Now, Treasury yields are indicative of where traders expect interest rates to go, which is clearly up this year. But when Treasury yields go higher, that also means that Wall Street has to sell out of stocks in order to chase more guaranteed money on government bonds. So, that selling more pronounced when it comes to expensive technology names that have run up so much over the past two years, Apple, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, they were down sharply in the session today. And as for banks, which actually usually do go up when interest rates are forecast to go higher, since banks make more money off their loans, but Goldman Sachs had its worst day in almost two years after a disappointing report card. Now, there was one bright spot. You had oil stocks, with oil prices hitting their highest in seven years, and U.S. gas prices are on track to hit four bucks a gallon by Memorial Day, according to GasBuddy. Now, to try and bring down oil prices, you had the Department of Energy releasing another 400,000 barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

And, finally, a big shock to Wall Street and big bets on the virtual reality future the metaverse, with Microsoft this morning bidding $68 billion to buy \"Call of Duty\" and \"Candy Crush' maker Activision Blizzard. You had Activision spiking almost 40 percent at its peaks on the back of this news. And virtual worlds like in the movie \"Avatar\" or \"Ready Player One\" seems to be a big future bet for a lot of companies. I hope you're excited, Charles.",

But if you are traveling to Hawaii, be advised that the state is considering adding a booster requirement to its already stringent travel guidelines. The state's Safe Travels program already requires incoming travelers to be fully vaccinated or to quarantine for five days. In an interview with The Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Governor David Ige said, if he decides to announce a booster requirement, it will come with a grace period of at least two weeks to allow visitors and returning residents time to get their vaccinations up to date. While existing vaccines are still reducing hospitalizations and deaths, researchers are looking for ways to stop transmission altogether. A preliminary study out of Israel found that a fourth vaccine dose does not appear to produce enough antibodies to stop Omicron infections, however. The CEO of Moderna says he expects to begin clinical trials in the coming weeks of vaccines specifically targeting Omicron and have data to share with regulators as early as March. Separately, he says, in late 2023, a vaccine could become available that would combine in a single shot a COVID booster protection against seasonal flu and protection against another common respiratory virus called RSV.",

And you get this message popping up that says that the first orders are going to go out in late January, and then you have this long shipping timeline. It's expected to take anywhere between seven to 12 days. So, critics are saying that, yes, this is great effort, but now this effort might come at after the peak of Omicron and have sort of a blunted effect. We also are hearing more about the White House plan to make masks available, N95 masks available. The president said last week that's another thing that Americans need to have better access to. We are awaiting an announcement on that. But, again, we are almost three years into this pandemic.

Here in the United States, the major airlines have put pressure on the telecom industry, as well as government officials, saying that the rollout of 5G could create chaos for fliers. And it seemed that pressure worked, because AT&T and Verizon now say they will delay turning on some towers around certain airport runways. AT&T tells us: \"We're frustrated by the FAA's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services. And we urge it to do so in a timely manner.\" So, instead, Verizon and AT&T will both launch towers everywhere else as planned, with the exception of that limited number of towers around airports. The airlines say 5G signal could interfere with critical safety instruments on planes, leading to mass cancellations of passenger and cargo flights. President Biden says that: \"This agreement from the cell providers will avoid potentially devastating disruptions to passenger travel, cargo operations and our economic recovery, while allowing more than 90 percent of wireless tower deployment to occur as scheduled.\" So, Charles, it sounds like the worst of the fears from the 5G rollout from the airline CEOs have been avoided, but we will see what happens when the rollout officially commences tomorrow.",

Of course, this is not the first time that the NBA has been wrapped up in controversy regarding the Communist Party of China. The league has famously tiptoed around comments made by its players and executives supporting Chinese dissidents, like the Uyghurs and the Hong Kong protesters. The NBA has a huge foothold in China. Remember that. Basketball is extremely popular there, and the league has a large monetary incentive to keep the CCP happy. Now, think of this. The CCTV there has banned NBA games from its air, costing the NBA roughly $400 million. Now, there's a statement from the Golden Warriors distancing itself from its minority owner, who owns about a 10 percent stake, but choosing not to acknowledge the root of the controversy, saying -- quote -- \"As a limited investor who has no day-to-day operating functions with the Warriors, Mr. Palihapitiya does not speak on our behalf -- on behalf of our franchise,\" rather. Now, someone who did take it head on was Enes Kanter Freedom of the Boston Celtics, a human rights advocate himself, an outspoken critic of the CCP. He offered this scathing tweet."

We have yet to hear from him. Gordon, it's -- there's -- it's not just, of course, the NBA. I always say we're missing something big when we don't bring Nike into this conversation as well. China is their fastest growing market. They spend millions and millions of dollars on NBA, NBA promotions. So it's sort of that trifecta, these billionaire owners, these millionaire basketball players, and these large corporations, but that was one of the most callous statements I have ever heard. GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Yes, Palihapitiya, in his walking back on Twitter, said, well, this may have shown a lack of empathy. But what it really showed was a lack of humanity. And it's incomprehensible, Charles, because he comes from a family that left a country, Sri Lanka, where there was ethnic cleansing and genocide. And for him to say that about the genocide of the Uyghurs and the Kazakhs, it is just unspeakable."

Do you expect anymore, anything else to come out of this? A lot of people today are saying, hey, he's a billionaire. The NBA has become Teflon. They're able to have the double standards. They can speak out in this country. You have someone like Steph Curry, who's very outspoken, very much a Democrat, wears it proudly, does promotions even for the Civil Rights Act. Will they come out on behalf of these people, this minority religious group that are being -- that are being thrown in reeducation camps and treated horribly?"

      "utterance": "Well, I don't think that there will be a change of heart until the NBA starts to lose money in China. Remember, China has a debt crisis. It has an economy which is probably not growing at the 8.1 percent pace that they claimed for last year. So I think that we're going to see a real change in attitudes on China when the Chinese economy fails to give people what they want."

And then that so-called apology was just really added just more pain to the whole statement. We will see you soon, my friend. All right, meanwhile, folks read them and weep, stocks selling off again today. Worries have intensified over rate hikes. In fact, maybe a more aggressive Federal Reserve. I'm going to go to FOX Business' Susan Li, who's keeping track of all of it -- Susan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, so a rough start to a holiday- shortened week for U.S. stock markets. You had the tech heavy Nasdaq now down roughly 10 percent from recent peaks, which is what we call a correction in investing. And the reason? Well, concerns that the Federal Reserve and the Central Bank might be behind when it comes to reining in sky-high inflation. So Wall Street now expects the Fed to raise interest rates four times this year, which then spiked up 10-year Treasury yields to the highest in two years. Now, Treasury yields are indicative of where traders expect interest rates to go, which is clearly up this year. But when Treasury yields go higher, that also means that Wall Street has to sell out of stocks in order to chase more guaranteed money on government bonds. So, that selling more pronounced when it comes to expensive technology names that have run up so much over the past two years, Apple, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, they were down sharply in the session today. And as for banks, which actually usually do go up when interest rates are forecast to go higher, since banks make more money off their loans, but Goldman Sachs had its worst day in almost two years after a disappointing report card. Now, there was one bright spot. You had oil stocks, with oil prices hitting their highest in seven years, and U.S. gas prices are on track to hit four bucks a gallon by Memorial Day, according to GasBuddy. Now, to try and bring down oil prices, you had the Department of Energy releasing another 400,000 barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Doesn't seem to be having much impact, though, on oil prices. And, finally, a big shock to Wall Street and big bets on the virtual reality future the metaverse, with Microsoft this morning bidding $68 billion to buy \"Call of Duty\" and \"Candy Crush' maker Activision Blizzard. You had Activision spiking almost 40 percent at its peaks on the back of this news. And virtual worlds like in the movie \"Avatar\" or \"Ready Player One\" seems to be a big future bet for a lot of companies. I hope you're excited, Charles."

But if you are traveling to Hawaii, be advised that the state is considering adding a booster requirement to its already stringent travel guidelines. The state's Safe Travels program already requires incoming travelers to be fully vaccinated or to quarantine for five days. In an interview with The Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Governor David Ige said, if he decides to announce a booster requirement, it will come with a grace period of at least two weeks to allow visitors and returning residents time to get their vaccinations up to date. While existing vaccines are still reducing hospitalizations and deaths, researchers are looking for ways to stop transmission altogether. A preliminary study out of Israel found that a fourth vaccine dose does not appear to produce enough antibodies to stop Omicron infections, however. The CEO of Moderna says he expects to begin clinical trials in the coming weeks of vaccines specifically targeting Omicron and have data to share with regulators as early as March. Separately, he says, in late 2023, a vaccine could become available that would combine in a single shot a COVID booster protection against seasonal flu and protection against another common respiratory virus called RSV."

    {
      "speaker": "JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, Charles, I actually tried that beta-tested Web site myself, as Jonathan was mentioning. COVIDtests.gov went live today in its beta form, the White House saying that it will go fully live tomorrow, and directing people to really use it tomorrow, which was the expected launch date, where you can get four tests per household, per residential address. But there is one drawback to this. I tested it out, put in my order. And you get this message popping up that says that the first orders are going to go out in late January, and then you have this long shipping timeline. It's expected to take anywhere between seven to 12 days. So, critics are saying that, yes, this is great effort, but now this effort might come at after the peak of Omicron and have sort of a blunted effect. We also are hearing more about the White House plan to make masks available, N95 masks available. The president said last week that's another thing that Americans need to have better access to. We are awaiting an announcement on that. But, again, we are almost three years into this pandemic. And the president has talked about the need to expand access for testing, the need to have people masking up for his entire administration. So these efforts, to critics, are coming too little, too late -- Charles."

Here in the United States, the major airlines have put pressure on the telecom industry, as well as government officials, saying that the rollout of 5G could create chaos for fliers. And it seemed that pressure worked, because AT&T and Verizon now say they will delay turning on some towers around certain airport runways. AT&T tells us: \"We're frustrated by the FAA's inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services. And we urge it to do so in a timely manner.\" So, instead, Verizon and AT&T will both launch towers everywhere else as planned, with the exception of that limited number of towers around airports. The airlines say 5G signal could interfere with critical safety instruments on planes, leading to mass cancellations of passenger and cargo flights."

So, let's see that -- let's see up this segment with that and RealClearPolitics founder Tom Bevan. Tom, if that's the case, it seems really clumsy, the handling, for instance, still trying to push through the Civil Rights Act, still trying to push through the filibuster. What else is on the agenda?"

And so they shifted gears on voting rights legislation, which, again, is an issue that a lot of Americans is not top of mind. It's inflation and it's COVID. It's not voting rights. And so, and on top of that, Charles, it's a strategy that was doomed to fail from the beginning. They know that they don't have the votes to get it done. So it's a dead end for them politically. And there is no plan C, there is nothing to shift to that they can get done. There's some talk now about breaking up Build Back Better into small pieces and trying to pass those. That seems to be the only option left for Democrats at this point in time."

And they could have worked around what he did say was acceptable. I mean, obviously, this would have turned into the Manchin bill. But I think, if you added up the numbers, it would have been another $900 billion package. And so this sort of tug of war and this attempt to publicly humiliate him and Senator Sinema has really been a huge mistake in my mind."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "I agree. And, look, I think part of the strategy here for Democrats is to try and reinvigorate the base of the party because it's an election year, and because they have been dispirited sort of watching Democrats fumble about and the disunity within the caucus, their inability to get anything done for the past few months. And so this is intended to sort of energize them and galvanize them for the coming midterms."

One was to unite the country, and the other was to get control of COVID. And, clearly, COVID is continuing to be a problem for the administration. But -- and some of that stuff is out of the control of the administration. But in terms of uniting the country, at every opportunity, this president has chosen the confrontational path, the one that causes division, as opposed to the one that can unite the country, whether it is on COVID and vaccine mandates or on other pieces of legislation like Build Back Better."
