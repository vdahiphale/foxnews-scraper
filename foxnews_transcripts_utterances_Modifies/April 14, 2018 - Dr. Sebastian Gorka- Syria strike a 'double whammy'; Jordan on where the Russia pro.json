Because if they used information paid for by Hillary and the DNC, manufactured in order to hurt Donald Trump, in order then to go and use the power of the Federal government to stomp all over him, then the very heart of our great Republic is at stake, and that's why this is not a small thing. I think James Comey has got a lot more to answer for. I thought Nate Silver, the New York Times analyst had the best line. He said, \"This book should not have been called a \"Higher Royalty,\" it should have been called a \"Higher Royalty.\" Because it was all about James Comey getting the most of amount of money he could and cashing in on his 15 minutes of fame.",

It has to be substantiated and corroborated, so I mean, I can't even believe this guy actually was the FBI Director because he doesn't seem to have a firm grip on things. I want to play some sound for you because it goes to the point of what the president right now is dealing with. Not only is he dealing with these tawdry books, not only is he dealing with a runaway special counsel investigation, he is dealing with a press corps that is so utterly ridiculous and we put together a montage of some questions that Sarah Huckabee and some others have had to field, roll it.",

Joining me, former Deputy Assistant to the president and Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka. So, Dr. Gorka, we had a lot of Navy assets in the region and it looked like we used over a hundred tomahawk missiles, double what we used last year from cruisers, destroyer, submarines, even the B-1 bombers got involved.

Those targets were destroyed and there was nary an effective response and the Russians that have been rattling their rusty saber for so long did nothing, so I think this was a double whammy, Jesse. Not only did we deal a significant blow to Assad's capacity to use chemical weapons. Again, in one night in just a period of less than an hour, we did more for Russia's reputation than the last 15 months of sanctions."

And if you are a subsidiary of Russia, if you are Iran, if you are Syria, that can't make you feel too good when big brother after talking all that game doesn't help you out when things get messy. So, let me ask you, Hezbollah, I was hearing things that some missiles might have struck some Hezbollah site in southern Syria. How do you think the Iranians and Hezbollah take this strike?"

You've got Russia that has issues in terms of it's no longer the Soviet Union. Vladimir Putin said the biggest catastrophe of the 20th Century was the fall of the Soviet Union. So, they have kind of emotional issues, but they are irrational actors at the end of the day. Iran, not so much. You have got a theocracy there run by mullahs and some of them believe in the occultation of the hidden Imam and the apocalypse could be just around the corner. So, I think the cooler heads in the Republican guard, the IRGC, the cooler heads in Tehran are saying, \"This did not go well for us. Maybe we need to reassess our internal red lines on how far we sponsor Assad.\" But you never know with the mullahs, Jesse.

But let's get back to the strikes here because we don't want to see this happen again. We don't want to have to keep doing this year after year after year.

You persuade the evildoer not to do it again, but this was a degradation strike. I mean, they were hitting research and development facilities, chemical and biological warfare. Technology, airfields for the delivery. This seems pretty significant. Was that your takeaway?"

We hit the weapons storage facility and the manufacturing one. That's the whole circle of chemical weapons, research, production and storage. So, it's a death blow to this capacity, and it would take a long time and some significant expenditure by Sssad to build that capacity again.

Pretty close to the election, remember, they found a bunch of stuff on the laptop of Anthony Weiner. He says this, \"It is entirely possible that because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinton was sure to be the next president,\" sure to be the next president. \"My concern about making her an illegitimate president by concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all the polls, but I don't know.\" What that tells me is he is a political animal here."

I said he was wrong from the get-go. He was wrong in July when he went and did his big press conference and said they weren't going to bring charges against her. He was wrong in October when he reopened the case. He was wrong completely through this and I took some heat from some Republicans when I said that in October. But the only reason he did it is because he thought she was going to win, and his statement just confirms that."

All right, Governor, I mean, come on. This guy, if you read the excerpts that have been released, lavishing praise on Loretta Lynch, lavishing praise on Barack Obama and lavishing praise on his chief of staff. I mean, he has destroyed his credibility. The guy is obviously has got a big ax to grind and he's completely biased against the president. I think he discredits himself more with this book.

He continued to work for this president. He had no problems up until the point that he got shown the door.

You know, this is supposed to be a real straight shooter and an honorable man, but he's not being straightforward and honest with people, if it's Loretta Lynch, if it's President Trump. He runs and writes something, and now he's trying to cash in on his little notebook. I want to read another excerpt. I mean, this is about the dossier and he says, \"Can you imagine me, hookers?\" President Trump saying that to James Comey. And then he goes, Comey says, \"Hhe has a beautiful wife and the whole thing has been very painful to her.\" So, you know, Trump does not need to pay for that. I don't believe, I don't think anybody believes that, but Comey seems to be opening the door for the fact that it actually occurred."

It was manufactured and then it was used as the basis to get a FISA warrant. That's what makes this whole circus so very frustrating, and I think it puts frankly, the entire Justice Department in a very bad light. Because if they used information paid for by Hillary and the DNC, manufactured in order to hurt Donald Trump, in order then to go and use the power of the Federal government to stomp all over him, then the very heart of our great Republic is at stake, and that's why this is not a small thing. I think James Comey has got a lot more to answer for. I thought Nate Silver, the New York Times analyst had the best line. He said, \"This book should not have been called a \"Higher Royalty,\" it should have been called a \"Higher Royalty.\" Because it was all about James Comey getting the most of amount of money he could and cashing in on his 15 minutes of fame."

Now, I think he sunk his own case because he's admitting in the book that the dossier was unverified and he still has no idea if it's true or not and you are not allowed to submit anything like that to a FISA court. It has to be substantiated and corroborated, so I mean, I can't even believe this guy actually was the FBI Director because he doesn't seem to have a firm grip on things. I want to play some sound for you because it goes to the point of what the president right now is dealing with. Not only is he dealing with these tawdry books, not only is he dealing with a runaway special counsel investigation, he is dealing with a press corps that is so utterly ridiculous and we put together a montage of some questions that Sarah Huckabee and some others have had to field, roll it."
