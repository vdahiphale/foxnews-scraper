He says most people infected are getting better. We have new information tonight about potential treatments for COVID-19. We will talk live with the president's coronavirus response coordinator, a bit later. Dr. Deborah Birx, says, of all the Americans who have taken the test so far, only 10 to 11 percent are showing positive results for the virus. We'll dig into that.  With more Americans being tested, the infection numbers are soaring as expected. More than 11,000 cases are confirmed in this country now, 157 deaths. Italy has now surpassed China as the country with the most fatalities from the coronavirus with more than 3,400.  The original epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, China recorded no new infections for the first day since the crisis began. Now that is according to Chinese officials.  Here in the U.S., the State Department is now advising Americans to avoid international travel altogether. We have new information about the proposed cash payments to citizens as part of a stimulus package from Capitol Hill. A short time ago, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced his plan in the Senate. We'll have details in a moment.  The Pentagon is pausing movements of any new troops into Afghanistan and is quarantining 1,500 service members who recently arrived to avoid the spread of disease. Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott has issued an executive order that forces bars, restaurants, gyms, and schools to close until April 1st.  ESPN reports tonight, New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton is the first member of the NFL community to test positive. And Prince Albert II of Monaco, the son of the late American actress Grace Kelly has also tested positive tonight.   Chief White House correspondent John Roberts, starts us off tonight live in the North Lawn. Good evening, John.",

Emergency responders initially could not locate the crash site and they eventually had to use all-terrain vehicles to navigate the difficult terrain and reach that scene. Fox two in St. Louis has two people are rushed to a local hospital following a fire at a 10 story apartment building last night. The fire chief says, when crews arrived at the scene, they found the occupants, a man, and woman, had been pulled from their fourth-floor apartment by their neighbors. 90 of the 140 apartments in the building had to be checked. Everyone was safely evacuated. And Fox 26 in Houston as a man dies by apparent suicide at one of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's family detention centers. A legal group says that it represented the man announced the death. It's the ninth to occur in ice custody since the start of the government's fiscal year in October.

We know what to do now to stop the spread of the virus. I think, are we as an American people, as a community of individuals who care for each other willing to make this personal sacrifice to change this course of the virus? So, it's not 25 million infected. It's not 5 million infected, but maybe 50,000 to 150,000 infected? That's the possibility that we hold in our hands."

So, we started planning and working from day one. We've screened a lot of compounds, chloroquine did show promise overseas. I think the FDA has joined forces and eliminating red tape to ensure that, that product could be available to physicians to subscribe -- to prescribe to their patients.

That doesn't mean they don't get seriously ill, but they have done well. The data that we have right now, for individuals between 20 and 54 is so limited, it was grouped together to say 40 percent. But if you look between 20 and 44, it's 20 percent. So, then you have to ask yourself, how many people are really between 20 and 30? And these are -- this is why it's so important to have case reporting. And we're really asking for every hospital to bring those data together so we can study them as one group of Americans to really understand how this virus is interacting with American individuals."

What we found reassuring that is in general, children under 19 have done very well. What do I mean by that? They recover. And I think that's what every mother wants to hear.

So, with the airport closures to both China and then Europe, we prevented what we would call a lot of seeding of new cases in the United States. Remember, three or four months ago, there -- this virus was not in America. So, it's come to the American shores. So, decreasing the travel and preventing those travelers from bringing in more virus was critical. But once you could see how in Europe, the virus was dramatically expanding and really is concerned of the elderly and the particularly vulnerable groups, and that higher mortality, the higher deaths among those with pre- existing conditions.

Emergency responders initially could not locate the crash site and they eventually had to use all-terrain vehicles to navigate the difficult terrain and reach that scene. Fox two in St. Louis has two people are rushed to a local hospital following a fire at a 10 story apartment building last night. The fire chief says, when crews arrived at the scene, they found the occupants, a man, and woman, had been pulled from their fourth-floor apartment by their neighbors. 90 of the 140 apartments in the building had to be checked. Everyone was safely evacuated. And Fox 26 in Houston as a man dies by apparent suicide at one of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's family detention centers. A legal group says that it represented the man announced the death. It's the ninth to occur in ice custody since the start of the government's fiscal year in October.

Now, it can live in the air for a few hours. So if you are out and about in the wind and you were around someone that was just coughing and sneezing, it is possible for you to pick it up. It can also live on surfaces up to about a few hours to a few days. So that is a possibility. So the key is, if you are outside doing whatever activity you are engaging in, that's fine.

Kids deal with uncertainty when they are awaiting to find out what score they got on a test, or whether they made a sports team. Those are smaller uncertainties and this is a bigger uncertainty, but reminding children of the skills that they have can help them think about what abilities they have to manage this present situation and the present difficulties. It can also be helpful as a reminder to children that the things that they are doing and the changes that are happening in their routine and those disruptions, they are doing also not just for their health and the health and safety of their family, but also for the health and safety of their classmates, their friends, and their family.

Usually 60, 70 degrees we she that viruses usually will not survive, will be destroyed. So that is the hope and the prayer. But we don't know for sure. This is a new virus.

Are vapers considered to be patients with underlying health conditions? And if so, is there any evidence to support the virus is more deadly for these people?\""

      "utterance": "That's a great question. Being a vaper does not necessarily put you in high risk condition. Now, if you have COPD or heart failure or kidney disease and you vape, then yes, you are in a high-risk category. Vaping and smoking can cause irritation and inflammation in the lungs, and therefore make you more prone to infection. And you will have a longer healing process. There is no clear data that links vaping, smoking, and specifically coronavirus, but from past experience, we tend to see that those who smoke and vape usually have more difficulty with recovery and have respiratory distress if they smoke and vape and encounter a bacterial infection or a viral infection that tends to result in pneumonia."

      "utterance": "We really want our kids to receive their information from parents, so I would try to limit their exposure to news, what they are seeing, and to newspapers, and be as much as you can the source of the news for them. And then be ready to provide explanations for things like if they see people buying a lot of groceries hoarding, whatnot, you can people want to be prepared, and leave it at that. And ask them what questions they have, keep an open line of communication and let them know it is OK to come to you at any point with questions."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. And along with that is making sure that people are practicing good self-care. That is going to be really important in the long run, and many of us are really focused right now and distracted, understandably, with managing the crisis at hand. It's easy to overlook basic self-care things like getting good sleep, eating regular meals, staying hydrated. And those may sound like simple things, but when we don't sleep well and we don't eat well, our ability to think and make decisions and take care of our children also gets compromised. So when parents are well, they are in the best position to take care of their children. And we need to be thinking clearly to be able to solve the problems that we have right now."

      "utterance": "Ending with some breaking news, President Trump canceling the G7 meeting scheduled for June at Camp David. He canceled that for world leaders of the G7. Finally, tonight, some sunshine in the rain. I know it's a little cheesy, but we like to and on these stories. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Christ the Redeemer Statue lit up with flags and messages of hope in solidarity with countries affected by the coronavirus. The message, hashtag #praytogether was also projected onto the statue in different languages. Uber Eats in the U.S. announcing that it will waive delivery fees for independently owned restaurants. Local restaurants need business now more than ever, so order in if you can. The coronavirus, no match for a granddaughter's love. With the nursing home on lockdown, Carly Boyd stood outside her grandfather's window to show him that she was engaged, and he was happy for her. Yesterday, at Skillets Restaurant in Naples, Florida, a regular came in, a customer, with $10,000 cash, gave each of the 20 employees there $500. Just walked out. That's good news.
