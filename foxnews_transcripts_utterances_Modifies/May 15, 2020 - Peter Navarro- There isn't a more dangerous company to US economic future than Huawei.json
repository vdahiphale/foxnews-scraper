And President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democrat nominee are entering that ugly phase of the battle. And for Biden, that means that he is now under the hot lights for his role in the Obama administration, a role once thought to be his biggest asset. Now turns into sometimes a difficult line of questioning.",

Biden also, his name at least, is on one of the requests for unmasking. So, shortly after that came the potential crime because whoever leaked the contents of that transcript with Flynn's name to the press may have some music to face.  The President is pushing for President Obama to testify. So, we're going to talk about that. Will that go anywhere? Tonight, Trey Gowdy joins us with his take on that Oval Office knowledge by the President of what the FBI was doing at the time. And then White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro on the escalation by China against American companies. This is heating up pretty considerably. We're going to talk with him about where all that is heading.   Also, tonight, Susan Rice says that she is humbled to be on the VP's list for Joe Biden. We'll talk about that as well. But our top story begins tonight with former House Oversight Committee Chairman and Fox News Contributor Trey Gowdy, and what the Vice President knew, if anything, about the insurance policy that we've talked so much about.

The House is up and a third of the Senate is up. Let's don't fight publicly. Let's don't have these internecine battles five months before the general election. This is what I think you should do. First of all, get all the documents, get all the evidence, Martha. You referenced Susan Rice.  There's a part of that e-mail that no one's ever read because it's still classified. How about the Comey emails? How about any text with Andy McCabe and Jim Comey? So, there are a lot of documents that need to be declassified. And if I call President Obama, he would be the last witness because I don't like surprises. I mean, this is not a mystery. This is not entertainment. We are trying to persuade and communicate. You already know what Samantha Power and Susan Rice and McCabe and Comey and Brennan and Clapper, you already know what role they played. So, lay that out for the jury. And then I would call Biden before I call President Obama, because remember, President Trump was impeached for trying to investigate his political enemies. Well, maybe that's what Biden did. I mean, I don't know it, but if it's good for President Trump, wouldn't it be good for Biden? And wouldn't you want to know that?",

We know you asked to on unmask Michael Flynn's name. We know that. How many other unmasking requests did you make?

The response from the Biden camp to this reporting was swift. A top campaign official tweeted this. Catherine Herridge is a partisan Right-wing hack, who is a regular conduit for conservative media manipulation ploys because she agrees to publicize things before contacting the target to ask for comment.   That was followed by a story published by The Daily Beast today titled The New CBS Reporter is driving Democrats and some of her own colleagues crazy.

I've worked in the national security world for a long time and have followed her reporting and know it to be extremely reliable. I find it extremely ironic because every time President Trump has insulted or attacked a journalist popular among mainstream media outlets, they proclaim that the republic is coming to an end, that it's an assault on a free press. Every time he says something mean about Jim Acosta or tweet something about Chuck Todd or Wolf Blitzer and every reporter stepped forward to express their solidarity as though they've been shipped off to a gulag. And here we have the Biden campaign viciously attacking a reporter who really isn't as straight of the shooter as it gets. She doesn't really ever editorialize. She doesn't squabble with anybody. She just reports documents that are true. And barely anybody express solidarity with her.   In fact, as you mentioned, The Daily Beast followed in the footsteps of the Biden campaign by publishing a really nasty, vicious hit piece on her for the crime of just being slightly off key. And I think that's really the key here, Martha, is that for years, there has been no dissent and no questioning tolerated in the mainstream media when it comes to the Russia gate scandal, the Mueller probe. And she doesn't play that game. She reports objectively and so she questions and sometimes challenges the prevailing narrative, and that's why they want to punish her.",

I also find it interesting, you know, just picking apart the Biden team's response if, as they say, he had no role in any of this and that there, you know, and if as many others have said, there's nothing wrong, unmasking happens all the time. It's really the leak issue that is the problem. As an aside. But that the unmasking in and of itself is no big deal. Why would they get so vehemently ruffled up over this report at all?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's important to remember that over the last month, there has been a series of newly released documents that have been in strong tension with the conspiracy theories about Trump and Russia that have prevailed in the media world for three years now. And several of those scoops were imported by her. This is not the first. She reported, for example, previously unknown FISA documents that called into serious question, the veracity of the Steele dossier and what the CIA and the FBI knew about it and whether they were honest about what they were claiming.  So, what they're really angry about here is that she's been reporting over the last month a series of factual documents, authentic materials that negate what the media has been peddling about Russia gate for three years. And so, they're angry at her for that. But they also want to send a signal that as our industry of journalism experiencing severe layoffs, as people are losing their jobs, they want to create a climate where nobody can dissent from their ability to construct narratives without being stigmatized and ostracized, as the Biden campaign signaled to fellow journalists that they ought to do. And then they obeyed.  Or imagine if you're a young journalist and you see jobs disappearing, the last thing you want to do when you look at how they're treating her is step forward and question any of these kind of pieties or orthodoxies that the media is peddling. So, I think it's really an attempt by the Biden campaign to create a climate where nobody's allowed to be off note or off key.  I personally don't consider it an attack on a free press. If a politician insults me or criticizes me. The Obama campaign threatens to imprison me. The Bolsonaro government in Brazil did too for my journalism. That's an attack on a free press. I don't think insults are an attack on a free press, but they've created this standard that when Trump insults a journalist, we all have to band together in solidarity in order to defend a free press. Why is that standard being waived when the Biden campaign viciously attacks one of their colleagues? It really is a double standard that I think is incredibly ignoble and shows some pretty corrupted motives.",

It's like - it's like they're talking about bad stuff here. Like it's about this big compared to the pandemic that Chinese Communist Party has foisted on the world. They've already cost us $10 trillion in monetary and fiscal stimulus. They've killed over 80,000 Americans and over 100,000 people worldwide. So, when I think about an angry China guy talk about these kinds of retaliations, I think it's important to put it in this broader context of the biological Chernobyl they've unleashed on the world. And I think that's kind of what we should focus on. Martha, I know you saw that Pew Research poll last month, which was taken before the COVID crisis, which showed that over 90 percent of Americans now see China as a threat. Over 70 percent see it in unfavorable light. I think President Donald J. Trump, history will show that he basically led the sea change on that. I think what China is trying to do right now is hit the 100 percent mark in American public opinion on both of those things. I mean, what is this country doing, Martha.",

Biden also, his name at least, is on one of the requests for unmasking. So, shortly after that came the potential crime because whoever leaked the contents of that transcript with Flynn's name to the press may have some music to face. The President is pushing for President Obama to testify. So, we're going to talk about that. Will that go anywhere? Tonight, Trey Gowdy joins us with his take on that Oval Office knowledge by the President of what the FBI was doing at the time. And then White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro on the escalation by China against American companies. This is heating up pretty considerably. We're going to talk with him about where all that is heading. Also, tonight, Susan Rice says that she is humbled to be on the VP's list for Joe Biden. We'll talk about that as well.

So, I understand his frustration. I'll tell you what my advice. My other advice to Republicans would be, we're five months away from the general election. The House is up and a third of the Senate is up. Let's don't fight publicly. Let's don't have these internecine battles five months before the general election. This is what I think you should do. First of all, get all the documents, get all the evidence, Martha. You referenced Susan Rice. There's a part of that e-mail that no one's ever read because it's still classified. How about the Comey emails? How about any text with Andy McCabe and Jim Comey? So, there are a lot of documents that need to be declassified. And if I call President Obama, he would be the last witness because I don't like surprises. I mean, this is not a mystery. This is not entertainment. We are trying to persuade and communicate. You already know what Samantha Power and Susan Rice and McCabe and Comey and Brennan and Clapper, you already know what role they played. So, lay that out for the jury. And then I would call Biden before I call President Obama, because remember, President Trump was impeached for trying to investigate his political enemies. Well, maybe that's what Biden did. I mean, I don't know it, but if it's good for President Trump, wouldn't it be good for Biden? And wouldn't you want to know that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Here's a question. You know, with regard to the names on this unmasking list, it's my understanding that it may or may not mean much that some of those names are there because someone else asked them to, you know, put their name on the unmasking request and that perhaps, you know, the person who was behind most of the desire to unmask those, doesn't have their name on that list at all.

      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "It does not, I mean I heard that from the Samantha Power, I mean, you heard the number of unmasking, she requested what was so far outside the realm, and then she said she didn't know about most of them. But that's a problem, too, isn't it? If you give the power to someone to unmask and they're delegating that power to a cleric or a subordinate, this is the question for Joe Biden. We know you asked to on unmask Michael Flynn's name. We know that. How many other unmasking requests did you make? I mean, were you a serial unmasker while you were the Vice President or was this the only one? I can't answer that question, but I think it's really relevant."

And we know that because of something that the Attorney General said in an interview with Hugh Hewitt just a short while, just a short while back at the end of April. Watch this."

      "utterance": "Follow the evidence. I mean - that's why you put a career prosecutor, this apolitical like John Durham in that position, wherever the evidence takes. I mean, if Joe Biden didn't make the unmasking request and wasn't involved in any of the Flynn decisions, then so be it. But someone needs to tell us that he's certainly not immune from investigation. What I took that to mean is there's no evidentiary support for it yet. But I don't think Durham is through either. You won't know until you talk to the witnesses. I mean, that's kind of my point with the FBI. I mean, you don't know who leaked until you asked them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So, you know, obviously, Lindsey Graham is going to get some pushback from the President's supporters on this, because a lot of people look at these situations from the beginning and say, no one has actually been held accountable. It's an enormous source of frustration for a lot of the President's supporters in this country. And, you know, they've also pushed back on you about that with not subpoenaing, some of your colleagues have asked why you didn't subpoena more actively when you had the chance to do so. Do you have any regrets about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, look, Martha, I was part of the investigation from the moment I've got to Congress. I did volunteer for them. I was drafted for most of them. So, you and I could have an entire hour on the mistakes I made. I was not the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Devin Nunes was, and he did a phenomenal job. Bob Goodlatte was the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and when it kicked up to him, I think he did a phenomenal job. So, whoever thinks that I failed to issue subpoenas either doesn't understand the way Congress works or just wants to do a drive-by shooting. And I'm not running again.

But one other question for you, because I heard you talk about this in the back and forth. You talked about going to the FBI and getting assurances about certain things with regard to the Russian investigation and then learning a lot more in documents that you were able to see at the Department of Justice that changed your mind about what you had heard originally in that briefing. And I thought that that was interesting. And it makes me wonder when you look back at that discussion with Christopher Wray, do you think that he was misleading to you?"

    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, there's no question what Devin and I were told in the briefings did not match up with the documents. So, the mistake I made, which I will confess to, is believing the word of DOJ and FBI officials that came after Trump was elected. Let's be really clear about that. I wasn't in the room with Jim Comey and Peter Strzok, I was in the room with people that came after President Trump. I should have gotten the documents first. I'm glad I've got them three weeks later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, I did not pick him, I will tell you this. The FBI told us that nothing happened before a certain date. The Trump campaign was not the target. Donald Trump was not the target. You go and look at that origination, initiation report from Peter Strzok and it mentions Trump campaign. That's when my mind switched. When I looked at the documents, it did not match up with the briefing that Devin and Paul and I received. So as for Chris Wray, the President picked him."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Journalists are supposed to hunt down and report the truth regardless of what they find. That's what Catherine Herridge, our former colleague, now of CBS News did this week, breaking the release of the Michael Flynn unmasking list, revealing top Obama administration officials, including Joe Biden, who had requested there was a record for it that certain names be unmasked, Flynn, in this case. The response from the Biden camp to this reporting was swift. A top campaign official tweeted this. Catherine Herridge is a partisan Right-wing hack, who is a regular conduit for conservative media manipulation ploys because she agrees to publicize things before contacting the target to ask for comment. That was followed by a story published by The Daily Beast today titled The New CBS Reporter is driving Democrats and some of her own colleagues crazy. Here now, Glenn Greenwald, Pulitzer Prize-Winning journalist and Co- Founding Editor of The Intercept. Glenn, good to have you here tonight. What was your reaction when you saw that attack on Catherine Herridge for that reporting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENN GREENWALD, PULITZER PRIZE WINNING JOURNALIST",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I think Catherine Herridge is a reporter of the highest integrity and professionalism. I've met her. I've worked in the national security world for a long time and have followed her reporting and know it to be extremely reliable. I find it extremely ironic because every time President Trump has insulted or attacked a journalist popular among mainstream media outlets, they proclaim that the republic is coming to an end, that it's an assault on a free press. Every time he says something mean about Jim Acosta or tweet something about Chuck Todd or Wolf Blitzer and every reporter stepped forward to express their solidarity as though they've been shipped off to a gulag. And here we have the Biden campaign viciously attacking a reporter who really isn't as straight of the shooter as it gets. She doesn't really ever editorialize. She doesn't squabble with anybody. She just reports documents that are true. And barely anybody express solidarity with her. In fact, as you mentioned, The Daily Beast followed in the footsteps of the Biden campaign by publishing a really nasty, vicious hit piece on her for the crime of just being slightly off key. And I think that's really the key here, Martha, is that for years, there has been no dissent and no questioning tolerated in the mainstream media when it comes to the Russia gate scandal, the Mueller probe. And she doesn't play that game. She reports objectively and so she questions and sometimes challenges the prevailing narrative, and that's why they want to punish her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, I can be the second source on this because I worked with Catherine for many years as well and found her to be a person of very high integrity, very solid reporting with a tremendous work ethic. So, I would second everything that you're saying about Catherine Herridge, Glenn. I also find it interesting, you know, just picking apart the Biden team's response if, as they say, he had no role in any of this and that there, you know, and if as many others have said, there's nothing wrong, unmasking happens all the time. It's really the leak issue that is the problem. As an aside. But that the unmasking in and of itself is no big deal. Why would they get so vehemently ruffled up over this report at all?"
    },

      "speaker": "GREENWALD",

And several of those scoops were imported by her. This is not the first. She reported, for example, previously unknown FISA documents that called into serious question, the veracity of the Steele dossier and what the CIA and the FBI knew about it and whether they were honest about what they were claiming. So, what they're really angry about here is that she's been reporting over the last month a series of factual documents, authentic materials that negate what the media has been peddling about Russia gate for three years. And so, they're angry at her for that. But they also want to send a signal that as our industry of journalism experiencing severe layoffs, as people are losing their jobs, they want to create a climate where nobody can dissent from their ability to construct narratives without being stigmatized and ostracized, as the Biden campaign signaled to fellow journalists that they ought to do. And then they obeyed. Or imagine if you're a young journalist and you see jobs disappearing, the last thing you want to do when you look at how they're treating her is step forward and question any of these kind of pieties or orthodoxies that the media is peddling. So, I think it's really an attempt by the Biden campaign to create a climate where nobody's allowed to be off note or off key. I personally don't consider it an attack on a free press. If a politician insults me or criticizes me. The Obama campaign threatens to imprison me. The Bolsonaro government in Brazil did too for my journalism. That's an attack on a free press. I don't think insults are an attack on a free press, but they've created this standard that when Trump insults a journalist, we all have to band together in solidarity in order to defend a free press. Why is that standard being waived when the Biden campaign viciously attacks one of their colleagues? It really is a double standard that I think is incredibly ignoble and shows some pretty corrupted motives."

The idea that we would Huawei into our economy for 5G, that's going to be the Internet of things, all of things that are going to drive future growth and innovation. So, President Donald J.

I think it's - we generally ignore whatever happens in that paper or we prefer to look at the cables and the intelligence. But here's the thing, Martha. It's like - it's like they're talking about bad stuff here. Like it's about this big compared to the pandemic that Chinese Communist Party has foisted on the world. They've already cost us $10 trillion in monetary and fiscal stimulus. They've killed over 80,000 Americans and over 100,000 people worldwide. So, when I think about an angry China guy talk about these kinds of retaliations, I think it's important to put it in this broader context of the biological Chernobyl they've unleashed on the world. And I think that's kind of what we should focus on. Martha, I know you saw that Pew Research poll last month, which was taken before the COVID crisis, which showed that over 90 percent of Americans now see China as a threat. Over 70 percent see it in unfavorable light. I think President Donald J. Trump, history will show that he basically led the sea change on that. I think what China is trying to do right now is hit the 100 percent mark in American public opinion on both of those things. I mean, what is this country doing, Martha."

We've now got what appears to be credible intelligence that China after foisting this pandemic on the world is now trying to steal the intellectual property that we need to develop a vaccine. Now, I mean, in terms of the deal itself, that would be the most blatant violation of the phase one deal that you can imagine because it basically threatens the world. I mean, think about that.

And the change in policy and it's playing out before our eyes is at times, we have to confront China and we have to do it with our allies, and that's a completely different policy from the past, and that's all pre-pandemic. Post pandemic, there is -- there needs to be a comprehensive strategy in dealing with what China has done and holding them accountable not just for the origin and lack of transparency on the origin of human to human spread but actually growing a pandemic from an epidemic by permitting international flights out of the country.

I don't know really where Susan Rice falls when it comes to Medicare for all. I don't know where she falls when it comes to free college tuition and that is going to matter. Because we have to remember that in 2016, one out of 10 Bernie Sanders supporters actually supported Donald Trump and that's because they were not happy with Hillary Clinton and the policies that she was playing for that they did not feel moved too far to the left.

But look, she checks a lot of boxes that are important for Joe Biden because she, first of all, she is a black woman who has -- and he needs to energized the black --African-American vote and she's got serious foreign policy chops as a former U.N. ambassador and a national security advisor.

This is the most important pick that a vice presidential candidate has made because Joe Biden is the oldest person to ever run for president in American history. He will be older on the day he takes office if he wins, and Ronald Reagan was on the day he left office and he's incredibly fragile.

Those are going to be very important. Also, with Kamala Harris, she is 55 years old so she is younger and she has come out in support of those socialist ideas which, you know, are going to be very important again.

You know, if there one thing that I heard very loud and clear over the last several weeks from parents and from students is that they want to be back in the classroom. And I think that we have a plan to make that happen.

      "utterance": "Well, you know, clearly, it's something that we have in mind, that it is the possibility and we are actually planning for a potential short fall enrollment, that's a very natural thing to have planned at this point. Our decision though, I have to say is completely guided by our desire to provide the best possible education to our students. We are going to do what is safe. So, if they condition as such that that cannot be done then of course we are going to return to an online mode like we are doing now. But if there is -- the safety condition as of this time that we're going to be open because we think that that's the best education that we can offer our students."

      "utterance": "I know that some schools are considering canceling the fall break and maybe breaking a little bit sooner for Thanksgiving so that you don't have kids leaving, going back home, going on a trip somewhere and then coming back to campus. Is that something that you're considering?"

    {
      "speaker": "STRUPPA",
      "utterance": "Yes. That is a very intelligent idea. We don't know yet whether that's what we are going to do. But we are considering all kind of variations. We are considering the possibility, in fact, as you said, of closing the semester earlier. I think a decision of that magnitude we have can be done later where we are closer to the beginning of the semester and we have better understanding of where the epidemic goes. But we have several task forces working under my direction through all the possible contingency plan. So definitely that's a very, very reasonable thing to keep in mind, absolutely."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I think being reasonable is one of the best ways to look at this. Dr. Fauci obviously concerned about a second wave in the fall, what will you do if students start getting sick?"

    {
      "speaker": "STRUPPA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, again, the CDC hasn't issued some guidelines should that happen. Actually, they have specific guidelines for higher education and clearly, should we have cases of corona, we would have to make an assessment whether it's an isolated case or there is a potential outbreak and that might mean suspension of classes for few days or even longer suspension. So, all of those things are among the possibilities. And as I said before, it's really hard to make a precise prediction when we are three months away from the start of classes, and the pandemic is still hard of control."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I know a lot of students really want to go back and we certainly hope they can do it safely. Dr. Struppa, thank you very much. Chapman University, great school in California. Great to see you, sir. We'll be right back."

Maybe we should adjust faster, maybe we should adjust slower. But whatever the era, 20 -- whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change. Fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must come first. You must read to your children, and you must hug your children, and you must love your children. Your success as a family, our success as a society depends not on what happens in the White House, but on what happens inside your house."
