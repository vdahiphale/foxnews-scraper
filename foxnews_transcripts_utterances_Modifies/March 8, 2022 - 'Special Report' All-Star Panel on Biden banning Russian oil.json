Why he would prefer the oil out of -- from Maduro or Iran, Venezuela or Iran, over American oil I don't understand. And the claim that he did nothing to prevent the flow or inhibit the flow in production of oil is obviously false. So Bill Buckley used to say, it's not where a man says. It's where he puts his emphasis. And clearly the animus of this administration toward the oil companies is clear and present.",

These set of challenges in Ukraine have really triggered two things, in my mind. It has forced us in the west, and the U.S. as leading the effort, to set the tone for the struggle between autocracy and democracy in the 21st century. And a part of that, obviously, is energy. We have seen one of our great geopolitical foes weaponize energy. And we should not kid ourselves. The second half of the 21st century to 22nd century, no doubt clean and green energy will be integral parts of our energy mix and matrix. But at the time being, fossil fuels and oil and gas continue to not only be an important part of what we do here in America, but an important part for our NATO allies as well. We should do all of the above when it comes to energy and our security.",

And Joe Biden's answer to him is no. Not one -- to both answers. And the objection to -- what the Poles basically did is they called Biden's bluff. He was blaming Poland for the drag on this. They said, OK, we'll give you the planes and you send them over there. And the Biden administration turned it down. Their objections are absurd. First of all, as you pointed out earlier in the show, it makes no difference whether the plane takes off from a Polish NATO base or a German NATO base in terms of international law. And second, the Biden administration is providing Stinger missiles to Ukraine right now to shoot down Russian planes. Those aren't magically appearing by teleportation in Ukraine.
