It is the latest executive order that was passed in this state by Texas Governor Greg Abbott in recent weeks to help slow the community spread of COVID-19. The announcement also comes on the heels of yesterday's record- breaking number of hospitalizations in Texas. More than 7,300 patients diagnosed with coronavirus are now being treated at hospitals across the state, a figure that has doubled in just the last two weeks. Health officials all over the country have been expressing concern about this very holiday weekend, concerns that people would not heed the warnings about social distancing or gathering in large groups, particularly in states experiencing those surges.  A lot of public beaches have been closed in places like California, Florida, and also right here in South Texas, or at the very least access to those spots, including boat ramps and campgrounds, limited.",

Later this evening, we will have a fly pass by Air Force One, as the president comes in to land at nearby Ellsworth Air Force Base. Then Marine One will also fly past as he comes back to land right here. But this is not just about celebration tonight. Obviously, in these times, there is always politics with it. Part of the politics here, coronavirus. The governor of South Dakota said there is no social distancing required.  We can tell you that, having seen the chairs, they are not separated by a single inch. And some of the benches below me are also filling up now. I'd say, Neil, from my view, maybe 20, 30 percent of the people are wearing masks, but they are not required to. Officials are handing out masks if people want them, but by no means is it a requirement for attending this event. Then you mentioned the fireworks. They are -- there they were stopped after 2009, because the fireworks had caused nearby forest fires. The South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, said that -- when she took office, that she wanted to bring them back. President Trump enthusiastically endorsed that, saying, what's there to burn? It's just stone. Well, there's a lot of stone here. There's also a great deal of forest. So there are firefighting units on hand, strategically placed, should there be any issue with that. There's also the question of this land, Neil. And Sioux Tribe members plan to protest on the roads leading up to Mount Rushmore today, because they say this land is rightfully theirs and should be given back to them. Finally, Neil, we have the politics of President Trump's speech. We're going to get fireworks after that, literally. We may have figurative fireworks in the president's speech.  And to return to the theme of coronavirus, Neil, the stage behind me here has a couple of video screens on either side of it. They have been popping up warnings about dehydration, warnings about ticks being prevalent in the area, warnings about sunburn. One thing they haven't mentioned, coronavirus -- Neil.",

You have heard about this dust-up from those representing the Sioux Indians and other tribesmen, who say that this is a big mistake. They find that to be a black mark, that entire Mount Rushmore. You have written very eloquently about the experience when you visited there, I believe with your 2-year-old, many, many years ago, and then that there is a uniting factor to that.

But just about 12 miles away from this beautiful Mount Rushmore, where we have got the four guys up there, these guys that did so many great things for our country, there's also an entire mountain being carved, and that's Crazy Horse. And when the Lakota leaders saw what Gutzon Borglum could do, they asked one of the guys who was working there, a guy by name of Korczak Ziolkowski, if he would concern helping them to carve a mountain, because they wanted their leaders to be represented as well.  And so for folks that come to South Dakota, please, come see Mount Rushmore, learn the story of America through the eyes of the presidents, and then go on over and see an entire mountain being carved just 12 miles away of Crazy Horse. I think it's a fair and balanced approach. It's -- as I tell people, there's nothing wrong with diversity, and there's nothing wrong with celebrating diversity. So, for me, I love to come to the hills. I love to go see Crazy Horse, but Mount Rushmore is so special. And it brings -- it tells America that these four guys, these people who were not perfect, but they're the folks that represent the ideals that we strive for. And, as they said, they knew way back then it wasn't perfect, but they were striving to create a more perfect union. They put their lives on the line.

I believe the Black Hills region still technically is Native American land. So it's going to incite some old grievances. So do you think the president should be there to agitate that?

So it's going to be a much more dangerous city. And, of course, Mayor de Blasio, as usual, has supported the protesters, has not supported the police. And police, because of the things that are happening, like taking away qualified immunity from them, are not going to respond. They're going to respond when they see a crime happening in front of them, but they're not going to do anything assertive.

So, this acceleration continues. Nationally, much has been talked about the spike in cases. What doesn't get as much attention is the fact that, despite the 14-day moving average that shows cases increasing about 90 percent to 55,595, on a rolling basis, the fact of the matter is that new deaths are down 19 percent in that same period to 722, again, looking at a 14-day sort of a cycle here that kind of puts it in a little bit better perspective. Dr. Amesh Adalja joins us right now. Doctor, you're looking at this. And we have chatted about these sorts of trends. What do you make of that? I mean, more cases, more testing, this is what you get.

So you can't look at deaths now and cases now and say that there's kind of a mismatch. We have to look at deaths in the future, because we know that some of these cases are going to take time to get sick, especially when there's younger individuals. They have to actually then transmit it to a vulnerable person. That person has to get sick enough to need hospitalization, and then die. So I do think we will see some uptick in deaths, hopefully not as bad as what we saw early on in this pandemic, because we have got new tools, we have gotten better at dealing with these patients, understanding the complications and how to prevent them. But I do think that we are going to see more deaths occur. It's a simple biological fact.

We thought that there might be some suppression, especially with surface transmission, when it got hotter, when it got sunnier, when it got more humid, and the virus wouldn't be viable as long. But that doesn't really interfere with person-to-person transmission. And it's just that there's so many people susceptible, and so many people interacting, that we don't see that kind of seasonality that we see with other coronaviruses. And we may not see a trough. But I think, alternatively, we have to be prepared in the fall for this to accelerate, when environmental conditions change.

The announcement also comes on the heels of yesterday's record- breaking number of hospitalizations in Texas. More than 7,300 patients diagnosed with coronavirus are now being treated at hospitals across the state, a figure that has doubled in just the last two weeks. Health officials all over the country have been expressing concern about this very holiday weekend, concerns that people would not heed the warnings about social distancing or gathering in large groups, particularly in states experiencing those surges.

That's because it's closed, like many beaches throughout this state right now, as public officials are encouraging people to just stay home. And travel experts at AAA say many people are doing just that, trips this week and expected to be down 15 percent from last year, a drop-off for the first time since the great recession.

A number of beaches, including those around Miami-Dade, they will be closed.

He is the Hard Rock International chairman, Florida among one of his bigger operations, and, for the state of Florida, its biggest casino, period. Jim, good to have you back. What has been the impact on you guys, especially with the reimposition of some restrictions?   JIM ALLEN, CHAIRMAN, HARD ROCK INTERNATIONAL: Well, first of all, Neil, thanks for having me. Florida has been interesting. South Florida is definitely challenged. But our operation in Tampa, frankly, is doing pretty well. The hotel in Daytona has been a little soft, and Orlando overall is Extremely soft. But, yesterday, we opened Hard Rock Atlantic City, and, frankly, we saw them a little bit more volume than what we anticipated. So, each geographic area has its own unique set of circumstances."

But, clearly, if you want to entertain or have a meal in one of the inside gourmet rooms, that's just something that's not available. But there are no restrictions on food or beverage or alcohol in the hotel rooms themselves. And, candidly, occupancy has been extremely strong."

Casinos like yours come to mind. Are you seeing that, that a crowd that normally might be outside or looking to go to some of these other outdoor hot spots, and now can't, migrate to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALLEN",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, in Florida, no, we're not seeing that. But on -- in Atlantic City, there's always been this debate about the casinos that are in the Marina District having a little bit of an advantage because of the road accessibility. But, frankly, for the first time in probably over 25 years, it's actually an advantage to be on the boardwalk, because the guests can actually leave their facility, go outside, walk the boardwalk, enjoy all the other restaurants and activities that, frankly, just don't exist over in the Marina District. You're kind of landlocked there."

      "speaker": "ALLEN",
      "utterance": "You know, we started this back in, frankly, end of March looking at what our options were. We made the decision to first invest in technology. So, we went out and, frankly, led the industry here. For anyone that walks in the facility, you're automatically scanned through thermal imaging. Not only do we know your temperature, but we actually know who you are, because we can then tie back into many, many national databases. So, contact tracing is something, in conjunction with our surveillance equipment, that really creates a safe environment. Certainly, we're doing all the things like having one slot machine on and two off, putting the Plexiglas dividers between the gaming positions at all the casino tables, reducing the number of seats at the tables, and obviously revisiting all of our food and beverage menus and standing operating procedures, just to try to comply with what we think is something that is very important, the safety of our employees and our guests."

You got to remember, in a case like his, a big international casino operation, what works in one place doesn't necessarily work in the other. So, this holiday weekend, there are adjustments that people are making, but we have been through worse. We can get through this. That will be a big reminder for the president of the United States when he visits Mount Rushmore tonight, big fireworks display planned. Masks are being provided if they want them. There isn't really any social distancing going on there. But they have very low cases in South Dakota anyway. So the message from the governor, who is encouraging the president to do this, don't worry about it. More after this."

We have been talking about it, but this should be something to celebrate tonight, the president going into the iconic venue there at Mount Rushmore that honors four presidents. There could be protesters there. We already know there's an invited crowd of about 7,500 there, not necessarily honoring distancing provisions, but very much being offered on nasty each and all if they want to wear them. No one's going to force the issue. The president will be speaking there. There will be a fireworks display. That can be sometimes a little dicey there, but, again, they're taking precautions at it, I think the first time in a decade they're doing something like this. Jonathan Hunt is there right now with the very latest -- Jonathan."

      "utterance": "Neil, hard to think of a more spectacular way to kick off America's July 4 weekend here at the iconic Mount Rushmore. You can see it right behind me. Later this evening, we will have a fly pass by Air Force One, as the president comes in to land at nearby Ellsworth Air Force Base. Then Marine One will also fly past as he comes back to land right here. But this is not just about celebration tonight. Obviously, in these times, there is always politics with it. Part of the politics here, coronavirus. The governor of South Dakota said there is no social distancing required. We can tell you that, having seen the chairs, they are not separated by a single inch. And some of the benches below me are also filling up now. I'd say, Neil, from my view, maybe 20, 30 percent of the people are wearing masks, but they are not required to. Officials are handing out masks if people want them, but by no means is it a requirement for attending this event. Then you mentioned the fireworks. They are -- there they were stopped after 2009, because the fireworks had caused nearby forest fires. The South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, said that -- when she took office, that she wanted to bring them back. President Trump enthusiastically endorsed that, saying, what's there to burn? It's just stone. Well, there's a lot of stone here. There's also a great deal of forest. So there are firefighting units on hand, strategically placed, should there be any issue with that. There's also the question of this land, Neil. And Sioux Tribe members plan to protest on the roads leading up to Mount Rushmore today, because they say this land is rightfully theirs and should be given back to them. Finally, Neil, we have the politics of President Trump's speech. We're going to get fireworks after that, literally. We may have figurative fireworks in the president's speech. And to return to the theme of coronavirus, Neil, the stage behind me here has a couple of video screens on either side of it. They have been popping up warnings about dehydration, warnings about ticks being prevalent in the area, warnings about sunburn. One thing they haven't mentioned, coronavirus -- Neil."

I want to go to Senator Mike Rounds, the Republican senator from that beautiful state of South Dakota, who will be joining the president of the United States tonight. Senator, very good to have you. You have heard about this dust-up from those representing the Sioux Indians and other tribesmen, who say that this is a big mistake. They find that to be a black mark, that entire Mount Rushmore. You have written very eloquently about the experience when you visited there, I believe with your 2-year-old, many, many years ago, and then that there is a uniting factor to that. But some of these protesters and these Native American leaders, they don't think so. Could we have problems tonight?"

They're welcome to protest, as long as it's peaceful. And I believe that it will be. But just about 12 miles away from this beautiful Mount Rushmore, where we have got the four guys up there, these guys that did so many great things for our country, there's also an entire mountain being carved, and that's Crazy Horse. And when the Lakota leaders saw what Gutzon Borglum could do, they asked one of the guys who was working there, a guy by name of Korczak Ziolkowski, if he would concern helping them to carve a mountain, because they wanted their leaders to be represented as well. And so for folks that come to South Dakota, please, come see Mount Rushmore, learn the story of America through the eyes of the presidents, and then go on over and see an entire mountain being carved just 12 miles away of Crazy Horse. I think it's a fair and balanced approach. It's -- as I tell people, there's nothing wrong with diversity, and there's nothing wrong with celebrating diversity. So, for me, I love to come to the hills. I love to go see Crazy Horse, but Mount Rushmore is so special. And it brings -- it tells America that these four guys, these people who were not perfect, but they're the folks that represent the ideals that we strive for. And, as they said, they knew way back then it wasn't perfect, but they were striving to create a more perfect union. They put their lives on the line. Lincoln lost his life trying to make it even better."

You mentioned Crazy Horse and the dedication there, obviously, a great Sioux leader, spiritual leader, who was going after Americans at the time because they were taking the land that he believed belonged to all Native Americans. I believe the Black Hills region still technically is Native American land. So it's going to incite some old grievances. So do you think the president should be there to agitate that? I can see what you mean that Mount Rushmore, it is a stunning, stunning wonder in this country, but that it could be interpreted as rubbing salt in some people's wounds."

He wants to share a vision of what this country is all about, the goals that we have, making things better. And I don't think people see it as anything other than that. But, for protesters, it gives them an opportunity to highlight their grievances.

And it did, in fact, nix the class of recruits, so you could have potentially fewer officers, certainly new ones, coming on board. And you have got concerns about spikes in crime as a result, but they don't care. They want more. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAFIR",
      "utterance": "Well, this is a group that wants anarchy. They don't want safety. The fact is that the cuts that have been made are going to be real. It may not be a million dollar -- billion dollars, but they're going to reduce the amount of police officers on the street. Cops are retiring at record numbers. Response time is going to go down. You did away with the anti-crime unit, which was 600 plainclothes officers who prevented crime. Uniformed officers respond to crime. Plainclothes officers prevent crimes from happening. So it's going to be a much more dangerous city. And, of course, Mayor de Blasio, as usual, has supported the protesters, has not supported the police. And police, because of the things that are happening, like taking away qualified immunity from them, are not going to respond. They're going to respond when they see a crime happening in front of them, but they're not going to do anything assertive. And from the safest large city in America, it's going to go back to the bad old days, when there were 2,000 murders."

      "utterance": "You know, it quickly is. And I'm worried about that, I mean, especially at this time. You and I discussed this, but even looking at the language and some of the signs spray-painted around City Hall, I mean, they're pigs, kill them, all of that -- we're going to show just a few -- but the fact of the matter is, crime has run up markedly, and this at a time when a lot of people who've been sheltered at home are now looking to go back, those who work in the New York area, into the city. I'm not sure they're going to be so eager to do that, to say nothing of those who want to visit the city, tourists, the lifeblood of the city, who are looking at this and saying, I don't think so. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAFIR",
      "utterance": "Well, Mayor de Blasio inherited one of the safest large cities -- well, the safest city in America, a booming economy, and it's all going in the wrong direction, because he is the number one cause of what's going on in New York. What's happening is, he doesn't support the police. He supports the protesters. He's talking about having social workers and health professionals respond to 911 calls without police officers. That's ridiculous. When somebody calls 911, it's because it's a police emergency. And nobody knows whether it's a domestic violence call or a call where there's going to be somebody with a gun. What's happening is, the good citizens of this city are going to be without the protection that they need. And I have to say this, because I think of it every time I see the statistic. Mayor de Blasio was elected by 70 percent. But only 22 percent of the voters voted. So, I hope that, in the next election, they're going to get out and elect a mayor who's going to take care of safety in the city."

And a lot of police men and women who now wonder whether they should respond to a call, whether they should even -- even be police. We're talking -- hearing word in New York that they are planning a sick-out tomorrow to express their frustration. I have talked to many officers who have sons or daughters who were interested in becoming cops themselves, and they're -- to a man or woman, they're telling me, I'm saying, no, don't do it. What do you make of that?"

But, unless things turn around, police officers put themselves not only at risk every day, as they have done for hundreds of years, but now, with what's going on in this country, they're putting their families and their economic survival at risk. District attorneys in some of these progressive cities and attorney generals are looking more to charge police officers than to charge violent protesters and rioters. It's a ridiculous thing. And with the Fourth of July coming, we should be celebrating the fact that these people have the freedom to protest, but they don't have the freedom to loot and vandalize and, as in Seattle, murder people."

Want to take you real quickly to Santa Monica, California. It's a beautiful place. Don't know if you have ever been there. A lot of people first head out to the beach. Not an option this weekend, beaches closed there, beaches closed in a lot of areas now, as people are violating these distancing provisions, so governors and mayors in those necks of the woods are saying, we're shutting them down in the weekend. There are fines for this, which makes me wonder, if you're in a bathing suit, and you're there, and they want you to show your license while you're out there, of course, you have a bathing suit and then -- anyway, it's a mess. More after this. Just part of the national confusion of new restrictions and phased-in, well, reversals that have a lot of folks generally confused.

      "utterance": "Hi there, Neil. And it's hard to keep track of all of it, because it's really a patchwork across the country when it comes to these different regulations. Just today, Texas and Kansas began imposing mandatory policies for wearing face masks in public. They join 20 other states in Washington, D.C., which have imposed similar mandates. However, some governors, such as Georgia's Brian Kemp, are hoping voluntary campaigns will encourage people to do the right thing."

Some question whether it would hold up to a legal challenge, since the governor's executive order on COVID-19 supersedes local policy. Around the country, other cities are enforcing face coverings. In West Hollywood, California, the first time you're caught unmasked, it could cost you $300. And that is drawing mixed reaction."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now it's up to people to do that, right? It is voluntary in some places, a strong order in others. Jonathan Serrie, thank you very much. It is still kind of like the case of law, certainly, in Texas, where we're just hearing from the Health Department that coronavirus cases rose today, as of today, by 7,550 to a total of 183,532. So, this acceleration continues. Nationally, much has been talked about the spike in cases. What doesn't get as much attention is the fact that, despite the 14-day moving average that shows cases increasing about 90 percent to 55,595, on a rolling basis, the fact of the matter is that new deaths are down 19 percent in that same period to 722, again, looking at a 14-day sort of a cycle here that kind of puts it in a little bit better perspective. Dr. Amesh Adalja joins us right now. Doctor, you're looking at this. And we have chatted about these sorts of trends. What do you make of that? I mean, more cases, more testing, this is what you get. A lot of people like to point to the fact that the hospitalization spike nationally isn't as severe, and the death count actually is going down. Put it all together for us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. AMESH ADALJA, INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA",
      "utterance": "Well, you can't look at deaths in isolation, because you have to remember that deaths are a lagging indicator. They're going to take some time to accrue. So you can't look at deaths now and cases now and say that there's kind of a mismatch. We have to look at deaths in the future, because we know that some of these cases are going to take time to get sick, especially when there's younger individuals. They have to actually then transmit it to a vulnerable person. That person has to get sick enough to need hospitalization, and then die. So I do think we will see some uptick in deaths, hopefully not as bad as what we saw early on in this pandemic, because we have got new tools, we have gotten better at dealing with these patients, understanding the complications and how to prevent them. But I do think that we are going to see more deaths occur. It's a simple biological fact. As more people get infected, more people are going to die, but hopefully not at the rates that we saw in March and April."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Doctor, we're looking at different numbers, obviously, in different states. It does seem to be concentrated in Southern states, where many thought the warm weather originally would quash this. Now, there's a counterargument to that, because of the exceptionally warm weather, in some places, blistering hot weather, people were indoors. But what do you make of that and where are these are concentrated?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "It's definitely multiple factors that are at play right now. Some of these states didn't get hit early on. And maybe there was some complacency in the psychology of the people there about this not being an issue there. Maybe they didn't hire enough contact tracers as well. But the other issue is, is, we never thought that there would be complete seasonality. We thought that there might be some suppression, especially with surface transmission, when it got hotter, when it got sunnier, when it got more humid, and the virus wouldn't be viable as long. But that doesn't really interfere with person-to-person transmission. And it's just that there's so many people susceptible, and so many people interacting, that we don't see that kind of seasonality that we see with other coronaviruses. And we may not see a trough. But I think, alternatively, we have to be prepared in the fall for this to accelerate, when environmental conditions change. And it is definitely true that there may be a reverse effect with people going indoors because it is so hot and people are seeking shelter, and we know that indoor transmission is greater than outdoor transmission."

    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "Sure. We have been tracking this virus for a long time , looking at its genetics. And we know that all viruses mutate, but most mutations don't do anything. What we're seeing is some data emerge that there is a new strain of this, a new clone, I guess you would say -- it's still the same thing, it still does the same thing to you -- that has a different genetic sequence to it. There's one specific change that's occurring. And it seems to be dominant in almost all places of the world where it has appeared. And it looks like, at least in laboratory settings, that it might be more efficiently transmitting. We don't know if that's the case. We don't know if there's -- there's a lot more science that needs to be done. This is something we need to track. But it doesn't change the fact that the virus still has the same amount of lethality, the same amount of severity. It's just that it might be more transmissible. But, again, we have to stay tuned to see what the actual science shows, based on these laboratory studies."

He has been way ahead a lot of these trends and looking at the bigger picture. We will look at the bigger picture as well, because, as you have these spikes in cases, now, suddenly, we have something else that's more favorable, an unusual spike in jobs for two months running now, almost eight million of them. What's going on? Charles Payne on that -- after this."

They have to sit and wait. And yet, through all of that, we had a spike in jobs, continuing a spike that continued from the prior month, when everyone thought we would lose jobs, over the last couple of months now gaining about seven, eight million of them.

I know people are upset about debt and all that kind of stuff, but they -- what they did to get money into the system quickly, as fast as they did, particularly for the small businesses out there, was just absolutely remarkable. But we're coming to a point now where, yes -- and I listened to some of your interviews. I think it's right that people are going to self-adjust and that masks won't be a big issue anymore, social distancing, nothing like when we first came out of the -- out of our homes after months and months of being locked down. There will be a lot more prudency, a lot more care and thought about all of that. The key, though, is to try to keep this going, right, until we can really, truly, truly get the economy back."

And it's been a little over two weeks now, had my negative test. So they work. Let's start with this. This is the Monos CleanPod. This is an ultraviolet C light sterilizer. It's about the size of a hairbrush. You turn it on, and you wave it over any kind of surface, whether it's your cell phone or the seat back or even your steering wheel. And this cleans up the surface, gets rid of germs. It scrambles the germ's DNA, so it can no longer infect you. And this has been proven over and over again, UVC light has been, to be an effective fighter of germs. You just cannot use it on your skin, no matter what. Another thing, we have now learned that the virus can potentially infect you through your eyes. So, in addition to masks, there are these bucket hats with either zip on or snap-on shields.
