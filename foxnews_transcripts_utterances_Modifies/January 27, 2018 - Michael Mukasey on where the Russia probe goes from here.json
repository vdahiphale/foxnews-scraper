President Trump saying he's looking forward to speaking to Special Counsel Robert Mueller and is ready to do so under oath. Those comments coming as the president prepared to depart for the World Economic Forum in Davos, and amid reports that he called for Mueller's firing in June, something the president denies.  The Justice Department's inspector general also saying on Thursday he recovered missing text messages exchanged over a five-month period between FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.  Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey, joins me now.  Judge Mukasey, welcome.",

You have the Justice -- this is Donald Trump's Justice Department trying to lean on the Republicans not to release this memo.

The memo has been described by House Republicans who have viewed it as alarming and shacking. Democrats call it misleading and a distraction designed to derail the Mueller probe. Let's bring in \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, and columnists, Kim Strassel and Bill McGurn. So, Kim, you've been following the story closely.

All I can say is the Russia bot seems to be more for disclosure than are Democrats on the Intel Committee. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes, but, you know, Adam Schiff and Senator Dianne Feinstein are saying these Russian bots are taking advantage of what the Republicans are doing, and they're on your side. This situation is beginning to spin out of control politically. But I personally think -- it's conjecture -- but this is probably about something even larger than the FISA courts. You have the Justice -- this is Donald Trump's Justice Department trying to lean on the Republicans not to release this memo. And I'm convinced that the FBI was not only surveilling Trump campaign workers but surveilling the Russians. This has to do with trying to figure out how the Russians were trying to penetrate our politics. They're undoubtedly afraid of exposing the methods and means about what they were doing."

But you know and I know, and the entire press corps knows, and is using it to its advantage, that the president's legal team has told him not to touch anything to do with this investigation if he can in any way help it, because the fear is, and I think some of it is justified, that Mueller's team and the president's critics out in the media and in the Democratic Party are waiting for another opportunity to accuse him of obstruction or interference.

The proposal coming a day after the president told reporters that he would allow the immigrants known as DREAMers to morph into citizens over a period of 10 to 12 years. The White House is expected to brief lawmakers on the details of the plan early next week, but the proposal is already drawing fire from the right and the left.

And on the other side, he's going to get $25 billion to build the wall, which was a basic campaign promise. I don't see how you can give up on that, plus some other security measures. But not things like E-Verify. The problem is here -- the goal should be to keep it simple. You're going to need votes in the House and the Senate. You say the right and the left have problems with this. But the problem is that when you get into stuff like chain migration, getting into the deep details of that, how many members of the family can come in and how much security you're going to impose, immigration is a Pandora's box in legislative terms."

That could be 1.8 million people. That's something that -- if you're Democrats or one of the DREAMers yourself, you say, that's a pretty good deal. So what are you going to give the restrictionists that Trump -- let's face it he ran on a - - I don't agree with that policy, but we need to break the logjam on immigration.

No one likes what we have but it's a test of sensibility. I'm with you in this sense. Even the details don't interest me as much as -- someone who was there during the collapse of the Bush-Kennedy deal, Congress is the proper venue for this and Congress has been unable to deal with this through several administrations. And clearly, the comprehensive thing is not in play for the reason that Dan says, it just complicates negotiations. I think we just need to get something solved, one piece of the puzzle and then move on and do other things later."

So you end up with the status quo. The deadline of the DREAMers, March 5th, because Trump basically killed the Obama legalization, that is now a forcing fact that basically says, if you do nothing now, if we still give both sides a veto, you're going to have these people illegal, and they could be deported. That's not, I think, a fair humanitarian position to take, morally or politically, because these people did not come here by their own volition."

They've not only come out with the contours of exactly what a deal generally needs to look like. They've been very generous, like saying to the Democrats, 1.8 million people and not just legalization but a path to citizenship. So now they're saying, can you take that deal? We already know that the restrictionist right is going to say no, and that's been very revealing. They've already come out and said, well, yes, that border money is good but the rest of this is a no-go. So the president is going to have to look beyond that if he ever wants to see this happen. The ball is really in the left's court and whether or not they're willing to finally make good on promises that they have been making to their constituents for years about getting this situation finished."

If I was going to criticize anything, I would say that, on trade, he's still completely wrong-headed about this. He talked about intellectual property theft. I'll give him that. That's a big problem. But in terms of countries that subsidize their exports and do central planning, which he said shouldn't be allowed in the international trade regime, we already know that's a failed strategy, and that is not a reason not to trade with other countries."

The night before, he met with all of these European business leaders, head of Nokia, Siemens. I'm with Mary, it thought it was a good speech. All presidents never say just free trade, they say free and fair trade. That's a big asterisk. I agree with Mary on the trade part. It contradicts the kind of growth message along with the weak dollar comments that they went into Davos on. The irony is like the idea that the weak dollar is going to promote your economy. That's one of the favorite little chestnuts of people like those who meet at Davos, right? I think it undercuts his message. I don't think he sees that. But I think that would be the little quibble I had. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: My reaction is a lot more positive. I think it's a big deal. Davos represents one thing. What is that one thing? The word, globalization."

He's saying, look, globalization is about the business sector and the private sector functioning. We've taken steps in the United States to allow or private sector to function, massive tax cuts, deregulation, making bureaucrats accountable again. As he said, we have a lot of unelected bureaucrats in the United States."

And Donald Trump, he fell out of that. And it had already been down in the Trump administration. So, now Donald Trump was really interesting. Two days later, he said, well, I think he was misinterpreted, and I actually think that, you know, he shouldn't talk about the dollar. The dollar will do what the dollar does. That's interesting. Because he's usually said I'm for a weak dollar, too. Maybe there's learning a little bit here about that."

That news coming as Starbucks announced it will use some of the savings from the GOP tax cuts to give its U.S. workers pay raises, company stock, and expanded benefits. Altogether, the coffee chain said it would spend more than $250 million on its employees and create 8,000 retail jobs. We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Mary Anastasia O'Grady. So, Kim, how do you read the 2.6 percent growth figure? Down a little bit from what the economists expected."

And most importantly, a number that does not take into account any real measure the effects of the upcoming tax cuts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "That's what's interesting. If you look inside the numbers, the reason for the decline, Dan, from the second and third quarters, which were above 3 percent, is inventories fell off. That's going to rebounded in future quarters so that's a temporary effect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes. Output was up close to 7 percent as well. And now we're seeing in the first quarter of this year, this tremendous amount of what looks like output, capital investment across the board. It's quite extraordinary. The tax cut has been notable. Cutting the corporate tax cut from 35 percent to 21 percent, one corporation after another is citing this as the reason they're going to make these capital investments, raise the wages of their workers, raise 401K matches. There's a tremendous amount of economic vitality happening in the first quarter. The question is, is it going to be sustainable over the long term or will something break it, whether it's a foreign policy event, like North Korea, a political event, or perhaps the feds eventually raising interest rates."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

That is a capital strike, so called, that we saw under Obama, seems to be ending. For years, you know, in the recovery you had really capital investment, much lower than you usually get in an expansion. And now it's actually popping up."

      "speaker": "O'GRADY",

They really surprised on the upside, which is showing you that people are - - companies are wanting this heavy machinery, not just in the United States but there's kind of a global reflation, which I think is going to be a very important component of this going forward."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Capital investment is not just important for building machinery. It's an investment in productivity. And if you increase productivity, which has also been low in the Obama recovery, what does that do? It flows through to workers. If each worker is more productive. They're worth more. You can pay them more."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's pretty clear that the business was really beaten down over the Obama years, partly just the rhetoric, the kind of negativity about -- made a very hostile business climate. But the other thing is that you have, going forward, you have some risk of no levers, monetary levers, and no fiscal levers to get the economy growing. That's why this tax cut was so important because it's going to bring capital off the sidelines back into the market."

Is this going to have an impact politically on voters?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",

Now, remember, Democrats immediately came out and pooh-poohed this bill, in fact, campaigned against it the entire time it was under discussion, saying it was a payoff for fat accounts and that no workers in America would benefit whatsoever. They've been remarkably proven wrong on that, almost in embarrassing fashion. Republicans are going to go out with that, they're going to talk about how right they were with this tax policy in terms of the economy, talk about rising fortunes for Americans, and try to take credit for it. It could help them very much, especially if, and it's a big if, if the president can stay on message this year and talk about that as well, too, maybe even notch a few more victories, but try to do something about improving his own approval rate."

And what the president usually does is lay out what he wants to do in foreign affairs, the economy, and domestic grab bag, from education to the environment, and then he goes out and sells it.

Your goal is -- you know, the Democrats, you say we're going to spend $10 million on the environment, Democrats get up and cheer. Republicans, you say we're going to do more for our troops and the Republicans get up. That's part of the little games. I think Donald Trump could be a little different.

Dan was talking about all of the voters who have shifted during the last month, the tone that the president sets in this speech will have a lot to do with it.
