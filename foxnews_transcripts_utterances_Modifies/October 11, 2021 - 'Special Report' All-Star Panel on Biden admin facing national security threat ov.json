The problem with that, I think, is lack of context. Clearly, we are still battling the coronavirus, and it's still having an impact on our economy, Bret. And I think one consequence of that is it distorts the normal September back to work, fall hiring and layoff patterns. Right now we actually saw more growth in July and August. They had to go back and up those numbers, more than we would've anticipated. So right now, it looks like we're going to be going through this for a while. Some big companies have announced now they won't be going back until even past January, and I was surprised at that. So you have to keep that in mind. Right now, if you stop and think about it, though, from the Biden administration perspective, we are under five percent unemployment, down from 6.3 percent I think it was in January. That's pretty good. You just heard the president say added 5 million jobs under his time. Again, that's very good.

Instead of incentivizing to create more jobs, they're prospectively, if they get the legislation passed, going to raise taxes on a lot of these companies. JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, that is the plan, and that's also the problem. Juan points to the unemployment rate below five percent. There are two reasons unemployment falls. One is because more people who are looking for work find work. The other reason is because fewer people are looking for work. And the problem here is that that latter cause could be what we are dealing with. There are 5 million fewer people working today than before the pandemic. And the question then becomes why is that? Why do we have so many job openings and so few people looking for work? And the question there is whether there are too many incentives in place not to work, whether these - - we have ended the supplemental un-insurance program. I think we waited too long to end it, but that was a good thing to do. But we still have lots of checks going out to families with kids, rental assistance, and so forth. We have a lot of incentives in place for people not to return to the labor force. And going forward, this administration was to increase those incentives not to return to the labor force, even giving families, six-figure income families, up to $200,000, incentives not to return to work. And that could be a problem going forward, not just in terms of the unemployment rate but in terms of the productivity of the country. Fewer people working means we are a less productive country, and that could in the long run affect our standard of living.",

So many of the fixes that the Biden administration wants to bring to bear are things that aren't even going to be wound up within the next calendar year-and-a-half, if not beyond that. And I think that with this semiconductor crisis, you see it again a situation where you can't just flip a switch and turn things on. I think that this Southwest Airlines situation where you see so many pilots and crew potentially involved in a mass revolt against the vaccine mandate that has been pressed upon them, I fear that that type of reaction is going to spread throughout our economy, and that we really are potentially on the cusp of a number of serious crises that the White House really is already dealing with so many in so many different areas. I'm not sure that they really have a solution that's going to be able to be brought to bear in time to make a meaningful difference for people in the economy in a short term.",

There's just no two ways about that. And the workforce participation, as Jason has pointed out, is already a problem. One more thing, Bret, on that semiconductor shortage. If anything could bring the Taiwan policy and the threats to Taiwan into sharp focus, that certainly is it, because so much of what we get in semiconductors comes from Taiwan. We need that production in the near term and possibly in the long. And if that is cut off in any way, we are really in trouble.",

The U.S., as you know, recently strengthened its relationship with Australia, strengthened its relationship in terms of military supplies, talking about semiconductor chips, with lots of the people in that pan-Asian basin to try to say that we are united, we're not giving up on that area. But when you use the word \"nebulous,\" I guess you mean, are we going to be more pointed in taking on the Chinese and challenging the Chinese? And there I think that's an ongoing issue as to how you do it. Clearly, we are not interested in bombs and fighting a war with them, but I think you have to be very clear about the fact that they are aggressive in terms of their behavior in that region, and that we should not be backing off in my opinion. But I think semiconductors, you've got to believe in American ingenuity. Our defense industry is the best of the world. I don't think anyone would contest it.",

So many of the fixes that the Biden administration wants to bring to bear are things that aren't even going to be wound up within the next calendar year-and-a-half, if not beyond that. And I think that with this semiconductor crisis, you see it again a situation where you can't just flip a switch and turn things on. I think that this Southwest Airlines situation where you see so many pilots and crew potentially involved in a mass revolt against the vaccine mandate that has been pressed upon them, I fear that that type of reaction is going to spread throughout our economy, and that we really are potentially on the cusp of a number of serious crises that the White House really is already dealing with so many in so many different areas. I'm not sure that they really have a solution that's going to be able to be brought to bear in time to make a meaningful difference for people in the economy in a short term."

      "utterance": "The vaccine mandates don't help, I don't think, because anything that incentivizes people who are concerned about it not to go to work or to be willing to lose their jobs is going to hurt the economy. There's just no two ways about that. And the workforce participation, as Jason has pointed out, is already a problem. One more thing, Bret, on that semiconductor shortage. If anything could bring the Taiwan policy and the threats to Taiwan into sharp focus, that certainly is it, because so much of what we get in semiconductors comes from Taiwan. We need that production in the near term and possibly in the long. And if that is cut off in any way, we are really in trouble."

      "utterance": "And speaking of that, Juan, China policy from the Biden administration seems a little nebulous. It doesn't seem like it's nailed down exactly what it is. And as Brit is talking about, the threats to Taiwan in just recent days with these bombers and jets flying over, it seems urgent."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I would say so. Clearly the president of Taiwan came out and said she is not going to be intimidated by that kind of behavior. The U.S., as you know, recently strengthened its relationship with Australia, strengthened its relationship in terms of military supplies, talking about semiconductor chips, with lots of the people in that pan-Asian basin to try to say that we are united, we're not giving up on that area. But when you use the word \"nebulous,\" I guess you mean, are we going to be more pointed in taking on the Chinese and challenging the Chinese? And there I think that's an ongoing issue as to how you do it. Clearly, we are not interested in bombs and fighting a war with them, but I think you have to be very clear about the fact that they are aggressive in terms of their behavior in that region, and that we should not be backing off in my opinion. But I think semiconductors, you've got to believe in American ingenuity. Our defense industry is the best of the world. I don't think anyone would contest it."

Violent crime is up, murders have almost doubled since 2019, and the police department is having trouble recruiting new cops. I don't think Austin is going to be the last big city to learn this lesson the hard way."
