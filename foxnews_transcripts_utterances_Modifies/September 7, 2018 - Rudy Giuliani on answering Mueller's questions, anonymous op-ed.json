The Democrats, they are out for blood. They want to impeach the president and now they are rolling out their savior, the anointed one, Barack Obama, all over the country to tell you how to vote. Of course, he wants to destroy the Trump agenda, he wants to preserve the deep state, he wants to decide your future after all of his failure because he thinks he knows better.  Now, tonight, with the help of a new report from John Solomon, we will connect all of the dots tonight. We'll show you just how malignant and dangerous this country's bureaucracy had become. Bruce Ohr, Peter Strzok, Andrew McCabe, Page, all of them, the other unelected officials trying to rig an election, influence your vote, stop Donald Trump, the president you voted for. They tried before he was elected. They've tried to undermine him ever since.  Now we've got anonymous, a figure inside the administration claiming the Trump presidency will soon be over one way or another. Is that a veiled threat coming from the deep state? Plus, we have new developments surrounding FISA abuse in the investigation. Andrew McCabe, we now know there is a grand jury convened and he may be just the person many officials who are about to be in serious legal trouble.  Buckle up. It is time for the Friday edition, news breaking, opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "Now, what a sanctimonious one. As Reagan said, stay the force. They have former President Obama -- well, he is actually right about one thing, because in 60 days, remember 2016, it was about the forgotten men and women of this country. If you don't go out and vote, the consequences will be dire. The Trump agenda, they will stop in its tracks.  Obama's friends in Congress that brought us to the brink of economic catastrophe and weakness and apology on the world stage -- guess what? They want power back. They want to stop Trump. And they want to impeach him.   Now, we're going to have an important monologue about the midterms you can't afford to miss. That's later in the show, including more of Obama's lo hypocritical, self-righteous remarks that should make your blood boil. All right. But first our investigation into the deep state rolls on tonight and what we have now uncovered is now beginning to connect all of the dots. I think we now understand what the insurance policy is, worse than we originally thought. The foundation of this republic is now shaken to its core. The biggest abuse of power scandal in history.  You've got a few unelected high-ranking officials inside of our government trying and almost exceeding to alter the course of this country's history. At the very center of it all is the man whose name should be seared into your brain. Bruce Ohr. He is the face now of the deep state corruption. And according to a damning investigative report from The Hill's John Solomon, in the summer of 2016, it was Ohr, remember he was the fourth highest ranking member of the DOJ, tampering with an ongoing FBI investigation into so called Russian collusion. Why? To destroy then candidate Donald Trump.  We'll break it down step by step, layer by layer. Here's what we know: 2016, Hillary Clinton wanted dirt on her opponent, Donald Trump. This is after she got her exoneration without an investigation. That's another part of the story.  Her campaign and DNC, well, they funneled money through a law firm that was called Perkins Coie, that hires Fusion GPS, an op research firm. And then, of course, they attempted to literally hire a foreign national, which we thought was a bad thing for America. That was Christopher Steele, former MI-6 spy. And don't forget, Nellie Ohr is the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr. She's working on the phony what turned out to be Russian dossier, specifically Russian dirt that's on Donald Trump that nobody bothered to verify.  Well, not so coincidentally, at the same time, the FBI was also paying Christopher Steele. They later fired him for lying and leaking in their Russia investigation. But now we know that Bruce Ohr had his dirty little fingers all over this.   It was Bruce Ohr who pushed the FBI to use the Steele campaign opposition research. Remember, he was a hater. He wanted to stop Trump. It was Bruce Ohr. Meaning Steele. It was Ohr who spread Steele's phony dossier throughout the government, to lie to the American people. It was Ohr who became a back channel. Remember, 70-plus contacts of Christopher Steele even after he was fired by the FBI for leading anti- Trump, leaking it to the press in this country. That means to you. It was Bruce Ohr who knew that Steele was completely bias, desperate to stop Trump at all costs and that Ohr wrote that Steele was passionate about Donald Trump never being president. Bruce Ohr knew of the dossier was biased, would never hold up in court. He knew it was tainted, he knew it was not verified or corroborated, and yet he pushed that information into the grateful hands of anti-Trump agent Strzok and Lisa Page, and even the pit bull himself, Andrew Weissmann.  So, you got to -- you start with Hillary's campaign, they fund it. They funneled the money. It gets to a foreign spy, a foreign agent. He puts in-- he hates Trump. He gets phony Russian information. It's disseminated to you, the American people, and it gets worse from there.  None of this should happen in America. You have a political campaign, the DOJ working together, coordinating their efforts, literally to stop one candidate over another candidate. This is a humiliating smear on the country's system of justice. And it gets worse because the phony, political, dirty Russian dossier that Hillary paid for, never verified, was used as the very basis for FISA warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate. Let's see. Jim Comey signed off on the FISA request, Sally Yates, Dana Boente, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, all signed off on it. And tonight, we can report that fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe is now facing a real serious criminal investigation. We know tonight a grand jury has been impaneled by federal prosecutors, multiple witnesses have been summoned, as the former deputy director is accused of using his position to advance his personal political interests.   If justice is served, the McCabe investigation should just be the tip of the iceberg. Everyone who committed this fraud on the FISA court using unverified information, the Steele dossier by a Trump hater probably should be investigated and prosecuted. That would mean Comey and Yates and, yes, the guy that did the last one, Rod Rosenstein. The guy that appointed Mueller need to be held accountable. Multiple Republican lawmakers now demanding the president declassify and unredact parts of FISA documents. On top of that, the 302s as it relates to Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele, and the \"Gang of Eight\" material. We're expecting the president could make this information available as early as this weekend.  Now, we're talking about everything that the \"Gang of Eight\" had. We know the specific pages of FISA that we had. Apparently exculpatory information on Carter Page. And even somebody like Papadopoulos, who was just sentenced to 14 days in jail, $28 million later.  This information must be released. You, the American people, have a right to know how a fraud was committed on an FISA court against the Trump campaign associate. Not once, but multiple times. They never verified any of this information that turned out to be false. They purposely omitted information that would have had an impact on these judges. That's lying by omission. And what we've shown you each and every night right here on this program is what is a scary level of corruption that's only risen to the surface because Hillary didn't win in spite of all these efforts. If she won, we wouldn't know any of this. The deep state would be alive and well, working behind the scenes corruptly, undermining your vote, what you want for your country. It's biggest abuse of power scandal ever. Now, thankfully, the president is breaking up some china in Washington. He's smashing the status quo. He's shattering all the establishment politics. The old rules are gone. That's why one such cowardly bureaucrat who claims to be a senior official in the Trump administration acting out in The New York Times op-ed, claiming to be part of the so-called resistance.   Really, within our government? We have a resistance? Wow. We have sleeper cells within our government? This is a clear and present danger to the country.  Now, in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\", the president slammed this anonymous New York Times, and The Times itself for publishing this nonsense. Take a look.",

Washington Post reporting sleeper cells within our own government -- think about that -- inside the administration. What? To undermine the commander-in-chief? Does this so-called senior official have a security clearance, access to top secret information, sources, methods and potentially compromised? Does he hear the president talking about war and peace? You know?   And, look at this particularly alarming part of the article. Look at this. We will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until -- one way or another -- it's over. One way or another? What is one way or another? Voted out? Impeached? Die in office? Is that a veiled threat?   Where's the Secret Service?  Either way, given this person's alleged proximity to the president, it should be investigated and treated as matter of national security. Now, perhaps the president should use the Obama model and track down the anonymous saboteur. According to reports, no previous president was more tough on leakers than Obama. I know, shocking. He subjected his own staff to lie detector test, prosecuted multiple individuals, He targeted members of the press who published leaked stories, including former Fox News reporter James Rosen, who was surveilled, even accused of being a co-conspirator because he dared to report with anonymous sources inside the Obama White House. That was Obama that did all that.  Meanwhile, the super patriot who authored this op-ed in The New York Times, if you were truly working behind the scenes for the benefit of the country, why not stay behind the scenes? Why risk exposure in a very public way? Because this individual, unelected and unaccountable, they think their truth is better than what the president ran on, what the American people voted for. And he's pushing their political agenda, he or her, whoever it happens to be. That they know better than we, the smelly Walmart people, and those opinions are of more value than your opinions.  But ultimately this is an attack on the presidency and the country. The country can get hurt in this process. The very reason why President Trump and the Secret Service now must do everything in their power to dismantle the deep state and find out whoever this is. We got a lot to get to tonight.  Joining us now Fox News contributor, investigative reporter Sara Carter, former assistant U.S. attorney, Victoria Toensing. And yes, Victoria has done legal work for me.

What bothers me as a former Justice Department official, because I know how it works, is that he was working in a counterintelligence investigation.

I never got involved in counterintelligence investigations when I was the head of the criminal investigation unit. They are very different people.

If you don't go out and vote, the consequences will be dire. The Trump agenda, they will stop in its tracks. Obama's friends in Congress that brought us to the brink of economic catastrophe and weakness and apology on the world stage -- guess what? They want power back. They want to stop Trump. And they want to impeach him. Now, we're going to have an important monologue about the midterms you can't afford to miss. That's later in the show, including more of Obama's lo hypocritical, self-righteous remarks that should make your blood boil. All right. But first our investigation into the deep state rolls on tonight and what we have now uncovered is now beginning to connect all of the dots. I think we now understand what the insurance policy is, worse than we originally thought. The foundation of this republic is now shaken to its core. The biggest abuse of power scandal in history. You've got a few unelected high-ranking officials inside of our government trying and almost exceeding to alter the course of this country's history. At the very center of it all is the man whose name should be seared into your brain. Bruce Ohr. He is the face now of the deep state corruption. And according to a damning investigative report from The Hill's John Solomon, in the summer of 2016, it was Ohr, remember he was the fourth highest ranking member of the DOJ, tampering with an ongoing FBI investigation into so called Russian collusion. Why? To destroy then candidate Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "We'll break it down step by step, layer by layer. Here's what we know",
      "utterance": "2016, Hillary Clinton wanted dirt on her opponent, Donald Trump. This is after she got her exoneration without an investigation. That's another part of the story. Her campaign and DNC, well, they funneled money through a law firm that was called Perkins Coie, that hires Fusion GPS, an op research firm. And then, of course, they attempted to literally hire a foreign national, which we thought was a bad thing for America. That was Christopher Steele, former MI-6 spy. And don't forget, Nellie Ohr is the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr. She's working on the phony what turned out to be Russian dossier, specifically Russian dirt that's on Donald Trump that nobody bothered to verify. Well, not so coincidentally, at the same time, the FBI was also paying Christopher Steele. They later fired him for lying and leaking in their Russia investigation. But now we know that Bruce Ohr had his dirty little fingers all over this. It was Bruce Ohr who pushed the FBI to use the Steele campaign opposition research. Remember, he was a hater. He wanted to stop Trump. It was Bruce Ohr. Meaning Steele. It was Ohr who spread Steele's phony dossier throughout the government, to lie to the American people. It was Ohr who became a back channel. Remember, 70-plus contacts of Christopher Steele even after he was fired by the FBI for leading anti- Trump, leaking it to the press in this country. That means to you. It was Bruce Ohr who knew that Steele was completely bias, desperate to stop Trump at all costs and that Ohr wrote that Steele was passionate about Donald Trump never being president. Bruce Ohr knew of the dossier was biased, would never hold up in court. He knew it was tainted, he knew it was not verified or corroborated, and yet he pushed that information into the grateful hands of anti-Trump agent Strzok and Lisa Page, and even the pit bull himself, Andrew Weissmann. So, you got to -- you start with Hillary's campaign, they fund it. They funneled the money. It gets to a foreign spy, a foreign agent. He puts in-- he hates Trump. He gets phony Russian information. It's disseminated to you, the American people, and it gets worse from there. None of this should happen in America. You have a political campaign, the DOJ working together, coordinating their efforts, literally to stop one candidate over another candidate. This is a humiliating smear on the country's system of justice. And it gets worse because the phony, political, dirty Russian dossier that Hillary paid for, never verified, was used as the very basis for FISA warrants to spy on a Trump campaign associate. Let's see. Jim Comey signed off on the FISA request, Sally Yates, Dana Boente, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, all signed off on it. And tonight, we can report that fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe is now facing a real serious criminal investigation. We know tonight a grand jury has been impaneled by federal prosecutors, multiple witnesses have been summoned, as the former deputy director is accused of using his position to advance his personal political interests. If justice is served, the McCabe investigation should just be the tip of the iceberg. Everyone who committed this fraud on the FISA court using unverified information, the Steele dossier by a Trump hater probably should be investigated and prosecuted. That would mean Comey and Yates and, yes, the guy that did the last one, Rod Rosenstein. The guy that appointed Mueller need to be held accountable. Multiple Republican lawmakers now demanding the president declassify and unredact parts of FISA documents. On top of that, the 302s as it relates to Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele, and the \"Gang of Eight\" material. We're expecting the president could make this information available as early as this weekend. Now, we're talking about everything that the \"Gang of Eight\" had. We know the specific pages of FISA that we had. Apparently exculpatory information on Carter Page. And even somebody like Papadopoulos, who was just sentenced to 14 days in jail, $28 million later. This information must be released. You, the American people, have a right to know how a fraud was committed on an FISA court against the Trump campaign associate. Not once, but multiple times. They never verified any of this information that turned out to be false. They purposely omitted information that would have had an impact on these judges. That's lying by omission. And what we've shown you each and every night right here on this program is what is a scary level of corruption that's only risen to the surface because Hillary didn't win in spite of all these efforts. If she won, we wouldn't know any of this. The deep state would be alive and well, working behind the scenes corruptly, undermining your vote, what you want for your country. It's biggest abuse of power scandal ever. Now, thankfully, the president is breaking up some china in Washington. He's smashing the status quo. He's shattering all the establishment politics. The old rules are gone. That's why one such cowardly bureaucrat who claims to be a senior official in the Trump administration acting out in The New York Times op-ed, claiming to be part of the so-called resistance. Really, within our government? We have a resistance? Wow. We have sleeper cells within our government? This is a clear and present danger to the country. Now, in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\", the president slammed this anonymous New York Times, and The Times itself for publishing this nonsense. Take a look."

      "utterance": "That is beyond unacceptable. It's like a soft coup aided and abetted by the corrupt media in this country. Washington Post reporting sleeper cells within our own government -- think about that -- inside the administration. What? To undermine the commander-in-chief? Does this so-called senior official have a security clearance, access to top secret information, sources, methods and potentially compromised? Does he hear the president talking about war and peace? You know? And, look at this particularly alarming part of the article. Look at this. We will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until -- one way or another -- it's over. One way or another? What is one way or another? Voted out? Impeached? Die in office? Is that a veiled threat? Where's the Secret Service? Either way, given this person's alleged proximity to the president, it should be investigated and treated as matter of national security. Now, perhaps the president should use the Obama model and track down the anonymous saboteur. According to reports, no previous president was more tough on leakers than Obama. I know, shocking. He subjected his own staff to lie detector test, prosecuted multiple individuals, He targeted members of the press who published leaked stories, including former Fox News reporter James Rosen, who was surveilled, even accused of being a co-conspirator because he dared to report with anonymous sources inside the Obama White House. That was Obama that did all that. Meanwhile, the super patriot who authored this op-ed in The New York Times, if you were truly working behind the scenes for the benefit of the country, why not stay behind the scenes? Why risk exposure in a very public way? Because this individual, unelected and unaccountable, they think their truth is better than what the president ran on, what the American people voted for. And he's pushing their political agenda, he or her, whoever it happens to be. That they know better than we, the smelly Walmart people, and those opinions are of more value than your opinions. But ultimately this is an attack on the presidency and the country. The country can get hurt in this process. The very reason why President Trump and the Secret Service now must do everything in their power to dismantle the deep state and find out whoever this is. We got a lot to get to tonight. Joining us now Fox News contributor, investigative reporter Sara Carter, former assistant U.S. attorney, Victoria Toensing. And yes, Victoria has done legal work for me.

And we now know that what he was using, the Steele dossier, he himself thought it was uncorroborated, unverified, not worthy of being submitted to the court, and yet Andy McCabe and all those people you said in your monologue and signed it, they represented that it had been corroborated.

Christopher Steele was afraid he'd be exposed. He wanted fire walls to hold. He was passing information through Ohr to go directly to the special counsel's office.

We've seen now that there's a resistance within the administration, within the bureaucracy, against the presidency of the United States, meaning against the people of this country. We're now seeing the pieces of this puzzle just kind of fit and fall together. They were on a fishing expedition to take this president down, to take candidate Trump down and then to go after president Trump. And they haven't stopped. This is so dangerous because I want us to take a step back. This isn't just about what happened right now. Remember the State Department was involved in this. Victoria Nuland was involved in this. John Kerry knew what was going on. There were other dossiers out there. And now, I'm hearing there's even more dossiers that we haven't discovered that were put together by Fusion GPS and spread out across Washington, D.C.

He wasn't talking to his wife and what she was doing early on in 2016? What bothers me as a former Justice Department official, because I know how it works, is that he was working in a counterintelligence investigation. This -- he is in charge of criminal investigations. That's like separation of church and state. I never got involved in counterintelligence investigations when I was the head of the criminal investigation unit. They are very different people. They're very different FBI agents that you work with and they're very different rules for collecting evidence. So I am appalled that this wasn't a big red sign. And if he were really an honest dude, which he isn't, we all know, he would have gone to Sally Yates and say, something really bad is going on here. No. He was participating in it. And here's what really bothers me about the FISA -- what they did to FISA. They purposely lied to the FISA court about Carter Page. I mean, he is really a big victim in all of this. The FBI, word in Washington is from -- in the affidavit, that they said, the FBI said, in 2013, that Carter Page was in cahoots with the Russians as opposed to being in FBI asset and helping them bring an indictment against Russian spy. More than that, they went after him for giving a speech in Moscow at the New Economic School. Guess who else made a speech there, Sean?"

Then when we finish that, we'll sit with them and talk about any further questions to whether -- we'll talk about any further questions about collusion or obstruction. The problem with obstruction is this. It all takes place post-presidency. To agree to it would really be to waive major presidential privilege. Also, it would involve very, very deep conversations that are very much under the protected branch of government. And finally, they don't need it. One of the things they would have to show is they have particularized need. In other words, they couldn't get it any other way.

And so the question is, was there a lot more here that has not been previously disclosed, number one. And number two, you're hearing from Democrats in Washington that this information is too sensitive to be released. But interesting they're making that argument, Sean, right after you had Cory Booker at the Supreme Court hearing saying, let's release everything. We need to know everything we can. So, the idea that Democrats have spent the last week saying we need more transparency, that might actually bolster the case for Republicans in Congress to release this info."

You know, when you look at the people that Ed mentioned in his report, Page, and Strzok, Bruce Ohr and McCabe, we've got all the essential figures in the insurance policy aspect of this. One has to wonder, is this now -- and Christopher Steele, one has to now wonder is that where this is leading to, Jim Jordan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. JIM JORDAN, R-OHIO",
      "utterance": "Yes. The first guy that Bruce Ohr talks to after he meets with Christopher Steele is Andy McCabe. He called him up a day or two later. And then meets with him and Lisa Page. So all of the key people at the FBI knew what was going on before they take the dossier to the court. They knew the Ohr's involvement. They knew who paid for the dossier. And they knew that the guy who wrote it, Christopher Steele, had told Bruce Ohr that he was desperate to stop Trump. And we don't believe they conveyed any of that critical information to the FISA court when they went to get the warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. That's why this is so important. We get it. They knew this up front when it started late July, early August. That's why this is so critical that this information become public."

And not only are they talking about fire walls, not wanting to be exposed. But, also did you get my stuff to the special counsel, which we now know the contact was Andrew Weissmann."

You got Bruce Ohr shuttling information to the FBI that was developed by his wife and the money paying for it all came from the DNC. I mean, the Ohrs are probably the most dangerous power couple in the Washington since the Clintons were running around this place. And I think that until we get the information about what was presented to the FISA we won't know the full depth of the misconduct at the FBI and the Department of Justice to inappropriately lie to a court. And I think that penalties are just starting to rack up."

Does that mean that everybody that was involved in that phony, fraudulent, Clinton bought and paid for dossier, the fraud on the court and information withheld purposely, more fraud on the court? Is everybody that signed that now in legal jeopardy perhaps?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "We'll see. What we do know is, the FBI and the DOJ had a sophisticated leaking project going on. Andrew McCabe lied about that, according to the inspector general, three times under oath and faces a criminal referral. And as Ed pointed out, there's now a grand jury being impaneled on the Andrew McCabe issue. So, this is what they did, I believe. They leaked information to the press and then they used their reports the press wrote to buttress the false dossier to give it legitimacy when it was a false document. That was the game that was being played. And we know that from Devin Nunes memo that the intelligence committee put out where they cite news reports to add weight to the dossier. It was all baloney this circular games they plane. That's I think may be the biggest concern that we see."

You'll remember there was a reference in the inspector general's report, so members of the media inappropriately giving gifts to people of the FBI to get stories and get tips. That may have been facilitated the illegal leaks and I think people could go to jail for it."

He wants to tell you how to vote because we, smelly Wal- Mart people that cling to our god cons bibles and religion, well, we can't be trusted to make important decisions. Only 60 days from today left until you head to the polls. And I keep reminding him what's at stake here come November. By the way that's the subject of tonight's mini monologue. All right. So President Obama said that Americans need to vote in November because our democracy depends on it. OK. What I'm about to say may shock some people. He's right. This November election is more important than any midterm in our life time. The stakes couldn't be higher. Democrats have proven again and again they will do anything, say everything and anything, to get their power back, to make sure, even if Donald Trump fails, no matter how much it hurts the country. We cannot let this happen. Now today President Obama tried attack and take credit for the economic successes we are now seeing. It's not true, but we'll show it to you."

Thanks to President Obama's stellar leadership, we had the lower labor participation rate since the '70s. We now have the highest. We had the lowest homeownership rate in 51 years. Obama, eight years of Obama, 13 million more Americans on food stamps. Eight million more Americans in poverty. We now have four million fewer Americans on food stamps, four million new jobs. Under him, anemic growth, endless burdens of regulation, lowest consumer confidence. That was the Obama economy and he took on more debt than every other president before him combined. He can spin it any way he wants but we, the American people, are smart enough not to believe the fake news that he was trying to feed us today. Now President Trump responded to Obama's outrageous claims as he tried to claim victory when he was a failure. Watch."

If the Democrats got in with their agenda in November of almost two years ago, instead of having 4.2 up, I believe honestly you'd have 4.2 down. You'd be negative. You'd be in negative numbers. You'd be in negative numbers."

They gave him a pass for hanging out with, let's see, Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn. That's where he started his political career. Make excuses 20 plus years in the pew of Mr. G.D. America.

He's my man. No. That's not going happen. I think that there's a certain segment of hard core Sean Hannity fans that probably wouldn't want to have a beer with me. There's no doubt about it. If you watch Fox News on a regular basis, it is a constant menu. They will find folks like who make me mad. I don't know where they find them.

In 2009, the Obama White House tried to exclude Fox News from a press pool interview with administration officials. In 2013 the story broke the Obama DOJ under the leadership of Mr. Holder they actually spied on one of our reporters at the time, James Rosen. They looked through Rosen's phone calls and his e-mails from 2009 while attempting to find a source for one of Rosen's stories. So what you heard from Obama today was nothing more than fake news and liberal spin. This is why this midterm election is so important. He's right about one thing. It's important. I can't stress enough. Yes, a lot in the country's at stake. Democrats win in November, you stay home, well, this is what's going happen. They'll rescind the tax cuts. They want their crumbs back. That's right. Nancy Pelosi calls them crumbs and she wants them back. And that's the money in your pay check that will be gone. They want to impeach President Trump. It's not a secret.

And, as you remember, in 2016, the Republican side of that equation, 16 people lost Donald Trump won. Pretty clear cut. You get to the general election, billion dollar campaign for Hillary Clinton, total support from the liberal media, she lost.
