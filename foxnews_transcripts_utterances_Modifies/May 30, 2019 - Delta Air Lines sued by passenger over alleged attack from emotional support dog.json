And, as you know, the president and his economic team have long hailed that first-quarter GDP reading as a sign that they say their economic policies are working. That number was revised downward slightly from 3.2 percent initially down to 3.1 percent, though it wasn't revised as low as some economists had been anticipating.  Within the last 15, 20 minutes or so, I just spoke with a senior White House official to get the White House's view on all of this. And here's what I was told, Charles. Their take on the downward revision described to me as pretty marginal. The one thing that they take as a positive, when you look under the hood at the numbers from this reading is that personal consumption, those numbers, they think, are going in the right direction, which will bode well, in their estimation, for Q2.  By the way, the White House still believes that, this year, the GDP number for the entire year will be at 3.2 percent. Earlier today, before he left for Colorado to speak at the graduation ceremony there at the Air Force Academy, the president took questions from reporters on the South Lawn.   And this was his take as it relates to the economy. Watch.",

But the bottom line is, there's all this investigation that goes into obstruction. We now hear that they're saying they felt completely bound to not reach a prosecutorial judgment, based on the OLC opinion. But I'm not sure that is so clear when you read the report. The report says that there were thorny issues of criminal intent on behalf of the president that would have to be resolved. That's a far cry from saying, we sure would have indicted him but, or that he's exonerated. It's in this great mushy middle ground that leaves everybody pretty frustrated. So I think there's daylight between Barr and Mueller. But there's not resolution of the underlying facts.",

Now, according to Food and Drug Administration estimates, at least 80 percent of the active ingredients found in all of America's medicines come from abroad, primarily China. And it's not just the ingredients. China wants to become the world's dominant generic drugmaker. Ninety percent of America's prescriptions are for generic versions. So far, Chinese companies are manufacturing generics for everything from high blood pressure meds to cancer drugs. Now, the author of \"China Rx,\" Rosemary Gibson, says this is all part of China's plan. ROSEMARY GIBSON, AUTHOR, \"CHINA RX\": In five to 10 years, when China has a complete choke hold over the United States and its supply of medicine, it's going to be telling us how much to pay for our medicine.

And, as you know, the president and his economic team have long hailed that first-quarter GDP reading as a sign that they say their economic policies are working. That number was revised downward slightly from 3.2 percent initially down to 3.1 percent, though it wasn't revised as low as some economists had been anticipating. Within the last 15, 20 minutes or so, I just spoke with a senior White House official to get the White House's view on all of this. And here's what I was told, Charles. Their take on the downward revision described to me as pretty marginal. The one thing that they take as a positive, when you look under the hood at the numbers from this reading is that personal consumption, those numbers, they think, are going in the right direction, which will bode well, in their estimation, for Q2. By the way, the White House still believes that, this year, the GDP number for the entire year will be at 3.2 percent. Earlier today, before he left for Colorado to speak at the graduation ceremony there at the Air Force Academy, the president took questions from reporters on the South Lawn. And this was his take as it relates to the economy. Watch."

Here's what Clarida said. This especially caught the attention of the market -- quote -- \"If the incoming data were to show a persistent shortfall in inflation, below our 2 percent objective, or were to indicate that global economic and financial developments present a material downside risk to our baseline outlook, then these are developments that the committee would take into account in assessing the appropriate stance for monetary policy.\" Charles, as you know, despite the strong growth numbers that the White House the president, his team have been holding up, the president has also been calling for the Federal Reserve to cut rates."

We are on the cusp of the longest U.S. expansion in U.S. history. And it's been 13 years since we have had 3 percent annualized growth. I think that the president is in the catbird seat right now, because in the battleground states, Charles, you seeing pretty much record low unemployment. We're talking Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio. So I'm not sure what the Democrats can do to combat this, because, across the board, jobless rates are low for all minority groups and for women and including teenagers as well."

To Liz's point, a shrinking of the economy, a recession really matters. George H.W. Bush, although he had very high approval ratings, he was a victim of a recession actually that ended before the election, but wasn't announced until after the election of 1992. But Democrats are going to have to figure out what their economic message is. And it certainly makes life difficult when things are this strong."

It's a lot of things that are destined and they're supposed to get people's attention away from how the economy is doing right now. And we talk a lot about these unemployment rates. And I was reading a really interesting article on NPR today. Detroit, in particular, unemployment is down to 4.4 percent. That is down from 17 percent in 2009. That is a real number. Real people are working more. And I think that that is what people are focused on."

Now they're saying, according to the Congressional Research Service study, that the tax cuts had no impact. I would -- I would look into the footnotes of the study personally. But you wonder about what the Democrat strategy is, because they're coming into this election like the Walter Mondale Democrats. We're going to raise your taxes, we're going to do impeachment, we're going to do big government plans. And the American taxpayer is very, very smart.

I think the American people are tired of the D.C. politics of them personally attacking each other, both Democrats and Republicans and the president. They want it to stop. But what's really important -- and Danielle hit on a key point -- is that they want the facts. We need a baseline agreement of facts. And when it comes to income inequality, that debate is so distorted, Charles. You have pointed us out.

FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was later removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's team for sending the anti-Trump texts, was a central coordinate coordinator for the FBI in the defensive briefing, which included multiple agencies. Three weeks earlier, Strzok had opened the FBI's counterintelligence case into campaign aide George Papadopoulos. These briefings are called defensive briefings. And they're supposed to be designed to warn the campaign of imminent national security threats.

And we don't really even know the full scope, because the way the statute works is that the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, was in a position to kind of approve or disapprove of any expansion to the probe. But I think it's safe to say it never turned inward on itself. It never got to a point where it said, hey, let's talk about Strzok and Page and FISA abuse and all the things that John Durham is now being appointed to look at. So I think daylight is coming. I'm not sure it's a postmortem, as much as it's like a new autopsy. But there's -- there's more coming in terms of that probe, and I suspect that will be in weeks or months, not months or years."

Of course, they didn't have the ability to charge President Trump with a crime on obstruction, but he could have had more of an opinion on this. He did he punt in that -- yesterday, the statement that he made, maybe saying to Congress, listen, I'm not going to go before you, but I will give you something to chew on and leave the door open if you want to take it from here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",

Any time anybody tries to summarize it, you get accused of leaving things out, as Barr well knows, and now Mueller. So I question whether Mueller should have been stepping up to the mics or just issuing a written statement and trying to recede into the background. But the bottom line is, there's all this investigation that goes into obstruction. We now hear that they're saying they felt completely bound to not reach a prosecutorial judgment, based on the OLC opinion. But I'm not sure that is so clear when you read the report. The report says that there were thorny issues of criminal intent on behalf of the president that would have to be resolved. That's a far cry from saying, we sure would have indicted him but, or that he's exonerated. It's in this great mushy middle ground that leaves everybody pretty frustrated. So I think there's daylight between Barr and Mueller. But there's not resolution of the underlying facts."

What do you make of the fact that no one has been charged with obstruction? After all of the witnesses, after all the interviews, no one has been charged with obstruction? Does that mean something?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, look, it's certainly mildly good news for the president that nobody -- consistent with the collusion findings, that nobody was really in harm's way for him or his family or his closest associates. But, obviously, this is an unusual situation, because a prosecution, an investigation leads to the full airing of dirt gathered over a course of years that is certainly damning or hurtful, politically or personally, to the president, although not in a courtroom, where he might have the chance to exonerate himself. So it's a -- it's an unusual situation for what you would normally see in federal prosecutions, all this daylight, and some of the daylight has some pretty dirty facts in it."

      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I mean, the good news for America is, my vote doesn't matter on that. I mean, the reality is, they're going to do what they're going to do. And it seems to me that there's at least an interest in the House of having prolonged airing of some of these facts and accusations and characterizations that may not fit with how a criminal prosecutor would look at it, but do some political damage.

In fact, you can argue it's gotten worse in recent weeks. So how do we reconcile those two things? Does it mean that the more their economy crumbles, the more desperate they will become, the more havoc they can wreak in the region? And, if so, what does that mean for us militarily?"

Yes, the Houthis in Yemen will continue to fire rockets at Riyadh. The Hezbollah will become more active. Hamas will become more active. And, of course, the IRGC, which is already in Syria and Iraq, will continue to target us, much like they did, it looks, two weeks ago there in the Green Zone against our embassy. So, Iran will become more erratic. We just saw the Chinese, interestingly, are going to allow one of their own freighters to come in with Iranian oil. Unfortunately, Beijing's not helping us.

That's what experts are warning. Our painkillers, antibiotics, vitamins, even aspirin can mostly be sourced to a country the Department of Defense recognizes as an adversary. Now, according to Food and Drug Administration estimates, at least 80 percent of the active ingredients found in all of America's medicines come from abroad, primarily China. And it's not just the ingredients. China wants to become the world's dominant generic drugmaker. Ninety percent of America's prescriptions are for generic versions. So far, Chinese companies are manufacturing generics for everything from high blood pressure meds to cancer drugs. Now, the author of \"China Rx,\" Rosemary Gibson, says this is all part of China's plan. ROSEMARY GIBSON, AUTHOR, \"CHINA RX\": In five to 10 years, when China has a complete choke hold over the United States and its supply of medicine, it's going to be telling us how much to pay for our medicine. We will lose control over how much we pay. We will be the price taker, not the price setter. And that's devastating."

Medicines used on our troops and veterans can also be sourced to China. And providers may not even know it, because pharmaceutical manufacturers are not required to disclose where they get their ingredients. Now, in a statement to Fox News, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio says this -- quote -- \"American consumers have a right to know where their ingredients and their medications are coming from, regardless of whether they are brand or generic.\" Charles, the U.S. Commission on China is holding a hearing on this very threat on July 31."

They adopted new rules for the balloting. The super delegates are not voting in the first ballot at that convention. They opened up the debates now with a criteria to kind of encourage a lot of grassroots involvement and fund-raising to qualify with a pretty low bar.

They're like, all right, well, we will do this to the passengers. Now the difference is that if you have below 4.6 rating, which, by the way, I would like a 4.62. And I don't know what I did wrong."

If you have all these passengers that are -- they're disasters, and they're mean, and they could be potentially dangerous to drivers, you don't want them in the back of your car either.
