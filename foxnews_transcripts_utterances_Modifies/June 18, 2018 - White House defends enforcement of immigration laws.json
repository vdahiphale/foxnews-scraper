You have Laura Bush writing something. You have the first lady writing something. Everybody says it's bad. But then you try to read and go down, and you can't find the solution.  I have solutions. You know, A, you have a bus that's right there -- you have a bus right there. You don't want to separate the family? Then you get in the bus. Then you wait for the next family, get on the bus, and then you drive them back. Ironically, it's never in Mexico. It's Honduras, or it's El Salvador. They never stop in Mexico. If you are definitely in danger, wouldn't you stop at the first place you could stop at? Not just go, \"Hey, you know what? We're going to go all the way through.\" Just stop.

Very much a concern in terms of human trafficking.  Obviously, everybody cares about it, and obviously, people don't want families separated from their children. But you do have an obligation to determine the true identity of the individuals coming over. Just because an adult is accompanied with a minor, you can't make the assumption that they are, in fact, related because quite the contrary. The evidence suggests otherwise. So that would be irresponsible and reckless and a matter of public safety and endangerment to a child. So this is -- it's a very difficult issue. I think the legislature does need to act on it expeditiously. It's in everyone's best interests to do so and work cooperatively with the president. Because obviously now, the good news is that the issue is getting a lot of, you know, attention and focus and light on it so that we can do something about it. Right? I mean, this is a country of immigrants, but nevertheless, we've got to ensure the safety of people here, those crossing, et cetera, and observe the laws on the books.",

One thing I was surprised about is that Kirstjen Nielsen -- first, she had excellent facts. That they didn't recognize, just even a week ago, as we started seeing this bubbling up, that they needed to get in front of it.

And yes, I think that tomorrow when the president goes to the Congress, he's going to say, \"I'm going to support these immigration bills. I want you to pass them.\" I hope that it's successful. I'm skeptical, in a way, partly because I heard today that one of the people in leadership thinks it has a 10 percent chance of passing the House and that a bill very similar recently held in the Senate only got 40 votes. So I think they're going to have to either reverse this policy or figure out another way to deal with it while they try to do something with Congress, because now you have a situation where Congress might not be able to pass anything.",

You have Laura Bush writing something. You have the first lady writing something. Everybody says it's bad. But then you try to read and go down, and you can't find the solution. I have solutions. You know, A, you have a bus that's right there -- you have a bus right there. You don't want to separate the family? Then you get in the bus. Then you wait for the next family, get on the bus, and then you drive them back. Ironically, it's never in Mexico. It's Honduras, or it's El Salvador. They never stop in Mexico. If you are definitely in danger, wouldn't you stop at the first place you could stop at? Not just go, \"Hey, you know what? We're going to go all the way through.\" Just stop.

Very much a concern in terms of human trafficking. Obviously, everybody cares about it, and obviously, people don't want families separated from their children. But you do have an obligation to determine the true identity of the individuals coming over. Just because an adult is accompanied with a minor, you can't make the assumption that they are, in fact, related because quite the contrary. The evidence suggests otherwise. So that would be irresponsible and reckless and a matter of public safety and endangerment to a child. So this is -- it's a very difficult issue. I think the legislature does need to act on it expeditiously. It's in everyone's best interests to do so and work cooperatively with the president. Because obviously now, the good news is that the issue is getting a lot of, you know, attention and focus and light on it so that we can do something about it. Right? I mean, this is a country of immigrants, but nevertheless, we've got to ensure the safety of people here, those crossing, et cetera, and observe the laws on the books."

And I understand they had a meeting at 3 p.m. with the president. And it's tense within the White House, because they realize they have a problem. One thing I was surprised about is that Kirstjen Nielsen -- first, she had excellent facts. That they didn't recognize, just even a week ago, as we started seeing this bubbling up, that they needed to get in front of it. So now you have all of these photographs, some released from DHS, some from HHS, some from reporters that have been there, some from members of Congress who have been there. And the photographs drive a lot of things. You remember when the little boy was killed on the crossing, the migrant boy --"

Kirstjen Nielsen was asked, have -- like, what about these photographs? And she said, \"I haven't seen them.\" I think that her staff owes it to her to make sure that she sees them so that she's aware that -- of what everybody out there is seeing and why there's all this reaction. Maybe some of it -- a lot of it based on misreporting."

And I don't think it's fair, necessarily, to say that children are being held in cages, but if you look at the photographs, they are chain-link partitions. So they're being covered with silver mylar blankets, and then you hear this ProPublica audio secretly recorded, maybe inappropriate, but the audio is going to pull at heartstrings tonight. And yes, I think that tomorrow when the president goes to the Congress, he's going to say, \"I'm going to support these immigration bills. I want you to pass them.\" I hope that it's successful. I'm skeptical, in a way, partly because I heard today that one of the people in leadership thinks it has a 10 percent chance of passing the House and that a bill very similar recently held in the Senate only got 40 votes. So I think they're going to have to either reverse this policy or figure out another way to deal with it while they try to do something with Congress, because now you have a situation where Congress might not be able to pass anything."

If you take this off the table -- and I've said this for months -- if you take this off the table, there's nothing left for the Democrats. I am -- I am so tired, though, of people implying that our agents are child abusers. This is something that we just let fly by. Oh, they're not being -- people are doing their best. This is -- imagine somebody coming to your house and dropping off kids. You try to do your best. That's what America is doing. They are dealing with an influx, thousands of kids.
