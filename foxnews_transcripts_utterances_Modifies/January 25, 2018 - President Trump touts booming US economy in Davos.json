I know: What is Davos, you ask? It's the home of the World Economic Forum where world leaders and business executives drink expensive wine, eat fancy meat and throw up in hot tubs. And also tell us what's wrong with us. I was going to go but my Gulfstream has been acting up and my manservant then has an infected uvula.  But these elites won't be giving Trump a warm welcome at all and he's already pissed off at cliffs. Take a look at that. An angry mountain. Swiss activists did that. Pretty funny that there's activists in Switzerland. Please, their biggest problem is being confused for Sweden.",

Our economy is on fire, so much so that Swiss could warm their hands on it. It's cause and effect. Because of the lower corporate tax, now even Starbucks -- Starbucks -- is giving workers raises worth millions. It's funny. A company raises its wages and Democrats go silent. I guess they just want the government to make those decisions. And now, Fiat Chrysler says the U.S. workers -- its U.S. workers will receive two grand in bonuses. This is great news for you and bad news for all those vulnerable Democrats up for reelection who didn't back the bill, which means they can't take any credit. All they can hope for is a reversal of fortunes. That's a sad place to be, rooting for bad news so you might win.  I want to point out that many of us are wearing burgundy today. No reason why.

So let's all work together. Let's do more. What all can we do here? I get the America First, not America alone type of thing. It's not my favorite rhetoric. But on the other side, I think that the leaders who are there -- there's some world leaders there but there's also business leaders. Reality has set in. For a long time they thought, well, President Trump really doesn't want to be president or he doesn't really want to run again. And now they're starting to realize after the first year that he governs very differently than he campaigns, and that they're figuring out a way to work with him, and today there was a roundtable that he did with some business leaders and all of them were like, we've got to invest in the United States and we're planning to increase that.

But these elites won't be giving Trump a warm welcome at all and he's already pissed off at cliffs. Take a look at that. An angry mountain. Swiss activists did that.

Our economy is on fire, so much so that Swiss could warm their hands on it. It's cause and effect. Because of the lower corporate tax, now even Starbucks -- Starbucks -- is giving workers raises worth millions. It's funny. A company raises its wages and Democrats go silent. I guess they just want the government to make those decisions. And now, Fiat Chrysler says the U.S. workers -- its U.S. workers will receive two grand in bonuses. This is great news for you and bad news for all those vulnerable Democrats up for reelection who didn't back the bill, which means they can't take any credit. All they can hope for is a reversal of fortunes. That's a sad place to be, rooting for bad news so you might win. I want to point out that many of us are wearing burgundy today. No reason why.

So let's all work together. Let's do more. What all can we do here? I get the America First, not America alone type of thing. It's not my favorite rhetoric. But on the other side, I think that the leaders who are there -- there's some world leaders there but there's also business leaders. Reality has set in. For a long time they thought, well, President Trump really doesn't want to be president or he doesn't really want to run again. And now they're starting to realize after the first year that he governs very differently than he campaigns, and that they're figuring out a way to work with him, and today there was a roundtable that he did with some business leaders and all of them were like, we've got to invest in the United States and we're planning to increase that.

And there's a lot of positive things happening here that you credit President Trump, including the corporate tax cuts.

It's fantastic that the president is participating and showing up there. Some of the people are quite upset that he's taking the press away from them. But he has wins on his side.

First you usually see a criminal prosecution, you know, the proceeds of civil litigation or some kind of class action could come forward to suspending because there's certainly quite a large number of young girls who were victimized. Then it comes down to these organizations and them being held accountable. What did people know? When do they know it? It does really remind me of Penn State, and you think about it in terms of these abuses, like was someone told? Did they not document it? Did they allow it to continue? So, there's an ability there for them to bring something forward to say, you know, you had a duty to protect and to keep us safe, and yet you put us in a very vulnerable and dangerous, you know, position where we were victimized. And I think that the young women were quite articulate in terms of explaining their position and their vulnerability and using their voice to say that there should be more of a thorough independent investigation to these entities."

No nurse in attendance and no restrictions on what he was doing. And they were told this is what you need to do. If you don't do it, you're going to be punished and you will be penalized in terms of participating with the team. So, what's interesting to me is the statement coming from the president of Michigan State because she's basically saying something that sound reasonable on his face, which is she's the president of a huge, important university, and how was she to know what some miscreant doctor is doing? But on the other hand, you realize \"The Indianapolis Star\" broke the story. Other people have been involved, and it was a very slow response. And I can -- I would think that she should have known at that point something is wrong here. And we've got to protect children. The same thing with the people who are on USA Gymnastics.

The doctor never wore gloves. He's walking around not wearing gloves, alone in hotel rooms. He was the first call they were supposed to make at nighttime. He's isolating them in mandatory camps across the country where they're cutting off communication with their parents, their agents and their lawyers. And the minute you complain, you're told you're not on the team anymore? I mean, it sounds like you're putting a serial pedophile in charge of young girls for decades, and no one saw anything abnormal about it. This is not just Penn-State-level scandal.

And I guess Democrats probably think that if they had a chance that this would be their time, but I don't know. I don't think that -- I don't think Democrats want to go backwards. I think they want to look for somebody new, and John Kerry is not going to fit that bill.

The reason why we have these brains is because we ate so much meat for 200,000 years.
