The president starting today by tweeting about Democrat Dianne Feinstein, leaking that transcript of testimony, declaring: \"The fact that sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has, on numerous occasions, stated that collusion between Trump and Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly legal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. Must have tough primary!\" Meaning back in California. Then, the president used a joint news conference with the prime minister of Norway to reiterate his claim that the U.S. looks bad on the world stage because of all these various probes into Russia, including Robert Mueller's investigation. The president hedging on a one on one with Mueller by saying, where there is no collusion, it is unlikely there would be an interview at all, suggesting Hillary Clinton was treated with kid gloves by the FBI when she was interviewed over her e-mail server.",

And President Trump last year made it clear that we're going to stand by the constitution. Congress writes the laws.

Honestly, I think the leadership that President Trump is providing on this issue is making it possible for us to move forward on priorities the president's expressed since the days of the campaign.   Look, the American people want us to build a wall. They want border security. They want to end the flow of illegal immigrants into this country, and also illicit drugs that are tearing apart families and communities across this country. They also, in the wake of those terrorist attacks in this country recently, they want us to end the visa lottery program. They want us to reform and end chain migration in this country. And ultimately, I think the American people also want us to feel compassionately with the issue of DACA.  What the American people saw yesterday is, frankly, what I see every day as his vice president, and one meeting after another is President Trump bringing together people from diverse points of view, driving toward an objective.

On the other side, some of the president's biggest supporters when it comes to immigration, initially, during the campaign for sure, Ann Coulter, Tucker Carlson, on our own network, were really felt very betrayed by what the president said at that table yesterday. That he sort of gave away the farm on the issue. That he said just bring me something, bring me whatever you want and I'll sign it. I'll offer a pathway to citizenship.

Obama tried it, couldn't do it. Bush tried it, couldn't do it. Donald Trump will be the president that can do it. He's got credibility on the border security issue that nobody else has.

And I urge everyone to read it because I think that we do have to look at both sides of this equation here. And they make some very sound arguments about what the end game would be if we just get rid of any kind of propositioning. And there does have to be a line between sexual assault and cat calling. In France, right now, they're deciding that they want to make cat calling a crime with fine for men who happen to do it. And in this letter they make the point that, look, sex and sexual nature is wild and aggressive because we're human beings and that's the way taht we're wired. But how we deal with that as a civil society and women standing up for themselves and saying no is the issue. Now, you can't always do that if you're in a situation where Harvey Weinstein is running the whole show and your life depends on getting a job from him. However, the broad brush approach to this that we've gone into, the man hating, all men are wrong, any accusation should be believed without any kind of evidence, that is I think what they're pushing back here.",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENCE",
      "utterance": "Well, we believe that decision was wrongly decided once again. Another West Coast judge is rendered a decision that would go to the Supreme Court we're sure would be overturned. Even President Obama said on multiple occasions that he did not have the authority, through executive action, to extend protection through DACA. And President Trump last year made it clear that we're going to stand by the constitution. Congress writes the laws. The president implements and upholds and executes the law, and we're confident the Supreme Court would uphold that. But our hope is, as you saw yesterday, is to continue a dialogue with Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill and call on the Congress to come together to address issues of border security, to make the necessary changes -- chain migration, visa lottery, and also deal with the DACA issue with the compassion."

But what does this do to your leverage when in the middle of that moment this judge said, basically, that issue is off the table."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENCE",
      "utterance": "We really don't think it affects it in any way. Because, we believe that ultimately, this decision has to be made by the Congress of the United States. And that the Supreme Court of the United States would uphold that. Clearly, under our constitution, the Congress writes the laws, and the president executes them, and implements them, and upholds them. We're confident the court would do that. Honestly, I think the leadership that President Trump is providing on this issue is making it possible for us to move forward on priorities the president's expressed since the days of the campaign. Look, the American people want us to build a wall. They want border security. They want to end the flow of illegal immigrants into this country, and also illicit drugs that are tearing apart families and communities across this country. They also, in the wake of those terrorist attacks in this country recently, they want us to end the visa lottery program. They want us to reform and end chain migration in this country. And ultimately, I think the American people also want us to feel compassionately with the issue of DACA. What the American people saw yesterday is, frankly, what I see every day as his vice president, and one meeting after another is President Trump bringing together people from diverse points of view, driving toward an objective. And we're confident, we're confident that even before the president's deadline of March is reached that we'll be able to achieve an outcome and will give credit to all those priorities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Two elements of yesterday. One was exactly what you say in the wake of the Michael Wolff book, which portrayed the president as someone who is unfit for office. He clearly demonstrated the command that he has of the issues and the negotiating ability that he was sitting at that table. And I think it went a long way towards dispelling some of those notions yesterday. On the other side, some of the president's biggest supporters when it comes to immigration, initially, during the campaign for sure, Ann Coulter, Tucker Carlson, on our own network, were really felt very betrayed by what the president said at that table yesterday. That he sort of gave away the farm on the issue. That he said just bring me something, bring me whatever you want and I'll sign it. I'll offer a pathway to citizenship. They felt that the issue of the wall and creating a border that is impenetrable, and sending people backward here illegal was swept away yesterday."

That -- this president, this administration, are absolutely committed to keeping promises we made to the American people. As the president said last weekend at Camp David, there's no DACA fix without a wall. We're going to build a wall. We're going to end chain migration. We're going to end the visa lottery program. And we're going to deal with DACA, but we're going to do it in a way that will meet the expectations of the American people. I have to tell you that what the American people saw yesterday is something that, you know, as I said before, I see every day. As vice president, I spend three, four hours a day with the president, often times in the oval office and in meetings near the oval office. And I'm absolutely confident, on this issue and on a broad range of issue, whether it'd be infrastructure, rebuilding our military. This president is going to continue to bring that great leadership quality he has to bear. Leadership that has resulted in a growing economy and restored American credibility in the world, and we're going to solve this issue, and keep America moving forward."

I think what we believe is going to be possible, as we make progress in reaching a bipartisan solution on these immigration issues, that that's going to facilitate us making the kind of funding agreement possible in the Congress to move forward. It's absolutely essential that Congress step up, pass a spending bill to rebuild our military at the level that President Trump has been driving. Look, we have many challenges across the wider world. I'll be traveling to the Middle East in the coming weeks. I'll be traveling to the Olympics in South Korea next month. I mean, now, is the time as we started last year, to make a historic investment in our military, and President Trump is absolutely committed to reaching a bipartisan agreement to pass that spending bill, even while we work through these other issues on immigration."

That we start breaking chain migration. That we get a deal that represents where the American people are. 83 percent of the American people support a pathway to citizenship. Overwhelming numbers support border security. I think most people think the diversity lottery is kind of crazy. This president is no longer a candidate. He's the president of all of us. You can't get this problem fixed without working with Democrats. You need 60 votes. And what I saw yesterday, was a man who understood the issue, was in command of the room, listened intently, is going to take this country to a solution. For ten years, I've been working on this. Obama tried it, couldn't do it. Bush tried it, couldn't do it. Donald Trump will be the president that can do it. He's got credibility on the border security issue that nobody else has. He does have compassion in his heart for these kids. We're going to get a good deal under his leadership.

So, I'm not sure whether Cohen got the authorization at his client, the president, to file this lawsuit. The lawsuit will, in the end, I believe, be withdrawn because I don't think that Cohen's going to want to allow the critical witness to this lawsuit.

It sounds to me like this is a bluff. Now, there are changes in the libel laws that should be made. For example, you can say anything about anybody as long as you put it in court papers, and that exempts it from libel. And a lot of unethical people and unethical lawyers do that. They hide defamation in lawsuits and that should be changed. There are other improvements that can be made to defamation laws.

That's unacceptable. President Trump has brought unprecedented economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on the regime in Pyongyang. We'll continue to do that. Part of my message in going is going to be to stand with those American athletes and know that we're cheering them on and wishing them well.

President Trump had the courage of his convictions to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It will be my great honor as vice president to visit and affirm that decision. That being said, the president also in making that decision, Martha, I said if the parties can agree on a two-state solution that we'll support it. That the president recommitted the United States to engagement in the peace process. And what I'll tell President el-Sisi and King Abdullah and other leaders in the region is that we remain committed to peace.

The appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, more court of appeals justices in a single year than any president in history. Historic tax cuts, all of which has created an environment where 2 million new jobs, unemployment at a 17 year low. You reflected on African-American unemployment is at a 17 year low as well in this country. We're making tremendous progress.

We believe that the freedom to say no to a sexual proposition cannot exist without the freedom to bother.

And they make some very sound arguments about what the end game would be if we just get rid of any kind of propositioning. And there does have to be a line between sexual assault and cat calling. In France, right now, they're deciding that they want to make cat calling a crime with fine for men who happen to do it. And in this letter they make the point that, look, sex and sexual nature is wild and aggressive because we're human beings and that's the way taht we're wired. But how we deal with that as a civil society and women standing up for themselves and saying no is the issue. Now, you can't always do that if you're in a situation where Harvey Weinstein is running the whole show and your life depends on getting a job from him. However, the broad brush approach to this that we've gone into, the man hating, all men are wrong, any accusation should be believed without any kind of evidence, that is I think what they're pushing back here."

Robert Johnson, the media educator at Syracuse University, said he presented some examples of \"Mash\" and \"Cheers,\" the one that we've just showed, and his students, when he saw what's happening in these shows were horrified. Here's two examples. One is Pepe Le Pew, which you probably remember, he's always going after Penelope. And then, there is a little clip from \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" Watch."

But they were always giving her a hard time. But Charlie, you know, it's like the students watching this and they see things very differently than we did growing up."

      "utterance": "Unfortunately, I think a big part of that is the fact that they see everything through sort of a legal lens, or an H.R. lens, or some sort of lens that sort of takes away all of the human aspects. At the end of the day -- we talked about this before, at the end of the day, it is all about human decency and it's about respecting one another, and if you follow those basic rules about respecting one another, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna work out just fine. But when people clearly go over the line, it's obvious. What Harvey Weinstein did, to the potted plant in front of the poor woman that he's with in the kitchen, you know, that's just unacceptable in any circumstance. Pepe Le Pew would never have done that."

But more on the serious note, I don't think you have to look back in time, pop culture in America to see this problem. If you look at recent Hollywood films that are out today, the objectification of women is a center of Hollywood now. And until that changes, until sex is not the center of what they do in Hollywood, I just don't see the attitude around using women for that purpose changes either."

It shows Oprah Winfrey with 48 percent, Donald J. Trump, president of the United States of America, at 38 percent, and 14 percent undecided, which means they could throw that whole thing either way once they made up their mind. Here now Karl Rove, former deputy chief of staff to George W. Bush, and a Fox News contributor. Good evening, Karl. We have you back on white board Oprah Watch tonight. What do you make of those numbers?"

      "utterance": "All right. We'll look at some numbers. We'll look at some numbers. You're right, 48-38. Don't know how good the poll is. But I do know this, last March, Quinnipiac said do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Oprah Winfrey, 52 favorable, 23 unfavorable, 25 didn't know enough to offer an opinion. You want her to run for president, 69 percent said no, 21 percent said yes. So, while they liked her 2 to 1, the object of running for president, there's a big difference between just sort of being popped into one of these surveys and then, actually, do people want you to run? Look, more important than that, we're three years, just over three years -- just under three years away from the presidential election. We're probably a year and a half away from the presidential primaries starting to get going. So what is the utility of a poll now doing a matchup for 2020? How likely is a head to head matchup gonna tell us what will happen in three years? I think it's down near Oprah -- I mean, zero. Zero."

      "utterance": "All right. So let's talk about something a little more practical and right in front of us. As you look towards the midterm, the Ohio race is shaping up to be the White House versus Mitch McConnell again, because the White House seems to be circling around Jim Renacci who was going to run for governor, and today decided to run for senate. Then you've got J.D. Vance of Hillbilly Elegy fame who Mitch McConnell is backing. Your quick thoughts on that before I let you go?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not certain -- look, first of all, I like Jim Renacci a lot. If you look back in his dark history, guess who -- I think the first person to go in and speak at a fund-raiser for him when he ran in 2010. That might be me. So I like him. A good man. I was taken aback a little when he said he would get in the race if the president asked him. He's jumping in the race. I'm not sure the president is going to get involved in this primary. And we've got until a couple more weeks until the filing deadline, and then the primary much later in the year."

She said this, \"The day will come when man will recognize women as his peer. Not only on the fireside, but in the council of the nation. Then, and not only until then will there be the perfect comradeship, the ideal union between the sexes that shall result in the highest development of the race.\" Amen to that. Email me yours at TheStory@foxnews.com with your name and your town. Thanks for joining us tonight. That's \"The Story.\" Tucker is up next.
