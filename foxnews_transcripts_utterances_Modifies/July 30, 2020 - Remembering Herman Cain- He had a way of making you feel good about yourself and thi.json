And a lot of it has to do with stimulus round three, four or five, whatever you want to call it, at least a trillion bucks that we're talking about here.  Nancy Pelosi has already been planning to meet with Steve Mnuchin, obviously others at the White House, Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. They're trying to come up with a way to bridge the gap, particularly on these jobless benefits, whether they continue at $600 a week at the federal level, or they start paring them down.  One thing is sure. They're a little closer than where they used to be. But time's running out to get anything done, so that it can take effect because time, as I say, is running out.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" We have a crazy market day to tell you about too, responding to all these crosscurrents and developments, and the president talking about possibly postponing the election, and Republicans and Democrats coming down hard on him over those remarks.  We are going to get a gauge of that and the fallout of that, because it did affect your money for a brief while today. In the meantime, these stimulus talks and where they stand, another coronavirus relief bill, where they're arguing over the details and the dollar signs.  Chad Pergram with more on that.

We have just gotten word in the past few minutes that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was at the funeral of John Lewis in Atlanta today, she's going to meet again with the secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, and the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, later tonight.   But what's developed in the past hour or two here is that the Senate is going to start debate. They had a procedural vote this afternoon to pry loose the House-passed $3 trillion coronavirus bill from May. Now, they're not actually going to consider that bill. But what they're going to do, they're going to take that bill and start next week, strip it down to its studs, and put in provisions, interim provisions here, to extend unemployment benefits on an interim basis. What this means is that the $600, that's going to expire, because the Senate is gone. The Senate is going to leave here in just a couple of hours here for the weekend. But that's gone. But they're going to start this next week. They're trying to dare Democrats to vote against this.  Here is the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.",

This battle back and forth, whether it's going to be a trillion dollars, whether it's going to be $3-$3.5 trillion, it is a lot of money we don't really have. I mean, we have poured about $10 trillion into coronavirus relief, if you add the trillions the Federal Reserve has spent to shore up and buy everything from regular bonds to corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and on top of these congressional measures.

I mean, keep in mind that the budget of the United States every single year, the ones we used to write at the Office of Management and Budget, were about $1.2-$1.3 trillion. The government spends more than that. We spend about $4.5 trillion, but most of that is Medicare and Social Security.   But the actual appropriated budget is only $1.2-$1.3-$1.4 trillion a year. So, they're talking about a package that is at least as big as that done in a matter of only a couple of weeks. I think Secretary Mnuchin is right to be fighting back against this $3 trillion absurdity in the House.  But the bottom line here is, whatever they do spend is going right to the bottom line in terms of the debt and the deficit, and the interest payment responsibilities for next generation. So, I think they're right to sort of take a deep breath and say, wait a second, do we really need to spend this much money?",

Unemployment insurance is run through the states, and that is continuing.  This is a federal supplement, a kicker on top of that. So, the $600 that we have had since, I think, March or April is on top of the ordinary benefits. Keep in mind, during the financial crisis, the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, when the Democrats were in charge of everything, they didn't do $200 worth of supplemental payments.   There's a lot of politics behind this, Neil, believe it or not. Nancy Pelosi really doesn't want to see Donald Trump elected. And if she can try and make a political issue here and make hay, she's absolutely going to do that.  I actually think you would see them be talking about a smaller package if there were a Democrat in the White House, because they understand what the cost is. And the proof of that is, that's what they did the last time we went down this road. So, I think that does get lost, the fact that the Democrats did less than this when they were in charge, and that it's a -- it's a kicker on top of this. People are not going to be left out in the cold. This was a supplement. Is the economy struggling? Absolutely. The numbers you saw today are historic.

Plus, as I think you have reported on the show earlier in the day, more than a trillion dollars of the CARES Act money isn't even out the door yet. So, there's a trillion dollars that they appropriated or they approved in April that hasn't hit the economy yet.  So, that money is all -- hasn't left, has not had the impact yet. You don't know if we need the additional money or not. Again, I think discretion is the better part of valor here.  And, besides, any -- any stimulus you do now, Neil, is going to have a real hard time affecting the economy before the election anyway.

Go back and look at the last Biden-Obama budget, and what did they predict for unemployment right now? Certainly, it wasn't as high as it was because of COVID, but, back before COVID, Biden thought the unemployment would be higher.  They thought growth wouldn't be lower. They didn't know how to get to 2.5 or 3.5 or 3 percent growth. They were just -- they were talking about that new normal. The country was graying, productivity was down permanently.

And they each have their spin on it.  The governor's spin is, the feds are calling home. The feds' spin is, well, we're still here. We're going to wait and see what happens. At some point, they have other things to do, the federal troops that are there, and, at some point, they will leave. They are probably on federal property. Neil, when they're on federal property, and they're protecting federal property, they have every right to do so. But when they leave federal property and engage demonstrators or try to enforce domestic law, against the wishes of the governor or the legislature -- I'm quoting the Constitution now -- this is not me -- they have no right to do so.

There's the people that want to destroy property to make -- somehow make their point that black lives matter. There's the people that want to express political opinion, basically dissent. That's constitutionally protected, and the government must protect it. There's the absence of police, local and state, in the Portland area, in the Portland -- in this particular six-block area. They should be there. They should be there to stop violence and to protect the demonstrators. Add to that the fence. The president, I think, was animated. He couldn't stand seeing the violence. He wanted to bring about law and order. Guess what? That's not a federal responsibility, under the Constitution. I think that the governor of Oregon has persuaded the secretary of DHS that that is so. It's not even a close call as to whether that's a federal responsibility. The only federal responsibility in that area is protecting federal assets, which is the federal courthouse, a series of buildings owned by the federal government. On the other hand, the streets have to be safe. And the local police and state police have to maintain some semblance of order, so that demonstrators are not hurt, and so that people who want to cause violence are arrested.",

So, students can be in their dorms, have some activities, but take many of the courses online, unless there are laboratories or experiential type of learning that they need to come on campus. So, very limited. The class sizes are going to be significantly smaller. So think about a class of 20 students, it could be 10 of them are present face to face, and balance of the month taking the courses online.",

He had been diagnosed, tested positive a little more than a few weeks ago. It was a fast descent for a man who had a fast and incredible life. In his young 74 years, Herman Cain changed the way we looked at African- American businessmen and success stories. He was the head of a pizza giant, but he never gained a pound. He had views on stirring economic growth, but he never had a political axe to grind. When others would rip up his ideas, he would stick to the ideas, usually with a joke, usually with a quick zinger and, when it came to me over the years, with a quick reminder, everything in balance, Neil, and in the fast- food industry, that includes you and ordering so many hamburgers. He had a way of making you feel good, not only about yourself, but this country. He was optimistic, he was upbeat, and he never doubted that we would come through this virus, just like he never doubted we would come through all of these protests. At our core, he would tell me, we were and are good people, all of us. We just bug each other sometimes. Over the years, we bugged each other a lot of times.

And a lot of it has to do with stimulus round three, four or five, whatever you want to call it, at least a trillion bucks that we're talking about here. Nancy Pelosi has already been planning to meet with Steve Mnuchin, obviously others at the White House, Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. They're trying to come up with a way to bridge the gap, particularly on these jobless benefits, whether they continue at $600 a week at the federal level, or they start paring them down. One thing is sure. They're a little closer than where they used to be. But time's running out to get anything done, so that it can take effect because time, as I say, is running out. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" We have a crazy market day to tell you about too, responding to all these crosscurrents and developments, and the president talking about possibly postponing the election, and Republicans and Democrats coming down hard on him over those remarks. We are going to get a gauge of that and the fallout of that, because it did affect your money for a brief while today.

We have just gotten word in the past few minutes that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was at the funeral of John Lewis in Atlanta today, she's going to meet again with the secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, and the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, later tonight. But what's developed in the past hour or two here is that the Senate is going to start debate. They had a procedural vote this afternoon to pry loose the House-passed $3 trillion coronavirus bill from May. Now, they're not actually going to consider that bill. But what they're going to do, they're going to take that bill and start next week, strip it down to its studs, and put in provisions, interim provisions here, to extend unemployment benefits on an interim basis. What this means is that the $600, that's going to expire, because the Senate is gone. The Senate is going to leave here in just a couple of hours here for the weekend. But that's gone. But they're going to start this next week. They're trying to dare Democrats to vote against this. Here is the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell."

And to get something out of the Senate, you're going to have to have 60 votes. There's only 53 votes on the Republican side of the aisle. And Mitch McConnell said on our air yesterday that he has about 20 senators who don't want to do anything. So maybe this is an interim, narrow, very skinny type of proposal here, but they would still need Democratic assistance. And if they don't get over a filibuster next week, they can then turn this back around on the Democrats later next week -- Neil."

This battle back and forth, whether it's going to be a trillion dollars, whether it's going to be $3-$3.5 trillion, it is a lot of money we don't really have. I mean, we have poured about $10 trillion into coronavirus relief, if you add the trillions the Federal Reserve has spent to shore up and buy everything from regular bonds to corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and on top of these congressional measures.

I mean, keep in mind that the budget of the United States every single year, the ones we used to write at the Office of Management and Budget, were about $1.2-$1.3 trillion. The government spends more than that. We spend about $4.5 trillion, but most of that is Medicare and Social Security. But the actual appropriated budget is only $1.2-$1.3-$1.4 trillion a year. So, they're talking about a package that is at least as big as that done in a matter of only a couple of weeks. I think Secretary Mnuchin is right to be fighting back against this $3 trillion absurdity in the House. But the bottom line here is, whatever they do spend is going right to the bottom line in terms of the debt and the deficit, and the interest payment responsibilities for next generation. So, I think they're right to sort of take a deep breath and say, wait a second, do we really need to spend this much money?"

The jobless claims were up week over week for the second week in a row. And I'm wondering whether that is hurting Republicans' argument to stop them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Well, keep in mind -- and I think you have hit the nail on the head here. This is a federal supplement. This is not everything that goes into unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is run through the states, and that is continuing. This is a federal supplement, a kicker on top of that. So, the $600 that we have had since, I think, March or April is on top of the ordinary benefits. Keep in mind, during the financial crisis, the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, when the Democrats were in charge of everything, they didn't do $200 worth of supplemental payments. There's a lot of politics behind this, Neil, believe it or not. Nancy Pelosi really doesn't want to see Donald Trump elected. And if she can try and make a political issue here and make hay, she's absolutely going to do that. I actually think you would see them be talking about a smaller package if there were a Democrat in the White House, because they understand what the cost is. And the proof of that is, that's what they did the last time we went down this road. So, I think that does get lost, the fact that the Democrats did less than this when they were in charge, and that it's a -- it's a kicker on top of this. People are not going to be left out in the cold. This was a supplement. Is the economy struggling? Absolutely. The numbers you saw today are historic. But does it have the ability to come back quickly? It absolutely does."

But keep in mind, one of the things I -- one of the reasons I think you're seeing some optimism still in the markets is that good news on a vaccine or good news on a therapeutic could change people's psychology. Keep in mind, this is a health care crisis. There's no question. It's an economic crisis."

    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "But there's a huge psychological component here. If people were not as afraid to go back to work, you could see things turn around clearly. Plus, as I think you have reported on the show earlier in the day, more than a trillion dollars of the CARES Act money isn't even out the door yet. So, there's a trillion dollars that they appropriated or they approved in April that hasn't hit the economy yet. So, that money is all -- hasn't left, has not had the impact yet. You don't know if we need the additional money or not. Again, I think discretion is the better part of valor here. And, besides, any -- any stimulus you do now, Neil, is going to have a real hard time affecting the economy before the election anyway. So, we should be looking at the economics of this, and not the politics. And the economics may dictate it's better to wait and see."

And he's gone on to say the same about the stock market surge, the comeback we have had since the virus, that too, amid talk that the former vice president wants to raise taxes, certainly corporate taxes from 21 to 28 percent. He has similarly said, you can kiss your 401(k) goodbye too in that -- in that environment. Do you buy that? Do you think that a Joe Biden presidency will tank the markets and the economy?"

When you do a federal budget, you don't just do that year. You do a projection for 10 years out. At least that's been the custom for a long time. Go back and look at the last Biden-Obama budget, and what did they predict for unemployment right now? Certainly, it wasn't as high as it was because of COVID, but, back before COVID, Biden thought the unemployment would be higher. They thought growth wouldn't be lower. They didn't know how to get to 2.5 or 3.5 or 3 percent growth. They were just -- they were talking about that new normal. The country was graying, productivity was down permanently. It was an anemic outlook on the future of the country. Remember, they were there eight years. And what did you have? You had the slowest recovery in history.

On day one of the Obama Biden administration, if you go to the end of that, they actually lost net manufacturing jobs. So, the proof is there, Neil. Listen, I get it. And I know folks want to criticize the president for that. But you actually have a template here. Joe Biden's been in Washington a long time. You can go back and see what the previous administration did. And that's your choice. Do you really trust that group to sort of take you out of this COVID recession? Or do you trust somebody else?

And they each have their spin on it. The governor's spin is, the feds are calling home. The feds' spin is, well, we're still here. We're going to wait and see what happens. At some point, they have other things to do, the federal troops that are there, and, at some point, they will leave. They are probably on federal property. Neil, when they're on federal property, and they're protecting federal property, they have every right to do so. But when they leave federal property and engage demonstrators or try to enforce domestic law, against the wishes of the governor or the legislature -- I'm quoting the Constitution now -- this is not me -- they have no right to do so.

That's constitutionally protected, and the government must protect it. There's the absence of police, local and state, in the Portland area, in the Portland -- in this particular six-block area. They should be there. They should be there to stop violence and to protect the demonstrators. Add to that the fence. The president, I think, was animated. He couldn't stand seeing the violence. He wanted to bring about law and order. Guess what? That's not a federal responsibility, under the Constitution. I think that the governor of Oregon has persuaded the secretary of DHS that that is so. It's not even a close call as to whether that's a federal responsibility. The only federal responsibility in that area is protecting federal assets, which is the federal courthouse, a series of buildings owned by the federal government. On the other hand, the streets have to be safe. And the local police and state police have to maintain some semblance of order, so that demonstrators are not hurt, and so that people who want to cause violence are arrested."

      "utterance": "Of course. That's the main reason. A lot of Americans are hurting right now. More than 40 million unemployed lost their jobs due to not their fault, or the economy was wonderful, and , suddenly, this happened. So, as a result, we need to do whatever we can to help our students."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOUSHMAND",
      "utterance": "Yes, that we are going to have in-person, hybrid. We have purchased a number of tests -- testings. We have set aside a 300- bed dorm as an isolation room, in case our students get hurt or come down with disease. We have got contact tracing set up. And we have also food deliveries that can be boxed and delivered to individual rooms. So, students can be in their dorms, have some activities, but take many of the courses online, unless there are laboratories or experiential type of learning that they need to come on campus. So, very limited. The class sizes are going to be significantly smaller. So think about a class of 20 students, it could be 10 of them are present face to face, and balance of the month taking the courses online."

They know what they're doing. And that's their -- that's their approach. But, for us, we are a blue-collar institution. And we really have to take care of our people, because, if we don't, they just don't -- don't come. And it's that simple. Not everybody can go to Harvard."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, that was a very polite way to not trash Harvard. You handled that very well. Dr. Ali Houshmand, thank you very much, the Rowan University president, sharing some news with a lot of incoming students and their parents at least, that you're welcome back, classes in person, and tuition cut 10 percent. You don't see too much of that these days. We will have a lot more on the impact of that kind of stuff and the impact of one Herman Cain. You know, conservatives and liberals loved him. How was that possible? We lost him, and both sides are now wondering, what happened?"

      "utterance": "My late Italian dad used to say, you can tell the measure of a man by how he treats people who don't like him vs. those who do. Herman Cain stood out in life for winning over liberals and conservatives alike, many times not sharing his views, but liking the guy who had them. Herman died this morning of COVID-19. He had been diagnosed, tested positive a little more than a few weeks ago. It was a fast descent for a man who had a fast and incredible life. In his young 74 years, Herman Cain changed the way we looked at African- American businessmen and success stories. He was the head of a pizza giant, but he never gained a pound. He had views on stirring economic growth, but he never had a political axe to grind. When others would rip up his ideas, he would stick to the ideas, usually with a joke, usually with a quick zinger and, when it came to me over the years, with a quick reminder, everything in balance, Neil, and in the fast- food industry, that includes you and ordering so many hamburgers. He had a way of making you feel good, not only about yourself, but this country. He was optimistic, he was upbeat, and he never doubted that we would come through this virus, just like he never doubted we would come through all of these protests. At our core, he would tell me, we were and are good people, all of us. We just bug each other sometimes. Over the years, we bugged each other a lot of times. Let's look back at Herman, an incredible life."

We're crazy about the Constitution, the Declaration, and we're crazy about freedom and liberty. The difference between businesspeople getting elected to office at all levels is that they know how to solve problems. They know how to cut through the clutter and solve problems. We don't have any problem-solvers in Washington, D.C. All we have are politicians in Washington, D.C. I worked my way up the corporate ladder when I was at Burger King to become a vice president. I worked my way up a second time to become a vice president with Burger King Corporation. And then, when I was made president of Godfather's Pizza, we were looking bankruptcy right between the eyes."

Of all the liberal critics, who would always say, there's no way to pay for your 9-9-9 plan, Herman Cain, when he was running for president and all of that, he would say, they doth protest too much, but they know not what they do. He'd laugh. I'd laugh. Even the people who were criticizing him would laugh, because you just couldn't help it. He was that kind of guy. He was bipartisan when no one was. He was fair and balanced with all, when no one could even try. And he's gone. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
