Two years ago when the Republicans held the House, there was this. And now on Wednesday when we lose there is this.  So true. But get this. There were protests but not from the losing side, but the actual winners. Making them the world's biggest losers at winning.  This protest took place on Thursday. They were howling over Trump firing Jeff Sessions. He was attorney general for 636 days in Trump's White House that is a long time. It is 63.5 Scaramucci's. So how desperate and lonely does the liberal have to be to protest the firing of a right winger? I mean, they are sad that Sessions is gone. He's to the right of Genghis Khan. He would give you the electric chair for wearing sandals to work.  I'm pretty sure he hunts vegans on a private island. Nude vegans. So if that's - I don't know why I added that. So if that's what leftists do when they win what would they have done if they had lost? I really feel bad for Cher. She just got new tear ducts. So it really is a lesson about losing and winning and it's the loss on life's true losers, the left, they can't stand to win. That would mean they couldn't whine.  Here's the Chairman of the Democratic Party being told he's won the House, but not the Senate.   You give them the House and they storm yours. You extend a hand in they give you the finger. But for us it's just another day. We actually have lives. You know when I first heard the Dems won, it hurt. I had no choice but to do this.",

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "sentences": "What can I say? I like peanut butter and jelly. So even when we lose, we know we will when the next time, plus we see the bright side everywhere. For example, with the House during blue, Donald Trump really actually has a new friend, a new foil. It's like when the Jeffersons moved next door to Archie Bunker. A lot of people don't remember that, and isn't it more fun to play tennis against another person and not a garage door even if that person is Nancy Pelosi? All right. Maybe not. More good news. Three leaders of the Kavanaugh witch trials got booted.  That's a great message. The message put fairness behind self- righteousness, suspend due process and you're out on your cowardly ass. I hope there next job is serving beer. I love beer.   Finally, the other silver lining, the most beloved progressive of all lost.  Beto. The media called Beto Kennedy-esque and they were not referring to his driving. He was a rock star without the herpes. I'm glad he lost if only to drive his celebrity fans who never heard of him until a few months ago nuts. See this mysterious space object. Harvard researchers believe it might be an alien spacecraft. No, that's Beto leaving for his home planet.  With Beto, when you see that kind of hype, you knew there's less there than meets the eye. When the media and celebrities join together over a candidate, you know he or she is going to be to the left of anyone with a pulse - or Madonna. Compare that to - oh, I insult Madonna and you are like - geez Louise. Compare that to Trump, he got the most media attention of anyone and it was free but mostly negative which proves if the media tells you one thing, you'll always do the other. No one hyped Trump as the next great thing. Hardly, the media turned circus promoters and wall-to-wall clowned him and that clown wiped the floor with Hillary's e-mails. So maybe there the lesson here for Dems? Trump won because for all of his faults, he was real. The Dems current crop of candidates for 2020 aren't.  They are like pool toys -- worthless -- just waiting to be inflated. But maybe they will figure it out. My suggestion, go for the exciting voices of your party. Or maybe this, or perhaps this. Hamster as VP? Why not?  We almost had Tim Kaine.  Let's welcome tonight's guests. He is so sharp - he is so sharp he can poke holes in water, that's TV writer and producer Rob Long. First-time guest, he's a patriotic, he once dated the statue of liberty, author of \"Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump,\" former Secret Service agent, Dan Bongino.  She is so bright you can see her thoughts from space, national security analyst Morgan Ortagus. And unlike the Democrats, he could literally flip a house. Former WWE superstar and my massive sidekick, Tyrus. All right, Rob. Give me your take on this week on the outcome.",

You can change your race and gender aplenty, so why not slash or age by 20?  His name is Emil Rattleband. He is 69 years old and he is suing to legally knock 20 years off his age. And he gives a whole lot of reasons why. His doctors tell him, he is biologically 45. He suffers from age discrimination. No job offers and also no dates. He quotes, \"When I'm on Tinder and it says I'm 69, I don't get an answer but when I'm 49 with the face I have, I'll be in a luxurious position.\" A local court is expected to make a ruling in a few weeks. But given that Rachel Dolezal, remember her, a white lady who claims she's black, why can't an old man declare himself young or how about the opposite? For more we go to Brad Von Bradley, a 24 -year-old who now self-identifies as an 88 -year-old man. Brad, how are you?",

Two years ago when the Republicans held the House, there was this. And now on Wednesday when we lose there is this. So true. But get this. There were protests but not from the losing side, but the actual winners. Making them the world's biggest losers at winning.  This protest took place on Thursday. They were howling over Trump firing Jeff Sessions. He was attorney general for 636 days in Trump's White House that is a long time. It is 63.5 Scaramucci's. So how desperate and lonely does the liberal have to be to protest the firing of a right winger? I mean, they are sad that Sessions is gone. He's to the right of Genghis Khan. He would give you the electric chair for wearing sandals to work. I'm pretty sure he hunts vegans on a private island. Nude vegans. So if that's - I don't know why I added that. So if that's what leftists do when they win what would they have done if they had lost? I really feel bad for Cher. She just got new tear ducts. So it really is a lesson about losing and winning and it's the loss on life's true losers, the left, they can't stand to win. That would mean they couldn't whine.  Here's the Chairman of the Democratic Party being told he's won the House, but not the Senate. You give them the House and they storm yours. You extend a hand in they give you the finger. But for us it's just another day. We actually have lives. You know when I first heard the Dems won, it hurt. I had no choice but to do this."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "What can I say? I like peanut butter and jelly. So even when we lose, we know we will when the next time, plus we see the bright side everywhere. For example, with the House during blue, Donald Trump really actually has a new friend, a new foil. It's like when the Jeffersons moved next door to Archie Bunker. A lot of people don't remember that, and isn't it more fun to play tennis against another person and not a garage door even if that person is Nancy Pelosi? All right. Maybe not. More good news. Three leaders of the Kavanaugh witch trials got booted.  That's a great message. The message put fairness behind self- righteousness, suspend due process and you're out on your cowardly ass. I hope there next job is serving beer. I love beer. Finally, the other silver lining, the most beloved progressive of all lost.  Beto. The media called Beto Kennedy-esque and they were not referring to his driving. He was a rock star without the herpes. I'm glad he lost if only to drive his celebrity fans who never heard of him until a few months ago nuts. See this mysterious space object. Harvard researchers believe it might be an alien spacecraft. No, that's Beto leaving for his home planet. With Beto, when you see that kind of hype, you knew there's less there than meets the eye. When the media and celebrities join together over a candidate, you know he or she is going to be to the left of anyone with a pulse - or Madonna. Compare that to - oh, I insult Madonna and you are like - geez Louise. Compare that to Trump, he got the most media attention of anyone and it was free but mostly negative which proves if the media tells you one thing, you'll always do the other. No one hyped Trump as the next great thing. Hardly, the media turned circus promoters and wall-to-wall clowned him and that clown wiped the floor with Hillary's e-mails. So maybe there the lesson here for Dems? Trump won because for all of his faults, he was real. The Dems current crop of candidates for 2020 aren't.  They are like pool toys -- worthless -- just waiting to be inflated. But maybe they will figure it out. My suggestion, go for the exciting voices of your party. Or maybe this, or perhaps this. Hamster as VP? Why not?  We almost had Tim Kaine. Let's welcome tonight's guests. He is so sharp - he is so sharp he can poke holes in water, that's TV writer and producer Rob Long. First-time guest, he's a patriotic, he once dated the statue of liberty, author of \"Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump,\" former Secret Service agent, Dan Bongino. She is so bright you can see her thoughts from space, national security analyst Morgan Ortagus. And unlike the Democrats, he could literally flip a house. Former WWE superstar and my massive sidekick, Tyrus. All right, Rob. Give me your take on this week on the outcome."

He was a ball hog who wouldn't let other reporters ask questions after he had a ton and when those reporters finally did get to ask questions, guess what? Trump gave it to them like he did to Acosta.

I'm a Queens kids. I grew up in Queens, right? We don't have the money of the Manhattan kids, right? So we don't have prestige, but we're never assumed to be tough like the Brooklyn and Bronx kids.

Thousand Oaks already reeling from a deadly shooting rampage is also in the line of the deadly flames. An autopsy found the gunman died of a self- inflicted gunshot. Investigators say 28-year-old David Long killed 12 people at a country music bar before turning the gun on himself.  Authorities are still searching for motive.
