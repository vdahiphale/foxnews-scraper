In a Fox exclusive, Omarosa's closest confidant inside the Trump administration will be here to set the record straight about what really went on in the White House. Also, we're going to tell you why the Democrats have suddenly gotten very quiet about domestic abuse allegations against one of its top leaders.  Plus, you will not believe what kinds of crimes open borders advocates are in fact defending now.  And some dynamite for you close to the end of our show tonight, T.V. icon J.J. Walker will react to the latest charges of racism against the president.  But first, the Democrats struggle to make socialism sexy again. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. In the midst of this massive economic boom under President Trump, it is stunning how Democrats simply refuse to learn. If Trump's for it, they're against it. Even on issues they used to be for, like look at how they refuse for instance, to work with Trump on legalizing the dreamers, or even may be on prison reform they won't work with him.  Well, we now see that anti-Trump delirium is pushing Democrats further out of the American mainstream right to socialism. A new Gallup poll confirms that more Democrats prefer socialism to capitalism. Fifty-seven percent view socialism favorably while just 47 percent have a favorable review of capitalism. Just two years ago, those numbers were flipped. Fifty-six percent then favored capitalism. Of course, it could be that socialism's attractive new poster gal is changing minds.

For instance, at Middlebury College, juniors can take a class called \"Beyond Intersectionalty: Developing Anti-Racist and anti- Capitalist Feminisms.\" A University of Michigan textbook used for activism class teaches that capitalism should be overthrown. And according to data from Open Syllabus Project, Karl Marx is the most assigned economist in U.S. college classes today. Great.

Then his successor, Nicolas Maduro, took the reins. The Washington Post reporting now that, \"Venezuela's crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption, and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security, and health care have all but collapsed.\"   No wonder Venezuelans are climbing out of the Andes to get out of there. More than 10 percent of the population, 4 million people have already departed. The situation on the ground is dire. Parents starved for food are abandoning children at orphanages. Power, water, and sanitation services are all breaking down. Government-backed militias are abusing citizens. Members of the military are going AWOL due to scant rations. Civil society is broken in Venezuela and crime is on the rise. Oh, and the people are choking the halls of hospitals since basic medicines are unavailable, while HIV-related deaths have surged.

Look, I am no apologist for socialism but there is a difference between Cubist communism, Chavez's high handed socialism bordering on communism, and Sweden for example, which does have a kind of democratic socialism. It's a mixture of socialism and capitalism. So, I think you overstate the arguments against socialism, but the Democrats can't win with socialism.   Look, my concern is that both parties are moving too far away from the center. I think the Democrats, clearly, their younger people are moving hard, hard, hard left. But I think Republicans, too, with their anti- immigration policies are going to alienate a lot of centrists in America. I think that we have to worry about rebuilding the center in America.

I know it's been getting picked apart today, and that is really why I am here is because there is something seriously wrong with society when a woman can run around the White House and surreptitiously record people possibly in violation of her own national security contract. But yet Katrina and I are the one who have to come on national television and explain ourselves. I've made it very clear, and I stand by my statement that I released last night, that the audiotapes that she has released, first of all, conflate two different conversations. One is with me, Omarosa, and Katrina. The other is also with me, Omarosa, Katrina, and Jason. But the distinction is muddled. And what you are hearing, really, in my opinion, is not only verification that the president said very early on and very sternly and immediately that he did not use this derogatory term. But the more I hear this recording, what you are also hearing it a woman, Omarosa, who outright interrupts me during this interview and says, he said. That's a lie.

And get this, some groups like the nonprofit Legal Aid at Work want rules that prevent ICE from arresting suspects in state court. Joining me now, Tom Homan, the former acting director of ICE, and immigration attorney Allen Orr. Tom, let's go to you. You know a little bit about this. ICE are now going to courthouses in order to nab some of these illegal immigrants. The argument is, people aren't going to report crimes because they might be illegal immigrants and they are going to these courthouses, and then they are going to be nabbed, too. Is that happening?",

In a Fox exclusive, Omarosa's closest confidant inside the Trump administration will be here to set the record straight about what really went on in the White House. Also, we're going to tell you why the Democrats have suddenly gotten very quiet about domestic abuse allegations against one of its top leaders. Plus, you will not believe what kinds of crimes open borders advocates are in fact defending now. And some dynamite for you close to the end of our show tonight, T.V. icon J.J. Walker will react to the latest charges of racism against the president. But first, the Democrats struggle to make socialism sexy again. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. In the midst of this massive economic boom under President Trump, it is stunning how Democrats simply refuse to learn. If Trump's for it, they're against it. Even on issues they used to be for, like look at how they refuse for instance, to work with Trump on legalizing the dreamers, or even may be on prison reform they won't work with him. Well, we now see that anti-Trump delirium is pushing Democrats further out of the American mainstream right to socialism. A new Gallup poll confirms that more Democrats prefer socialism to capitalism. Fifty-seven percent view socialism favorably while just 47 percent have a favorable review of capitalism. Just two years ago, those numbers were flipped. Fifty-six percent then favored capitalism. Of course, it could be that socialism's attractive new poster gal is changing minds.

And according to data from Open Syllabus Project, Karl Marx is the most assigned economist in U.S. college classes today. Great. What college students would benefit from, is a little less rage and a little more reality. Like this devastating exchange -- now this goes back to the ‘70s, one of my favorites -- between Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman and old lefty Phil Donahue. It should be required viewing.

The great achievements of civilization have not come from government bureaus. Einstein didn't construct his theory under order from a bureaucrat. Henry Ford didn't revolutionize the automobile industry that way. In the only cases in which the masses have escaped from the kind of grinding poverty you are talking about, the only cases in recorded history are where they have had capitalism and largely free-trade.

There has never been a successful socialist government. Not ever. A hundred million people were killed in socialist regimes in the 20th century. The USSR, China, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea, Nicaragua, Zimbabwe, et cetera, et cetera. But we don't have to reach into the annals of history to tell us this. Just look at Venezuela today.

Then his successor, Nicolas Maduro, took the reins. The Washington Post reporting now that, \"Venezuela's crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption, and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security, and health care have all but collapsed.\" No wonder Venezuelans are climbing out of the Andes to get out of there. More than 10 percent of the population, 4 million people have already departed. The situation on the ground is dire. Parents starved for food are abandoning children at orphanages. Power, water, and sanitation services are all breaking down. Government-backed militias are abusing citizens. Members of the military are going AWOL due to scant rations. Civil society is broken in Venezuela and crime is on the rise. Oh, and the people are choking the halls of hospitals since basic medicines are unavailable, while HIV-related deaths have surged.

Look, I am no apologist for socialism but there is a difference between Cubist communism, Chavez's high handed socialism bordering on communism, and Sweden for example, which does have a kind of democratic socialism. It's a mixture of socialism and capitalism. So, I think you overstate the arguments against socialism, but the Democrats can't win with socialism. Look, my concern is that both parties are moving too far away from the center. I think the Democrats, clearly, their younger people are moving hard, hard, hard left. But I think Republicans, too, with their anti- immigration policies are going to alienate a lot of centrists in America. I think that we have to worry about rebuilding the center in America. The center is where America thrives. We can have great debates between moderate liberals and moderate conservatives. I used to debate William Buckley all the time on television.

All allegations of domestic abuse are disturbing and should be taken seriously. And Ellison just moments ago won his Democratic primary in an attempt to become the Minnesota attorney general. Joining me now for reaction, Monica Crowley, senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research and Leo Terrel, a civil rights attorney. All right, Monica, let's start with you. The Me Too Movement has been a pretty powerful thing and the Democrats have been pretty powerful in aligning themselves after the Harvey thing kind of went through its cycle with the women who claim to be subject to abuse.

Look, the Me Too Movement has claimed a lot of very powerful scalps on both sides of the aisle and you look back and you wonder, well, Al Franken went down in flames. John Conyers went down in flames. We have a lot of people again, on both sides of the aisle, have essentially been destroyed by past actions and accusations and so on. So what is different in the Keith Ellison case? Well, could it be that the DNC and the Democrats have chosen to protect Keith Ellison, trying to promote him, because he checks two boxes? He is African-American and he is a Muslim. So he's got two minority aspects weighing in his favor, at least in this era of hyper identity politics."

When it adversely affects the head of their party, it takes 72 hours -- that's a lot of time. And just today, they released this, you know, three line statement. And there are two women, I believe, who have come out now. And again, I say everybody is innocent. I think men and women who are accused are condemned before we know anything half the time and I'm not minimizing any allegations, but I think everybody needs to take a breath on some of this stuff.

I know it's been getting picked apart today, and that is really why I am here is because there is something seriously wrong with society when a woman can run around the White House and surreptitiously record people possibly in violation of her own national security contract. But yet Katrina and I are the one who have to come on national television and explain ourselves. I've made it very clear, and I stand by my statement that I released last night, that the audiotapes that she has released, first of all, conflate two different conversations. One is with me, Omarosa, and Katrina. The other is also with me, Omarosa, Katrina, and Jason. But the distinction is muddled. And what you are hearing, really, in my opinion, is not only verification that the president said very early on and very sternly and immediately that he did not use this derogatory term. But the more I hear this recording, what you are also hearing it a woman, Omarosa, who outright interrupts me during this interview and says, he said. That's a lie.

As soon as we walked in, she said, Lynne, don't turn around, but has the SUV left yet? And he was still sitting there, and she said, they are on to me. They are waiting to see if I come out of this restaurant, because it was really only two blocks away from her apartment. And it occurred to me what she was doing.

On the face of it, it sounds devastating until you read that ICE nabbed the father in court while he was dealing with a felony domestic abuse allegation that he pled down to a misdemeanor assault. And get this, some groups like the nonprofit Legal Aid at Work want rules that prevent ICE from arresting suspects in state court. Joining me now, Tom Homan, the former acting director of ICE, and immigration attorney Allen Orr. Tom, let's go to you. You know a little bit about this. ICE are now going to courthouses in order to nab some of these illegal immigrants. The argument is, people aren't going to report crimes because they might be illegal immigrants and they are going to these courthouses, and then they are going to be nabbed, too. Is that happening?"

We're looking for those who are criminals or fugitives or reentrants."

So therefore, they might have been charged but they haven't fully been through the court proceeding to be guilty of these crimes, and now they are being placed in deportation and removed from the country when most of them are married to U.S. citizens."

And they've had their due process in federal court but they ignored that order, and they are hiding from the government. This is exactly where we need to arrest criminals, in jails and courthouses, because they are behind the wire. They don't have weapons, we know it. Judges protect themselves, senators protect themselves by security, why shouldn't ICE have that same protection from criminals, criminals in criminal courthouses?"

Then you have to read down and it says, well, they've has some recent domestic disturbances at the house, or turmoil. It sounds like the guy bashed his wife in the face. A lot of spouses are battered who want to stay -- I get that. But he is both illegally in the country, he is a wife abuser, and you are pleading his case, Allen? Or you think he should stay?"

And I always say this, we are not the divided states of America. We are the United States of America. And Donald Trump is a guy that's not a politician. He's an action guy."

Under Trump administration, there are more women of color on major magazines, whether they be \"Vogue,\" \"Elle,\" whatever. America, get on board, and start defending Americans. Donald Trump is one of those guys that it is an American patriot. And America, as they used to say on \"Saturday Night Live\" for Donald Trump, has been very, very good to him. So he is not a guy that is trying to desecrate anything in America. And the majority of the country, even though he lost by 3 million votes, the majority of the country is for Trump. They are for the flag. I, myself, will always stand up for the flag, and I will always stand up for Donald Trump. Donald Trump is a guy that I would love to have dinner with, but on the other side, I would love to have dinner with Maxine Waters, too. I am not leaving anyone out. And this is what it seems that we are so fractured, so concrete against America. We have the best country in the world."

So why is it -- hold on, Jimmie -- why is it that the entire, with the exception of a few people, yourself included, why is the entire world of comedy now so politicized that -- I think, like, Stephen Colbert would literally wither up and melt into himself if there was a night when he couldn't discuss Trump. There is no other comedy other than Trump, and most of that comedy is fairly tedious and remedial."

Even though taking kids at out of the arms or parents was not the best thing to do, if you look at what happened to the immigration policy, people were on line to get into America. There were lines of miles and miles -- there was no one on the other side trying to get out of America. People want in because they know the opportunity is here, they know the discussions are here. They know --"

In Vermont, Bernie Sanders beat back his Democratic challenger, but he will renounce the win and run as an independent. OK. Code word, socialist. And as we noted earlier in Minnesota, Keith Ellison fought off domestic abuse allegations to win a chance to fight for that state's attorney general seat. Interesting direction for that party. We're going to see where they all end up. That's it for us tonight. Ed Henry is in for Shannon Bream. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
