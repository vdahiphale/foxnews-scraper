You know, the president knew that Gary Cohn was thinking about leaving when he made statements at that press conference this afternoon about more people leaving the White House. But I'm told that the president and Cohn met just after that, and that's when Cohn said let's make the announcement today. This has been rumored for weeks. It hit a fevered pitch late last week when the president announced that he was going to be slapping punitive tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel.   You mentioned that Gary Cohn was fiercely opposed to these tariffs. So, looks like he lost that battle. But I'm told that, you know, Cohn didn't leave because of any one thing. He didn't leave because he lost the battle on tariffs. That he's not the sort of person who would, you know, pick up -- take his ball and go home just because he lost a single game, that there was more to it than that. And he also was coming to the end of what he wanted to do. He was involved in getting the tax reform through, he was involved in getting regulatory reform through and other changes like that, and then he was -- he'd just decided that it was time to move on. He appears to be leaving on good terms. The president saying, 'Gary has been my chief economic advisor. He did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping deliver historic tax cuts and reforms, and unleashing the American economy once again. He's a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.' From Gary Cohn, 'It has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to the benefit of the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform. I'm grateful to the president for giving me this opportunity. I wish him and the administration great success in the future.' I just got another statement. This one is very interesting. From Mick Mulvaney, who is the president's Budget Director. He said, 'As a right- wing conservative, and founding member of the Freedom Caucus, I never expected that the co-worker I would work closest and best with at the White House would be a globalist. Gary Cohn is one of the smartest people I've ever worked with.' There was a difference between the president and some of his top advisors like Mick Mulvaney, like Peter Navarro, and Gary Cohn. They were all very much America first; he's very much a globalist. But it's interesting that Mick Mulvaney said that he could work so closely with him. As to how long he'll be here, I'm told several weeks until another head of the National Economic Council comes in. You know, when you are the president's chief economic advisor, you've got to have somebody good at the helm. I'm told, a couple of possibilities: Kevin Hasset, who is currently the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisor; or if the president goes outside, maybe somebody Larry Kudlow. We'll see.",

But we have countries like China, as Senator Manchin, was saying, China doesn't prepare and build up 50 percent of the world's aluminum and 50 percent of the world's steel. What China actually does is they do over-capacity so they can use the over-capacity to depress markets. And one of the markets that they've been depressing on aggressive days is for 25 years is America. They have almost $600 billion trade surplus on steel with the rest of the world, and they're -- anywhere they can put that, they're putting it. If you take aluminum -- if you take aluminum, China said three years ago that they're going to dominate the world in solar panels even if they have to sell under the cost of production.

That was not good enough for Democrat Jackie Speier, who quickly went on CNN to flatly charge the president in her words as being blackmailed by Russia.  She didn't cite any evidence, then she claimed cyber experts had told her they cannot say for sure if voting machines were hacked. But when pressed on whether there's any evidences that votes were actually impacted by Russian interference, she admitted she doesn't have evidence. Democrats have also jumped on those reports that the Trump's State Department has not spent any of the $120 million fund to counter interference in the midterms.

I agree with Judith, we don't know exactly what it is, but it was an assassination attempt of some kind. And Russia has a long history of doing this. Alexander Litvinenko was mentioned. He was assassinated with polonium in his tea in London. Litvinenko, reason he was assassinated because he was investigating the assassination of a Russian journalist who was investigating war crimes in Chechnya, and she was poisoned first and survived that, and then shot in her apartment in Moscow.",

He had killed three people in Washington state, two because they were gay before slaying the young college sophomore. The story happened roughly around the time of the Michael Brown case and others that had garnered national attention. Today, Brown pled guilty to the murder, robbery and terrorism in this case. The Tevlin family has been, quote, dreading a long-drawn-out trial where they would have to endure the details of Brendan's death. Prosecutors did what they could to comfort the family today and telling them, quote, that the bottom line is that Brendan's killer will die in jail. Thanks for watching tonight everybody.

You know, the president knew that Gary Cohn was thinking about leaving when he made statements at that press conference this afternoon about more people leaving the White House. But I'm told that the president and Cohn met just after that, and that's when Cohn said let's make the announcement today. This has been rumored for weeks. It hit a fevered pitch late last week when the president announced that he was going to be slapping punitive tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel. You mentioned that Gary Cohn was fiercely opposed to these tariffs. So, looks like he lost that battle. But I'm told that, you know, Cohn didn't leave because of any one thing. He didn't leave because he lost the battle on tariffs. That he's not the sort of person who would, you know, pick up -- take his ball and go home just because he lost a single game, that there was more to it than that. And he also was coming to the end of what he wanted to do. He was involved in getting the tax reform through, he was involved in getting regulatory reform through and other changes like that, and then he was -- he'd just decided that it was time to move on. He appears to be leaving on good terms. The president saying, 'Gary has been my chief economic advisor. He did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping deliver historic tax cuts and reforms, and unleashing the American economy once again. He's a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.' From Gary Cohn, 'It has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to the benefit of the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform. I'm grateful to the president for giving me this opportunity. I wish him and the administration great success in the future.' I just got another statement. This one is very interesting. From Mick Mulvaney, who is the president's Budget Director. He said, 'As a right- wing conservative, and founding member of the Freedom Caucus, I never expected that the co-worker I would work closest and best with at the White House would be a globalist. Gary Cohn is one of the smartest people I've ever worked with.' There was a difference between the president and some of his top advisors like Mick Mulvaney, like Peter Navarro, and Gary Cohn. They were all very much America first; he's very much a globalist. But it's interesting that Mick Mulvaney said that he could work so closely with him. As to how long he'll be here, I'm told several weeks until another head of the National Economic Council comes in. You know, when you are the president's chief economic advisor, you've got to have somebody good at the helm. I'm told, a couple of possibilities: Kevin Hasset, who is currently the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisor; or if the president goes outside, maybe somebody Larry Kudlow. We'll see."

President Trump is giving them a chance for that to come back now. We're talking about fair trade. Everybody in America is for fair trade. This free-trade hasn't worked out well for American or American jobs. This is not about the jobs or Main Street. This is about Wall Street pushing back now. And Main Street, hopefully, that -- those are the people that voted for President Trump, and he's respecting that, and I think coming through on the commitment he's made to make sure that we're treated fairly throughout the world.

So, we have a president that has the spine to start saying, wait a minute, we've been taken advantage of for far too long. West Virginia and all over rural America and rural -- all over every rural state in America have suffered. We have a chance to fight back. We want a level playing field. We'll compete any one leveling. And what we're saying is if a country is going to charge us 20 percent to put our product in their market, shouldn't we reciprocate and charge the same coming in? Why should we give up our market? Why would you concede to that?"

I agree with the president on bilateral. I have never been a fan of multi- lateral. You have five or six different countries. We really sincerely are trying to give some advantages and help third world nations pick themselves up, but there's other people in the mix. And before you know it, we're giving super advantages that countries don't need; they should be on even bar. So, I think this is absolutely correct in what the president is doing. Bilateral -- let's deal directly with Mexico, let's deal directly with Canada which has been favored nation treatment. I think we can deal one on one and do much better and achieve our goals of helping those that need help, but making sure the ones that don't, can compete on a fair level playing field."

One of the challenges that we have is that we have a lot of countries, including countries like Canada that play by the rules, and, in fact have a trade deficit with the United States on steel. But we have countries like China, as Senator Manchin, was saying, China doesn't prepare and build up 50 percent of the world's aluminum and 50 percent of the world's steel. What China actually does is they do over-capacity so they can use the over-capacity to depress markets. And one of the markets that they've been depressing on aggressive days is for 25 years is America. They have almost $600 billion trade surplus on steel with the rest of the world, and they're -- anywhere they can put that, they're putting it. If you take aluminum -- if you take aluminum, China said three years ago that they're going to dominate the world in solar panels even if they have to sell under the cost of production. You can't make a solar panel without aluminum. We had 15 smelters, we're down to four."

And so, when we have an accumulated trade deficit of over seven trillion, when we have an annual trade deficit of 800 billion with these countries that cheat, we have to tackle them with the president and to say that we're not going to let you do that anymore."

But you know, in terms of translating those union steel jobs in America, can you be competitive at those salaries and those wages? Can you do that?"

So, just this today, the U.S. Steel announced that they're going to re-open their facilities in Granite City. When you talk about competition, we have to have fair competition. South Korea built a new oil country tubular mill. They've built it with Chinese steel that had been sanctioned by America. They sold that Chinese steel to South Korea that cut rate. South Korea built in other country a tubular mill that produces zero drilling, and they don't drill one foot in their country and they're flooding our market with those oil country tubular goods that they had subsidized by china.

Now, he said it, and it's still not good enough. At this news conference with the Swedish prime minister, the president flat out admitted Russia 'meddled in the last election', but made the important distinction that there's no evidence that they influenced any votes or swung the overall election. That was not good enough for Democrat Jackie Speier, who quickly went on CNN to flatly charge the president in her words as being blackmailed by Russia. She didn't cite any evidence, then she claimed cyber experts had told her they cannot say for sure if voting machines were hacked. But when pressed on whether there's any evidences that votes were actually impacted by Russian interference, she admitted she doesn't have evidence. Democrats have also jumped on those reports that the Trump's State Department has not spent any of the $120 million fund to counter interference in the midterms. But as you noted, Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, testified today that senior officials are engaged in stopping Russian interference -- other countries as well. Even as he did admit there's not yet a coherent strategy. The president, though, vowed Russia will be stopped."

The lead FBI agent on the case, Peter Strzok, was told of this and we're told he did not really follow up. A fact that is now being probed by the Justice Department's inspector general who remembers also revealing the conduct of then Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. McCabe was overseeing the Clinton probe despite his wife's ties to the Clinton camp, so he had Trump critics inside the FBI, spun up about interference in the last campaign but not quite as curious about possible foreign meddling with the Clinton's server, Martha."

You know, I had the opportunity not to just review the Republican FISA memo and the Democratic rebuttal memo to that, but also the underlying FISA application, and each of the three renewal applications. And it was during that review that I really came to the conclusion that a second special counsel was unavoidable, because some of these questions about a FISA abuse, the folks that would have to answer that would not be within the jurisdiction of the Inspector General Michael Horowitz. And so, a second special counsel is not just appropriate but necessary."

It all just sort of keeps piling up about Peter Strzok, that there was reason to think that he found something on Hillary Clinton's server that indicated that there may have been exposure to foreign governments on that server. And I just want to play, this is from James Comey's presser when he exonerated Hillary Clinton on July 5th, 2016. Here's what he said about that."

Now, we learn that the language and Peter Strzok changed some of the language on all of this, changed from reasonably likely that hostile actors gained access to the Clinton account, and it was possible when James Comey said if there is sort of a softer phrase. What do you make of this, Congressman King?"

And looking back on that, what he said then, and we're learning now, to me, it's just one more example of -- it appears to many of us that the FBI investigation was not conducted fully, that there are many unanswered questions. And that's why, really, very reluctantly, on my part, is I've never supported a special counsel before. I think in this case, it is essential that there'd be one. I agree with Trey Gowdy. I agree with John Ratcliffe. Because there are so much interconnections here, there's so many potential conflicts of interest, and there's so many people beyond the scope of the inspector general. And we can't expect the FBI and the Justice Department to investigate themselves."

Martha, with respect to both Andrew McCabe and Peter Strzok, these developments are not exhibit one and two, they're exhibits 101 and 102. I mean, I've literally seen hundreds of text messages and e-mails, and seen sworn testimony and other documents, all of which speak to these unprecedented actions and decisions and irregularities that, again, I think underscore the need for a second special counsel to look into all of these issues."

      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "Yes. First of all, if Comey felt it's so important to get it out there, why did he not do it himself? Why be sneaky about it and leak it through somebody else? Also, to me, it shows that Jim Comey was very selective in his moral outrage. He never did a memo, at least intended one, about the fact that Loretta Lynch several times leaned on him to change the terminology of the Hillary Clinton investigation, to calling it -- I don't know what she called an issue or even or something like that. She was definitely leaning on him for an info into the investigation, he never went public with that, never wrote a memo about it, never leaked that out. But instead, he leaks conversations with the president of the United States. So, it shows that leaking was almost an art form with these guys."

Again, we've to restore people's faith and trust in our justice system in the Department of Justice and the FBI. And very clearly, it's shaken right now. And I think one way to get there is have a special counsel look at these issues that are now clearly in the public view and over which they have a great deal of mistrust."

He was in prison in Russia, but set free in 2010 during that prisoner swap you mentioned with the U.K. and U.S. that involved Anna Chapman, the Russian double agent and model, who blended into American society and later became the basis for the TV show The Americans. Experts point out the Russian had a long history of developing and using undetectable poisons, and the apparent poisoning of Skripal and his daughter is being compared to Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian spy who died in 2006 after drinking polonium-laced tea in London. British authorities say they won't stand for another assassination attempt on their soil. Watch."

We don't know enough about motive. For example, why would the Russian government try and kill someone whom President Medvedev had pardoned and had been swapped -- we're now talking about his information being 15-years-old. And why would the Russians."

Now, he and his daughter are in the hospital. They were foaming at the mouth and three emergency workers who tried to help them were actually hospitalized. So this was clearly -- this wasn't -- something that was just a random attack. This was clearly an assassination attempt. Now was it the Russian government. Maybe he was in the wrong ways with an oligarch. A lot of these guys try to do business in Russia. After they leave their connections are in the intelligence world. So we don't know. I agree with Judith, we don't know exactly what it is, but it was an assassination attempt of some kind. And Russia has a long history of doing this. Alexander Litvinenko was mentioned. He was assassinated with polonium in his tea in London. Litvinenko, reason he was assassinated because he was investigating the assassination of a Russian journalist who was investigating war crimes in Chechnya, and she was poisoned first and survived that, and then shot in her apartment in Moscow."

That would hurt -- as you point out. But I think part of the problem here, Martha, and Marc also talked about it, is that there hasn't really been severe sanctions.

David Hogg was like we have to make a change. Let's make this happen. And then, the White house calls you and it was like, let's do it.

A New Jersey family has been spared a painful trial after the horrific murder of their son at the hands of a lone wolf terrorist. In June of 2014, Ali Muhammad Brown, executed 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin as he sat on his car at a red light. Brown was on a, quote, personal jihad, to avenge U.S. policy in the Middle East. He had killed three people in Washington state, two because they were gay before slaying the young college sophomore. The story happened roughly around the time of the Michael Brown case and others that had garnered national attention. Today, Brown pled guilty to the murder, robbery and terrorism in this case. The Tevlin family has been, quote, dreading a long-drawn-out trial where they would have to endure the details of Brendan's death. Prosecutors did what they could to comfort the family today and telling them, quote, that the bottom line is that Brendan's killer will die in jail. Thanks for watching tonight everybody. That's our story. We'll see you back here tomorrow at 7:00. Tucker Carlson is up next."
