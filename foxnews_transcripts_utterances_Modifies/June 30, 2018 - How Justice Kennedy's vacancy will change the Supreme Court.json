Justice Anthony Kennedy announcing his retirement Wednesday, giving President Trump his second vacancy to fill in a once-in-a-generation chance to cement conservative control of the nation's highest court. The 81-year- old Kennedy stepping down after 30 years and setting up a confirmation battle in the Senate just before the midterm elections.  Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, columnist, Bill McGurn, editorial board member, Allysia Finley, and editorial features editor, James Taranto.  James, what difference is it going to make for the Supreme Court without Anthony Kennedy?",

I use the word \"heterodox\" advisedly. He was often called a moderate. He's really not a moderate. He has very strong views on subjects, but they don't always line up with the traditional liberal conservative dichotomy. He's very much in favor of gay rights, he's very much in favor of free speech, whether it's a liberal free speech argument or a conservative free speech, so he was something of a wild card on the court. Most likely, the new justice will be more apt to line up with the other four Republicans --",

Wrote the Citizens United decision, for example, on campaign finance and free speech. And there's no guarantee that his replacement, even if a so-called conservative, is going to be as strong on, say, the First Amendment or even on states' rights.  DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST/DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, that's right. All of these nominees when it comes down to the Supreme Court, intelligent person, they have their own minds. By and large, they are able to identify whether they will vote most of the time with conservatives or the liberals. But there's no real predicting. And a lot of these issues have been in play. I think, the First Amendment, going forward, is going to be a big one as people begin to argue that the First Amendment should give weight to things like hurtful speech. In the last term, Justice Gorsuch, in one of his interesting concurrences, said he would like to revisit the Fourth Amendment on searches and seizures. He thinks it's very unclear. He thinks the court ought to do some housecleaning there. It's a little hard to predict, other than as James suggests, probably the next nominee will align with the conservatives. Almost certainly.",

People tried to evaluate -- I certainly did -- how he got to the answer in a lot of different areas of law, but often there was a simple inscrutability. He seems to find, for example, the equal dignity clause with respect to gay rights, or the idea that a civilized society doesn't pass laws that harm people, for example, rather than importing either a national rights theory of the law or involving constitutionalism or anything. So, yes, I agreed with him a lot. He was probably the most Libertarian justice, although that's a low bar. But a bit of a black box as well.",

I think, if you want to describe Kennedy's jurisprudence, one way to do it would be that he a kind of jurisprudence of personal liberty that is -- that led him to, for example, the social left on abortion rights and gay rights, but on free speech and gun rights and even property rights, led him to what we would call the right.

He was one of the votes for the government, for the development agency in Kelo v. New London, that you can take property from a private business or individual and give it to another private actor. And so, again, it's harder to contextualize across issue areas. Certainly, he was for personal liberty in many ways, but not in the way that Libertarian, not in the way that Cato Institute or other classical liberal organizations or scholars might like. He didn't apply national rights theory or any other way that you might describe. Like Gorsuch, like Neil Gorsuch, the newest justice, I think is dedicated to. And so it really depends on how it fit into his view of the world. In certain cases, the Constitution's structural protection for liberty, be that federalism or separation of powers, were very important. And he was a key vote on the Obamacare case, for example, fully in line with striking it all down. But in other examples, Raich versus Gonzales, the federal government, yes, apparently can regulate plants that you grow in your own backyard. That was a medical marijuana case.",

And although, technically, Gorsuch was dissenting from that ruling against the criminal defendant for the government, that dissent was a concurrence in all but name. He had some technical reasons there. But calling for a fundamental rethink of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence not to be tied to 50-year-old precedent about the reasonable expectation of privacy, which, after all, is judge made. Even more than Justice Thomas who focused on property-right aspect of the Fourth Amendment, Gorsuch really looked at, have you taken steps to protect your personal effects and papers, whether that's digital, contractual, property or otherwise.

Justice Anthony Kennedy announcing his retirement Wednesday, giving President Trump his second vacancy to fill in a once-in-a-generation chance to cement conservative control of the nation's highest court. The 81-year- old Kennedy stepping down after 30 years and setting up a confirmation battle in the Senate just before the midterm elections. Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, columnist, Bill McGurn, editorial board member, Allysia Finley, and editorial features editor, James Taranto. James, what difference is it going to make for the Supreme Court without Anthony Kennedy?"
    },

      "speaker": "JAME TARANTO, EDITORIAL FEATURES EDITOR",
      "utterance": "Anthony Kennedy was an unusual member of the courts, particularly after Justice O'Connor left. He was the most heterodox of the nine justices. I use the word \"heterodox\" advisedly. He was often called a moderate. He's really not a moderate. He has very strong views on subjects, but they don't always line up with the traditional liberal conservative dichotomy. He's very much in favor of gay rights, he's very much in favor of free speech, whether it's a liberal free speech argument or a conservative free speech, so he was something of a wild card on the court. Most likely, the new justice will be more apt to line up with the other four Republicans --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Well, that could be the case. Although, Dan, it's interesting, because if you look at his First Amendment jurisprudence, for example, Kennedy was very, very strong. Wrote the Citizens United decision, for example, on campaign finance and free speech. And there's no guarantee that his replacement, even if a so-called conservative, is going to be as strong on, say, the First Amendment or even on states' rights. DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST/DEPUTY EDITOR: Well, that's right. All of these nominees when it comes down to the Supreme Court, intelligent person, they have their own minds. By and large, they are able to identify whether they will vote most of the time with conservatives or the liberals. But there's no real predicting. And a lot of these issues have been in play. I think, the First Amendment, going forward, is going to be a big one as people begin to argue that the First Amendment should give weight to things like hurtful speech. In the last term, Justice Gorsuch, in one of his interesting concurrences, said he would like to revisit the Fourth Amendment on searches and seizures. He thinks it's very unclear. He thinks the court ought to do some housecleaning there. It's a little hard to predict, other than as James suggests, probably the next nominee will align with the conservatives. Almost certainly."

But I think that the reason the Supreme Court especially looms large for the left, it's their preferred legislature. Right? They would rather work through and get five justices to put something through that couldn't make it through the Democratic system, especially on state-by-state basis. And that's why they are so very upset at this."

      "speaker": "ILYA SHAPIRO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CATO SUPREME COURT REVIEW",
      "utterance": "Yes. Part of the rule of law isn't just getting the right results, but the reasoning matters. That's why the Supreme Court explains itself so people can follow how the law develops, what it means, what the Constitution means. And Justice Kennedy didn't follow kind of conventional jurisprudential methods, be that originalism and textualism, be that legislative history or the purpose of a given law or anything in particular. People tried to evaluate -- I certainly did -- how he got to the answer in a lot of different areas of law, but often there was a simple inscrutability. He seems to find, for example, the equal dignity clause with respect to gay rights, or the idea that a civilized society doesn't pass laws that harm people, for example, rather than importing either a national rights theory of the law or involving constitutionalism or anything. So, yes, I agreed with him a lot. He was probably the most Libertarian justice, although that's a low bar. But a bit of a black box as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "And I agree with you, I think, on his racial jurisprudence. For example, he didn't give clear guidance, even though he was swing vote on issues like university racial preferences. But on the First Amendment, for example, I think that he had actually a very clear sense of what was legal and constitutional under the First Amendment. He provided the key fifth vote. For example, he wrote the opinion on Citizens United. And had a lot of these First Amendment cases gone the other way, his vote, we would have a diminished free speech right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's one of the exceptions that proves the rule that I was talking before. Absolutely. Justice Kennedy was actually not the swing vote on First Amendment cases, Citizens United or otherwise. He was the most pro-free speech justice that we've had in quite some time, maybe ever. You saw that in several opinions this term, this past week, whether with the compelled speech with public sector unions or crisis pregnancy centers or Masterpiece Cake Shop, for that matter. Very solicitous First Amendment protections."

I think, if you want to describe Kennedy's jurisprudence, one way to do it would be that he a kind of jurisprudence of personal liberty that is -- that led him to, for example, the social left on abortion rights and gay rights, but on free speech and gun rights and even property rights, led him to what we would call the right. But that was the consistency of the core of his jurisprudence. What do you think about that?"

      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "Again, you're trying to make consistent claims across issues and I don't think it holds up. You mentioned property rights. He was one of the votes for the government, for the development agency in Kelo v. New London, that you can take property from a private business or individual and give it to another private actor. And so, again, it's harder to contextualize across issue areas. Certainly, he was for personal liberty in many ways, but not in the way that Libertarian, not in the way that Cato Institute or other classical liberal organizations or scholars might like. He didn't apply national rights theory or any other way that you might describe. Like Gorsuch, like Neil Gorsuch, the newest justice, I think is dedicated to. And so it really depends on how it fit into his view of the world. In certain cases, the Constitution's structural protection for liberty, be that federalism or separation of powers, were very important. And he was a key vote on the Obamacare case, for example, fully in line with striking it all down. But in other examples, Raich versus Gonzales, the federal government, yes, apparently can regulate plants that you grow in your own backyard. That was a medical marijuana case."

His first year on the court, very important term. How do you think he did?"

      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",

You saw that, for example, in his opinion in Carpenter v. United States, relating to whether the police need a warrant to get cell phone location data. And although, technically, Gorsuch was dissenting from that ruling against the criminal defendant for the government, that dissent was a concurrence in all but name. He had some technical reasons there. But calling for a fundamental rethink of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence not to be tied to 50-year-old precedent about the reasonable expectation of privacy, which, after all, is judge made. Even more than Justice Thomas who focused on property-right aspect of the Fourth Amendment, Gorsuch really looked at, have you taken steps to protect your personal effects and papers, whether that's digital, contractual, property or otherwise. You can see that again and again in textual and first-principle constitutional cases. He really wants to go back to that well."

And some of these younger judges, I think, feel that, over the years, the Supreme Court has become muddled. A lot of the law is simply unclear in areas like the Fourth Amendment, possibly, in the First Amendment as well. And I think he's going to spend a lot of his time going forward kind of being the voice of clarity about the Constitution on the court. And I wouldn't be surprised if the new judge joining him, say, Amy Barrett, for instance, from Notre Dame, if perhaps she's the nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, on the appellate court in D.C., are going to join him in that effort."

Joining me now is Republican Senator Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, home of Harley-Davidson's headquarters. Welcome, Senator. So you're a businessman. You were before you got to the Senate.

They can't sell their products. They are going to lose the markets. They will lose the sales. And they would even lose the workers here in Wisconsin because they don't have the sales or they have the opportunity to produce these things overseas where they can buy steel at world market prices and that could charge the tariff going to Europe. They are put in a horrible situation. They're making rational economic decision. And I heard members of this administration talk about there's going to some short-term pain for long-term gain. And no doubt, some of that short-term pain would be temporary, but some will be immediate and permanent. And this is certainly one of the decisions. I talked to the CEO of Harley, and he said maybe within a couple of months they could reverse decision, but if this doesn't get taken care of, it's going to be a permanent loss of jobs.

DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: That's right, Paul. I do think her victory is probably a little bit overstated. I think Joe Crowley lost touch with his constituents.

      "utterance": "Republican leaders suffering another setback this week with the House soundly defeating a so-called compromise immigration bill. The measure getting 121 votes, far short of the 218 needed for passage. That defeat coming as the debate over immigration takes an uncivil turn with members of the administration being heckled at their home and at public venues. And a Democratic congresswoman telling supporters to harass officials at department stores, restaurants and gas stations. We are back with Dan Henninger, Bill McGurn and Kate Bachelder Odell. Kate, why did the immigration bill fail so miserably?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ODELL",
      "utterance": "It's a good question, Paul. So 120 votes is a pretty embarrassing defeat. But there are a lot of authors of this failure. One of them was President Trump, who did not go out and campaign for the bill and try to get it passed. There are other authors, too, like the Freedom Caucus, who have moved the goal post on what they are interested in getting in exchange for a deal on DACA and whose own bill, the Bill Goodlatte bill, failed also on the floor. But the Democrats have been cynical about this discussion as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "They want an issue. Is there -- in November. Do -- they think it will help turn out of their voters. But is there any chance of anything happening on immigration between now and election, for example, on family unification at the border?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ODELL",
      "utterance": "The Republicans have been working on a bill on that issue but it's not clear where Trump is on signing it at this point. And that's one reason that it's been delayed and has not come to a vote yet or even introduced. But -- so I don't see much opportunity unless there's change. Because I think one thing that we were discussing is when voters know that both parties are being cynical about having political issue instead of resolving a real problem for young adults, who some of them are in the military, I think that's when they start to vote for people who are more radical."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Dan, where does that leave the moderates, so-called moderates who are pushing a discharge petition to be able to consider abill taht would give legalization for the DREAMers but also have tougher border security? This kind of leaves them high and dry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "I would say it leaves them on the bubble, Paul. That's why they wanted the vote. Had this incident down at the border with the separating mothers and fathers from children not happened, I don't think this would be a big issue in November. It is now. And the issue is there are between 20 and 24 Republicans who is are in very tight battles for their seats. These are not sure Republican seats. And they have to wonder whether the moderate, Independent voters in their districts are going to punish them for what has happened at the border. That's why they wanted this vote. So it's going to be an issue in November for about 20 Republicans."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Both parties. Trump seems to think it's a good issue. Republicans, Democrats think it's a good issue for them. We are seeing such a breakdown of civility on immigration. It's more polarized than ever. What do you make of this call to harass --"

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Yes. I don't think people want to see that. Look, it's intractable in the sense there are Republicans that don't want any compromise because they feel it would give a path to citizenship or amnesty, right, however you define it."

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "They're willing to live with status quo rather move an inch on -- in this direction. Democrats I think have long preferred the issue. It allows them to call the Republicans racists, the status quo. I think, politically, that does benefit -- the status quo does benefit the Democrats that way. And I think that now we've reached a point where it's hard to get any deal before November."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "You saw, Dan, where Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leaders in Congress, they basically said, knock it off, Maxine Waters, stop it, we don't think this helps us to have that kind of a call for harassment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes, they've got -- the question is, can the Democrats control their left, because the moderate left are into mass protests, they're into disruption. They invaded a restaurant in Washington, D.C., where Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was having dinner, screamed at her in front of the other dinners, went to her house and screamed at her. This sort of thing makes a lot of voters uncomfortable. They think it raises the law-and-order issue. And the Democrats, I think, would like to tamp that down. They want the protests, they want opposition, but they don't want that kind of violence beneath the surface."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I agree with Dan entirely. Except I would say this. What's shocking is how many Democrats don't condemn what Maxine Waters is saying. And how tepid some of the advice against her is. I think that's a new change. I think Maxine Waters used to be seen kind of at the fringes, and now a lot of people are afraid of her in her own party."

But linking it to the courage of the Iranian people that are now demonstrating on the streets in Iran. I think it is an odd time when the prime minister of Israel has more confidence in the people of Iran them their own government."

This week he said in his confirmation hearing that he was committed to running a top-to- bottom unbiased IRS. This agency has had some amusing problems lately, like the tax Web site blowing up on Tax Day. But also, more serious issues like the attacks targeting conservative groups. And especially important, because we have a new tax law that needs implementation. Cheers to this agency getting some long-overdue and new political leadership."

It has rescinded an award it gave year ago to Laura Ingalls Wilder, the author of \"Little House on the Prairie,\" because it didn't like the way she depicts Native Americans. It says she doesn't do it with enough inclusiveness, integrity or respect. Then it said, this should not be construed as an act of censorship. Paul, the rest of us do not have to participate in that kind of disgusting doublespeak. That is censorship."
