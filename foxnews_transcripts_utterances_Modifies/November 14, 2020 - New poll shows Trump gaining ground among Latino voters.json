Mollie Hemingway, Victor Davis Hanson, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. UFC Fighter Jorge Masvidal and Raymond Arroyo are here in just a few minutes. We have hours now before it is just officially Election Day. But first, with just hours of course until the first polling places open, President Trump, as you can see - look at him! He is just still working hard for your vote. In fact, the president still rallying the faithful in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with a fifth rally to come a little bit later on tonight. We hope in the show. The man is an absolute machine. Breakneck schedule, it's an emblematic of how he's been running the country for the last four years. And it reminds me of why the people elected him in the first place. And it's paying off. Now check out the \"Real Clear Politics\" polling averages in the key swing states. Trump is ahead in five of them and is within striking distance in the other three. He sweeps all eight and he wins. Now when the president left the hospital remember after his COVID diagnosis four weeks ago, all the experts on the left in the media and Democrat politics said don't campaign, it's too dangerous. You will be a super-spreader. Told him not to hold rallies but he knew how this was the most important election of our lifetime and how important his campaigning was for the psyche of America? He had to be with the people. They had to see him. He knew it was important for Americans not to succumb to the media and the Biden doom and gloom propaganda they've been pushing on you since the beginning of this pandemic. And the president's fans well what did they do? His supporters, the voters, they repaid him by turning out in the cold, in the rain, in the heat, in the wind for rallies and impromptu caravans. This is all organic. In Arizona, 1500 cars took part in a pro-Trump parade that stretched for miles and miles. Conservatives in San Diego put on a huge boat parade, a liberal sea of Trump supporter's, tens of thousands turned out last week in Butler, Pennsylvania. I personally shot this video in overflow crowd in Rochester, Minnesota, and then check out these crowds last night. This is in Rome Georgia. Check it out. Then Miami of course, this is the scene. It was a massive party there and here's Trump in Traverse City, Michigan earlier tonight again, huge crowds. That crowd just goes on forever and ever again, organic. This is an organic movement. It's a love for this president. Meanwhile, the favorite candidate of China, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street is out ranting on the trail and being propped up by the same out of touch forces that failed Hillary in 2016.",

He's barely leaving home. He's not in front of crowds. It couldn't be more different. In part because the media has done the job of running the Joe Biden campaign and so they've been very active and so they don't need Joe Biden to be so active. But this really does reflect their two different governing strategist, they're two different ideas. This is a reflection of how the Trump Presidency has been, full of energy, full of excitement and growing in support among his - particularly his Republican voters. Also with this idea that America can take on its challenges and defeat its challenges versus Joe Biden's us approach, which is that we are headed into a very dark winter, that Coronavirus has us dead to rights and that we have very dark days ahead.",

Suddenly he can't have a good debate after the first one, he had a great debate. And then people said there's going to be all these melodramas every three days. Bob Woodward, tax returns, and then suddenly they just fizzled out and they had a big October surprise but it was Hunter Biden. And then they said well after Oklahoma City is too sick, you will have COVID post-viral fatigue, he's done for and then suddenly he comes back as superman and nobody's ever seen anything like these rallies. They are crazy, they are huge.

And there are plenty of people have been standing there for hours. And he's on his way to his final stop. Going back to where he finished it out in 2016 back in Michigan, so he's going to be heading back to Michigan for one more stop tonight after a grueling 96 hour schedule. Since I was on the trail with him on Friday and we are going to move on now because we have other important information to get to you. You're not going to see this anywhere else. Really interesting four years ago, Swiss researchers boldly predicted that Trump would win against all these other experts in the field of polling and now those same analysts in Switzerland say that Trump is poised for another victory. Of course, flies in the face of most of the polls, we get it but that's because these Swiss research teams are relying on completely different metrics. One team is basing its election forecast on online search frequency. The other team's key metric is based on a candidate's charisma, which you just saw from Trump at that rally. Here now is one of the lead researchers, John Antonakis, Organizational Behavior Professor at the University of Lausanne. Now John, thank you for rising up so early for us here in the United States.

So we are actually in a better position, and I think we are set for a decisive Election Day victory because partially Democrats don't want to vote in person, they are doing the mail. And then Republicans, we have over 200,000 super voters more than the Democrats who haven't voted, so we know a lot of these people are going to be voting tomorrow and so we are looking at two or three to one advantage in Election Day potentially.

He was the Supervisor in Broward I also removed the Palm Beach County Supervisor because they had not run the elections properly. So we had new individuals in those positions and so far those counties have run well this year in both the presidential primary and the general primary.

Mollie Hemingway, Victor Davis Hanson, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. UFC Fighter Jorge Masvidal and Raymond Arroyo are here in just a few minutes. We have hours now before it is just officially Election Day. But first, with just hours of course until the first polling places open, President Trump, as you can see - look at him! He is just still working hard for your vote. In fact, the president still rallying the faithful in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with a fifth rally to come a little bit later on tonight. We hope in the show. The man is an absolute machine. Breakneck schedule, it's an emblematic of how he's been running the country for the last four years. And it reminds me of why the people elected him in the first place. And it's paying off. Now check out the \"Real Clear Politics\" polling averages in the key swing states. Trump is ahead in five of them and is within striking distance in the other three. He sweeps all eight and he wins. Now when the president left the hospital remember after his COVID diagnosis four weeks ago, all the experts on the left in the media and Democrat politics said don't campaign, it's too dangerous. You will be a super-spreader. Told him not to hold rallies but he knew how this was the most important election of our lifetime and how important his campaigning was for the psyche of America? He had to be with the people. They had to see him. He knew it was important for Americans not to succumb to the media and the Biden doom and gloom propaganda they've been pushing on you since the beginning of this pandemic. And the president's fans well what did they do? His supporters, the voters, they repaid him by turning out in the cold, in the rain, in the heat, in the wind for rallies and impromptu caravans. This is all organic. In Arizona, 1500 cars took part in a pro-Trump parade that stretched for miles and miles. Conservatives in San Diego put on a huge boat parade, a liberal sea of Trump supporter's, tens of thousands turned out last week in Butler, Pennsylvania. I personally shot this video in overflow crowd in Rochester, Minnesota, and then check out these crowds last night. This is in Rome Georgia. Check it out. Then Miami of course, this is the scene. It was a massive party there and here's Trump in Traverse City, Michigan earlier tonight again, huge crowds. That crowd just goes on forever and ever again, organic. This is an organic movement. It's a love for this president. Meanwhile, the favorite candidate of China, Silicon Valley, and Wall Street is out ranting on the trail and being propped up by the same out of touch forces that failed Hillary in 2016."

Joining me now is Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at \"The Federalist\" and Fox News Contributor also with me, Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow.

He's all over the country. He's very energetic rallies. He just recovered from COVID, versus Joe Biden, who may be a few days ago he decided he need to get out a little bit on the trail. He's barely leaving home. He's not in front of crowds. It couldn't be more different. In part because the media has done the job of running the Joe Biden campaign and so they've been very active and so they don't need Joe Biden to be so active. But this really does reflect their two different governing strategist, they're two different ideas. This is a reflection of how the Trump Presidency has been, full of energy, full of excitement and growing in support among his - particularly his Republican voters. Also with this idea that America can take on its challenges and defeat its challenges versus Joe Biden's us approach, which is that we are headed into a very dark winter, that Coronavirus has us dead to rights and that we have very dark days ahead."

And it's fun versus the long, dark, dreary winter that will be lockdowns and controls and high taxes and demonization and recrimination and payback and all the stuff we know they're going to do.

We are muscular people, we are out working. We're going to take calculated risks, we're going to get the country back together and it's against the elite. The people have a voice after all and I think this started mysteriously about three weeks or so I think Trump was pretty even. Suddenly he can't have a good debate after the first one, he had a great debate. And then people said there's going to be all these melodramas every three days. Bob Woodward, tax returns, and then suddenly they just fizzled out and they had a big October surprise but it was Hunter Biden. And then they said well after Oklahoma City is too sick, you will have COVID post-viral fatigue, he's done for and then suddenly he comes back as superman and nobody's ever seen anything like these rallies. They are crazy, they are huge. And then he got back on message and I think the pollsters were just baffled because the people who were the outliers, Trafalgar, Democracy Institute Inside Advantage to a lesser extent Rasmussen. They had it right. They were trying to find his voters and here they are. In the doctrine or pollsters that were wrong didn't have an answer for, they won't tell us well, we did this to correct from 2016 and now we got it right because they're worried.

And I thought OK, finally he's probably figured out that the America people actually don't think - they know enough to know that hasn't been an effective strategy and that the best strategies are - you know, this is a global pandemic, there are ways to handle it and they don't involve locking down the entire country and not dealing with all of the unintended consequences of that."

Even the - has gone from its assured 99.9 certainty that Trump is going to lose to maybe we don't need Pennsylvania after all to wow, if we don't win at Pennsylvania, Biden is in trouble. So even their experts that statisticians are worried. So something happened and the historians are going to chronicle that period in October from the second to the present, because I think Trump really came into his own after COVID and the first debate and really re-corrected he's got to win them now."

Three of the last five statewide polls in the \"Real Clear Politics\" average put Trump at one or two points ahead of Biden. Joining me now is Jake Corman, Pennsylvania State Senate Majority Leader, State Senator Corman to what do you attribute this late break for Trump in Pennsylvania?

Going back to where he finished it out in 2016 back in Michigan, so he's going to be heading back to Michigan for one more stop tonight after a grueling 96 hour schedule. Since I was on the trail with him on Friday and we are going to move on now because we have other important information to get to you. You're not going to see this anywhere else. Really interesting four years ago, Swiss researchers boldly predicted that Trump would win against all these other experts in the field of polling and now those same analysts in Switzerland say that Trump is poised for another victory. Of course, flies in the face of most of the polls, we get it but that's because these Swiss research teams are relying on completely different metrics. One team is basing its election forecast on online search frequency. The other team's key metric is based on a candidate's charisma, which you just saw from Trump at that rally. Here now is one of the lead researchers, John Antonakis, Organizational Behavior Professor at the University of Lausanne. Now John, thank you for rising up so early for us here in the United States. What is the issue with modern polling in your eyes? Why does it miss some key - key factors in a race such as this?"

      "utterance": "Well, firstly, there's a very low probability that a person answers the phone and if they do answer the phone, there's a high likelihood that that is correlated with party allegiance, so that's one problem. The second one is will they tell you the truth? The third one is will they go to the polls? So if a pollster under samples one of the other sides; there's going to be a huge systematic bias in this bias may be correlated also across states that are similar."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We are seeing this play out on the screen right now, Professor. This is, you know, pretty freezing evening in Wisconsin. The president is now on his fourth rally, just wrapped that, going to his fifth and we are not even able to capture the full scope of the crowd, but there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people in little Kenosha, Wisconsin. Well, I think 100,000 people in the entire city of Kenosha, but this has been happening all over these so-called swing states, most of the broadcast media here in the United States aren't covering them. I think they think that not covering it is going to make it go away. But it's happening whether they cover it or not. In the polling here is not picking up this energy and charisma that I think you just referenced."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANTONAKIS",
      "utterance": "Yes. And in our methods we don't really care about the polls, we look at historical trends and we notice that history will repeat itself, given certain socioeconomic conditions, given certain charisma difference between the two candidates. Our model makes a prediction and this time it seems like again the fact that Trump is an incumbent, the economy has been doing very well in the last quarter, reasonably well over the last four terms not so good this year but the fact too is that he's much more charismatic than Biden and it is fact that may galvanize people to go to the polls. It may get people to perhaps switch a vote towards him if they were somewhere in the middle. So our models are completely using different metrics then do polls."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I'm curious after this is all over what you might think of how the lockdowns, the looming lockdowns that you're seeing all over Europe now and many people think are coming next year under Biden here, how that would have played out? But I'm looking forward to seeing what you might think about that? We will check back with you. Professor, thank you again for getting up so early. We really appreciate it. And one of our biggest prizes tomorrow night of course, will be the State of Florida. Governor Ron DeSantis is here and just moments on where things stand there in the UFC Fighter, Miami native Jorge Masvidal will tell us why the Latino vote is exploding for Trump in the sunshine state? Last night Miami was insane. If you missed that, we will show you some of it. You don't want to miss it, up next."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "One state Trump must win to secure his reelection path is Florida and the \"Real Clear Politics\" average currently has Biden up by 1.7 points in the state and Democrats have a slight lead in early voting. But is that margin really big enough to withstand the title wave of votes Trump is expected to get tomorrow on Election Day? Joining me now, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Governor, wonderful to see you tonight big day for your state tomorrow as always every four years it seems to be. What you expect G.O.P. turnout to look like tomorrow?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOV. RON DESANTIS, FLORIDA",
      "utterance": "Well, Laura, as you mentioned, Republican ballots are a little bit below Democrat for early and mail-in voting but we expected that. We are actually down less. We were down 1.4 percent in '16 going against Hillary. I think we are about 1.1 percent behind. So we are actually in a better position, and I think we are set for a decisive Election Day victory because partially Democrats don't want to vote in person, they are doing the mail. And then Republicans, we have over 200,000 super voters more than the Democrats who haven't voted, so we know a lot of these people are going to be voting tomorrow and so we are looking at two or three to one advantage in Election Day potentially. So I think that's going to put Donald Trump over the top. Last night I was with the president at the Miami rally, I think it was one of the mornings and you had electricity in the air."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "We are showing pictures of it now. We're showing it now on the screen. It was unbelievable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "And that's a county that he got clobbered in and '16. He lost by 30 points, he still won the state, which is amazing. Well now the turnout we are getting and the energy and enthusiasm and particularly the Latino community, he's going to do very well. We are not going to win Dade County, but I think he can cut the margin by a third or half. That could be 100,000 votes right there, so I think going into Election Day tomorrow, Donald Trump is in a stronger position than he was in '16 and obviously we know he carried the State of Florida in 2016."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now where the polls close their? At least right now, stories that I'm about to tell you are seriously concerning. Investigators in Florida, Governor, reported a scheme to register dozens of dead people to vote in Broward County, which just happens to be of course Democrat strong hold, second most populous county in the state. And Broward Election Supervisor Pete Antonacci saying this is an organized effort by someone who had a scheme to either undermine the Florida registration system with fake voters or intended to vote 50 times. Now this was foiled before fraudulent votes were cast, but should voters be concerned given some of these other stories we are hearing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say two things. One, just generally, law enforcement in Florida spoiled the number of improprieties, so people should know if they tried that, they will get caught and prosecuted. Second, with respect to Broward and Palm Beach one of the first things I did when I took office in 2019 was except Brenda Snipes' resignation. He was the Supervisor in Broward I also removed the Palm Beach County Supervisor because they had not run the elections properly. So we had new individuals in those positions and so far those counties have run well this year in both the presidential primary and the general primary. So I think that people in Florida should have confidence that those two counties are going to perform better than they have in the past and I think that's just important. People don't want to see kind of the same mistakes be repeated every single year in the same counties."

And so people have been voting with their feet, and people have wanted to come to a state that's open for business, where people can work, and where kids can go to school. All 67 Florida counties are open for in-person instruction, K-12, all charter schools, all private schools. You have some of these other big school districts across the country, they have zero in-person instruction in some of these places. That is catastrophic for young people. And some of these public health, quote, experts have shown very little regard for the well-being of our children throughout all of this, and I think that that's going to be looked upon very negatively when people look back on what some people could have done had they exercised a little bit more leadership."

And we tried to cancel culture them because they had a business meeting with Trump. So obviously, I stand to lose a lot, but I'm not going to be intimidated by no mob or by no individual. I'm not the type of person you can take something from me. It's better we talk it out. So I don't care what I stand to lose. I'm speaking from my heart. I'm speaking for those that can't speak, like my father, like my aunt that escaped communist Cuba. I have to be a mouthpiece for them.

We are of course going to cover that when he hits the stage. My friends, tomorrow, the American people will decide who will sit in the White House next year. But the radical left is trying to intimidate Trump supporters, like David Tootle. He's an African-American resident of historic Savannah, Georgia. After the last presidential debate, the Trump flag hung outside his home. Well, of course, it was set on fire by radicals. When he bought another, that too was set ablaze. Meanwhile, the Biden-Harris signs in his neighborhood have all been left standing. David Tootle joins me now. David, it's great to see you tonight. You told us that you have actually bought a third Trump flag. That's dedication. So they are not going to silence who, are they? Why?"

      "speaker": "DAVID TOOTLE, TRUMP FLAG WAS BURNED ON HIS LAWN",
      "utterance": "First of all, thanks for having me on. Yes, we're teaching our kids right now that you can't be intimidated in this cancel culture. And Jorge was on earlier talking about it. I refuse to be intimidated. I'm not going to let them -- I'm not going to let them win. So we've got about five flags. I've got two of them hanging over my house right now, and they are going to stay up there tomorrow."

      "utterance": "And any comments from your neighbors? Do they actually come up to and say, look, you're an African-American guy, how can you be for Trump? Are they pulling that routine on you, David?"

      "speaker": "TOOTLE",
      "utterance": "How dare you do that, be a black guy and vote for Trump, right? I actually had a neighbor come up to me the other day. She was standing next to her Biden flag, or Biden street sign, and she said, wow, you're really showing your political views here. I was like yes, just like you are."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, so, what, you got a problem with that? But I think, David, a lot of young people -- I had a chance to talk to a lot -- hundreds and hundreds of people, thousands I've been able to meet over the last couple of weeks. And young people in school, David, are afraid oftentimes to speak out about issues and certainly supporting this president. They're afraid."

    {
      "speaker": "TOOTLE",
      "utterance": "Yes, you've seen over the last couple of years kids out on uniform days, or even posts with kids wearing the Trump shirts or hats, it's honestly sad. But this president, we've got a choice to make tomorrow. This president has got to win. If we don't, there are going to be more of those, and unfortunately cancel culture, they're out. They're not going anywhere. And I think this is a fight, this is a battle we have to win."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And David, to African-Americans across this country who have been told that Donald Trump is a racist, he doesn't like minorities, he's not good to you -- what do you say to them?"

    {
      "speaker": "TOOTLE",
      "utterance": "Well, I say look at the unemployment rate. Look at the platinum plan, Lil' Wayne, 50 Cent, all the rappers that love Trump and hated him. Now they're coming back on the side. They see the way the country is going, and I feel like, it's an easy choice to make. Look at prison reform as well. That's another --"

      "utterance": "Tomorrow is going to tell us a lot about the future of America, because for 10 years our populist movement has sought to empower the average American of all people, races, genders across every state. And we've completely reformed the Republican Party. We took away control from big business and the warmongers, and organized the party around the principles of peace, prosperity, and protecting our unalienable rights. And tomorrow is our day. Tomorrow. The polls don't matter. The media doesn't matter. Tomorrow, we vote. We've already come so far. One more victory. And we can preserve this country in ways that's going to benefit our children, our grandchildren for many, many years to come. It's all the time we have tonight.
