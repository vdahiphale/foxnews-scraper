Night after night, these attacks on the president and everybody who supports him, they are vicious, they're absurd, and at this point, it's psychotic.  And right here on \"Hannity\" we've been onto this game all along. We've been calling out o for years. And what you've witnessed in the last 48 hours is the latest example of the left's anti-Trump echo chamber, propaganda, all in an attempt to hurt his presidency, delegitimize the election, and really undermine the vote of the American people.  Now, in moments, we're going to expose all the political hacks who pretend to be so fair and unbiased, the so-called \"journalists\". We'll also show you also the media's best friends in the Democratic Party, they are playing politics with the safety and security of our country at the southern border.  And the midterm elections are now fast approaching. The left, they have no plan to improve America. And, by the way, they are in full gear trying to discredit your vote, your agenda, your beliefs, and your economy. All right. Stay tuned, buckle up, it's time for tonight's very important breaking news opening monologue.",

Way back in 2015, when Donald Trump, remember, descended from the escalator at Trump Tower, he announced his candidacy for the presidency of the United States. These so-called \"elites\" in this country -- they were laughing in his face. They said it couldn't happen, please, please run.  And, of course, Trump went on to prove them all wrong. And despite the media's best efforts to trash then-candidate Trump, laugh at his agenda, he energized the American people. He won the Republican primary, went on to resoundingly defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election.   This wasn't their plan. This was not supposed to happen. And on the election night, you may remember, 2016, your corrupt mainstream media, America's holier-than-thou so-called \"journalists\" -- they had a collective depression and meltdown all on television. You might remember. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC, NOV. 9, 2016: America is crying tonight. I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion. I mean, literally crying. This is a sadness. It is a mourning moment for those people, and it is a moment filled with fear, filled with fear.   RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC, NOV. 9, 2018: Our country is about to face some serious crises. And so, buckle up. Your country needs you. MARTHA RADDATZ, ABC NEWS, NOV. 8, 2016: Pretty extraordinary thing to say. If you have a son in the Marine Corps and you don't trust the commander-in-chief. People in the military defend the constitution. VAN JONES, CNN, NOV. 8, 2016: This was a white-lash. This was a white-lash against a changing country.

And, of course, their favorite topic, when all else fails, let's go back to Russia, Russia, Russia. Almost two years of this nonsense. It's like a moth drawn to a flame, they cannot help themselves. The past 48 hours is one more example. Take a look.  All right. And always, the media bolsters this rhetoric by trotting out pro-Obama, pro-Hillary Clinton, former deep state officials to thrash Trump, all in an attempt to legitimize their hyperbole. That includes the disgraced fired FBI director, James Comey. Remember, he doesn't watch this show, or even really know who I am, he said that on his book tour. Well, we all know Jim Comey is a liar. He said this in an interview with ABC7 in New York's Bill Ritter. And then, by the way, he attacked me and Tucker just yesterday. But I thought he never watched.  And yesterday he tweeted, quote: This Republican Congress has proven incapable of fulfilling the founders design that ambition must counteract ambition. Well, all who believe in this country's values must vote for Democrats this fall. Policy differences don't matter right now. History has its eyes on us.  Yes, Jim, we've been watching you. In other words, Republicans won't turn their backs on the leader of their party, President Trump, so it's time to vote all of them out because Jim Comey doesn't want the investigation to continue. We're going to have a full montage of all these high-ranking former deep state officials trashing Trump later in the show.  But why would he ever trust political hacks in the intel community that abuse their power? It's first important to call out what is a blatant double standard. Despite what you see and hear from this bubble media echo chamber, President Trump and his peace through strength Russia policy has been so incredibly tougher than that of Obama, who they worshiped and adored in the media. In an interview today, once again, the president reaffirming America's commitment to combat Russia's hostile actions. Watch this.",

As you can see, Democrats are happy to play politics with your border security. They don't want their actions written down on paper as official record. They know they are wrong, they know it's politically at odds with the American people, but they want to play politics because this is all about them getting their power back at all costs. Now, without a doubt, 2018 is now the single most important midterm election in our lifetime. Democrats, the media, their allies in the deep state, they are going to get more hysterical, all in their continuing efforts to delegitimize the president, and your agenda, and your vote, and your support for the president. We know this game, it's too familiar, their tactics. We all know the truth. The United States is seeing the best GDP growth we've seen since before Obama. We now have historically low unemployment rates all across the board, 14 state records with women in the workforce, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans. Literally, the U.S. pulled out of the horrible Iranian deal that Obama got us in because of his weakness. Yes, he is the only president to promise Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel and keep it. He is leading with peace through strength all over the world. The left wants to go back to what? The old days of weakness? Appeasement? Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps? Eight million more in poverty. Really? We want to go back to doubling the debt. We want to go back to economic -- the only president to ever hit 3 percent GDP in his life? Are you kidding me? We now went from the lowest labor participation in history to the highest. I mean, with each passing day, this country is improving on all fronts. We know that the agenda is succeeding, with or without the support of these elites in the media. These corrupt, biased, abusively biased, hysterical reporters that are agenda-driven. This isn't news anymore. It's fake news. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, investigative Sara Carter, the author of \"Why We Fight,\" Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.  You know, add to that, Sara, this is their playbook. They have their five agenda items, and to get there, they are going to do what they always do with the support of the media. Republicans are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. They want dirty air and water. They want children to die. And they want to throw grandma over the cliff. So, it's all the same thing. Nothing is going to improve the lives of the American people. Here is my question, does the shrill, so-called \"fake news,\" not so-called, it is fake news, so-called news, does it -- does it win the day? Do they have an ability to sway the American people with these stories that they gin up the way they do?",

They were actively trying to interfere in elections in Eastern Europe, and some of the former Soviet states. So this was nothing new at all, and what I am most upset about in this whole situation of many things, but when you go back to that time period is how they were able to ignore the warnings that we were sending from the House intelligence committee.

They wait, they know that Congress is going to l adjourn next week. And so, the more that they delay for no reason, we are waiting on many documents, as you know, we are getting very slow snail paste cooperation that is clearly designed to wait until next week when Congress adjourns. Now I have news for them. They are still going to have to come in and give the depositions, they may think they are not going to, but they are going to be coming in and to get depositions throughout the summer. And that is part of the 42 names that I sent to Chairman Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatte so I have every expectation that there will be many opportunities for these 42 individuals to come to Congress, even though they have tried to wait us out. I think they would love to see Republicans lose. And I say that, and I don't want -- I hate to say that, but I have to believe that the Department of Justice and FBI, the people at leadership, they are banking on a loss by the Republicans in the fall. Which is why people have to understand how important it is going to be to get out and vote in this election to ensure that members of Congress will return that are actively involved to ensure -- because of the Democrats get control, they are going to drop all of this investigation.

These so-called \"elites\" in this country -- they were laughing in his face. They said it couldn't happen, please, please run. And, of course, Trump went on to prove them all wrong. And despite the media's best efforts to trash then-candidate Trump, laugh at his agenda, he energized the American people. He won the Republican primary, went on to resoundingly defeat Hillary Clinton in the general election. This wasn't their plan. This was not supposed to happen. And on the election night, you may remember, 2016, your corrupt mainstream media, America's holier-than-thou so-called \"journalists\" -- they had a collective depression and meltdown all on television. You might remember. LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC, NOV. 9, 2016: America is crying tonight. I'm not sure how much of America, but a very, very significant portion. I mean, literally crying. This is a sadness. It is a mourning moment for those people, and it is a moment filled with fear, filled with fear. RACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC, NOV. 9, 2018: Our country is about to face some serious crises. And so, buckle up. Your country needs you.

And always, the media bolsters this rhetoric by trotting out pro-Obama, pro-Hillary Clinton, former deep state officials to thrash Trump, all in an attempt to legitimize their hyperbole.

That's a move against the wishes of Vladimir. And compare that to Obama in 2009, he actually killed a plan that would have armed our Eastern European allies with missile defense systems. Could've prevented all of that. A move praised by Putin as correct and brave. No hysteria over Obama's relationship with Putin, I'll have more flexibility in my next term. First month in office, President Trump extended broad economic sanctions against Putin, against Russia.

They just want their power back. They want their crumbs back, the tax cuts. They want to impeach Donald Trump, but don't say it. They want to keep Obamacare, keep your doctor, plan and pay less, that didn't work out. They don't want Judge Kavanaugh to be confirmed to the Supreme Court, and, of course, they want open borders. But their political tactics are all too blatant. No solutions. Recently, House Democrats even authorizing a bill to abolish ICE. They want to show how in favor of open borders they really are. Even top House Democrat, Keith Ellison, even claiming today that our borders are \"an injustice.\" really?

They know they are wrong, they know it's politically at odds with the American people, but they want to play politics because this is all about them getting their power back at all costs. Now, without a doubt, 2018 is now the single most important midterm election in our lifetime. Democrats, the media, their allies in the deep state, they are going to get more hysterical, all in their continuing efforts to delegitimize the president, and your agenda, and your vote, and your support for the president. We know this game, it's too familiar, their tactics. We all know the truth. The United States is seeing the best GDP growth we've seen since before Obama. We now have historically low unemployment rates all across the board, 14 state records with women in the workforce, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans. Literally, the U.S. pulled out of the horrible Iranian deal that Obama got us in because of his weakness. Yes, he is the only president to promise Jerusalem will be the capital of Israel and keep it. He is leading with peace through strength all over the world. The left wants to go back to what? The old days of weakness? Appeasement? Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps? Eight million more in poverty. Really? We want to go back to doubling the debt. We want to go back to economic -- the only president to ever hit 3 percent GDP in his life? Are you kidding me? We now went from the lowest labor participation in history to the highest. I mean, with each passing day, this country is improving on all fronts. We know that the agenda is succeeding, with or without the support of these elites in the media. These corrupt, biased, abusively biased, hysterical reporters that are agenda-driven. This isn't news anymore. It's fake news. Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, investigative Sara Carter, the author of \"Why We Fight,\" Fox News national security strategist, Dr. Sebastian Gorka.

The redline was probably one of those glaring points where he truly did go backwards in terms of strength, when he literally put that redline and said, Syria, you know, you've got to do these things, don't gas your own people, and, of course, after Syria gassed their own people, he sat back and let it go. When the Ukraine -- I mean, you're talking about good friends of ours, allies of America were being invaded, President Obama sat by and did nothing. And Ukrainians, by the way, were asking the Obama administration, not for boots on the ground, but just for weapons to defend themselves. And he turned his back on them. President Trump, by the way, in contrast, gave the Ukrainian missiles, gave them the ability to stand up to Russia. President Trump has stood up to Russia on a number of fronts.

He is personally responsible for the leaking of unmasked information, he was responsible for the sharing of false information to U.S. intelligence sources to get FISA warrants.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. The House intel committee chairman, Devin Nunes, he blasted the Justice Department yesterday during an interview, claiming that some within the DOJ, they're hoping the Republicans will actually lose the House on the midterm elections. He also said that if there was evidence of the Russians were colluding with the Trump campaign in 2016, Congress would've been briefed on it at the time, which they were not. Now remember, it was Chairman Nunes back in 2014 he sounded the alarm about Russia's malicious intent to cause chaos around the world and yes, in our very own elections. Here now is the House intel committee chair, Devin Nunes. So with all this talk about meddling and interference it happened at least in '08, it happened in 2012, you warned the Obama administration very publicly in 2014, and now we're supposed to act surprised that it all happened, although, you know, it was under Barack Obama's watch, not Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. DEVIN NUNES, R-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "Yes, Sean. Look, I think I warned them not just in 2014, but very specifically in 2016 where I called it the largest intelligence errors since 9/11, our failure to understand Putin's plans and intentions. And remember, by that time, we have seen the Russians actively involved in many elections around the globe. They were actively trying to interfere in elections in Eastern Europe, and some of the former Soviet states. So this was nothing new at all, and what I am most upset about in this whole situation of many things, but when you go back to that time period is how they were able to ignore the warnings that we were sending from the House intelligence committee. And then lo and behold, after they lost the election, they first tried to blame fake news and when that didn't work, they switched into this whole concept of Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So this is a big point, too, is that if there was any collusion, certainly you would've known about it at the time. And if anything had come up between now and then, you would have seen that as you have seen almost everything. So the question is, why is the witch hunt going on? And how do you look at the Mueller indictments then of these 12 Russians that are the equivalent of our CIA operatives, they are never coming to America, there's never going to be a trial, Mueller, you know, indicted these bot companies thinking they would never respond, now he is asking the judge in that case if they could literally not turn over any documents, in other words, that there won't be any disclosure that doesn't accurate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "And remember, and remember, so it's not just about the warnings that I gave into 2014, '15, and '16. It is also a fact that a year and a half ago, the House intelligence committee had more than what's in the Mueller indictment of the 12 Russian officers. OK? So we had more information than that. Now we put it in our report in March, it was in our report that was made public in April, it's heavily redacted, remember, by the Department of Justice and FBI. But we had all this information. And so, you know, the thing that I brought up, is I just find the timing of this to be very hard to believe. Right?"

Every time something happens on one side where we find out a new revelation about what appears to be real problems in the FBI and DOJ with this investigation, then all of a sudden, they drop an indictment. It happens time and time again. And this one is really bad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "So this is what I want to ask you, do you think they are trying to literally, as you said, you believe the FBI and DOJ they're are obstructing in terms of doing what is their -- what your authority constitutionally is oversight, and they have been obstructing the entire way. And now there is talk about actually impeaching Rod Rosenstein, and there is talk about holding these people in contempt. And you say they're really doing this hoping that Dems take over Congress and that it all ends then?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "It's the oldest trick in the book. So, many of the bureaucracies here in Washington know how to way out Congress. They know to try to plan meetings on a Friday when they know there are no votes, or on a Monday when there's not votes. They vote -- you know that's the times they want to get things. They wait, they know that Congress is going to l adjourn next week. And so, the more that they delay for no reason, we are waiting on many documents, as you know, we are getting very slow snail paste cooperation that is clearly designed to wait until next week when Congress adjourns. Now I have news for them. They are still going to have to come in and give the depositions, they may think they are not going to, but they are going to be coming in and to get depositions throughout the summer. And that is part of the 42 names that I sent to Chairman Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatte so I have every expectation that there will be many opportunities for these 42 individuals to come to Congress, even though they have tried to wait us out. I think they would love to see Republicans lose. And I say that, and I don't want -- I hate to say that, but I have to believe that the Department of Justice and FBI, the people at leadership, they are banking on a loss by the Republicans in the fall. Which is why people have to understand how important it is going to be to get out and vote in this election to ensure that members of Congress will return that are actively involved to ensure -- because of the Democrats get control, they are going to drop all of this investigation. They are not going to do anything on this investigation."
