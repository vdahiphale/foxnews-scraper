      "sentences": "Great question. What is the strategy of killing children? Maybe you should ask Planned Parenthood, lady.   So, who is killing children? Who's letting children die? Wouldn't it be great if we actually demanded proof from these idiots? What we're seeing now among the weakest minds is an adolescent delight in demonization. It feels good to call someone a murderer. That's why I keep trying to get Andrew Cuomo on the show. It elevates you as judge and jury to get lots of attention as well. You don't even need to bother with fake statistics, like the ones they used about Texas and Florida. But if they truly wanted to persuade people to their point of view, why would they constantly berate and mock and censor them? Because name-calling is way easier than making a sound argument based on fact and truths? And a sound argument would take all the fun out of being on T.V., which tells you the essential truth. They don't want to persuade you. They don't care who gets the backs. It's all about that surge of dopamine -- emphasis on dope.  Now, you were to return the favor or call them stupid. Watch out. I actually did this as an experiment, no joke. After Mika Brzezinski, blood- libeled Governor DeSantis, on \"THE FIVE\", I called her a dumb broad.  Why would I do that? It seems -- it seems curse even for me. But I did it to reveal how the media would respond to it. As Gomer Pyle used to say, surprise, surprise, surprise. Calling her a dumb broad is worse than her calling people mass murderers. And it's because the media much like Van Gogh can only hear one side of things. Too soon? They are never offended by the truly offensive if it said against someone they disagree with. They can call you a murderer but don't you call them stupid. Well, whatever you say, stupid.   So, who really cares about vaccination rates? It turns out that we do. Unlike the jerks that those other networks, we've debated how to persuade the hesitant if it's possible, without accusing them of being Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, nor Andrew Cuomo.  Of course, there are white folks hesitant about the vaccine. But Mika, Joe, and Acosta want you to think that these groups are just like the neighborhoods they live in all white, preferably in red hats, but they can't do the same to others outside that stereotype.  New York City data shows that only 28 percent of black New Yorkers ages 18 to 44 are fully vax. That's compared to 48 percent of Latino residents and 52 percent of whites in the same age group. That's a hell of a disparity. And you don't hear that on those other shows.   Fact is every individual has reasons for their reluctance. Some of it is misguided fear, others are based in legit skepticism based on previous lies by so-called medical experts. You know, like, this virus didn't leak from a lab. Yes, paging Dr. Fauci.  It's normal and healthy not to trust the government. God knows they've given us plenty of reason to. Just as it is normal and healthy, to acknowledge and admire the astonishing progress we've made in fighting disease with vaccines. It's changed the world. Paging Dr. Salk. I am pro vaccine, but I'm also pro-skepticism. How can that be? That's too nuanced, and you can't get in trouble if we're just trashing whitey. It's the soft bigotry of low expectations. Once again, those babbling clowns on other networks don't believe minorities can handle criticism or math or getting an I.D.  So, they focus their bio on some amorphous white mass of unvaxxed rednecks.  I'm suddenly craving Cracker Barrel. Meanwhile, it's expected another wave of COVID will hit black New Yorkers pretty hard, which is the perfect setup for the more evidence this country is racist segments on cable news. I'd say Mika and her death cult have blood on her hands, but then she might sue me for plagiarism. Only Joe Biden get away with that.",

Multimillionaire Director Quentin Tarantino refuses to give any money to his mother for discouraging his film career, although he's open to giving her 50 percent off lobby popcorn in Junior Mints. That's so Tonight's Show 1997. American Airlines is mandating employees get the COVID vaccine by October 25th or risk getting fired. Meanwhile, Spirit Air has decided to focus on hepatitis. Airlines are bringing back COVID restrictions due to the Delta variant. I thought that's what they called it when you had to change plans at Newark. Boom, boom. That's only an East Coast joke. Did you see this? A Frontier Airlines Flight Crew duct taped a rowdy passenger to his chair, but for an extra $10.00 they'll give him half a can of soda. That's the second time and unruly passenger has been duct taped to a plane. It must have Greyhound thinking, hey, maybe we should open up an airline. People are dying here, huh? Right to your airlines duct tape, a rowdy passenger to his chair, which on frontier is called an upgrade. Frontier is the airline for people who consider eating in their car dining out. I like that one. A spokesperson for the airline said they're punishing the unruly flyer with tickets for another flight on frontier. A school board member in Oklahoma called students who come to school unmask potential murderers. Students quickly replied, where do you think we are, Chicago? The governor of Oregon has dropped the reading, writing and math proficiency requirements for high school graduates. And due to budget cuts, students will only learn about 15 of the 22 genders. The governor of Oregon has dropped the reading and writing requirements for high school graduates. Outraged students want to sign a petition, but they don't know how.

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Great question. What is the strategy of killing children? Maybe you should ask Planned Parenthood, lady. So, who is killing children? Who's letting children die? Wouldn't it be great if we actually demanded proof from these idiots? What we're seeing now among the weakest minds is an adolescent delight in demonization. It feels good to call someone a murderer. That's why I keep trying to get Andrew Cuomo on the show. It elevates you as judge and jury to get lots of attention as well. You don't even need to bother with fake statistics, like the ones they used about Texas and Florida. But if they truly wanted to persuade people to their point of view, why would they constantly berate and mock and censor them? Because name-calling is way easier than making a sound argument based on fact and truths? And a sound argument would take all the fun out of being on T.V., which tells you the essential truth. They don't want to persuade you. They don't care who gets the backs. It's all about that surge of dopamine -- emphasis on dope. Now, you were to return the favor or call them stupid. Watch out. I actually did this as an experiment, no joke. After Mika Brzezinski, blood- libeled Governor DeSantis, on \"THE FIVE\", I called her a dumb broad. Why would I do that? It seems -- it seems curse even for me. But I did it to reveal how the media would respond to it. As Gomer Pyle used to say, surprise, surprise, surprise. Calling her a dumb broad is worse than her calling people mass murderers. And it's because the media much like Van Gogh can only hear one side of things. Too soon? They are never offended by the truly offensive if it said against someone they disagree with. They can call you a murderer but don't you call them stupid. Well, whatever you say, stupid. So, who really cares about vaccination rates? It turns out that we do. Unlike the jerks that those other networks, we've debated how to persuade the hesitant if it's possible, without accusing them of being Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, nor Andrew Cuomo. Of course, there are white folks hesitant about the vaccine. But Mika, Joe, and Acosta want you to think that these groups are just like the neighborhoods they live in all white, preferably in red hats, but they can't do the same to others outside that stereotype. New York City data shows that only 28 percent of black New Yorkers ages 18 to 44 are fully vax. That's compared to 48 percent of Latino residents and 52 percent of whites in the same age group. That's a hell of a disparity. And you don't hear that on those other shows. Fact is every individual has reasons for their reluctance. Some of it is misguided fear, others are based in legit skepticism based on previous lies by so-called medical experts. You know, like, this virus didn't leak from a lab. Yes, paging Dr. Fauci. It's normal and healthy not to trust the government. God knows they've given us plenty of reason to. Just as it is normal and healthy, to acknowledge and admire the astonishing progress we've made in fighting disease with vaccines. It's changed the world. Paging Dr. Salk. I am pro vaccine, but I'm also pro-skepticism. How can that be? That's too nuanced, and you can't get in trouble if we're just trashing whitey. It's the soft bigotry of low expectations. Once again, those babbling clowns on other networks don't believe minorities can handle criticism or math or getting an I.D. So, they focus their bio on some amorphous white mass of unvaxxed rednecks. I'm suddenly craving Cracker Barrel. Meanwhile, it's expected another wave of COVID will hit black New Yorkers pretty hard, which is the perfect setup for the more evidence this country is racist segments on cable news. I'd say Mika and her death cult have blood on her hands, but then she might sue me for plagiarism. Only Joe Biden get away with that."

Take that feminists. Even people, even people who think the earth is flat or saying that's a bad idea. Personally, but personally, I love that tweet.

Did you see this? A Frontier Airlines Flight Crew duct taped a rowdy passenger to his chair, but for an extra $10.00 they'll give him half a can of soda. That's the second time and unruly passenger has been duct taped to a plane. It must have Greyhound thinking, hey, maybe we should open up an airline. People are dying here, huh? Right to your airlines duct tape, a rowdy passenger to his chair, which on frontier is called an upgrade. Frontier is the airline for people who consider eating in their car dining out. I like that one. A spokesperson for the airline said they're punishing the unruly flyer with tickets for another flight on frontier.
