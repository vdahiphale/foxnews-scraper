      "sentences": "In an executive order Biden thought was so important, he had to issue it on day one. The administration purports to have the authority to halt all deportations from the U.S., even those that have been fully adjudicated. Now, this is both profoundly dangerous and profoundly revealing, dangerous for all the obvious reasons. Biden's move will cause an explosion in violent crime and COVID.  Tens of thousands of migrant criminals and traffickers are already rushing the border right now. They clearly got the amnesty memo. In fact, today, Biden sent his mass amnesty bill over to Congress.   So, my question to all of you tonight is, is this why Biden was elected? Was this his mandate? Absolutely not. So why is he doing this? In part, he's doing it to satisfy his party's radical open borders caucus. AOC and the gang are eager to replace native born Americans and lawful immigrants with foreigners who came here illegally. Now, this they hope will hasten the cleansing of the country, which they believe is systemically racist. A crush of new illegal immigrants fully programmed by BLM approved curricula and Far Left cultural influences think the entertainment industry and social media, the only hope for a nation scarred by 40, 74 million voters who supported the Trump agenda and voted for President Trump.   But the overriding reason for Biden's border and amnesty move, is far more nefarious. This is about cutting labor costs and giving the business community more power over workers. This isn't about helping Hispanic voters or atoning for American sins, it's about putting money in the pockets of Biden's donors. Now, anyone who cares about working class Americans of all races should oppose this giveaway to the rich. I was thinking this today, if Biden wants to help poor people in other countries, he should propose raising taxes on rich Americans and sending that money overseas. He should have campaigned on that. Instead, what he plans to do is to impoverish millions of Americans to help his donors. It's a disgusting, despicable act of greed. Also, turning a blind eye to immigration related crime is more of a confirmation of the fraud that was the Democrats' Capitol crackdown.  Now they care about law and order when the angry mob sends them scurrying for cover. But when some poor Hispanic American family is trying to save their son from MS-13 and let's say Oakland, California. Well, Pelosi and the gang, they just look the other way.   When a landscaper, a construction worker, can no longer support his family on a salary because wages have been driven down due to the flood of illegal workers. Team Biden doesn't care. The American people are just collateral damage on the road to their open borders, nirvana. Now, here's what's in the slew of executive orders Biden signed, so he's seriously going to be curtailing interior enforcement, stopping deportations for 100 days, if you believe that, just 100 days. Halting construction and funding for the border wall, ending travel restrictions from hotbeds of terrorism and reinstating DACA, requiring illegals be counted in the census.  Now, every single one of those provisions hurts the average American. How? Lower wages, more crime, crowded schools, increased terror threat stretch local budgets, a total nightmare. And as I said, if you believe the deportation stoppage is only going to be part of the branded 100-day effort, I have a bridge to sell you. Of course, the Biden flaks are already, though, trying to sell you the Golden Gate.",

Now, according to ICE, the vast majority of interior removals, 92 percent had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including 4276 known or suspected gang members and 31 known or suspected terrorists.   My friends, this is a catastrophe. The tsunami of illegals trying to cross the border has been building for months. U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 200 and 8000 (ph) migrants during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021. That begins in October, who illegally crossed the southwest border between ports of entry. This is the highest first quarter figure since the fiscal year 2000. Wow.

According to Jon Meacham, historian. The American people who support legal, but not illegal immigration are the dark forces. Oh, I got it. This is a really simple game of our plan here. Very easy. Now on the issue of the border, as with so many other issues, Democrats are going to - they're going to claim to be champions of the disadvantaged as they promote policies that make life more difficult for working class Americans and the disadvantaged.  So just tonight, we learned that thousands of National Guardsmen were forced to vacate the U.S. Capitol and are now taking their rest breaks outside in a nearby parking garage. OK, so the question is, why are our National Guard troops still in Washington?  Every governor should insist that they be pulled out and treated like American heroes, not second-class citizens. Or maybe they should just be treated as well as the people crossing the border illegally. But don't forget that from the perspective of Pelosi, Schumer and Biden, the guard represents a racist and white supremacist threat to our country. So naturally, they're going to be treated worse than illegal immigrants or people who've already been ordered deported.  The media's dishonesty in covering this issue, like so many other issues do a huge disservice to all of you out there watching and any of you still reading their tedious newspapers. So, why is it that every pending deportation that you read about or hear about seems to involve a college valedictorian who works weekends at a food bank. The drama always goes one way for them. Now, this is one story you won't see featured on the Today show. Another future Biden voter, I suppose.   Yes, well, Democrats mistake the plaudits that they're getting from the press and other liberal organizations for support among average voters who feel like government is getting too big and too powerful. The bottom-line, a government that's hell bent on enforcing mask mandates and the Grand Canyon but that refuses to enforce its own borders won't be popular for long. And that's the angle.  Joining me now is Angel Mom, Agnes Gibboney. Her son, Ronald de Silva, was killed in April 2002 by a previously deported illegal immigrant gang member. Ronald was ruthlessly gunned down while standing in his driveway. His birthday is next week. He would have been 48 years old. Agnes, when the President of the United States makes it one of his top priorities in his first 24 hours in office to halt deportations. How does that make you feel?",

We have a COVID issue in this country. We need money to help our country. But no, let's bring thousands more into our country who are not going to be able to contribute. In 1986, we had a President Reagan gave an amnesty. Why don't we investigate those 3 million people, see how much they contributed to the economy of this country, see how many are in prison, see how many returned to their country of origin, and then decide if we're going to open the gate to let a flood of millions of millions of people.

The media can be glad for the Biden White House's return to normalcy. But let's not be lulled. Except when you read beyond the headline, her real intention becomes obvious. There's a difference between truly holding power to account and grandstanding. It's the latter that gave rise to ridiculous dust ups, like the one over President Obama's wearing of a tan suit and shameful overplaying of the Hillary Clinton's email scandal during the 2016 campaign. In other words, don't actually go hard on old Joe ever, especially when it could cost him politically. So, it should come as no surprise that trust in traditional media is at an all-time low, according to Edelman's Annual Trust Barometer. 56 percent of Americans agree that journalists and reporters are purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations.

They actually talk about it quite a bit. But when they talk about it, the fact that they're losing faith and trust on the part of the public, they do one of three things. Either they complain about it and whine about it like it's so unfair because they're entitled to deference or they blame their critics. They say the reason this is happening is because people point out our errors and point out that we're engaged in propaganda and not reporting, so it's their fault. And now what they're doing is they're trying to just censor everybody off the Internet so you essentially have no choice but to listen to the people that these polls show are no longer trustworthy.

Now, this is both profoundly dangerous and profoundly revealing, dangerous for all the obvious reasons. Biden's move will cause an explosion in violent crime and COVID. Tens of thousands of migrant criminals and traffickers are already rushing the border right now. They clearly got the amnesty memo. In fact, today, Biden sent his mass amnesty bill over to Congress. So, my question to all of you tonight is, is this why Biden was elected? Was this his mandate? Absolutely not. So why is he doing this? In part, he's doing it to satisfy his party's radical open borders caucus. AOC and the gang are eager to replace native born Americans and lawful immigrants with foreigners who came here illegally. Now, this they hope will hasten the cleansing of the country, which they believe is systemically racist. A crush of new illegal immigrants fully programmed by BLM approved curricula and Far Left cultural influences think the entertainment industry and social media, the only hope for a nation scarred by 40, 74 million voters who supported the Trump agenda and voted for President Trump. But the overriding reason for Biden's border and amnesty move, is far more nefarious. This is about cutting labor costs and giving the business community more power over workers. This isn't about helping Hispanic voters or atoning for American sins, it's about putting money in the pockets of Biden's donors. Now, anyone who cares about working class Americans of all races should oppose this giveaway to the rich. I was thinking this today, if Biden wants to help poor people in other countries, he should propose raising taxes on rich Americans and sending that money overseas. He should have campaigned on that. Instead, what he plans to do is to impoverish millions of Americans to help his donors. It's a disgusting, despicable act of greed. Also, turning a blind eye to immigration related crime is more of a confirmation of the fraud that was the Democrats' Capitol crackdown. Now they care about law and order when the angry mob sends them scurrying for cover. But when some poor Hispanic American family is trying to save their son from MS-13 and let's say Oakland, California. Well, Pelosi and the gang, they just look the other way. When a landscaper, a construction worker, can no longer support his family on a salary because wages have been driven down due to the flood of illegal workers. Team Biden doesn't care. The American people are just collateral damage on the road to their open borders, nirvana. Now, here's what's in the slew of executive orders Biden signed, so he's seriously going to be curtailing interior enforcement, stopping deportations for 100 days, if you believe that, just 100 days. Halting construction and funding for the border wall, ending travel restrictions from hotbeds of terrorism and reinstating DACA, requiring illegals be counted in the census. Now, every single one of those provisions hurts the average American. How? Lower wages, more crime, crowded schools, increased terror threat stretch local budgets, a total nightmare. And as I said, if you believe the deportation stoppage is only going to be part of the branded 100-day effort, I have a bridge to sell you. Of course, the Biden flaks are already, though, trying to sell you the Golden Gate."

Now, according to ICE, the vast majority of interior removals, 92 percent had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, including 4276 known or suspected gang members and 31 known or suspected terrorists. My friends, this is a catastrophe. The tsunami of illegals trying to cross the border has been building for months. U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 200 and 8000 (ph) migrants during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021. That begins in October, who illegally crossed the southwest border between ports of entry. This is the highest first quarter figure since the fiscal year 2000. Wow.

According to Jon Meacham, historian. The American people who support legal, but not illegal immigration are the dark forces. Oh, I got it. This is a really simple game of our plan here. Very easy. Now on the issue of the border, as with so many other issues, Democrats are going to - they're going to claim to be champions of the disadvantaged as they promote policies that make life more difficult for working class Americans and the disadvantaged. So just tonight, we learned that thousands of National Guardsmen were forced to vacate the U.S. Capitol and are now taking their rest breaks outside in a nearby parking garage. OK, so the question is, why are our National Guard troops still in Washington? Every governor should insist that they be pulled out and treated like American heroes, not second-class citizens. Or maybe they should just be treated as well as the people crossing the border illegally. But don't forget that from the perspective of Pelosi, Schumer and Biden, the guard represents a racist and white supremacist threat to our country. So naturally, they're going to be treated worse than illegal immigrants or people who've already been ordered deported. The media's dishonesty in covering this issue, like so many other issues do a huge disservice to all of you out there watching and any of you still reading their tedious newspapers. So, why is it that every pending deportation that you read about or hear about seems to involve a college valedictorian who works weekends at a food bank. The drama always goes one way for them. Now, this is one story you won't see featured on the Today show. Another future Biden voter, I suppose. Yes, well, Democrats mistake the plaudits that they're getting from the press and other liberal organizations for support among average voters who feel like government is getting too big and too powerful. The bottom-line, a government that's hell bent on enforcing mask mandates and the Grand Canyon but that refuses to enforce its own borders won't be popular for long. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Angel Mom, Agnes Gibboney. Her son, Ronald de Silva, was killed in April 2002 by a previously deported illegal immigrant gang member. Ronald was ruthlessly gunned down while standing in his driveway. His birthday is next week. He would have been 48 years old.

We have a COVID issue in this country. We need money to help our country. But no, let's bring thousands more into our country who are not going to be able to contribute. In 1986, we had a President Reagan gave an amnesty. Why don't we investigate those 3 million people, see how much they contributed to the economy of this country, see how many are in prison, see how many returned to their country of origin, and then decide if we're going to open the gate to let a flood of millions of millions of people.

If you're an illegal alien, you can do whatever you want, including committing crimes against U.S. citizens. I want to underscore, Laura, the real-world impact of this, speaking of somebody who worked with our brave ICE officers for the last four years, who saw what they did up close and personal, they will not be able to arrest the criminals in your neighborhood. When your police departments call and say, pick this criminal up because of this memo, they can't arrest them. They can't deport them. They can't remove them from our country.

They actually talk about it quite a bit. But when they talk about it, the fact that they're losing faith and trust on the part of the public, they do one of three things. Either they complain about it and whine about it like it's so unfair because they're entitled to deference or they blame their critics. They say the reason this is happening is because people point out our errors and point out that we're engaged in propaganda and not reporting, so it's their fault. And now what they're doing is they're trying to just censor everybody off the Internet so you essentially have no choice but to listen to the people that these polls show are no longer trustworthy.

Adam Schiff has a bill pending since 2019 that they want to now use a pretext for, which is that America is on the verge of civil war, there's roving bands of insurgents.

      "utterance": "I don't think so. And I realize there are folks on the other side of the issue, but I think the constitutional text, Laura, provides the answer. Just go to the text, because the text makes it clear that the judgment in cases of impeachment shall not go further than what, and what's the key word, removal, you're exactly right. Moreover, when we're talking about the, quote, removal, President Trump is not to be removed, when the impeachment is against the president of the United States, the chief justice is to preside over the trial. Again, that's the constitutional text. So I cannot imagine Chief Justice Robert saying, oh, is President Trump on trial? My Constitution says the president of the United States. So I think it's just wrong structurally. It's being driven by a policy concern that bad things might happen in the future. But guess what, if you're concerned about a candidate in the future, those are called elections."

But I'm happy to opine on constitutional issues, especially one where I just don't think the answer is difficult to divine. And Laura, let me say this. The one most salient example from history is the resignation of Richard Nixon. the Democratically controlled House just called a halt. It's gone. The president is gone. He's off to San Clemente. This is done, it's over with. That's the relevant presidents, not an obscure 1876 proceeding against a secretary of war, which is so distinguishable that I find it painful that very, very able people, some of whom are my friends, are saying, well, there is the key precedent. It's just not."

They don't opine on whether he should be convicted, but they say absolutely. And I'm thinking maybe I'm not -- maybe I'm not a smart as I should be, but I don't see it, and it seems petty and vindictive. Ken, very quickly, close it out."

Let's look to the text of America's Constitution, which talks about removal. And President Trump is no longer the president of the United States. It really is as simple as that."

      "utterance": "Ken, thank you so much, great to see you tonight, as always. And several Republican forced are now telling FOX News that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants to give Donald Trump's legal team two whopping weeks to prepare for another impeachment trial. The former president is also apparently hired lawyers to argue his case in the Senate. I don't know who they are, but apparently has already hired them. Here now is Montana Senator Steve Daines. Senator, with everything facing our country, with now the assault on our borders and our immigration policy by President Biden, COVID, everything else we have to deal with, why does Mitch McConnell think it's good to give the thumbs-up to a Senate trial of former president Trump?"

      "utterance": "Well, Laura, think about this. It was less than 36 hours ago. We were on the west steps of the capitol watching the inauguration of President Biden. He talked about unity, about healing, bringing the country together. What the Democrats are doing, sending impeachment on a speeding train on the tracks towards the U.S. Senate is wrong. It is vindictive. This is revenge. Remember shortly after President Trump was sworn in back in 2017, there were already talking about the impeachments. They're going to have two impeachments in President Trump's last year an offense. But as Ken Starr and you just pointed out, the president is no longer in office. So the bottom line is this can be stopped. Here's what I'm recommending tonight. President Biden should step up and deliver on his commitment on unity and healing. He needs to call Nancy Pelosi and say Speaker Pelosi, I am asking you to stop. They do not have to transmit these article to the Senate. Let's just end it and move on, because every hour we're spending in a trial that will go on for weeks in the U.S. Senate is hours taken away from working on behalf of the American people, working on these huge challenges we face as a nation."

      "utterance": "Listen, we feared this lurch to the left from President Biden and his team. We're seeing it. It's breath-taking. Within six hours of President Biden being sworn in, with a stroke of a pen, he killed the Keystone pipeline. It's 11,000 jobs, it's $80 million a year of tax revenues to my state of Montana to help impoverished counties. President Biden cares more about jobs now and energy in Saudi Arabia than made in America energy and American jobs. And it gets worse. Of course, he then put it back into the Paris Climate Accord yesterday. And then he also called on a moratorium on oil and gas leases in Alaska. And we're hearing now in the next few days he's going to put a complete moratorium on oil, gas, and coal leases on all federal land. That's a million jobs by 2022 that are going to be eliminated. This is outrageous. One of the great accomplishments of President Trump working with a Republican Congress was American energy independence. He's now putting us back in a position on dependency on the Middle East. That is a huge mistake --"

Senator, I hope you send a message to Mitch McConnell tonight the Republican senators should resist this idiotic and divisive impeachment trial. The Democrats are going to do what the Democrats are going to do, but the Republicans should stand united even if they don't have a great personal relationship with the president. Thank you so much.

It's gone on and on and on, and we have a man that's a president that was fighting for us, and what he got out of this was an ice pick in the back by 10 people. And I expect that from the swamp in Washington. What I don't expect, and what the people of Wyoming don't expect, is somebody from Wyoming helping to stab him in the back. And so that's why I'm running. I think we have to make a good fight against what's going on. Energy costs are going to go up, taxes are going to go up, the walls is coming down, jobs are going to go away, the green deal. Who's going to fight if we have people going in from Wyoming, going to Washington to just make deals, what good is that going to do? We need fighters to go --"
