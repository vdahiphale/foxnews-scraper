      "sentences": "Breaking tonight the fight to protect the southern border. President Trump says he will not allow asylum-seekers from Mexico into the United States while the cases are heard, but Mexico seems to be pushing back. Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again for making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for having made \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals,\" number one on the New York Times bestseller's list.  We have got a great show on deck for your tonight -- Ann Coulter, Dan Bongino, Michelle Malkin and Steve Doocy -- who I never thought came out at night, to name just a few of the great guests joining me live tonight.  Plus, you won't want to miss my special trip to the Museum of the Bible exploring the world of fashion, art and food in the Bible. But first my open.  This week, Hillary Clinton said that Europe showed no longer offer refuge and support to migrants. Say what? No more refuge and support for migrants? The woman is either had a lobotomy or she has been out in the woods too long. Her latest flip-flop from the less generic open border, globalist, sanctuary, let them all in policy is a stunning reversal. She even breaks with her pal Barack Obama who said this about the caravan coming to the United States.",

      "sentences": "Now, Barack, I don't have time to talk you through this, but you are wrong. Thousands of miles away? They are here. In a matter of weeks from Central America, they are here. It is a miracle or could it be that some entities planned long in advance to arrange to get them to our border?  But I digress.   So back to Hillary. Hillary, why your change? Might it be that you have had a revelation of anyone of a number of things, like looking at the United States? You now recognize that the caravan might to be a Trojan horse of criminals, drug smugglers, human traffickers, coyotes or worse?  Already there are already 500 criminals identified in the caravan. Or that you're fed up with those that arrogantly demand with no absolutely basis that they were entitled to come here and be treated as Americans. Or might you have boned up on elementary economics as in the impact of the uninvited on the US economy, the financial burden they put on the schools, hospitals, healthcare, housing and entitlements like disability and Medicaid? Not to mention criminal and civil law lawyers and a whole host of courts to accommodate them. Or maybe you've heard the first generation of illegals are generally a complete drain on the hard earned dollars of taxpaying Americans. It certainly cannot be that you have become a recent disciple of law and order given you've skirted so many laws yourself as well as your clear disdain for truth and justice. Maybe you've heard from legal immigrants who say if you want to come here, do it legally like we did and get in line. Or maybe you heard from families who have lost loved ones after the helter-skelter admission of openly tatted up MS-13 members from the last caravan who proudly proclaimed their membership from when they arrived and then wreaked havoc on the lives of innocent Americans they murdered?   Might you have become a nationalist resenting the images of foreigners carrying flags of their countries while demanding entry into ours? Like the boisterous demonstration on the US-Mexico border where the demonstrators defied our laws, screaming for Trump to let them in. No, folks, it is for none of those aforesaid reasons Hillary says Europe should no longer offer refuge and support to migrants because it opens the door to political turmoil. She says it is the flame that cause populist, those on the right like Trump and his supporters as well as the Brits who push for Brexit to rise up. So her reason is purely a political one. Immigrants be damned. Forget them. We on the left are losing on this issue ergo throw the immigrants under the proverbial bus. Hillary then opens her soul with her clinical assessment of those on the right who oppose the invasion, the horde, of those who choose to forcibly enter to not be vetted, who offer nothing in terms of what they give to any country but instead demand immediate entry for example here in our homeland.  She says, \"Right-wing populist in the West,\" that's you and me, \"Met a psychological as much as political yearning to be told what to do, where to go, how to live and have their press basically stifled and so be given one version of reality.\" Translation, we're all still stupid and deplorable.   So folks, there has been no revelation. She has not seen the light. It is pure political calculus. And more than a flip-flop, it is the classic Clinton two-step. She simply wants to boost her base. The woman is simply desperate. There is even talk of a 2020 run. Hillary, the only place you need to run his back into the woods. And that is my open. If you love my opening statements, you will like my new book, \"New York Times\" bestseller \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\"  Now developing tonight, President Trump tweeting about the migrant crisis at the border a short time ago saying quote, \"Migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our legally. Other than that, our very strong policy is catch and detain. No releasing into the US. All will stay in Mexico and if for any reason it becomes necessary, we will close our southern border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore.\" Meanwhile, curiously Mexico is pushing back on reports of an asylum deal.  The country's incoming government saying there is no real agreement in place. Joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and all of the developing news tonight, conservative commentator and author of the new book, \"Resistance is Futile: How the Trump Hating Left Lost its Collective Mind.\" Ann Coulter.

Three out of our Hispanics in Texas are under the age of 18, so every day Trump doesn't fulfill his immigration promises, his voters are dying off and Democratic voters, Hillary voters are registering to vote.

This is an annual event and it is something that is globally coordinated. And it's not just nonprofit organizations, there are many religious leftist organizations involved as well. And I have pointed out and I am a Catholic, so it doesn't cheer me to have to say this, but the Vatican itself have spent $20,000.00 on of these shelters to get people all the way to Tepic, Mexico where people just hopped on freight trains and got into the country.

President Trump says he will not allow asylum-seekers from Mexico into the United States while the cases are heard, but Mexico seems to be pushing back. Hello and welcome to \"Justice.\" I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us tonight and thanks to all of you for once again for making \"Justice\" number one last weekend and for having made \"Liars, Leakers and Liberals,\" number one on the New York Times bestseller's list. We have got a great show on deck for your tonight -- Ann Coulter, Dan Bongino, Michelle Malkin and Steve Doocy -- who I never thought came out at night, to name just a few of the great guests joining me live tonight. Plus, you won't want to miss my special trip to the Museum of the Bible exploring the world of fashion, art and food in the Bible. But first my open. This week, Hillary Clinton said that Europe showed no longer offer refuge and support to migrants. Say what? No more refuge and support for migrants? The woman is either had a lobotomy or she has been out in the woods too long. Her latest flip-flop from the less generic open border, globalist, sanctuary, let them all in policy is a stunning reversal. She even breaks with her pal Barack Obama who said this about the caravan coming to the United States."

      "speaker": "BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Now, 2018, they are telling you that the existential threat to America is a bunch of poor refugees a thousand miles away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Now, Barack, I don't have time to talk you through this, but you are wrong. Thousands of miles away? They are here. In a matter of weeks from Central America, they are here. It is a miracle or could it be that some entities planned long in advance to arrange to get them to our border?  But I digress. So back to Hillary. Hillary, why your change? Might it be that you have had a revelation of anyone of a number of things, like looking at the United States? You now recognize that the caravan might to be a Trojan horse of criminals, drug smugglers, human traffickers, coyotes or worse?  Already there are already 500 criminals identified in the caravan. Or that you're fed up with those that arrogantly demand with no absolutely basis that they were entitled to come here and be treated as Americans. Or might you have boned up on elementary economics as in the impact of the uninvited on the US economy, the financial burden they put on the schools, hospitals, healthcare, housing and entitlements like disability and Medicaid? Not to mention criminal and civil law lawyers and a whole host of courts to accommodate them. Or maybe you've heard the first generation of illegals are generally a complete drain on the hard earned dollars of taxpaying Americans. It certainly cannot be that you have become a recent disciple of law and order given you've skirted so many laws yourself as well as your clear disdain for truth and justice. Maybe you've heard from legal immigrants who say if you want to come here, do it legally like we did and get in line. Or maybe you heard from families who have lost loved ones after the helter-skelter admission of openly tatted up MS-13 members from the last caravan who proudly proclaimed their membership from when they arrived and then wreaked havoc on the lives of innocent Americans they murdered? Might you have become a nationalist resenting the images of foreigners carrying flags of their countries while demanding entry into ours? Like the boisterous demonstration on the US-Mexico border where the demonstrators defied our laws, screaming for Trump to let them in. No, folks, it is for none of those aforesaid reasons Hillary says Europe should no longer offer refuge and support to migrants because it opens the door to political turmoil. She says it is the flame that cause populist, those on the right like Trump and his supporters as well as the Brits who push for Brexit to rise up. So her reason is purely a political one. Immigrants be damned. Forget them. We on the left are losing on this issue ergo throw the immigrants under the proverbial bus. Hillary then opens her soul with her clinical assessment of those on the right who oppose the invasion, the horde, of those who choose to forcibly enter to not be vetted, who offer nothing in terms of what they give to any country but instead demand immediate entry for example here in our homeland. She says, \"Right-wing populist in the West,\" that's you and me, \"Met a psychological as much as political yearning to be told what to do, where to go, how to live and have their press basically stifled and so be given one version of reality.\" Translation, we're all still stupid and deplorable. So folks, there has been no revelation. She has not seen the light. It is pure political calculus. And more than a flip-flop, it is the classic Clinton two-step. She simply wants to boost her base. The woman is simply desperate. There is even talk of a 2020 run. Hillary, the only place you need to run his back into the woods. And that is my open. If you love my opening statements, you will like my new book, \"New York Times\" bestseller \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The case against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" Now developing tonight, President Trump tweeting about the migrant crisis at the border a short time ago saying quote, \"Migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our legally. Other than that, our very strong policy is catch and detain. No releasing into the US. All will stay in Mexico and if for any reason it becomes necessary, we will close our southern border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore.\" Meanwhile, curiously Mexico is pushing back on reports of an asylum deal.  The country's incoming government saying there is no real agreement in place. Joining me now with reaction to my opening statement and all of the developing news tonight, conservative commentator and author of the new book, \"Resistance is Futile: How the Trump Hating Left Lost its Collective Mind.\" Ann Coulter. Good to see you again, Ann."

If either of those ever flip, no Republican ever gets elected President again. Three out of our Hispanics in Texas are under the age of 18, so every day Trump doesn't fulfill his immigration promises, his voters are dying off and Democratic voters, Hillary voters are registering to vote. So I hope he keeps his promise. I mean, this is why we wanted a wall so that - and he wants a wall, too."
    },

You know what he got in the last Omnibus Bill was $1.6 billion and then in the fine print, Paul Ryan, thank goodness he is leaving and Mitch McConnell say, so he can only use $1.6 billion for the actual wall itself.  It's all of this other nonsense with the fencing that they climb over all the time.

The problem we've had in the past is asylum seekers get to enter the United States. They get backlogged because we don't have enough immigration judges so they don't get a hearing for years.

It was remarkable to see over the last week, the video of Mexican citizens telling these people to go home. Every sovereign nation has the right and prerogative to exercise their ability to make sure that they are able to tell who is able to come into their country or not and the Mexican government officials have said that endless caravans are not in their interest and are not in the United States' interest either."

I was just talking about the Mayor in Tijuana, they cannot handle it anymore and it's only been a few days where this influx is there and taking over the towns. But I want to ask you about a question that I asked in one of the previous blocks. Who do you think is responsible for the caravan that was just thousands of miles away and miraculously just got to the border?"

Somebody is helping facilitate it, and over the past year, I have reported on a group called Pueblos Sin Fronteras, which organized the caravan that got here all the way up to the US border from Central America during Holy Week, during Easter. This is an annual event and it is something that is globally coordinated. And it's not just nonprofit organizations, there are many religious leftist organizations involved as well. And I have pointed out and I am a Catholic, so it doesn't cheer me to have to say this, but the Vatican itself have spent $20,000.00 on of these shelters to get people all the way to Tepic, Mexico where people just hopped on freight trains and got into the country. Once they are in here, there is a sanctuary network of evangelical Christian and other religious groups well as the left wing, big billion-dollar funded organizations philanthropic organizations."

In fact, we are the most generous nation ever to exist, but unfortunately, because of certain special interests, the asylum process is being taken advantage of and there probably are some people within this caravan that truly need the help of asylum.

In fact, our border is a complete joke and the President is correct where he says, a nation without borders is not a nation at all, and the reason you've seen the influx of illegal immigration is when you start to hear politicians speak about amnesty and they think it's their big chance right now to get a shot at being in a United States citizen and part of it is like you can't really blame them, but it's our fault that we haven't secured borders, and we have too loose immigration laws, and kudos to this President for his convictions --"

That right there are the easy smores. It takes less than five minutes to make, and then on you plate, you've got Sarah Huckabee Sanders' world famous bourbon pecan pie and then you've got Martha MacCallum's Mother Betty's bourbon pumpkin cheesecake."

      "speaker": "DOOCY",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the easy apple gallett. Essentially, it is a - it's like an apple pie, but you can eat it like a pizza pizza. At the Doocy house we just put a little whipped cream on there."

The whole idea behind this was, every October 19th, which is my birthday, my wife will say, \"You want your mom's pot roast, right?\" And I'll say, \"Absolutely.\" And the German chocolate cake she used to make, which is true because when she makes that for me, it takes me back to when I'm five years old and everything is beautiful. And everybody has got a happy food and that's mine. You probably have a happy food, too."

      "speaker": "DOOCY",
      "utterance": "Well, that is the one that Sarah Huckabee Sanders made for the press corps last year and they thought, it's got to be that - she used a stock picture, but that's - she's told me the reason that makes her happy is because she always makes it at Thanksgiving and Christmas for her family and when the family is around."

When my wife, Kathy and I are on our book tour, people come up to us and give us their mom's recipes. You know, the moms are gone, but they want the recipes to live on and it's just - it's so nice. Our lesson for folks watching right now, if you have a little time this holiday season, write down the family specialty that you are good at because that way you can have it for your kids and their kids and it lives on forever."

Folks, the way he set up this table, you know this man has been in the kitchen before and Steve I want to tell you, there is definitely bourbon in this pie, it is wonderful. All right, great, so what are you cooking for Christmas?  Anything special? Move fast, 10 seconds."

This was the number one cookbook on Amazon yesterday on Black Friday and we had a lady came up to me in Palm Beach Gardens where we were last week and she said, \"I heard you say it's the perfect gift, so I am going to give it as a gift,\" and I said, \"Thank you.\" And she said, \"I have 40 people on my list.

How soon you'll be - well, you'll be planning a trip to see a true piece of history, there I am.  Me and my friend, Linda. Washington's Museum of the Bible marks its first anniversary this month and its millionth visitor this week. So I had to go see all of their exciting exhibits and of course, share them with you."

You may recall that for the opening of the museum, we were here a year ago.  And now, one year later and a million people later, we are going to zero in on three new exhibits that involve my favorite things -- food and art and fashion. Here we are at my favorite part of the visit today and that is to view the impact of the Bible in the world, specifically the fashion world and we are going to see some designers who got inspiration from the Bible, like Dolce & Gabbana and Versace. When you look at these dresses, there is so much artwork in them and there is a cross in jewels and then there are visual recreations from the Bible as well as crosses on that second dress."

This is the byzantine collection, Dolce & Gabbana. So we have a bag that you can see is biblically inspired with Madonna, a beautiful cross that is made into a necklace and then also we have this - this is all Swarovski crystal and a crown. We know Dolce, and they love to have the crowns."

Last year, we started to work on something with manna - of course manna being what the Israelites ate when they were in exile, lots of different thoughts as to what manna is. I have actually some - this is real manna from the Middle East. We probably have - I have a small bag back here, probably a pound that might be the only pound in North America. I wanted to work with it so I thought, why don't we do something and find something that we think might be almost reflective of what manna is. So we went and I thought - and my wife and I worked very hard on this and I said, why don't we try to find bee pollen and let's taste it and let's look at it and let's make this so we can actually make it what it is a finishing spice. Now, the one I make, bee pollen and all kinds of Israeli spices. I want you to try this now. This one I think is a little bit more sort of versatile in the sense --"
