And so is Al Green, the Texas congressman who led that failed effort in the House to impeach the president of the United States. Let's just say the congressman ain't done. Wait until you hear what he's planning to do next. And here's a duo you don't see together every day, former Republican House Speaker John Boehner and former Democratic bigwig Joe Crowley, yes, the same Joe Crowley who Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez primaried right out of a job -- why these two men have buried the hatchet and say both parties better do the same.  And this week that we remember the first man to walk on the moon, let us not forget the one who did not because, Apollo 11 command module pilot Michael Collins is here, and only here.   And a truly out-of-this-world \"Your World\" is now. Welcome, everybody. I'm glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto, and so much to get to, so let us get to it. First up, settling an 18-year-long battle that rages on.   At issue, compensating the now thousands of rescue workers from 9/11 who are still waiting for help from Washington. Jon Stewart says Rand Paul is making things difficult. Rand Paul says Jon Stewart is making things up.",

I have spent my entire Senate career putting forward pay-fors for any time spending is expanded. As soon ago as two weeks ago, I put forward a pay- for, for the border funding. I put forward a pay-for the disaster funding. I do this on every new bit of funding. So he's really not informed. And his name-calling just sort of exposes him as a left-winger, part of the left-wing mob that really isn't using his brain and is willing to call people names.  And it's -- it's really kind of disgusting, because, see, he pretended for years when he was on his comedy show to be somebody who could see both sides and see through the B.S. on both sides. Well, now he is the B.S. The B.S. meter is through the roof, when you see him calling people names, calling people an abomination, when I'm asking something very reasonable, that an amendment be included to consider whether we should pay for this, from taking money somewhere else in the budget.  It doesn't actually reduce the deficit. It just keeps the deficit from getting bigger. It's a very reasonable thing. I have done it dozens and dozens of times, including on the tax bill.  The left-wing mob says, oh, but you're for tax cuts, but you're not doing anything to offset the tax cuts. There's something called pay-go. And I was the leader in trying to keep that in the tax bill. It was in the tax bill when we passed it and was later taken out of the tax bill, over my objections. So the whole thing is misrepresented and not true.",

You lower tax rates, and you can sometimes get more revenue. Revenue went up after the tax cuts. The deficit did too, but because we refuse to address spending in this town.  And what I don't like about this, about the lies and the ad hominem attacks from Jon Stewart and Kirsten Gillibrand and the whole left-wing mob is, they are telling a lie.

It wasn't clearly delineated. Neil died almost five years ago, but that was one of the questions. So I think the current plan has been well-thought-out, but I just disagree with it. I think we ought to shoot directly for planet Mars.

We're going to continue exploring that this week and on Saturday with not only Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon. We talked, of course, to Michael Collins, who was his crewmate on Apollo 11, but Gene Kranz. He was an instrumental role, a flight control director, later got to fly in Skylab himself, looking back at that very special time. I left out a very important Gene Cernan story I just want to very quickly share with you, the last man to walk on the moon. My son was a big fan of astronauts, and particularly Gene Cernan, and went to the viewing of his documentary. And, of course, he treated my son like a star, even though my son was just happy to miss school, as a result, to see this guy. But he left an impression.

And so is Al Green, the Texas congressman who led that failed effort in the House to impeach the president of the United States. Let's just say the congressman ain't done. Wait until you hear what he's planning to do next. And here's a duo you don't see together every day, former Republican House Speaker John Boehner and former Democratic bigwig Joe Crowley, yes, the same Joe Crowley who Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez primaried right out of a job -- why these two men have buried the hatchet and say both parties better do the same.

And a truly out-of-this-world \"Your World\" is now. Welcome, everybody. I'm glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto, and so much to get to, so let us get to it.

I put forward a pay-for the disaster funding. I do this on every new bit of funding. So he's really not informed. And his name-calling just sort of exposes him as a left-winger, part of the left-wing mob that really isn't using his brain and is willing to call people names. And it's -- it's really kind of disgusting, because, see, he pretended for years when he was on his comedy show to be somebody who could see both sides and see through the B.S. on both sides. Well, now he is the B.S. The B.S. meter is through the roof, when you see him calling people names, calling people an abomination, when I'm asking something very reasonable, that an amendment be included to consider whether we should pay for this, from taking money somewhere else in the budget. It doesn't actually reduce the deficit. It just keeps the deficit from getting bigger. It's a very reasonable thing. I have done it dozens and dozens of times, including on the tax bill. The left-wing mob says, oh, but you're for tax cuts, but you're not doing anything to offset the tax cuts. There's something called pay-go. And I was the leader in trying to keep that in the tax bill. It was in the tax bill when we passed it and was later taken out of the tax bill, over my objections.

In a subsequent bill, they went ahead and got rid of the pay-go rules in some big enormous spending bill. I objected to it, and I forced an amendment vote on it. And only nine people voted with me. But when I voted for the tax bill, it actually had provisions in it that says you would have to cut spending if there's any less revenue. But the left-wing mob doesn't care about the truth.

You lower tax rates, and you can sometimes get more revenue. Revenue went up after the tax cuts. The deficit did too, but because we refuse to address spending in this town. And what I don't like about this, about the lies and the ad hominem attacks from Jon Stewart and Kirsten Gillibrand and the whole left-wing mob is, they are telling a lie.

We're borrowing most than -- almost $2 million every minute. And I have consistently sounded that theme. And what is really disgusting is people like Jon Stewart lie to the American public.

This is a country that's already paid $12 billion to those people who both died and have died since then. This is a country that will continue to do more.

How about the $2 million we spent studying whether or not if someone sneezes on the food in front of you at the cafeteria, whether you're more or less likely to get the food? That runs throughout the budget. And until you're willing to cut that kind of stuff out to pay for something more important, like the 9/11 victims, you're not doing your job. Just to add it on and borrow it is inexcusable. It's wrong. And it really is what's wrong with Washington, is that everybody fears people like Jon Stewart will say, you lack humanity.

So, I think the discussion now, since we have maximum pressure on and maximum sanctions on Iran, now we have to say, what would we be willing to remove them for? What type of behavior would we be willing to remove them for? I think there is a possible opening that Iran would sign an agreement saying that they won't develop a nuclear weapon ever. That would be a huge breakthrough. I think President Trump is one of the few people who actually could get that deal. And he will get it because he's strong and he's showing maximum pressure. But he's also willing to talk. This is a president who's willing to talk to Kim Jong-un from North Korea. It's a president who's also offered to meet with the Iranians. I hope it will take place. I hope there will be diplomacy. And, once again, I'm for -- I'm fighting to try to prevent war. And I think that should be something that's commended, not excoriated."

And so I see the good side of refugees who appreciate what a great country we have. I have been disturbed and I talk to people every day who are worried about how Omar just bashes our country, and says it's terrible. She wanted justice. She came here. She -- we -- we provided for. We gave her all kinds of benefits when she came to this country. She was elected to Congress, which is an enormous privilege that was -- that was given to her. And yet she continues to bash our country as being this terrible, awful, no-good, rotten place. And I kind of side with the president on this, that I do think she needs to be called out.

Look, I'm opposed to the socialism that AOC is promoting, and Omar, and Tlaib -- or Tlaib. I'm opposed to all of that. It has nothing to do with the color of their skin. But I can't call them out for their socialism or for their ungratefulness to our country because of the color of their skin? No, I think the left wing went crazy on the president.

He's talking about white mice."

And the reason was, of course, that some scientists had thought we might have brought lethal pathogens back from the moon, and they were trying to protect us. So, if the white mice survived and were healthy, they were going to free us. And if the white mice all sickened, I hate to think of the consequences. About that time, I was reading a book, \"Of Mice and Men.\" And I got thinking about it. And the three of us, yes, we had done it. We went to the moon and we came back. But was that good or bad, a triumph or a failure? It depended on the white mice and their health."

There's an attempt to sort of restart the whole space program with the -- using the moon as a launching pad. And I have always thought that it just seemed odd, having done that and achieved that, that we're going back to that. I get the strategy, that maybe that's a launching point for bigger and broader missions. What do you think of all that?"

      "speaker": "COLLINS",

My friend Neil Armstrong, who I think was a far more competent engineer than I, thought that -- in discussing Mars, he thought there were chinks of missing knowledge along the way, and that those chinks could perhaps be filled in at least partially by a stopover or some intermediate step of going back to the moon. It wasn't clearly delineated. Neil died almost five years ago, but that was one of the questions. So I think the current plan has been well-thought-out, but I just disagree with it. I think we ought to shoot directly for planet Mars. I used to joke when I came back from Apollo 11 that I had been sent to the wrong planet, that NASA should be renamed the National Aeronautics and Mars Administration."

One man -- going to put a man on the moon or return him by the end of the decade. He told us what we were going to do and when we were going to do it, and we just have to fill in the how. And that was of immeasurable help, as we were trying to get all the pieces to fit that we needed, all the information we needed, 400,000, would you believe, Americans at one time working on that program."

And he would, sadly, tragically die before -- without seeing that. But his mission was realized. Do we think -- do you think we need that kind of galvanizing competitive threat to do it again? Or can we do it on our own?"

And so I think that things got a little bit out of hand for Donald Trump. All the Republicans -- a lot of Republicans were condemning what happened at the rally, and some of them even condemning what he said in his tweets about Ilhan Omar.

But a lot of his Republican colleagues, including John Thune and a host of others, have told me that they do wish -- and this is even prior to this event -- he would dial it back a little bit.

They're -- the Republicans are always being accused of being racist for things that are not even in the wheelhouse of the comments that we saw from President Trump and the comments at this rally. And so when you have something that's so much more explicit like this, I think that that worries them, especially going into the 2020 election, and they expressed that sentiment to the president."

And it was a unique core of individuals, if you think about it. Only 12 had this special place in human history. And I'm wondering, how did he share that with you growing up and with the extended family?"

When we were little, when he would come home during the -- after working all week long and being gone all week, he was a dad. We did dad things. We horseback-rode, we camped, we fished, we did all sorts of fun death things. But older, when we got -- he communicated it. And he always just really wanted to inspire kids. Dad was very focused on education and on the STEM and just really told kids that, dream the impossible and go out and do it. He only wanted to fly aircraft carriers off of -- fly airplanes off aircraft carriers. And look what he did. He walked on the moon. So..."

And if it had not been the accident in Apollo 13, where we almost lost that crew, it would have been very, very different, but with every moon landing after that, Apollo 14, 15, 16, 17, little less, little less. And he had a sense -- that is your dad -- that maybe, Amy, that this was getting to be like a passing phenomenon. And it worried him, that that would decide the fate of Apollo and the fate of space travel. Did he ever get over that?"

      "utterance": "All right, it froze there. And, hopefully, we will correct this here. But one of the things that both of these astronauts shared, whether you came right after Apollo 11, in the case of Alan Bean and Apollo 12, or certainly Gene Cernan and Apollo 17, this fear that it was winding down, already at the Apollo 11 mission, having achieved this monumental moment, that there wasn't the ratings draw, the appeal that there had been. And it weighed on them. We have lost both of these ladies now. So, obviously, I just wanted to share some of these videos that we took when I was with Gene Cernan. There are others where I was happy to be with Alan Bean. I always like to tell the story, having known them well, that I wanted to be an astronaut myself when I was a kid. My parents wisely took me to Cape Canaveral and to Huntsville, Alabama, Space Center to have a look at these capsules and realize that, well, I was a chubby kid. I couldn't -- I couldn't fit in the capsule. And they said, well, maybe you have to have other dreams. So I became a television anchor."

Obviously in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 flight and the missions since, and a reminder of the -- what we were able to achieve, as the nation was otherwise distracted by everything from Vietnam, to political assassinations, to the deaths of astronauts, in this case, just a little more than two years before Apollo 11's successful launch. We're going to continue exploring that this week and on Saturday with not only Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon. We talked, of course, to Michael Collins, who was his crewmate on Apollo 11, but Gene Kranz. He was an instrumental role, a flight control director, later got to fly in Skylab himself, looking back at that very special time. I left out a very important Gene Cernan story I just want to very quickly share with you, the last man to walk on the moon. My son was a big fan of astronauts, and particularly Gene Cernan, and went to the viewing of his documentary. And, of course, he treated my son like a star, even though my son was just happy to miss school, as a result, to see this guy. But he left an impression. And Gene Cernan said, \"Someday, you're going to go to Mars.\" I told him, not before I force him there myself."
