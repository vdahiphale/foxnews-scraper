Every former president has a choice to make, right? So, how are they going to shape their like? Will they be an active participant in that or they let other sort of take the lead?   I think that President Obama obviously wouldn't turn down an award like this. He could have waited another year if he wanted to but I think that he thinks he is the best person to try to protect his legacy. The contrast of his speaking style, President Trump is so stark. And we are almost three minutes into the show before we start talking about it because it takes a while for these words to get out. The interesting thing also about him needing to protect his legacy is remember we learned in that book that just came out that Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen put out about the Hillary Clinton campaign. And on election night they said Hillary Clinton, when she talked to President Obama, she said I'm so sorry. And the reason is that she was hopefully going to be in position for the Democrats to defend President Obama's legacy. And now she's not able to do that. She is still fighting the last war. She's still blaming everybody as we talked about last week. So he has to be the person. Interesting thing is the divisiveness -- I don't know who you going to blame for that but you can't just blame the current situation. And this has been going on for a long time. And Obamacare was certainly one of the most divisive things that ever happened. And the last thing I say is he continues to lecture rather than persuade and it gets annoying a little bit because you think, well, we actually have problems that we need to fix with this law. It's not perfect. And it doesn't take a profile encourage award to admit that. Actually the more courageous thing is to say this law actually does need some -- to be fixed.",

He was -- President Obama mastered the art of the two idea prison. If you didn't agree with him, you were evil. And everything that he did was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do. So, if you disagree with him on climate change -- you want the planet to die, if you disagree with him on immigration, you would destroy families. If you are against him on Obamacare, you wanted sick people and children to die. There was no halfway point with President Obama.  His idea of compromise was to agree with him. Or you were evil.

When you have senators who took steps, took measures in the Senate that led them to some pain at the ballot box, and that's what happens to people who backed Obamacare as Democrats, who paid a price, lost office in many cases. And he was saying that today we could use that kind of courage where people coming together and actually fix and repair, make possible good health care for all Americans.

Every former president has a choice to make, right? So, how are they going to shape their like? Will they be an active participant in that or they let other sort of take the lead? I think that President Obama obviously wouldn't turn down an award like this. He could have waited another year if he wanted to but I think that he thinks he is the best person to try to protect his legacy. The contrast of his speaking style, President Trump is so stark. And we are almost three minutes into the show before we start talking about it because it takes a while for these words to get out. The interesting thing also about him needing to protect his legacy is remember we learned in that book that just came out that Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen put out about the Hillary Clinton campaign. And on election night they said Hillary Clinton, when she talked to President Obama, she said I'm so sorry. And the reason is that she was hopefully going to be in position for the Democrats to defend President Obama's legacy. And now she's not able to do that. She is still fighting the last war. She's still blaming everybody as we talked about last week. So he has to be the person. Interesting thing is the divisiveness -- I don't know who you going to blame for that but you can't just blame the current situation. And this has been going on for a long time. And Obamacare was certainly one of the most divisive things that ever happened. And the last thing I say is he continues to lecture rather than persuade and it gets annoying a little bit because you think, well, we actually have problems that we need to fix with this law. It's not perfect. And it doesn't take a profile encourage award to admit that. Actually the more courageous thing is to say this law actually does need some -- to be fixed."

He was -- President Obama mastered the art of the two idea prison. If you didn't agree with him, you were evil. And everything that he did was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do. So, if you disagree with him on climate change -- you want the planet to die, if you disagree with him on immigration, you would destroy families. If you are against him on Obamacare, you wanted sick people and children to die. There was no halfway point with President Obama. His idea of compromise was to agree with him. Or you were evil.

When you have senators who took steps, took measures in the Senate that led them to some pain at the ballot box, and that's what happens to people who backed Obamacare as Democrats, who paid a price, lost office in many cases. And he was saying that today we could use that kind of courage where people coming together and actually fix and repair, make possible good health care for all Americans.

They know that they've got this guy lying to the vice president. What's interesting is the Trump White House, Don McGahn, the White House lawyers then says to Sally Yates -- and by the way, she was in person, it's not over the phobe. She goes to see him. Says, well, what difference does it make if you have two White House officials lying to each other? What's the problem with that?

Speaking of police, Broward County confirmed this attack took place in North Lauderdale, Florida. They don't know the woman's condition yet. Of course the media usually helps in such matters -- if it fits their assumptions. But right now they're trying to find the name of the lady who berated a Muslim at a supermarket. No joke. That's the lead on some sites. So the pool story is not so much about the assault, the story is the lack of a story and how big the reverse would have been. Imagine an elderly, infirm black woman walks into a frat house pool party filled with white crew cuts. One body slams her then chucks her and her small dog into a pool. Now that's not national news. It's international news. Soul-searching and national conversation are the terms that we hear all week. Stephen Colbert shouts, welcome to Trump's America. MSNBC jumps in with both feet. The lawsuits are filed before the woman dries off. But here that's not the case. Instead, we're the only show doing the story. I guess clearly this woman didn't check her privilege at the gate.

She could have been killed. What if she couldn't swim? You don't know. Or she had a heart condition like you said or something like that. To me this is aggravated assault or an aggravated battery. We could be looking at serious jail time, prison time, multiple years, up to five years and fines. And I think it should be taken seriously.

And the Democrats push it because it puts Republicans on the defensive and it fires up their base. I do agree with Juan on one point and I hate to disagree with Kimberly because I'm afraid."

I was saying, listen, can you believe that we actually have to pass a law telling people to observe and uphold the law? And that's what they're trying to do. Nevertheless, we've seen all the legal challenges to the travel ban. No matter what move they make. They found a court that's sympathetic to try to bring the case against it to stop it. So, I mean, you know, I worked in a sanctuary city. I see the pitfalls and the perils of it, and when I was a prosecutor in San Francisco in cases like Kate Steinle. It's just shocking to me that we now have to tell law enforcement people to actually follow the law that they sworn in oath to uphold."

There never have been. But if you want to look -- when people talk about how destructive this is, just go and look to the south. Peer over Texas to Venezuela and you will see liberal policies killing people. So this is nothing. No one is going to die from this. They are dying from that."

On Friday, prosecutors announced criminal charges for 18 fraternity brothers over the February death of 19-year-old Timothy Piazza. The sophomore died after falling down a stairs while intoxicated at a fraternity party. According to a grand jury investigation, police found Piazza unconscious only after fraternity brothers had waited about 12 hours to call 911. We're now learning more about why it took so long for anyone to call for help."

Honestly, I mean when you see a situation like this, how horrifying too for the parents of these children. They stop there and let another human being die probably internal injuries, et cetera. But for their lack of regard, their callous disregard for human life, this young man would still be alive. Manslaughter charges."

      "utterance": "Well, it's not just fraternities. It's the age of 17 to 22, where you appear to be an adult but you are encouraged to act like a child. It's a strange thing. It's not just in fraternities. It's everywhere. I think the thing that needs to be addressed is, you know, there has to be a Samaritan pass. You know, a lot of people don't call 911 in any party situations. Not just in fraternities but in clubs or on vacation, you don't want to be implicated in the law breaking behavior that might have led to an injury. So you have to somehow let people know that even though you're breaking the law, when the victim who is suffering has broken the law, you get some sort of immunity. You get a free pass if you try to save this person. So it says, look, man, I was doing drugs with this guy and I don't want to call the police but I got to call the police and the cops says -- they go like, don't worry about it, tell us where you are. There has to be some kind of Samaritan pass that is encouraged."
