And my understanding is, you know, she answered. And I have to say that, her testimony I thought was exceptional. She answered in excruciating detail every question about the campaign, every allegation at all of anything involving Papadopoulos or Carter Page or any about Russian influence or Russian collusion or any type of cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia as far as I was concerned in any rational observer. She debunked all of that. I thought she did an exceptional job, and she was still going a few minutes ago; she should be over by now. She was there for nine hours.

But, you know, the lack of knowing that hasn't stopped many people from arguing that there is a lead pipe cinch of a case of collusion or that there's bombshell evidence out there establishing collusion. I don't see that. I have a column out today in The Hill where I go through all of the alleged evidence of collusion, and it just doesn't hold together very well. This is not particularly compelling evidence, and it is, indeed, quite implausible. When you look at the dates and look at what the meetings were at the Trump Tower, a meeting in a pub involving Papadopoulos, these don't really fit a very convincing narrative of collusion.

They didn't limit the meeting. They held it at Trump Tower where there was an army of reporter downstairs. Does that sound like a Russian intel operation? Because it's not very convincing.

China is still a one-party state that exerts an enormous control over political dissent, public opinion and the economy. And even with term limits, President Xi Jinping was referred to as the chairman of everything because he's not just the head of state, he's also general secretary of the communist party and heads up numerous committees and leadership groups. The concern now is the communist party has elevated Xi to the same status as Chairman Mao. Remember, Mao Zedong was credited in turning China into a world power. He was also condemned for mass repression and the wide dismantling of religious and cultural artifacts. Mao died in 1976. His successor, Deng Xiaoping, implemented 5-year term limits in 1982. Now, inside China, it's unclear how much opposition there is to scrapping term limits because the country's internet censors are reportedly deleting critical comments. But a well-known Chinese journalist and former editor of a Chinese state-run newspaper has penned an open letter saying this proposal will sow the seeds of chaos, quoting here, as a Chinese citizen, I have to fulfill my responsibility until the delegates my opinion. I don't care what these delegates will do. It's not like the whole country agrees with the amendment, but everyone has been silenced. The reaction from world leaders has been more muted, and experts say that's likely because the world does not want to promote instability in a nation that contains one fifth of the world's population.

And so what President Obama, and really a feckless national security staff did was level the playing field so that there were no hills. And a good example is, dealing directly with Iran on nuclear weapons, who weren't supposed to have nuclear weapons. We just dealt with them as if they were a peer. And so, you've got now China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, Hungary, Egypt, all of these regimes now taking on more authoritarian terms because, under the Obama administration, we created a power vacuum because we gave away our superpower abilities.

Fifty plus million children have been killed. In multiple states, we allow doctors to assist people, medically. Doctors who have taken a Hippocratic Oath to help people take their lives, assisted suicide by doctors. That, coupled with the fact that so many people in America, including our youth, are on psychotropic drugs which literally are altering their mental state. The side effect of which -- on so many is depression and suicidal thoughts.

And my understanding is, you know, she answered. And I have to say that, her testimony I thought was exceptional. She answered in excruciating detail every question about the campaign, every allegation at all of anything involving Papadopoulos or Carter Page or any about Russian influence or Russian collusion or any type of cooperation between the Trump campaign and Russia as far as I was concerned in any rational observer. She debunked all of that. I thought she did an exceptional job, and she was still going a few minutes ago; she should be over by now. She was there for nine hours.

I was speaking of the evidence that's available at this time. He was referring to a tweet that the president had sent out that quoted me, saying that I was skeptical about collusion based on the evidence that we know. And so, it was somewhat ironic to hear -- you know, this doesn't mean that if Mueller doesn't have something else. Well, of course it doesn't. But, you know, the lack of knowing that hasn't stopped many people from arguing that there is a lead pipe cinch of a case of collusion or that there's bombshell evidence out there establishing collusion. I don't see that. I have a column out today in The Hill where I go through all of the alleged evidence of collusion, and it just doesn't hold together very well. This is not particularly compelling evidence, and it is, indeed, quite implausible. When you look at the dates and look at what the meetings were at the Trump Tower, a meeting in a pub involving Papadopoulos, these don't really fit a very convincing narrative of collusion. Now, yes, Mueller might have, you know, pictures of a shirtless Putin in the Oval Office -- you like Saturday Night Live -- but he might not."

If anything, it seems to me to run against that narrative, the Russians used an acquaintance of music promoter, to get a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. on the promise of giving a legal evidence -- of illegal contributions to the Clinton Foundation. They didn't limit the meeting. They held it at Trump Tower where there was an army of reporter downstairs. Does that sound like a Russian intel operation? Because it's not very convincing. It's not very convincing that the Russians have this top secret, you know, conspiracy. But they're going to reveal it to Donald Jr. in Trump Tower meeting."

And then, they, you know, went in hard with the Magnitsky Act issue. It's pretty hard to figure out where the collusion actually comes into play in that. What about this letter that was drafted -- the statement that was drafted on Air Force One, that they obviously wanted to know more about from Hope Hicks today. And clearly, something that Robert Mueller is interested in. Would helping to craft the response to what happened in the June 26 meeting? Would that constitute obstruction of justice in any way?"

These are usually type A personalities that, you know, try to direct events. So, could it be obstruction or part of that? Sure. But it also could be the most obvious explanation, which is, Trump was trying to control the controversy and control the narrative. Should he have done it? No. But that doesn't make it obstruction."

China is still a one-party state that exerts an enormous control over political dissent, public opinion and the economy. And even with term limits, President Xi Jinping was referred to as the chairman of everything because he's not just the head of state, he's also general secretary of the communist party and heads up numerous committees and leadership groups. The concern now is the communist party has elevated Xi to the same status as Chairman Mao. Remember, Mao Zedong was credited in turning China into a world power. He was also condemned for mass repression and the wide dismantling of religious and cultural artifacts. Mao died in 1976. His successor, Deng Xiaoping, implemented 5-year term limits in 1982. Now, inside China, it's unclear how much opposition there is to scrapping term limits because the country's internet censors are reportedly deleting critical comments. But a well-known Chinese journalist and former editor of a Chinese state-run newspaper has penned an open letter saying this proposal will sow the seeds of chaos, quoting here, as a Chinese citizen, I have to fulfill my responsibility until the delegates my opinion. I don't care what these delegates will do. It's not like the whole country agrees with the amendment, but everyone has been silenced. The reaction from world leaders has been more muted, and experts say that's likely because the world does not want to promote instability in a nation that contains one fifth of the world's population.

So starting about nine years ago when President Obama got elected, you know, he had graduated from the Jeremiah Wright School of foreign policy, a weaker America makes for a stronger world. And so, he dealt with our adversaries in that fashion in such a way that we were no longer, in my opinion, Reagan's shining city on the hill and a beacon of freedom and democracy for others to view and aspire to be. And so what President Obama, and really a feckless national security staff did was level the playing field so that there were no hills. And a good example is, dealing directly with Iran on nuclear weapons, who weren't supposed to have nuclear weapons. We just dealt with them as if they were a peer. And so, you've got now China, North Korea, Russia, Iran, Hungary, Egypt, all of these regimes now taking on more authoritarian terms because, under the Obama administration, we created a power vacuum because we gave away our superpower abilities. And now what you've seen with President Trump is reasserting American hegemony and dominance, and that very well could be the catalyst for what happened in China."

And I think about the person who expressed their dissent to his decision to be an endless authoritarian figure in China. I don't know what's going to happen to that person.

President Trump -- in preparation for this segment, I reread the national security strategy that the president's team put out in December, and it very clearly identifies China and Russia as peer competitors that are trying to take on more totalitarian roles with their people to fight of free people, free information, and free markets, and to suppress their people, and grow their military so they can be more peer competitors. And it's in the wake of this very weak American foreign policy in the past. And so, what we need to do now is stand up to these countries, such as China, and make sure they understand that we are here and in the South China Sea.

    {
      "speaker": "MATT BEVIN, KENTUCKY GOVERNOR",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Martha."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You believe that in order to get to the heart of this matter, there's a lot of discussion about gun-control, about mental health, that we need to really regroup and where we are headed as a society as a whole. How do you do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVIN",
      "utterance": "It's not easily done. And I'll tell you, there is no easy fix. That's the most difficult thing. It's why so many people are quick to ridicule and disregard this conversation. But how do you do it? You do with one person at a time. This is literally a call out to every single parent in America, to every teacher in America, to every coach, to every Sunday school, to every civic organization, to every single scout leader. I'm asking every adult in America to look for the young people in your life, and if you're not doing enough to protect them, to protect their physical security, their emotional security, to protect their innocence, and then I'm asking you to step up and do more because, societally, it is the responsibility of the adults, those among us who are in a position to do so, to protect our young people, we're not doing a good job of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You talk about the fact that there have always been guns in America, but there haven't always been these horrific, vicious, impossible to understand killings by children of other children. So what changed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVIN",
      "utterance": "I think what is change is we've become rudderless as a society. Again, you take the culture of life or death, however you want to look at it, do we celebrate life or do we celebrate death in this culture? And again, this is a heavy, heavy topic. But you look at musical lyrics, you look at the video games, you look at the television programming and the movies and how increasingly violent and how increasingly realistic, they are desensitizing our young people and our adults, for that matter, to the value and the sanctity of human life. And again, without going off on topic that will get people's hair on end, we in this society, for the last 40 year years, have told people it's OK to kill a child if it's not yet born. Fifty plus million children have been killed. In multiple states, we allow doctors to assist people, medically. Doctors who have taken a Hippocratic Oath to help people take their lives, assisted suicide by doctors. That, coupled with the fact that so many people in America, including our youth, are on psychotropic drugs which literally are altering their mental state. The side effect of which -- on so many is depression and suicidal thoughts. You mix all that together, you look at the studies that have been done one after the next that talked about the impact of a personal phone and a device and the screen time and what that does to the psyche. All these things are crushing the spirit and the psyche of our young people. And parents turn the TV off. You don't need your children to have cell phones. Pour into your children. America has got to wake up. And governors and presidents and everybody in political office and those of you who have the power of the media to wake up and protect our young people, because we are reaping what we've sown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think you make excellent points about phones and social media and the impact. I don't think we've even begun to understand the impact of that. When you look at this kid, he had four Instagram accounts and he was putting pictures of his guns, at which I see is a cry for help. I mean, he wanted somebody to stop him. He even called 911 and said, I lost my mother recently and I'm in trouble. And the fact that -- we've talked too much about all the signs that were there. It's just mind- blowing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVIN",
      "utterance": "It's always easy, and you know this. And when we look in the rearview mirror, it's always easy to have found a path we might have taken. What we are not doing is looking out the windshield at the problem right before us with our young people. The Atlantic published an article, recently, addressing this very issue and the impact of this screen time on our children, and people would be well served to look at it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Agreed. Governor Bevin, thank you very much, sir. Good to see you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVIN",
      "utterance": "Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Thanks for being on The Story tonight. We'll be right back."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So a public university in California is offering a new course focused on removing President Trump from office. Starting next month, criminal justice students at San Diego State University can take a class called a Trump, impeachment, removal or conviction. The university insists that this is a weekend course, not sure whether it makes a difference, and that it is not funded by public tax dollars, which is of interest. Here now, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor, and Wendy Osefo, a professor and political commentator. Welcome to both of you this evening. So those are the three choices, Mollie, that you get if you enroll in that class."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Not surprising. I'm wonder for these college students, is this really worth going into debt over, is this the type of thing that's going to prepare you to enter the real world? We have problems with a lot of the kids not being able to get jobs straight out of college and this is the type of course that you're seeing. If you look at catalogs, we kind of replacing of learning which is naked politics. Adults used to spend college time teaching students what they needed to know to become good members of society. And now it just seems that they're pandering to whatever kids are goofing off about, whether it's televisions studies, or video games theory or whatever is happening in the resistance at the moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Wendy, what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WENDY OSEFO, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Well, as a professor, our job is not just to educate students about what it is they want to learn, but also what may pique their curiosity. Educators, there's been courses for, you know, history that talk about presidents and talk about things that are intrinsically woven with the presidency. So during Obama's presidency there were lots of courses that examine Obama, and hip-hop Obama and the urban community. And now with Trump, all you hear on TV and the media is Trump and impeachment. So again, this does not mean that the university believes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But why is the university giving into all they hear on TV? Why aren't they offering an option? Why is there no class, you know, Trump, you know, why he won, the forgotten men and women of America, something like that would also be interesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSEFO",
      "utterance": "Yeah, that's American history 101. In universities, our job is to make that whatever is going on we have a course that discusses this, so students are able to learn from it. This does not indoctrinate them in anyway. It just talks about the tentacles that have to deal with impeachment. That's the core of this course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Mollie, do you agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I mean, it's also about helping students cope with reality. And a lot of what we experience in the media for the last year is people unable to deal with the reality that Donald Trump won election. They talk about impeachment. They talked a lot about the 25th amendment, this idea that they can somehow take care of what wasn't taken care of by the voters. And that's actually the entire problem with people's inability to come to terms with Trump winning is that people were getting kind of sick of the elites telling other people what they needed to believe or what they needed to do. And the voters do have a say in how this country is run. And students should learn to understand that better, rather than be led by the moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What about Mollie's initial claim, Wendy, that, you know, we're not educating our students in a way that is going to be truly useful to them when they leave?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSEFO",
      "utterance": "Well, I reject that premise. We are educating all students. Al students are graduating at higher rates and all students are entering the workforce, actually, more prepared than any other group of students. So it's not just because of your political view that you can say of course it's useful to you or not. The courses can speak to Democrats, it can speak to Republicans, and it's an elective course, it's not a required course, so we have to underscore that. Students take wrestling, student take dance, student can take anything they want to. So this is educating all students if they want to learn about the impeachment process and about our government and our political systems."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Mollie, final thought?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Universities have had this credibility that wasn't viewed upon them by previous generations of educating students, and they're losing that credibility and it's becoming a serious problem. They say, this course isn't taxpayer-funded, but a lot of universities are taxpayer-funded, and it is a problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, most are. Wendy and Mollie, thank you. Good to see you both. Thanks for coming. All right, so former President Bill Clinton paid tribute to the late-Reverend Billy Graham. We'll show you what he had to say, very interesting, next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So tomorrow, the late-Reverend Billy Graham will become the fourth private citizen in our nations history to lie in honor in the Rotunda of the U.S. capital, other includes Rosa Parks, and the Capitol police officer who was killed on the line of duty. Today, mourners including former President Bill Clinton paid their respects as Graham rested in his birthplace of Charlotte, North Carolina, where Clinton offered this assessment of religion's role in politics. It's our quote of the night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "We have a saying, you know, if you're a preacher, you've got to be careful of getting to close to politicians. I agree with that. Don't forget, those of us who are Christians believe in a God of second chances, and the politicians need that more than anybody else."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "We will be back here tomorrow night with more of The Story at 7:00. That's our story for tonight. Tucker Carlson, coming up next."
