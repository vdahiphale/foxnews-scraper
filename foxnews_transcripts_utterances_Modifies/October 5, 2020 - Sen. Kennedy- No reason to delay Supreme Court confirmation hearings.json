      "sentences": "Afternoon, Neil. The president is a phenomenal patient, and soon he will be heading home.  That's the word from his medical team here at Walter Reed. They say there are no active signs of the virus. His vitals look very good.   In fact, his respiratory signs are very good. And so, later on this evening, he is expected to make his way back over to the White House. Let me take you to Twitter and share with the president had to say about that, as we sort of unpack what has been an action-packed afternoon here at Walter Reed. He said: \"I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at   6:30 p.m., feeling really good. Don't be afraid of COVID. Don't let it dominate your life. We have developed under the Trump administration some really great drugs and knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago.\" Dr. Sean Conley, briefing reporters earlier, he said the president is breathing normally, he says, and though he is not entirely out of the woods, the team here agrees that the clinical status supports a safe return home to the White House, where, of course, he will be surrounded by 24/7 medical care. He also said the president has been a phenomenal patient. He's been back and forth on what's safe and reasonable and never once pushed the team to do anything beyond what is safe and reasonable practice of medicine.  Neil, there are still some questions about what will happen with respect to the action plan once he is back at the White House. And then the all- important question, of course, is also, when might he back out on the campaign trail?   The doctors were hesitant to sort of pin that down, but they made it sound like he could be back out there. Of course, that will have to happen after a weeks-long evaluation back at the White House. Also, there were some questions about when he had his last negative test.  The doctors here didn't want to touch that, citing HIPAA rules, but a lot of people are wondering when that was with respect to contact and contact tracing -- contact tracing. So, we're not exactly sure. We will continue to dig for that -- but, for now, back to you.",

And as I said, when the president told me he was headed back to the White House, he told me to head to Utah, and we're looking very much forward to the vice presidential debate.

I should stress he has tested negative again and again for the virus. Out of an abundance of caution, though, some doctors have suggested it might not be wise to go there, to push this thing back. So far, it doesn't look like they are. And they're going to honor severe distancing rules, as I call it, I believe, about 12 feet between them. So we will monitor that.

And I think we have really, really felt that enthusiasm from Trump supporters. Everything that he's saying everything he's doing, everybody's very, very protective of him. Now, on the other side, you have seen Biden supporters, you have seen a lot of people on the other side really attack everything that's been happening, whether it's -- whether it's that he is coming home too soon, whether it's his doctors or lying or covering up for him. You have heard all of that.  Now, that's energizing the other side. I think, ultimately, it's a big wash. I don't think that it's going to have a huge impact. What is going to have an impact is how the president behaves now and how Joe Biden proceeds from here. So, is Joe Biden going to take the tone of, I told you so? I don't think that's going to be something that's going to help him. Is the president to be dismissive, that this is something not to fear too much? I think there's a lot of people who are very concerned. So I think that all of it's going to come in the days that follow. How is it going to impact us? Now, I think The Wall Street Journal poll was also an outlier. When you look at the polling, really, what's happened since the debate last week, there's been a shift about one point to 1.5 points. When you look at the key swing states -- and that's where we're most important -- no big shifts have really happened.",

Fairly or not, he's been criticized for not taking masks seriously, maybe not taking COVID-19 seriously, even distancing and other provisions within the White House. Now we have a half-a-dozen officials, high and low, there who contracted the virus, maybe more to come, and all these people who got diagnosed with it after a White House event for the Supreme Court candidate here.

If he's overly dismissive of COVID -- and I think a lot of people are concerned as they're seeing numbers spike again, as you're seeing an event like this happen -- and I think he can't be too, too dismissive. I think he can show, look, I got it, we have made advances, innovations happen, this is great, it's not what it once was.

I remember, when I got sick, first became symptomatic on March 17, the next two or three days were just sort of slight flu-like symptoms, which sort of what the president is describing, from what we're hearing, that there was a spike in temperature, that there was some compromise of his oxygenation, which I also experienced. But then it was curious, because that's why I beg him to really take heat at this, that the next few days, there were sort of, you have blips of positivity of feeling a little bit better, and then it comes back and forth. I would say I had two days where I felt a little bit better, my temperature was sort of in control. And then, within five days, I proceeded to get worse and worse, with an incredible spike in temperature, with symptoms that went from losing taste and smell to incredible headaches and memory loss and a number of these things. So, there's more yet to come. I hope that he ends up having the lighter version of this. And we don't know about the treatment and the therapeutics he's undergoing.

And so, later on this evening, he is expected to make his way back over to the White House.

We have developed under the Trump administration some really great drugs and knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago.\" Dr. Sean Conley, briefing reporters earlier, he said the president is breathing normally, he says, and though he is not entirely out of the woods, the team here agrees that the clinical status supports a safe return home to the White House, where, of course, he will be surrounded by 24/7 medical care. He also said the president has been a phenomenal patient. He's been back and forth on what's safe and reasonable and never once pushed the team to do anything beyond what is safe and reasonable practice of medicine. Neil, there are still some questions about what will happen with respect to the action plan once he is back at the White House. And then the all- important question, of course, is also, when might he back out on the campaign trail? The doctors were hesitant to sort of pin that down, but they made it sound like he could be back out there. Of course, that will have to happen after a weeks-long evaluation back at the White House. Also, there were some questions about when he had his last negative test. The doctors here didn't want to touch that, citing HIPAA rules, but a lot of people are wondering when that was with respect to contact and contact tracing -- contact tracing. So, we're not exactly sure. We will continue to dig for that -- but, for now, back to you."

And we heard that today, that his respiratory function is in good shape.

Now, in normal cases, that would warrant, just out of an abundance of caution, the vice president quarantining himself, which would obviously bring us up to this debate.

And we really believe it is emblematic of the love and the care and the compassion the American people have shown all of those that have been impacted by the coronavirus from the very beginning of this pandemic. And as I said, when the president told me he was headed back to the White House, he told me to head to Utah, and we're looking very much forward to the vice presidential debate.

I should stress he has tested negative again and again for the virus. Out of an abundance of caution, though, some doctors have suggested it might not be wise to go there, to push this thing back. So far, it doesn't look like they are. And they're going to honor severe distancing rules, as I call it, I believe, about 12 feet between them. So we will monitor that.

The Democratic nominee also said he would like to come back to Miami in 10 days to debate Trump again. And while he was saying that, somebody noticed that there wasn't enough social distancing.

Want to go to Lee Carter on the impact of all of this. Lee, you think about some of these polls that are out, including this Wall Street Journal/NBC News one that has the president trailing by now by 14 points, now, out of that pre the president being diagnosed with COVID. But what do you suspect the COVID impact has been for the president? I know it's sort of a mug's game here. But what do you think?"

And they are really, really excited, energized, enthused to continue to support the president. They're all paying attention to every word, hoping and praying for his recovery. And I think we have really, really felt that enthusiasm from Trump supporters. Everything that he's saying everything he's doing, everybody's very, very protective of him. Now, on the other side, you have seen Biden supporters, you have seen a lot of people on the other side really attack everything that's been happening, whether it's -- whether it's that he is coming home too soon, whether it's his doctors or lying or covering up for him. You have heard all of that. Now, that's energizing the other side. I think, ultimately, it's a big wash. I don't think that it's going to have a huge impact. What is going to have an impact is how the president behaves now and how Joe Biden proceeds from here. So, is Joe Biden going to take the tone of, I told you so? I don't think that's going to be something that's going to help him. Is the president to be dismissive, that this is something not to fear too much? I think there's a lot of people who are very concerned. So I think that all of it's going to come in the days that follow. How is it going to impact us? Now, I think The Wall Street Journal poll was also an outlier. When you look at the polling, really, what's happened since the debate last week, there's been a shift about one point to 1.5 points. When you look at the key swing states -- and that's where we're most important -- no big shifts have really happened."

But, at the same time, people are going to wait to see, has this changed your posture on the disease? Fairly or not, he's been criticized for not taking masks seriously, maybe not taking COVID-19 seriously, even distancing and other provisions within the White House. Now we have a half-a-dozen officials, high and low, there who contracted the virus, maybe more to come, and all these people who got diagnosed with it after a White House event for the Supreme Court candidate here.

And that is both physically safe, emotionally safe, and financially safe? The physical safety comes really down to law and order and it comes down to how you feel about COVID. If he's overly dismissive of COVID -- and I think a lot of people are concerned as they're seeing numbers spike again, as you're seeing an event like this happen -- and I think he can't be too, too dismissive. I think he can show, look, I got it, we have made advances, innovations happen, this is great, it's not what it once was. I think he can go that far, but there's a point where he could cross the line. And I think he's very good at going right up to that line."

And, certainly, we have seen a big spike in the New York City metropolitan area there reimposing restrictions on indoor dining and the likes in at least eight to nine zip codes around the New York City area. Another dozen could experience the same type of restrictions, as cases get a little out of whack. So this is something that's gone a lot bigger and a lot further certainly than the White House and the Washington, D.C., area.

And just before we came on the air here, Lindsey Graham, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, formally sent out the notice that the hearing would start a week from today, Monday, October 12, and would run through the 15th. Now, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, he has sidelined all floor action for the next two weeks. It doesn't mean the committee's can't work. But this will probably be some sort of a hybrid hearing, with some senators appearing, some not. And the problem here is that they still do not have a testing regime for coronavirus at the United States Capitol. This is really a problem, according to Rodney Davis, Republican from Illinois, who is the top Republican on the House Administration Committee."

I want to be able to look the nominee in the eye and judge her temperament and her intelligence and her judicial philosophy and her character. But if folks are concerned about it, my colleagues on the committee, they can appear -- appear virtually. There's -- we will do it in a big room. Everybody will be socially distanced.

And we now have seven people who have contracted the virus, including Chris Christie, again, three of your colleagues, a host of others, now Kayleigh McEnany. Do you think now, with the president coming back to the White House -- we hope he does well -- I'm sure you feel the same way, Senator -- that he's got to tighten up or get more aggressive how business is conducted at the White House, everyone wear a mask, everyone honor social distancing?

And the reason they call it a pandemic is because it's out there, it's easy to get. If you can get it at the White House, you can get it pretty much anywhere. And you just -- you have got to be careful. I think that point has been enforced and reinforced."

Maybe this whole thing has changed him. Do you think it should?"

This is America. And people are free. I mean, in China, it would be easy. If you don't wear a mask, they will bayonet you or throw you in Shawshank Prison. We don't do that in America.

As you know, I was sick from March through mid-June, a three-month bout with COVID that was substantial. And then what ended up happening is, I'm now being called one of the COVID long-haulers, as the symptoms have continued on so many different parts of my body and my health.

But I still really believe it's important that people need to note that that -- and my prayers go out to the president and his wife and all those who have tested positive -- that people tend to believe that, if you're old, you die, and, if you're young, you get better quickly. But there are tens and thousands of people who have gotten the virus like myself who have collateral and residual symptoms that are ongoing, and there is no playbook for it. So, while I'm now eight months into this, I'm still suffering quite a bit with residual damage, having had this incredibly huge four-level fusion on my neck as a direct result of the virus. So, I think it's important people really need to take note that this is not a joke, it's a beast, and that I don't know what people have to -- in store. For me right now, I'm trying to get better at a day at a time, and I'm thrilled to be here with you, Neil."

For those who are older, for those who are dealing with other issues, it can be -- it can be kind of back and forth. What do you want to remind the president to prepare for, do, change, alter? Anything?"

And there's no direct playbook. I remember, when I got sick, first became symptomatic on March 17, the next two or three days were just sort of slight flu-like symptoms, which sort of what the president is describing, from what we're hearing, that there was a spike in temperature, that there was some compromise of his oxygenation, which I also experienced. But then it was curious, because that's why I beg him to really take heat at this, that the next few days, there were sort of, you have blips of positivity of feeling a little bit better, and then it comes back and forth. I would say I had two days where I felt a little bit better, my temperature was sort of in control. And then, within five days, I proceeded to get worse and worse, with an incredible spike in temperature, with symptoms that went from losing taste and smell to incredible headaches and memory loss and a number of these things. So, there's more yet to come. I hope that he ends up having the lighter version of this. And we don't know about the treatment and the therapeutics he's undergoing. But, from my experience, the next -- after five days of having the virus, the next 45 days were quite a ride. So, I wish him the best."

Be aggressive about it. He, of course, contracted COVID-19, and he is still dealing with it now, with a host of issues. Kaylee McGhee joins us right now of The Washington Examiner.

So, Trump still has a bit of recovery ahead of him. Obviously, he seems to be in much better spirits. He seems to be doing very well, based off of his recent tweet.

But I'm wondering, too, even talking to Peter, this Wall Streeter who has had all sorts of complications, an older gentleman close to the president's age, and you begin to wonder about the president trying to move too fast on this. Do you think the issue of the debate itself will come up or whether he should push that back? What are you hearing?"

I think that there is a legitimate concern that moving back to the White House too soon could put other staffers at risk. So the White House needs to be sure that they're not recklessly endangering the lives of other people and the health of the staffers who will work at the White House under Trump. And as to the debate, technically, the second presidential debate is scheduled to be after the 14-day quarantine period. So there's no reason that Trump couldn't technically participate in that debate. Obviously, his health is the most important thing, though. So, if he's not feeling up to it, or if he feels that that would be a risk to other people who would be attending the debate, he should do the right thing and either not participate, or, better yet, just hold the debate virtually."

Either it will instill confidence, when the people see that he had this, he beat it, and he's able to lead them moving forward, or it could take that confidence, if he's still unable to promote certain restrictions or to guard the safety of the American public.
