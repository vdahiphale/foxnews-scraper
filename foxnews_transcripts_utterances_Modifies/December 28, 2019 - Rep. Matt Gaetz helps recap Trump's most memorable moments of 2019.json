      "utterance": "Welcome to Watters' World. I'm Jesse Watters. 2019 was an amazing year. The media did everything it could to tear us apart. So-called news organizations, they lied to us, spiked the truth, humiliated themselves, but America is stronger than ever. Here to analyze, Townhall.com columnists Kurt Schlichter, the host of I'm Right w/ Jesse Kelly, Jesse Kelly and host of Your Voice America, Bill Mitchell. Or we tried to, you know, load the show up with bomb throwers to send the year off in a good way. So, let's start with the Covington smear. Innocent children just out for a walk in D.C. and the media went nuts. Roll it."

      "speaker": "Kurt Schlichter",
      "utterance": "Well, of course, Jesse. The problem is the mainstream media is garbage. It's filled with garbage people doing garbage things and putting out a garbage product. So, none of this is a surprise. My favorite part is how they fell for the idea that this Army Reserve refrigerator repairman who never deployed was somehow the hero of the Tet Offensive. Oh, and he's not just an Indian guy, no, he's an elder, a respected elder, who goes and hassles people and beats a stupid drum in their face."

And I'll tell you what, 17-year-old Jesse would have responded a little differently if somebody approached me and started banging drums in my face. And to what Kurt just said, it's totally true. The guy -- they make the guy out to be some lion, nobody in the newsroom cares about Indians or any of the Indian causes, but as soon as you attack a kid with a MAGA head on, all of a sudden, the guy's Sitting Bull."

Bill, it is funny how the media treats children of different, I guess, political stripes. Trump told Gretchen Thornburg to chill out, and he got attacked for about 48 hours. They called this kid Hitler --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bill Mitchell",
      "utterance": "Yeah. This is a perfect example of the 48-hour rule when it comes to the media. The media loves to throw a bomb. They love to set a fire. And then, if you just wait 48 hours, typically the truth starts to trickle out and the story runs out. And that's what happened on this. It was political judo. They came after him and it ended up making them look bad. So, you know, I mean, this is normal. I mean, [laughs] this is just every week, we get another story like this."

And I want a little gay boy who might watch this to see that I fought the [expletive] back. I'm pissed off. How do you not believe that? It's the truth?"

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",

      "speaker": "Jesse Kelly",
      "utterance": "I think it's my favorite story of 2019. There were bigger, more important stories, but this one is by far my favorite. It had every element in it you could possibly want, including a gullible press where everybody with a brain that is more advanced than an amoeba, heard his story about having a noose tied around his neck and bleach poured on him by two Trump supporters at 2:00 a.m. in downtown Chicago, and everybody who heard this story were like, “No, that’s not true at all.” Only the media, who wanted it to be true, sat there and thoughtfully nodded along and heard his tale of woe [laughs]."

      "speaker": "Bill Mitchell",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes, I’m sorry. Yeah, amazing, amazing. This is another example of the media having Trump Derangement Syndrome so badly that they can take something that any other rational person would look at and say, “You know, this is insane.” I mean, Trump supporters in MAGA hats out trolling for gay black men at 2:00 in the morning when it’s 20 below zero in Chicago [laughs]? I mean, preposterous, and yet they want so badly to believe it that they run with it. And then they’re stuck with it, and, you know, they end up having to walk it back, so -- or if they run with it on page one, then they walk it back on, you know, page 24 in the bottom corner. So --"

      "speaker": "Kurt Schlichter",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I’m just going to chew on my footlong on the way home as the blizzard rages. My favorite part is the assumption that a couple of MAGA-hat guys cruising around at 2:00 a.m. actually knew who the hell Jussie Smollett was."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Amy Robach",
      "utterance": "She told me everything. She had pictures; she had everything. She was in hiding for 12 years. We convinced her to come out; we convinced her to talk to us. It was unbelievable what we had. Clinton; we had everything."
    },

      "speaker": "Kurt Schlichter",
      "utterance": "Well, Clinton -- I mean, he’s partying with Bill Clinton, and ABC News has it, and ABC News squashes it. I mean, it’s unbelievable, except it’s totally believable, because that’s what the media does."

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Kelly",
      "utterance": "Well, it makes you think about a lot of things, Jesse. I mean, we’re talking about the still very much alive, very much in the public eye, former president of the United States of America tied on camera to a billionaire’s pedophilia ring, and not one person in the United States media has approached that ABC reporter and asked her what she meant by, quote, “We had Clinton.” And I’m sorry, you’re right, this is not a laughing one. This is not something to joke about. We’re talking about young girls who were ritually abused by the most powerful men in the world, and potentially the president of the United States, and the entire American media just kind of shrugged and moved on, and they just want to talk about how many scoops of ice cream Donald Trump eats. It’s shocking to me. It’s an embarrassment on the entire American media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Bill, if we had a really just journalistic situation here in this country, you’d have reporters outside of the president of ABC News, outside of the townhouse of Amy Robach, demanding answers. You just don’t have that, though."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bill Mitchell",
      "utterance": "Yeah, absolutely. You know, back in the day when everybody tried their hand at day trading, I tried that as well. And I joined a chatroom, and there was always one guy in the chatroom that was wrong about everything, and we called him the contrarian indicator. And right now, the media has become the contrarian indicator. When they say something, and the more loudly they say it, the less likely the American voter is to believe them, and I think that’s what’s happening here. And these stories come out, and people, like, roll their eyes like, “Okay, you know, whatever.” It actually works, like impeachment, in Trump’s favor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, I completely agree. If they say something, usually the opposite is true. All right, gentlemen, we actually had more stuff. We didn’t even get to it. Obviously, the collusion hoax fell apart. We wanted to play some sound of Jim Acosta accidentally explaining that walls do work at the southern border."

      "utterance": "More trouble for Hunter Biden. As we’ve reported, Hunter is locked in a child support battle in Arkansas. Lunden Alexis Roberts was an exotic dancer in Washington, D.C.; Hunter got her pregnant. She’s suing him for support because, well, she needs the money to raise her child, but Hunter says he’s dead-broke. He’s obviously not. So, this private investigator comes in; he’s been looking into Hunter Biden, he says. He files a notice with the court in Arkansas, claims that Hunter is currently the subject of multiple criminal investigations involving fraud, money laundering, counterfeiting, all sorts of stuff. He claims Hunter and his associates have amassed millions upon millions of dollars through international schemes, but the details are very, very sketchy. Here to break it all down, reporter for The Federalist, Erielle Davidson. Erielle, we can’t confirm this, but the allegation made by the private investigator is what exactly?"

      "speaker": "Erielle Davidson",
      "utterance": "Yes, it’s the usual cast of characters that we see Hunter involved with. The allegations allege that Hunter Biden was involved in money laundering up to hundreds of millions of dollars --"

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "In Ukraine?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Erielle Davidson",
      "utterance": "Yes, in Ukraine, and also associated with some Bank of China accounts potentially. So, there’s a lot going on here, and the one thing we have to know or keep in mind with regard to the allegations is that this is all we really have to work with. All we have to work with are personal investigations. The media has not been very good about investigating Hunter Biden’s professional activities, so what are we left with when we want to get answers to our questions? We’re left looking at personal investigations that are associated or tangential to a custody battle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Right, and we’re just reporting that this was filed in the courtroom in Arkansas as a part of this custody dispute, and Watters’ World has not been able to confirm any of this. But Hunter is saying he doesn’t have any cash, yet he’s living where exactly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Erielle Davidson",
      "utterance": "He’s living in Beverly Hills at a -- in a house that’s valued at $2.5 million. Now, we don’t know how much he bought the house for, but he did buy it this past summer, and according to recent court documents, he’s alleged that he’s in deep debt and has no job. So, this is --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "But he was getting -- what was it? Eighty -- 55 $150,000 a month?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Erielle Davidson",
      "utterance": "Up to $80,000, I think, at some point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "$80,000 from a Ukrainian gas company. He just shelled out $2.5 million or whatever for a house in Beverly Hills. He obviously has some income. What else is going on? You said something to me about he had been paying this woman, Lunden, for some time before."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Erielle Davidson",
      "utterance": "Right. So, part of this custody battle also includes some sort of issues surrounding child support, and in order to go forward with those types of claims, you need to give detailed information about your income. In this case, apparently the mother of the child was actually receiving Hunter Biden for an extensive period of time in 2018. Why this matters is because as of late, Hunter Biden has been telling us, “This isn’t my child. This isn’t my child.” Now we’re starting to wonder, at least ask questions like, well, maybe he was paying this woman off to not say anything. We don’t know. We don’t have answers to these questions, but I will say is that these types of personal investigations, as well as the recent court documents related to Baby Doe -- they do make us wonder, okay, is there a lot more going on with Hunter Biden that we just don’t know?"

Now, the next question, Jesse, is how will we uniform the Space Force? I think it would be only appropriate, since it was created during the Trump administration, to have gold trim on the uniform of the Space Force."

They're going to have to fight there for generations and generations.\" And he bombed the hell out of them in about two and a half years. Let's go to a very historic moment. I think it was the first sitting president to ever step foot in North Korea. This was the big handshake with Kim Jong Un. And, you know, the president got a hard time for that, but definitely had cooled the tensions down between the two countries because, you know, the first year and half, a lot of missiles flying out of North Korea."

First, he called Kim Jong un a little rocket man, sort of rattled him, got him in the right posture to then be able to send love letters back and forth. The only relationship maybe more complicated than the Trump-Kim Jong un relationship is the Trump-Erdogan relationship. And I cannot believe it did not make your list of great presidential moments when Trump sent Erdogan, possibly, the greatest letter in all of presidential communications."

We protect Denmark like we protect large portions of the world. So, the concept came up and I said, \"Certainly, I'd be -- strategically, it's interesting.\" And we'd be interested, but we'll talk to them a little bit. It's not number one on the burner. I can tell you that."

      "utterance": "Live from America’s News Headquarters, I’m Jackie Ibanez in New York. The fire department now confirming the identities of the five people killed in that deadly plane crash in Lafayette, Louisiana. The crash happened this morning near Lafayette Regional Airport. Officials say the eight-passenger plane had just taken off en route to a college basketball -- football game, that is, a playoff in Atlanta between LSU and Oklahoma when it went down. One surviving passenger is in critical conditions. Local reports say the twin-engine plane hit a power line as it was attempting an emergency landing back at the airport, but they do not know what caused the onboard emergency. Meanwhile, two people were killed and seven others wounded when, authorities say, the group was ambushed during a filming of a music video. It happened last night near Houston, the sheriff’s office saying they don’t know motive or have any suspects. They’re asking for witnesses to come forward. I’m Jackie Ibanez.

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "And you got some big endorsements in New Hampshire, and your poll numbers really started to rise, and you were really the attack dog for a lot of that primary campaign. Then you dropped out, endorsed Donald Trump. Tell us about the endorsement. You went down to Texas?"
    },

      "speaker": "Chris Christie",
      "utterance": "Yeah. We went to Fort Worth. I flew down there the night he was having a debate in Houston. I met him in Fort Worth, and we did the endorsement. And I remember we kept it so quiet, no leaks, that when we walked into that room that you're showing on the air right now, a reporter saw me walk into the room with Trump and said, \"Oh, my God.\" They were stunned. But here's what I knew, I knew he was going to be the nominee."

      "utterance": "Yes. Before anybody, I endorsed him. He was my friend for 15 years at that point, but also, I had campaigned against him. I knew he was going to be the Republican nominee. And my job, as I saw it, was to endorse him and to go in there and making the best candidate could be because we did not want Hillary Clinton to be president of the United States."
    },

And now we have Donald Trump as president."

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",

There's people in the campaign that say Chris Christie had the opportunity to fly on the jet with the team and go to that debate in Houston, and you decided, that morning maybe, not to go, and people thought that was a little disloyal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Christie",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, listen, that's Steve Bannon who just making stuff up, telling me if either you're on the plane or you're off the team. Typical Steve drama that was completely made up. I made it really clear. I called that morning and said, \"Listen, I'm the only elected official here, and you haven't yet answered these questions. And if I go there, they're going to be all over me to answer these questions. I want you to answer them first.” Same reason I didn't go on Sunday morning shows that Sunday before the debate. And president knew full well I wasn't going. And that night after the debate was over, 10 minutes after it was over, he called me, and he said, \"I won that debate because you. You're the best campaign debate prepper I've ever seen. We still run debate prep for debate number three.\" So, this whole idea that I was off the team -- I was there. And then on election night, I was in his apartment with he and Melania and Barron and the rest of the family watching election returns. So, another Steve Bannon fiction."

When the exit polls came in at 5:30 showing Hillary Clinton is going to win 350 electoral votes, believe me, down the street at Trump Tower, there was a lot of consternation. But when -- but it made it only better when those returns came in and it went our way. And he was one very happy man that night."

And on the transition stuff, two days after the election, as I was writing the book, Steve Bannon called me in and fired me as chairman of the transition. And when -- I knew it wasn't his doing. And I said to him, \"Whose decision was this?\" I thought perhaps was the president elect's, and I wanted to talk to him directly. And he finally said to me, \"No.\" As he referred to him, he said, \"It was the kid,\" referring to Jared Kushner. He said, \"It's the kid. He's been taking an axe to your head ever since I got here with the boss. Ancient bitterness.” And so, you know, this goes back to, as I detail in the book, the time in 2004 when I prosecuted Jared's father."
