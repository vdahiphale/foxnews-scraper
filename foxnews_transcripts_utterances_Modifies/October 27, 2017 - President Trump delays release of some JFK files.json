So Castro enjoyed diving and they were going to put a shell that had bombs in it, but they couldn't find a large enough shell. I want this job to sit around and come up with fantastic ideas. It's incredible. The only this is that -- the problem with this, and I can see why some people are disappointing, it's like when you go to the carnival or a county fair and there's a sideshow they go like, this is a bearded lady and you're really excited as a 10-year-old, and it's a guy in a dress."

So there was a plan going forward, but then he called it off. But Lee Harvey Oswald was such a die-hard believer that he went forward with it, and then they had Jack Ruby kill him to make sure that there was no -- that you couldn't find that connection.

And the Jack Ruby stuff I thought is kind of interesting. The other thing about going to get a confession in the hospital, I thought that was kind of interesting, but then really not able to do that, was like sort of a last-minute press to try to get that nugget to say, OK, we can wrap this up and close it down, and history would've been very different, I think, if they had been able to obtain that. One other thing, Dana, that I found was really interesting was the phone call, there was an intercept of a phone call connecting, like we talk about the Russians, I mean, they're everywhere, between Oswald and then also a death threat against him. Those things were pretty interesting that I thought where like new and kind of like revealing."

When I go back to the Castro stuff, we were doing this too. Like we were planning to off, you know, the head of a country because, you know, we didn't like him. And I look at this stuff and I go, this is really amazing. We must be doing this now or maybe we don't.

And then look at Hoover, the FBI director, making sure the public doesn't think it's a conspiracy because he would, so what? Make sure that there's not World War III?

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Probably. And the thing is -- they have been asked about this before. This story originally broke in January, meaning that there was the dossier and somewhere it was in the Democratic Party. They knew there had been some payments, but it wasn't directly connected to with to the DNC or to the Hillary Clinton campaign. It was some sort of third-party thing. Well, now we know that that actually was basically just money laundered through the law firm. And so, they could have found out if they wanted to. But I think that you're right that she's like -- it's better not to know."

So Kim Strassel, the Wall Street Journal has a column about this today, she's been following it very closely. And I have to take a look at that in particular because you have the bank record issue from Fusion GPS. You have this denial now from different entities who the New York Times is frustrated because they feel like they were lied to when they were asked about it before. And then in addition to all of that, you have campaign disclosure forms and anything over a certain amount, I think like $200, has to be listed. The reason you do it through a third party, like a law firm, which then denies it for several months is because you don't want have to disclose that you're doing something."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

I understand they don't want to have a statement that incriminate them or have any prior inconsistent statements. But it just seems like this was definitely they were trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the media and the American people."

Or maybe it's an apple like the apple in the Garden of Eden, and the DNC took a big, bad bite of that evil apple, because that could be an apple or it could be a banana. I don't know.

So I think that everyone should just take a step back, let us find out a little bit more, meaning the committee should find a little bit more.
