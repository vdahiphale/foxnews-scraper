      "sentences": "All right. I'm Laura Ingraham, this is “The Ingraham Angle” from Washington. Tonight, what a show we have for you, so what's behind Jill Biden's sudden re-emergence after weeks of relative hiding. My “Angle” reveals all. And would Biden be vulnerable with African-Americans versus Trump? Round two between Candace Owens and Cornel West ahead. Plus, Dersh (ph) and Saul Weissenberg are here on the breaking news surrounding potential testimony from Mueller, and why Democrats should be worried about that.  And last night, we were the only show to bring you details of African migrants being dumped into San Antonio, Texas. Tonight, an exclusive follow up on where they could be sent next. But first, age and rage in 2020, that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  All right, let's face it, Joe Biden is a primary candidate on the ropes. Now since May, his RealClearPolitics lead among Democrats has dropped by nearly 10 points. He's also nursing a dwindling lead in the all-important state of Iowa. A Des Moines Register/CNN poll has him down eight points in that state since December.  So, it's no surprise, is it that Biden's camp is scrambling to triage his reputation as his political star dims. And to assuage the Far Left of the party, Biden has flip-flopped on the federal funding of abortion and he's also embraced the Green New Deal. And today, in a series of carefully controlled kind of smallish Iowa events, Biden attempted to take Trump on directly. He's going to be tough guy. But long before he delivered his remarks, Biden leaked his comments to the media, which provoked this reaction from the President.",

I mean they couldn't beat him in 2016, despite spending, what, double the money and having almost the entire media, the entire entertainment establishment, and Wall Street against Trump, and with Hillary. So what does that say about their abilities? Over at The Daily Beast, that's a really moderate very objective group, well their hypocrisy was also on full display yesterday. With Biden in the race, they ran this piece, \"In the news business, it is considered irresponsible to spread baseless potentially damaging rumors about public figures.\"   Really? Well, is Rod Serling standing in the wing somewhere? This is The Daily Beast from March of 2018. \"How close is Donald Trump to a psychiatric breakdown?\" Or how about this from October 2017? \"These 27 top shrinks think Trump might be nuts.\" Well, maybe the rules of the news business have changed since then. The fact is, if it's vibrancy, stamina and vitality, if that's part of this Presidential contest, wow well who's going to win that one? When you have a 76 year old running against a 73 year old, how could there not be considerations of stamina and how vigorous you are, you got a campaign to run and a country to run. I think these are legitimate questions. Back in October, even Biden understood this.",

While he cautiously avoids the media and sticks to a very limited schedule, Trump on the other hand seems to have energy to burn. According to The Washington Examiner, Biden has only held ten public events in five states since jumping into the race. That's less than half the events of his rivals. He missed two big Democratic events in California and Iowa over the weekend. And in fact, Biden's big outing before today's Iowa swing, well, was attending his granddaughter's graduation in DC.   I'm sure that was nice and a fun event, but you're running for President. Meanwhile, in the last week, Donald Trump attended a state dinner with the Queen of England, held working meetings, and held a press conference with Theresa May.  He hosted a dinner for Prince Charles, attended a D-Day commemoration in Portsmouth, England, flew to Ireland where he met with the Irish Prime Minister, flew to Normandy for the D-Day Remembrance, sat for an interview with yours truly, and held a bilateral meeting with French President Macron. And then, he returned to the United States and on Monday, he attended an intel briefing and met - well, this was just fun, the Indy 500 champ. Today, he was off again to Iowa. I'm tired just reading that. All of this demonstrates that Trump is going to be formidable in 2020, and I think Biden knows it.",

His other legislative priorities -- saving the disastrous to Obamacare, of course, and also pushing for government mandated universal health care. Again, does that sound moderate to you? Now, when Ilhan Omar made insensitive remarks about 9/11, Mr. Kim chose not to critique her even though the terror attack was devastating for the state in which he serves. Now, instead he lashed out at President Trump are having a temerity to criticize Congressman Omar on Twitter. On weed, Mr. Kim wants marijuana declassified a schedule one drug and could support full marijuana legalization in the future.

Now since May, his RealClearPolitics lead among Democrats has dropped by nearly 10 points. He's also nursing a dwindling lead in the all-important state of Iowa. A Des Moines Register/CNN poll has him down eight points in that state since December. So, it's no surprise, is it that Biden's camp is scrambling to triage his reputation as his political star dims. And to assuage the Far Left of the party, Biden has flip-flopped on the federal funding of abortion and he's also embraced the Green New Deal. And today, in a series of carefully controlled kind of smallish Iowa events, Biden attempted to take Trump on directly. He's going to be tough guy.

I mean they couldn't beat him in 2016, despite spending, what, double the money and having almost the entire media, the entire entertainment establishment, and Wall Street against Trump, and with Hillary. So what does that say about their abilities? Over at The Daily Beast, that's a really moderate very objective group, well their hypocrisy was also on full display yesterday. With Biden in the race, they ran this piece, \"In the news business, it is considered irresponsible to spread baseless potentially damaging rumors about public figures.\" Really? Well, is Rod Serling standing in the wing somewhere? This is The Daily Beast from March of 2018. \"How close is Donald Trump to a psychiatric breakdown?\" Or how about this from October 2017? \"These 27 top shrinks think Trump might be nuts.\" Well, maybe the rules of the news business have changed since then. The fact is, if it's vibrancy, stamina and vitality, if that's part of this Presidential contest, wow well who's going to win that one? When you have a 76 year old running against a 73 year old, how could there not be considerations of stamina and how vigorous you are, you got a campaign to run and a country to run. I think these are legitimate questions. Back in October, even Biden understood this."

While he cautiously avoids the media and sticks to a very limited schedule, Trump on the other hand seems to have energy to burn. According to The Washington Examiner, Biden has only held ten public events in five states since jumping into the race. That's less than half the events of his rivals. He missed two big Democratic events in California and Iowa over the weekend. And in fact, Biden's big outing before today's Iowa swing, well, was attending his granddaughter's graduation in DC. I'm sure that was nice and a fun event, but you're running for President. Meanwhile, in the last week, Donald Trump attended a state dinner with the Queen of England, held working meetings, and held a press conference with Theresa May. He hosted a dinner for Prince Charles, attended a D-Day commemoration in Portsmouth, England, flew to Ireland where he met with the Irish Prime Minister, flew to Normandy for the D-Day Remembrance, sat for an interview with yours truly, and held a bilateral meeting with French President Macron. And then, he returned to the United States and on Monday, he attended an intel briefing and met - well, this was just fun, the Indy 500 champ. Today, he was off again to Iowa. I'm tired just reading that. All of this demonstrates that Trump is going to be formidable in 2020, and I think Biden knows it."

Well, that doesn't sound so good. Joining me now is Dr. Cornel West, Professor of Philosophy at Harvard, and Candace Owens, conservative commentator and founder of the Blexit movement.

Indeed, even though I wrote the introduction to the Mueller Report, the Mueller Report never should have been written. There's no room under our Constitution for special counsels, special prosecutors, reports. Prosecutors have the right to say only one thing. We have concluded that there's no evidence sufficient to charge the president with Russian collusion or obstruction of justice, period. I'm taking no questions, I'm making no public report. I'm giving my findings to the attorney general. No prosecutor should ever go beyond that. We all agreed with that when Comey went beyond that with Hillary Clinton. I don't understand the difference between the criticism of Comey for saying that Hillary Clinton engaged in extreme carelessness. Everybody criticized that. And then we want to know why Mueller didn't charge the president. It's the same thing. The whole enterprise of special counsel, special prosecutors is inconsistent with the Constitution. I hope we've seen the last of it."

They just said here's -- on March 17th, 1973, President Nixon had a conversation with these two people. Then they listed the tape recordings and the grand jury testimony that the House could look at. Totally different than the Mueller report, which made a number of legal and factual conclusions. That's number one. But number two, more importantly for the people that still believe that firing James Comey could ever be criminal obstruction of justice, the Watergate roadmap, which was all about obstruction of justice, that's what the grand jury indicted people for, never in any way mentions the firing of Archie Cox as obstruction of justice."

There's no legal obligation to provide the public or Congress with any of the information, certainly not information that is protected by grand jury secrecy that involves ongoing investigations. It violates the separation of powers for Congress to try to compel disclosure of information that the executive branch has the right to maintain secrecy over. Not forever, but while there are pending investigations, and until a judge clears the grand jury. What they're actually asking Barr to do is violate the law. And no court is going to compel an attorney general to violate the law."

I would argue they gave up too much information to the executive branch during this process. Sol, close it out."

But for many of them, that is not the final stop. San Antonio's assistant city manager, Dr. Colleen Bridger, revealed this to a local CBS station, quote, \"The plan was 350 of them would travel from San Antonio to Portland,\" as in Portland, Maine. \"When we reached out to Portland, Maine, they said please don't send us anymore. We're already stretched way beyond our capacity.\" Now, why would Portland be beyond their capacity? I want to go back to January of this year when Maine's new Governor Janet Mills gave her inaugural address."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Isn't that nice? In Portland alone, asylum seekers who are primarily from African countries make up 90 percent of the people living in the city run family and overflow shelters. But back to today. When the San Antonio city manager's request to Portland was turned down, the response was jarring. Quote, \"We're working with them,\" the migrants, \"now to identify other cities throughout the United States where they can go and begin their asylum-seeking process.\" Where are these migrants going to be dropped next? That's anyone's guest. But the fact that two cities in two states, thousands of miles apart, are both at capacity should be alarming for all Americans. We reached out to officials in Portland, Maine, and received the following response from a city counselor. \"Portland is proud to be a welcoming city for all Americans and those seeking to become Americans. At the same time, no city of 67,000 people can possibly manage to entire nation's immigrant situation on its own.\" Wow. We are going to continue to follow this story and others like it and bring you updates, since apparently no one else will. Also tonight, “The Ingraham Angle” is exposing poor border leadership like in the state of New Mexico. We don't talk about New Mexico much, but we're going to do this tonight, where their citizens, by the way, deserve a heck of a lot better. Yesterday, led by the Democratic Governor Michelle Grisham, the state of New Mexico and the city of Albuquerque sued the Trump administration over its asylum policies. The state wants to release asylum-seeking migrants into local communities and then claim reimbursement for humanitarian efforts to shelter them. Joining me now is Andrea Moore, secretary of the Republican Party of New Mexico. All right, Andrea, what do you say about the situation in the state?"

I don't think you knew who I was. We were just chatting. And you started telling me the story of New Mexico, which has become a pretty solidly Democrat state. I think the Trump administration thinks that they have a chance to flip that state back to the Republican Party. Given what has happened under Democratic leadership in state just on the issue of immigration, do you think this is possible?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. With the continued failing policies of our governor, our state is primed to be flipped back to red and vote for Trump as well as all of our wonderful conservative Republicans up and down the ticket."

Tonight's expose, Andy Kim of New Jersey's third Congressional district. Now, as a candidate, Mr. Kim stressed his bipartisan bona fides as campaign staple."

      "utterance": "I will always remember the first time I set foot in the White House situation. Politics was checked out the door. The stakes were high, but we listened, and worked together to save lives. That is exactly why I'm running for Congress, to put the lives of New Jersey families before politics. I will work with both parties."

      "utterance": "Now, after a narrow victory, he even said that he wasn't going to vote for Nancy Pelosi a speaker. And at the time, he noted that the country is looking for, quote, \"a new generation of leaders on both sides of the aisle.\" Well, despite that pledge, his first vote in Congress was to support Pelosi's speakership. Well, his reward? His preferred committee assignment on Armed Services. Pelosi's payoff? An avowed moderate voting with her over 95 percent of the time. Now, following that, Kim joined the leftwing caucus in Congress, the Progressive Caucus, a caucus committed to passing, for instance, the Green New Deal. Does that sound moderate to you? His other legislative priorities -- saving the disastrous to Obamacare, of course, and also pushing for government mandated universal health care. Again, does that sound moderate to you? Now, when Ilhan Omar made insensitive remarks about 9/11, Mr. Kim chose not to critique her even though the terror attack was devastating for the state in which he serves. Now, instead he lashed out at President Trump are having a temerity to criticize Congressman Omar on Twitter. On weed, Mr. Kim wants marijuana declassified a schedule one drug and could support full marijuana legalization in the future. On abortion, this so- called moderate refused to sign on to the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Of course, that would have required appropriate medical care to any child who survived a botched abortion. So again, does any of what I described to you, those are all facts, does any of that sound moderate? As voters, it is great to be open to new ideas or even cross party lines to support certain candidates because of the issues and the policies he or she says that they will support. But it is also important to note if a fraud was perpetrated on you and to ask yourself if you want to be moderately fooled again. Up next, a truly hilarious Last Bite."
