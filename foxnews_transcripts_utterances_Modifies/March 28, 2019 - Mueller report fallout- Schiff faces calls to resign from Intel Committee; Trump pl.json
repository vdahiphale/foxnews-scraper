And to have all nine Republicans sign a letter together, including members like Will Hurd and Elise Stefanik unanimously saying you ought to step down from your position. He's not going to step down. But, anyway, that was a show of unity on the Republican side.  I think this is very politically astute for President Trump to get out of Washington, because only in Washington are people talking about Russia and the Mueller investigation. Like out in the country, they want to hear what he has to say, what's he's going to do. And he's going to a place where, when it comes to reelection, he's underwater right now. He's got some work to do to try to shore things up in Michigan.   And, of course, he wants to win it again. Before he was talking about all the other things when he left this afternoon, he was talking about the economy, all the jobs that are coming back. So, if I were those guys, I would try to get the president out of Washington, D.C. as much as possible, and not just to Mar-a-Lago. Go see America. The presidency goes by really fast.

And the rest of the country is looking at them like, are you guys crazy? What the hell are you saying?  Now, Smollett's attorney went out and said -- and she used the white faced defense, very novel.

Some local officials now going to extreme lengths to protect children, in Rockland County, just outside New York City, kids under age 18 are now banned from public places if they have not been vaccinated. This measles outbreak is just one example that's stirring up vaccination controversy.  Just a couple of weeks ago, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin revealed he expose his nine children intentionally to chicken pox instead of vaccinating them.

The dramatic scene about the government deciding to go in and help the child because the parents decided not to take him to the hospital, that obviously conjures up a lot of concern for people who want to be responsible for themselves and for their children and they don't want the government to be involved.  Separately, I do think that anybody who cares about children and -- this is the thing, we all care about children. And the parents who don't vaccinate their children, they're doing so because they care about their children. That's the decision that they're making. So I would say that we have to figure out a way to get better information easily digested to people that -- for example, if you do not get the measles vaccine, you're more likely to have your child die. I mean, it has to be that stark. And also -- for example, one of the questions being -- do vaccines cause autism? The science is now showing that autistic traits are being developed in the womb, way before any child would get vaccinated. What is the science that we can do to help prevent autism? Let's focus there rather than on the vaccines because it does seem like a much bigger problem. And now people can't even go out of their house in Rockland County for 30 days.",

So there's a lot of people that will say, you know what, I support vaccination but I don't want my 2-year-old to get so many -- we need to space these out more because I'm worried about the implication of not only being exposed to some of these viral, but also some of the chemicals that are in -- these are infants. They're very small.  So, I think you have -- there's a lot of gray matter here because you're dealing with parental rights. You're dealing with parents who want to have a say. And you're dealing with a public that also gets concerned that if there are mandates for certain vaccines, will it wind up than being a mandate for the flu shot? I don't get a flu shot. I don't respond well to it. It does not do my body well. I would not want a mandate. I would not want to do that to myself. And I want to maintain the right to not get that flu shot. I choose to eat healthy and exercise and hope that my body will just not get the flu. So, you have to figure out. I don't have the answer to this, but you have to figure out where the line is drawn. What should be mandated. Where there is flexibility and you have to give the parents some say that if they want their infant to say space - they want their vaccine spaced out, that's something where I think there is some common ground that could be found where doctors can say OK you know what instead of getting a bundle of vaccines, let's have this go on over a period of two years so you feel a little bit more secure in the baby's immune system being able to handle it.",

They're the other victims, those audiences because they were fed or sold the journalistic equivalent of swampland. You know, they thought they were getting a condo and they've got swamp land. And now they have PCD which is post-collusion depression. The only cure is to turn the channel and watch Fox News and join the winners.

Like there was never any partisan strike by either side. But in the last -- even going back into the Obama years I think it sort of got that way. And to have all nine Republicans sign a letter together, including members like Will Hurd and Elise Stefanik unanimously saying you ought to step down from your position. He's not going to step down. But, anyway, that was a show of unity on the Republican side. I think this is very politically astute for President Trump to get out of Washington, because only in Washington are people talking about Russia and the Mueller investigation. Like out in the country, they want to hear what he has to say, what's he's going to do. And he's going to a place where, when it comes to reelection, he's underwater right now. He's got some work to do to try to shore things up in Michigan. And, of course, he wants to win it again. Before he was talking about all the other things when he left this afternoon, he was talking about the economy, all the jobs that are coming back. So, if I were those guys, I would try to get the president out of Washington, D.C. as much as possible, and not just to Mar-a-Lago. Go see America. The presidency goes by really fast. America is awesome. And I think that people want to see him."

But I would also not -- I would give it away at some point and also talk about jobs and talk about what all the people across the country are really craving because there were so many people who are watching this go down that initially were like, all right, let's let the investigation play out, let's see what they have. And then at some point we're like, OK, this is a witch hunt. This has gone completely off the rails. So I think he's going to need a little bit of time just to say I told you so."

I don't know how this guy is not embarrassed. Forget about resigning. He should be bowing his head in shame everywhere.

That would be a huge victory if you get it to go to the FBI. And then she says she recused. But she had already made the move. So, to me, that is not -- that's a big problem. And the bigger story I believe is that when she was running for office with one of her noble goals was to try to restore trust between the public and the police because we know in Chicago that that's been a problem.

Six states across the country now dealing with a massive measles outbreak after parents made the choice not to vaccinate their children for the disease. In 2000, everyone thought measles had been eliminated in the USA, but this year alone we've already seen over 300 cases nationwide. Some local officials now going to extreme lengths to protect children, in Rockland County, just outside New York City, kids under age 18 are now banned from public places if they have not been vaccinated. This measles outbreak is just one example that's stirring up vaccination controversy. Just a couple of weeks ago, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin revealed he expose his nine children intentionally to chicken pox instead of vaccinating them. And Arizona police were reportedly called to the home of an unvaccinated toddler who had a temperature of 105 after his parents refused to bring him to the hospital. Here's the dramatic scene caught on tape."

      "utterance": "Well, it's definitely a problem. And it seems -- I don't know whether it's a growing problem or one we are just more aware of because now we have ways of getting information all across the country. It's not just happening in -- we knew about the measles outbreak in Seattle. But in Rockland County here in New York, Arizona, so it's everywhere. The dramatic scene about the government deciding to go in and help the child because the parents decided not to take him to the hospital, that obviously conjures up a lot of concern for people who want to be responsible for themselves and for their children and they don't want the government to be involved. Separately, I do think that anybody who cares about children and -- this is the thing, we all care about children. And the parents who don't vaccinate their children, they're doing so because they care about their children. That's the decision that they're making. So I would say that we have to figure out a way to get better information easily digested to people that -- for example, if you do not get the measles vaccine, you're more likely to have your child die. I mean, it has to be that stark. And also -- for example, one of the questions being -- do vaccines cause autism? The science is now showing that autistic traits are being developed in the womb, way before any child would get vaccinated. What is the science that we can do to help prevent autism? Let's focus there rather than on the vaccines because it does seem like a much bigger problem. And now people can't even go out of their house in Rockland County for 30 days."

      "utterance": "Well, just that is, it doesn't just affect your child. It affects others. This came up in schools a lot when I used to teach. A lot of the issue is that a lot of parents who are anti-vaccine have an issue with the bundling of vaccines and the way their administrative. So there's a lot of people that will say, you know what, I support vaccination but I don't want my 2-year-old to get so many -- we need to space these out more because I'm worried about the implication of not only being exposed to some of these viral, but also some of the chemicals that are in -- these are infants. They're very small. So, I think you have -- there's a lot of gray matter here because you're dealing with parental rights. You're dealing with parents who want to have a say. And you're dealing with a public that also gets concerned that if there are mandates for certain vaccines, will it wind up than being a mandate for the flu shot? I don't get a flu shot. I don't respond well to it. It does not do my body well. I would not want a mandate. I would not want to do that to myself. And I want to maintain the right to not get that flu shot. I choose to eat healthy and exercise and hope that my body will just not get the flu. So, you have to figure out. I don't have the answer to this, but you have to figure out where the line is drawn. What should be mandated. Where there is flexibility and you have to give the parents some say that if they want their infant to say space - they want their vaccine spaced out, that's something where I think there is some common ground that could be found where doctors can say OK you know what instead of getting a bundle of vaccines, let's have this go on over a period of two years so you feel a little bit more secure in the baby's immune system being able to handle it."

Last year, it snowed here in New York on Opening Day. At Yankee Stadium today, it looked like a lot of business folks played hooky since there was a sellout crowd back in D.C. My favorite team, the national stole the spotlight from the cherry blossoms for a time they played the Mets and they lost. My wife and son took my seats as they rooted for the home team. I can't wait to get some of those peanuts and Cracker Jacks, and I keep the faith going that, we're going all the way this year."

Another guy was lifted 10 feet, I don't know this says, 10 feet into the air, stepped on the base but they were able to jump off. They walked away unharmed but that had to be terrifying as far as I can see. I mean I don't know - right away. I would have jumped."
