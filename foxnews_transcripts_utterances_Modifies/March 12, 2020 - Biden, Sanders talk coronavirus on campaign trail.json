Eighty percent of the population is going to recover, especially the young individuals, people who are healthy, 80 percent. You're going to have mild symptoms, maybe a cough, a fever ache. Go home, stay home, and you will recover. We want you home because we don't want you to contaminate anybody. And we can't test you right now because we don't have a lot of kits, so we are going to make you guilty until proven innocent, so stay home. Fifteen percent of the population may have severe respiratory problems like the gentleman you had before. In that case, call your health care provider, call your hospital. They will probably tell you to come to the emergency room, they have set up places for you, and then they will test you. And if indeed you have respiratory problems, that you can't catch your breath, there's oxygen issues, maybe there is pneumonia on the basis of an x-ray, you're going to get admitted, you're going to get hydrated, you're going to get treated with antibiotics, and the vast majority of people will recover if receiving proper treatment. If you look at the mortality rate, for instance, in South Korea, after they tested thousands of people it's about 0.7 percent's. So it's getting to be very close to the normal flu mortality. We don't know that yet in the United States because we haven't tested anybody. If you look at the mortality rate in Italy, 23 percent of the population of Italy is over the age of 65. So you expect people over the age of 65 to have more significant complications and therefore higher mortality. And that's why the numbers are different in some countries, but at the end of the day, if you put the basis of all these numbers around the world, I think, like the president said, this too shall go away, we are going to get a vaccine, and right now we need better screening.",

He is really a calming voice. He'll tell you when things are going well. He'll tell you when things are not going well, and it makes you feel like you can trust him. Clearly people are very concerned about what's happening now. And I think it's good that people are concerned and that they are changing their behavior in a public health crisis that requires changed behavior. What is more concerning, I think, is that a lot of powers that be have not thought through the other issues with public health crises, which is a serious damage to the economy can cause serious damage that I don't think people are thinking through as well as they could.

CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": I don't know what it is about the number 11, but 3/11, March 11th yesterday when the WHO declared the pandemic will probably go down in history as the moment when our society kind of capitulated to this threat. All of a sudden, a lot of people were holding back on certain decisions made them. So we have all the school closings cascading now.

Globally, according to Johns Hopkins University, more than 68,000 people have recovered from the virus 50,000 in China. We'll talk more about that in just a moment.

      "utterance": "Bret, it was one of the worst days in Wall Street history. Stocks plunging, trading halted again for a second time this week and only for the second time since 1997. So there's fear, there's anxiety that the coronavirus spread will disrupt businesses and daily lives that will drive the U.S. economy eventually into a recession. So, travel has been limited and that's hurting the airlines which virtually collapsed today. Playmaker Boeing, seeing its worst today drop in its history. Cruise lines, cratering Carnival, canceling princess cruise itineraries for the next two months. And all of this despite extraordinary steps being taken by the Federal Reserve of New York today. They were stepping in to provide $1-1/2 trillion worth of cash into the bond markets to make sure that the financial system doesn't seize up like it did during the financial crisis. But it is important to keep things in perspective. We haven't seen any big companies like Bear Stearns or Lehman's collapse. And investment advisors that we speak to, say you really need to stay calm in these times."

      "utterance": "Well, the first piece of advice is don't panic. And a typical safety trades are the U.S. Treasuries, gold, and also the U.S. dollar. But he wants to buy stocks. They usually recommend these big companies, what they call blue chips that pay out dividends or money back to investors who hold the stock. But those aren't necessarily the ones that return the most over time. Here's a list of some of the best performers over the past 11 years, and the longest bull market run in history that ended just yesterday. You see tech and consumer names, they make up a lot of the top 10 performers. So, those are some ideas for the brave if they feel they need to pick up some bargains in these uncertain times. Bret?"

      "utterance": "Well, I think what we're seeing right now are a lot of dramatic developments this week in response to the coronavirus, both with our public health and in our economic response. And so, what we need to do is act swiftly to not just concentrate on solutions for Wall Street, but we need to provide relief for working Americans, Americans who are living off of tips, who are getting laid off, who -- whose shifts are being canceled all of a sudden, and we need to make sure that we act very quickly. And that's why I think it's imperative that we pass the bill that's been presented today, which includes paid sick leave, which includes extended unemployment benefits, protections for Medicaid, and also making sure that we're taking action to protect doctors, and nurses, and hospital workers on the front line."

Democrats, you weren't there at the time, but they were supportive of it under President Obama. Doesn't work this time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OCASIO-CORTEZ",
      "utterance": "I think what we need to see is what tools we use for what responses? So, a payroll tax is one thing to be considered when there are certain economic indicator. But right now, we are dealing with is a pandemic. And so, what we need to make sure is that we're taking swift actions right now to protect doctors, to protect people on Medicaid, to make sure that people can see a doctor. And those are the things that we need to be focusing on right now. We can talk about a payroll tax later, you can talk about, you know, debate, all of these sorts of things at another time, but right now is the moment for swift action to make sure we're protecting our elders and our immunocompromised Americans."

      "utterance": "We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world. We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Agree with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OCASIO-CORTEZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I think one thing that we need to do is put politics aside. And that's exactly why Democrats have agreed with President Trump on his goals of paid sick leave and his goals of free coronavirus testing. And so, all of those things have been included in our package. We bumped it up a little bit more. But you know, in -- when you have a Democratic House and a Republican Senate, compromises the name of the game. I think the president is going to have to accept the fact that we're fighting for people who are going to be potentially unemployed. He's going to have to accept the fact that we're going to push on doctor and nurse protections. But also when you look at the best -- you know, the best health care system in the world. That's something that's up for debate. South Korea, we're up to -- South Korea has up to 10,000 tests per day. They've been able to provide test to any single person that wants it. And here people are scrambling, and it almost seems like the more wealthy and powerful you are, the more able you're-- the more able you are to access a test. But the more -- you know, the rougher road you've got here, it's going to be a lot more difficult for you to access healthcare. That's exactly the recipe for disaster in a pandemic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Dr. Fauci testified that there is a failing on the testing up on Capitol Hill. But on the politics front, this is only two weeks ago, you tweeted out, Mike Pence literally does not believe in science. It is utterly irresponsible to put him in charge of U.S. coronavirus response as the world sits on the cusp of a pandemic. This decision could cost people their lives. Pence's past decisions already have.\" Obviously, Vice President Pence is the head of the coronavirus task force, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the CDC, all those other scientists, were also a part of it. Isn't that politics?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OCASIO-CORTEZ",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I disagree with the appointment of Vice President Pence. I have made that extraordinarily clear. But at the end of the day, he's there. So, we need to focus on the actions that need to be happening right now. And the actions that need to be happening is making sure that we're taking care of people who are going to be hurting as a result of this. Again, this is not just -- this is a public health crisis, but it's also an economic crisis. And on the public health front, we have a lot of people who are older and who are immunocompromised in this country. And the coronavirus is has been testified from the CDC director as 10 times more lethal than the flu."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Sure. And then that people point to the H1N1 virus, and it killed a lot of people in the U.S. And there is a wonder whether you know, where the perfect to response is? Whether we go too far or whether we don't go far enough. You're saying we should just not worry about that now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OCASIO-CORTEZ",
      "utterance": "I think we shouldn't worry about it right now. In fact, you know, one thing that I will agree with is that we should not be panicking, but we should be preparing. And if we are at a standstill here in Washington, and we aren't getting these things passed, and we are willing to compromise and negotiate for folks who are going to be unemployed, and for folks who need these helps in hospitals, folks who are on Medicaid, then there are going to be people who will get hurt by this. So, we need to take action right now. We have to depoliticize it. Right now we're hearing that some of the fights and some of the gridlock is because people are trying to put pro-life provisions into this. We can have that debate another time. We understand that we -- that we disagree on some of this --"

But, to your point, I want to ask you a couple questions about the race -- presidential race. Your Bernie Sanders, most prominent surrogate, was it difficult to witness his kind of swift fall from frontrunner status? He's almost a protest candidate now. Your thoughts on that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OCASIO-CORTEZ",

Just today, he laid out a very strong plan and response for the coronavirus for everyday people, for Main Street, not just Wall Street. He's talking about how do we make sure that everyone who needs access to Medicare can get it? And that, that Medicare is improved and expanded. How do we make sure that people aren't getting booted out of their homes, whether it's not being able to afford their mortgage payment this month, or not being able to afford their rent payment?"

I think that Democrats can look in our own backyard and say, there are places where we can do better too. And I think that if you are taking big money, and if you are relying on lobbyist funds, and you aren't answering to your constituents back home, you should be held accountable.

Where Iranian-backed Shia militias have both warehouses, as well as, this is an effort to basically disrupt their command and control. But it will be multiple locations we understand, it will be -- we're told a proportional response to the attack on the Taji base. Here is what the defense secretary said earlier today."

      "utterance": "Right. So looking at the numbers, we already have about three or four weeks of a lot of data that has come in from China, South Korea, you name it. Eighty percent of the population is going to recover, especially the young individuals, people who are healthy, 80 percent. You're going to have mild symptoms, maybe a cough, a fever ache. Go home, stay home, and you will recover. We want you home because we don't want you to contaminate anybody. And we can't test you right now because we don't have a lot of kits, so we are going to make you guilty until proven innocent, so stay home. Fifteen percent of the population may have severe respiratory problems like the gentleman you had before. In that case, call your health care provider, call your hospital. They will probably tell you to come to the emergency room, they have set up places for you, and then they will test you. And if indeed you have respiratory problems, that you can't catch your breath, there's oxygen issues, maybe there is pneumonia on the basis of an x-ray, you're going to get admitted, you're going to get hydrated, you're going to get treated with antibiotics, and the vast majority of people will recover if receiving proper treatment. If you look at the mortality rate, for instance, in South Korea, after they tested thousands of people it's about 0.7 percent's. So it's getting to be very close to the normal flu mortality. We don't know that yet in the United States because we haven't tested anybody. If you look at the mortality rate in Italy, 23 percent of the population of Italy is over the age of 65. So you expect people over the age of 65 to have more significant complications and therefore higher mortality. And that's why the numbers are different in some countries, but at the end of the day, if you put the basis of all these numbers around the world, I think, like the president said, this too shall go away, we are going to get a vaccine, and right now we need better screening."

But be that as it may, we don't need patients to go to the emergency room right now and overwhelm the health system. That's what we are telling folks. You can work from home, if you are concerned, and a lot of companies are doing that. If you have cold like symptoms, stay home. No big deal. You can take Tylenol. You can drink liquids. You can have your mom's chicken soup and rest there for at least 14 days so you don't contaminate because right now we are going to assume that you may be infectious. And that's what we want. We don't want folks to be running to the emergency room be tested because, a, we don't have that many kits right now and we need to utilize them for people who we do indeed suspect that have the disease. And we have to be careful with overrunning the beds and admissions and things like that. So we have to get organized. We don't have to panic."

You're going to get it by getting saliva, touching, liquids, that sort of thing, in your hands from one body to the next, maybe surfaces for a couple of hours or maybe a little bit more. I don't know if that three-hour idea that if you, let's say, are an empty room you cough, the virus is going to be embedded here for three hours and then somebody can come in and get infected. I think that is just one study. But the premise is, direct contact from an infected individual, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and that is why the separation, that sequestration, that quarantine becomes socially important."

Let's bring in our panel, Josh Holmes, former top adviser to Mitch McConnell, now president of Cavalry Consultants, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" A lot has changed over the past couple of days in how the country has reacted, how this place, Washington, D.C., has reacted. Thoughts about this evolution that we have seen? MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": First off, I just want to say I love watching Anthony Fauci testify. He is really a calming voice. He'll tell you when things are going well. He'll tell you when things are not going well, and it makes you feel like you can trust him. Clearly people are very concerned about what's happening now. And I think it's good that people are concerned and that they are changing their behavior in a public health crisis that requires changed behavior. What is more concerning, I think, is that a lot of powers that be have not thought through the other issues with public health crises, which is a serious damage to the economy can cause serious damage that I don't think people are thinking through as well as they could. It would be nice to see people be concerned about public health while also being concerned about not inducing people toward panic that can really hurt people who are in jobs that rely on, in the service economy, waiters, retail workers, these types of people who through no fault of their own might be facing some serious economic hardships."

CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": I don't know what it is about the number 11, but 3/11, March 11th yesterday when the WHO declared the pandemic will probably go down in history as the moment when our society kind of capitulated to this threat. All of a sudden, a lot of people were holding back on certain decisions made them. So we have all the school closings cascading now. We have the president go into the Oval Office and give the speech that he had not given. Congress this morning decides, you know what, maybe we won't go on recess. And the reason for that is that they have judged, I think at the advice of people like Mr. Fauci, that the downside risk here is substantially greater than it was with H1N1.
