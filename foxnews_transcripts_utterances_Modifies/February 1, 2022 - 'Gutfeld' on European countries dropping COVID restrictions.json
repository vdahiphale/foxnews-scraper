I've been on this planet for maybe 50 years after immigrating from California. And I've never seen anything like this. I know crime victims. And I'm not just talking about people who bought Kilmeade's last book. We've covered the stats and the stories until we were blue in the face. So how can anyone deny them?

Imagine doing that with victims of police brutality or COVID. Apparently, it's OK to mock crime victims because those victims don't rate, they aren't romanticized. So what alternative university you live in? Sadly, the dangerous one that people like Psaki's boss helped create but don't see. It's a place where women are pushed to their deaths teens are murdered. Businesses are ransacked until they close and elderly Asians are beaten unconscious. The media spent a year telling us how people that walk through the Capitol are worse than 9/11 while completely ignoring all of that. What an unlucky universe crime victims live in. Because unlike the media, they don't have armed security around the clock. They don't have personal chauffeurs safely taking them to and from work, or an assistant who can run to the store and get them suppositories. Thanks, Gabby. And yet, the media claimed to be in danger on January 6. But no, their universe is secure. They only get scared when they forget the sunscreen at the Hamptons. So what happens when you see bad things with your very own eyes? And you pointed out and people like Psaki laugh at you like they just swallowed an ounce of magic mushrooms. And the media safe behind their security and anonymity laugh along like school kids who just heard a knock- knock joke. I guess pretending a massive increase in murders is no big deal is literally the best they can do. And if bad things don't affect them, then they didn't happen at all. But it's a cover up in plain sight. So we don't notice what cause the crime wave which is them. together the media's disregard for rising crime and the progressive embrace of policies that rewarded the criminal created the crime wave. And now they're covering it up. Now they need to change that narrative. They need to apply the radical politics. Almost like Instagram filter. Sure, this brutal murder of a young girl looks bad, but factor in that cash bail discriminates against the poor and there's prison overcrowding, which is cruel. And there's COVID in jail. And isn't the suspect really the victim? Did you know he has dyslexia? He's addicted to meth and has gender dysphoria? He thinks he's a woodland nymph. Frankly, isn't the criminal society itself? Yes, society is the culprit. It's the new way to blame the victim. It's a trick these hacks used to sleep well at night. Also heavily medicated so they can't hear the screams.",

That follows neighboring Denmark, the home of cheese, who'd scrapped the restriction starting today. England lifted the last of their restrictions and Ireland also dropped. There's days before that. Hopefully Europe will inspire us, although I'm not sure it's worth the soccer. But it sounds like Americans are ready to follow suit. A new poll finds that 70 percent of Americans agree with the statement. It's time we accept that COVID is here to stay, and we just need to get on with our lives. Finally, we're more sick of mandates than COVID. And here's the shocker that St. Paul found a partisan to side between who thinks it's time to move on. 89 percent of Republicans versus 47 percent of Dems. And 98 percent agreed we should still keep a mask over Nancy Pelosi face. Either way, February 1st, ah, looks damn good. It's almost over because the dominoes are already following and like a lesbian coming out of the closet. We're all saying no more mandates. It's all that joke come in like a Frisbee in the desert. Colorado dropped its vaccine requirements for large indoor gatherings over 500 people. And you should only wear a mask if your bong hits are extra dank.

I've been on this planet for maybe 50 years after immigrating from California. And I've never seen anything like this. I know crime victims.

Imagine doing that with victims of police brutality or COVID. Apparently, it's OK to mock crime victims because those victims don't rate, they aren't romanticized. So what alternative university you live in? Sadly, the dangerous one that people like Psaki's boss helped create but don't see. It's a place where women are pushed to their deaths teens are murdered. Businesses are ransacked until they close and elderly Asians are beaten unconscious. The media spent a year telling us how people that walk through the Capitol are worse than 9/11 while completely ignoring all of that. What an unlucky universe crime victims live in. Because unlike the media, they don't have armed security around the clock. They don't have personal chauffeurs safely taking them to and from work, or an assistant who can run to the store and get them suppositories. Thanks, Gabby. And yet, the media claimed to be in danger on January 6. But no, their universe is secure. They only get scared when they forget the sunscreen at the Hamptons. So what happens when you see bad things with your very own eyes? And you pointed out and people like Psaki laugh at you like they just swallowed an ounce of magic mushrooms. And the media safe behind their security and anonymity laugh along like school kids who just heard a knock- knock joke. I guess pretending a massive increase in murders is no big deal is literally the best they can do. And if bad things don't affect them, then they didn't happen at all. But it's a cover up in plain sight. So we don't notice what cause the crime wave which is them. together the media's disregard for rising crime and the progressive embrace of policies that rewarded the criminal created the crime wave. And now they're covering it up. Now they need to change that narrative. They need to apply the radical politics. Almost like Instagram filter. Sure, this brutal murder of a young girl looks bad, but factor in that cash bail discriminates against the poor and there's prison overcrowding, which is cruel. And there's COVID in jail. And isn't the suspect really the victim? Did you know he has dyslexia? He's addicted to meth and has gender dysphoria? He thinks he's a woodland nymph. Frankly, isn't the criminal society itself? Yes, society is the culprit. It's the new way to blame the victim. It's a trick these hacks used to sleep well at night. Also heavily medicated so they can't hear the screams."

Why they still vote for the people that they vote for when you have this horror, and the sons are being killed. And they remember when that cut -- the two cops got killed. What was that? That was a mother being beaten up by a junkie ex-con on probation with a Glock with a -- with an extended magazine.

Hopefully Europe will inspire us, although I'm not sure it's worth the soccer. But it sounds like Americans are ready to follow suit. A new poll finds that 70 percent of Americans agree with the statement. It's time we accept that COVID is here to stay, and we just need to get on with our lives. Finally, we're more sick of mandates than COVID. And here's the shocker that St. Paul found a partisan to side between who thinks it's time to move on. 89 percent of Republicans versus 47 percent of Dems.

Apparently, the videos will have you sweating like the crew of an Alec Baldwin movie. Taking a page from only fans, a site dedicated to raising heart rates among other things. I know, terrible. These 30 minute workout classes will cost you 15 bucks a month just to watch scantily clad beautiful women sweating on an exercise bike. I'm intrigued."

Clever devil. His comments were unexpected because he wasn't punching anyone. Saying in an earlier interview, I don't think that to be fair to women, we should become them, which makes sense. So, like my Aunt Henrietta used to say, put on the petticoats or you're going to lose another fingernail.
