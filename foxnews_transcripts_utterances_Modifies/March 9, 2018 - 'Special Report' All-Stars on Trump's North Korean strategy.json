But look, I don't think there is anything to lose if the president meets with Kim Jong-un as soon as possible, and when they do meet, about 72 after they get the inspectors in, because if Kim is serious he will be amenable to that, and then we can have a two week period of snap inspections like we don't see in Iran. And the worst case in that sense, though, is you have perhaps spent three or four weeks doing something unusual, but you have not wasted months. And wasting months would mean their development towards that ballistic missiles. We want to do something before then. If this works, great. If it doesn't we have not lost that much time.",

And talking about halting tests while they complete the development of their arsenal, this provides them more time. These are promises they have never, ever kept.   Why when you would be getting so close to completing your mission that you have put as a priority above all else that you've starved your people for, why would you just fold now?
