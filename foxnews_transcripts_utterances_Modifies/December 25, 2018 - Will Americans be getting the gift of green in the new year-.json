This is a special edition of \"Your World.\"  And what a world it has been, certainly for your money this year. The economy humming along, that's good. And you got companies adding two million jobs this year. Pretty impressive. Workers seeing more money in their paychecks, as wages are rising, but the stock market, well, not quite as great.  You have got a lot of uncertainty right now over trade. You have got a lot of uncertainty regarding the Fed and those rate hikes. You have got the Mueller probe. And you have got, of course, the promise of Democratic investigations, all taking their toll on the markets. So with these crosscurrents out there, what can you really expect for your money in 2019? We're asking our money pros.  We have Lee Munson, Danielle Shay, and Scott Martin. Scott, starting with you.  Is it going to be a good year for the markets?",

And here's the good news I would like to run down, by the way, because I would add too, Trish, economic data has suddenly gotten weaker in the face of, say, this market volatility too, which is a concern, as we have seen rates come down. So, to me Trish, yes, it's going to be a better year in '19 and a less volatile one, but probably not for a couple months, as the market kind of sorts out where it wants to be valued. So, as an individual investor, you need to take these dips as reasons to buy to hold for the long term.",

But, last Wednesday, after that Fed meeting, I got my Christmas gift early, which we're seeing 2500 on the S&P 500. So we're doing buying for clients. So I agree. You have got to take these dips to buy. It is going to take such an act of God to have earnings go down 20 percent to really get into an earnings recession to make this market go even lower. So I think the bottom line is, even if we have flat earnings growth, that's OK. Even if we have 4 or 5 percent, that's OK, because the market can still rise on that.  That's why we, think as of right now, on Christmas Day, I think you have got 10 percent upside and a little less than 10 percent upside -- or downside. So I think it's even odds. I think you go in here. Again, recessions are always going to happen, but it's really going to take a lot to get us there by next year.",

It's how you make more profits at the late stage of a bull market.  So, I like that people are positive about the world.

And, listen, I guess I'm sitting here disappointed, because Lee mentioned earlier he got this early Christmas gift, which, obviously, I guess wasn't mine. Sorry about that, Lee, that I sent you. I did put that on a credit card, by the way, because he's right. I mean, credit is extended to consumers, to businesses for a reason. And with rates down, as they are, Trish, as we have seen over the last couple months, which is kind of curious -- if things are OK economically, why the 10-year note, say, has fallen from 3.75 to 2-and-change, you know, 2.7, 2.8, because that to me tells me something is weakening somewhere in the economy.

They don't have to take hard votes in Congress. They can go out there and really start to campaign right away. So I think that's where you will see a lot of divisions arise within the Democratic primary, the folks who actually have to do their job and show up in Washington and take the hard votes, and then the guys who really can go out there and try and set the agenda through rhetoric and through campaign events, and that's going to be a hard challenge.",

But then, we you think about the field, remember when Marco Rubio tried to hurl some insults at him? It just didn't -- it didn't sit right. They weren't able to do it with the same panache, maybe because it wasn't natural. And so to be a natural politician, you really kind of have to be yourself. You have to be authentic.

Personal finance guru Larry Winget, who's the author of \"You're Broke Because You Want to Be,\" joins me now. Larry, what's your advice to people this holiday season, as they confront these growing credit card debts? LARRY WINGET, AUTHOR, \"YOU'RE BROKE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE\": Well, listen, when you get that bill, realize that you lost control of your self-control, and now you need to get back in control by paying this debt off quickly. Give yourself 60 days to do that. And that means you're going to have to cinch your belt and kind of suck it up in other areas of your regular life in order to do that. But the nice thing is, if you pay it off in 60 days, you will be used to that. And then you can continue and pay off all that other credit card debt that you probably have. And that will give you the highest return on your money you're ever going to find, because you're not getting 17 percent on it any place else.",

      "utterance": "Forget about presents under the tree. Will Americans be getting the gift of green in the New Year? Hello, everyone. I'm Trish Regan, in for Neil Cavuto. Merry Christmas. This is a special edition of \"Your World.\" And what a world it has been, certainly for your money this year. The economy humming along, that's good. And you got companies adding two million jobs this year. Pretty impressive. Workers seeing more money in their paychecks, as wages are rising, but the stock market, well, not quite as great. You have got a lot of uncertainty right now over trade. You have got a lot of uncertainty regarding the Fed and those rate hikes. You have got the Mueller probe. And you have got, of course, the promise of Democratic investigations, all taking their toll on the markets. So with these crosscurrents out there, what can you really expect for your money in 2019? We're asking our money pros. We have Lee Munson, Danielle Shay, and Scott Martin. Scott, starting with you. Is it going to be a good year for the markets?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT",
      "utterance": "I hope so. I hope so. And here's the good news I would like to run down, by the way, because I would add too, Trish, economic data has suddenly gotten weaker in the face of, say, this market volatility too, which is a concern, as we have seen rates come down. So, to me Trish, yes, it's going to be a better year in '19 and a less volatile one, but probably not for a couple months, as the market kind of sorts out where it wants to be valued. So, as an individual investor, you need to take these dips as reasons to buy to hold for the long term."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "I like that optimistic outlook. Lee, your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS",
      "utterance": "Oh. Well, the only thing I disagree with on, which really doesn't matter, is the volatility. I think it's going to persist throughout the whole year. But, last Wednesday, after that Fed meeting, I got my Christmas gift early, which we're seeing 2500 on the S&P 500. So we're doing buying for clients. So I agree. You have got to take these dips to buy. It is going to take such an act of God to have earnings go down 20 percent to really get into an earnings recession to make this market go even lower. So I think the bottom line is, even if we have flat earnings growth, that's OK. Even if we have 4 or 5 percent, that's OK, because the market can still rise on that. That's why we, think as of right now, on Christmas Day, I think you have got 10 percent upside and a little less than 10 percent upside -- or downside. So I think it's even odds. I think you go in here. Again, recessions are always going to happen, but it's really going to take a lot to get us there by next year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "I hear you on that. Danielle, curious to get your thoughts, because I look at the economic landscape right now, and it feels pretty good. And I know the markets are rocky, but you have got the wage growth that I was just talking about. You have got GDP growth. You have got jobs being added. In other words, the fundamentals, for now anyway, and certainly for a change, compared to the last decade, they feel good."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANIELLE SHAY, SIMPLER TRADING",
      "utterance": "Yes, and there are a lot of fundamentals that feel good. But, at the same time, there are a lot of problems. The political instability is a huge one. Trade wars has taken our industrial stocks and our transportation stocks for a huge dive. It is going to be incredibly difficult for this market to recover if the transportation stocks, if the industrials and if the financial stocks cannot get it together. There's just really not going to be anything to pull the market higher."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Right. But do you think that a recession is actually in the works? Because I hear a lot of talk. And, in fact, I see -- I see these -- these Democratic strategists out there almost gleeful when they talk about it, this idea of recession being on the horizon. I don't see it yet in the fundamentals. And I tend to run a little scared on these things. Is there anything that indicates to you, Danielle, we need to be worried about recession in 2019?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAY",
      "utterance": "Well, the main thing that I'm concerned about is a high level consumer debt, high level of margin debt. I mean, I'm seeing reports all over the place that people are buying Christmas presents on credit cards. We have a generation that has a really high level of student debt as well."

      "utterance": "And so..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "By the way, the student debt is awful. But, Lee, Was that you saying, oh, gosh, because, you know, by the way, sometimes, you would consider that a healthy sign, right, because people are out there spending. They're not holding on to every penny. They're willing to go into credit card debt. And I'm not saying it's ever a good thing, but it does show, symptomatically, how people are feeling about the future. And it shows a little bit of confidence, which, let's face it, we need, Lee."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUNSON",
      "utterance": "Every recession starts with a lack of consumer spending and a housing crisis and all these things that make people spend less. We don't have any anecdotal evidence to suggest that's not. Debt is bad. Debt is bad. This is not \"The Dave Ramsey Show,\" people. Debt is good. It's how you leverage. It's how you make more profits at the late stage of a bull market. So, I like that people are positive about the world. And I think that when you see what's happening over the last six to eight weeks in markets, this is about investors being moody and investors being disappointed that we're not going to see 20 percent earnings growth next year. And you can see those value -- those industrials, all those cheap stocks that got beat up, in a matter of months, you can see that stuff roar back. Beware."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Scott, investors are moody. But let's not forget, there's also a lot of machines, right, and algorithms doing the trading, and when you hit certain levels, a lot of those algorithms kick in. So it's investors, but isn't it also the sort of nature of trading these days, where you get a little more volatility?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARTIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, sadly. I mean, Fed day last week was certainly an example on that. I mean, that was a really steep slide, or the fastest I have seen this year, with all the volatility that the machines were hitting around the ping-pong ball with. And, listen, I guess I'm sitting here disappointed, because Lee mentioned earlier he got this early Christmas gift, which, obviously, I guess wasn't mine. Sorry about that, Lee, that I sent you. I did put that on a credit card, by the way, because he's right. I mean, credit is extended to consumers, to businesses for a reason. And with rates down, as they are, Trish, as we have seen over the last couple months, which is kind of curious -- if things are OK economically, why the 10-year note, say, has fallen from 3.75 to 2-and-change, you know, 2.7, 2.8, because that to me tells me something is weakening somewhere in the economy. So, as credit is getting extended, that's great, but some of these businesses and consumers could be getting overleveraged."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "All right, we're watching it all. Thank you so much. Good to see you. Before we see, everyone, the ball dropping on this year, we're hearing a lot of name-dropping, shall we say, by presidential hopefuls in two years. Who's got the best shot, if anyone? Some answers that may surprise you next."

      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "We haven't even said goodbye to 2018 yet, but already several Democrats are out there indicating that they may actually run for president in 2020. You got a whole lot of potential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. They're reportedly spending the holiday discussing their next moves with family and friends. So, who actually has the best shot to take on President Trump? We're asking National Taxpayers Union senior fellow Mattie Duppler, \"Catalina\" magazine publisher Cathy Areu, and Washington Examiner's Phil Wegmann. Good to see you all. Who's your money on, Cathy?"

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "So, in this case, he would be running in the Democratic field. The president himself, though, told me, Cathy, he doesn't think -- President Trump, that is -- that Mike Bloomberg would be able to make it through the field, because the party has gotten so aggressively left. Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "The party's a little bit everywhere. So no one's quite sure where they are. But the party is energized. That's -- we do know that they're energized. We learned that with the midterms. So, with the energy comes a little bit of this and a little bit of that, and you don't know what's going to appeal to these voters. So, Bloomberg has a great shot, because Republicans like him. The Democrats like him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "He's a little more, though, down the middle. And when you have got a party that is fascinated by the likes, Mattie, of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and was so smitten with Bernie Sanders, how does someone who's more down the middle actually play in that Field?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATTIE DUPPLER, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I think that that is a very good question. Democrats have a really big challenge ahead of them. And that is that a lot of the Democrats who are running for president actually have to govern. These are United States senators. And they actually have to keep the government open. They have to focus on the priorities in Washington, D.C. Now, people like a Michael Bloomberg, or even a Beto O'Rourke now, who's become sort of the darling of the left, are a little bit liberated. They don't have to take hard votes in Congress. They can go out there and really start to campaign right away. So I think that's where you will see a lot of divisions arise within the Democratic primary, the folks who actually have to do their job and show up in Washington and take the hard votes, and then the guys who really can go out there and try and set the agenda through rhetoric and through campaign events, and that's going to be a hard challenge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Phil, you think back on Joe Biden. And he kind of missed that moment, if you would, because he had that everyday kind of speak, right, that was very appealing to, I think, everyday Americans in a way that, frankly, Hillary Clinton just couldn't possibly do. So Joe Biden's also looking at this. Do you foresee Joe Biden on the on the -- at the top of the Democratic ticket?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILIP WEGMANN, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think that Joe Biden is going to make the same mistake that he made in 2016. I think that he definitely is looking closer at jumping back into the race. But I think the better question right now is, who isn't looking to jump into the race right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEGMANN",
      "utterance": "Because, if you're a Democratic governor, or congressman, or even mayor or dogcatcher, you have got to be looking around right now and asking yourself, why not? Why not run for president? Everyone is doing it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEGMANN",
      "utterance": "And I think the reason why is that what we saw in 2016 is, you had Hillary Clinton, who was an eminently qualified candidate, win the nomination, and then lose to Donald Trump, who didn't have a lot of the qualifications that we used to think were required for the presidency. In 2016, the elites lost. And now I think the playing field is open for everyone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, you know, 2016 was a unique moment in time. And I think that President Trump is a unique kind of candidate. I don't know as that kind of personality would play again or for others. I mean, it works for him, and it worked brilliantly for him. But then, we you think about the field, remember when Marco Rubio tried to hurl some insults at him? It just didn't -- it didn't sit right. They weren't able to do it with the same panache, maybe because it wasn't natural. And so to be a natural politician, you really kind of have to be yourself. You have to be authentic. And so, when you look at that field -- let me go back to you, Cathy. I know that you like Mike Bloomberg, but who are the examples of the most authentic politicians?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",

      "utterance": "Absolutely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AREU",
      "utterance": "So, the Cory Booker is almost the answer to the Donald Trump. So he is so controversial. He is out there. He is so loud. He could really get this energized base more energized. So, I don't know. Cory Booker is kind of like a Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUPPLER",
      "utterance": "I will tell you who I worry about, as a Republican, Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota. I find her to be very, very reasonable, very persuasive. I think that she could really give Republicans -- really start to inoculate some Republican criticisms of the Democratic ticket, if she were to jump in the race. I really think that she might be a strong point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "You have also got Kamala Harris out there who's looking at throwing her hat in the ring. She's been pretty divisive, I would argue. And I think she has been someone who really has tried to make this push towards identity politics. Does identity politics even work anymore, I mean, given, Phil, that it certainly didn't fly with Hillary Clinton?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEGMANN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what we're going to see with Kamala Harris is, she's going to have to come to account with her record as an attorney general in California, and see whether or not that actually plays well with the liberal base going forward. But something that I think is really important to remember here, while we're throwing out all of these names -- and, after the holidays, we will have a better idea of who's in and who's out. But this is an incredibly crowded field. And because it's so crowded, whoever wins the nomination, they don't need a majority. They only need a plurality. That gives -- that can -- it gives voters more choice, absolutely. But it means that we're not going to necessarily have a consensus candidate at the end of the day. And I think that clears the lane maybe for some of these elder statesmen, like Biden, or some of the senators, like Booker, who have been making a name for themselves, because they don't need a majority. They only need a plurality. And they need to be able to hold on to the end."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "I will tell you one thing. It'll certainly be interesting. And, hey, we don't even know, right, because you think about Donald Trump at this stage in the game really wasn't out there in any kind of serious way. And now here he is the president the United States today. So, look, it's anyone's guess. That field could get even bigger."

And it's going to continue into the new year. And guess what? I think it's partly a present from President Trump. He got on OPEC to produce more oil, get those gasoline prices down.

I think the market is actually overreacting to the downside on fear. And I do not see the slowdown. In fact, there's a disconnect between the drop in price and what we're seeing an actual demand. Demand in the United States for oil, gasoline and diesel fuel is at the highest it's ever been. So I agree with you. I don't want to be a Scrooge.

U.S. forces celebrating Christmas in Afghanistan were joined by Joint Chiefs Chairman General Joe Dunford, who said their mission remains unchanged. The president has ordered the Pentagon to start planning to withdraw our 7,000 troops in Afghanistan. And an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala has died in government custody after crossing the border illegally. He had been evaluated in a hospital and given antibiotics and a painkiller after showing signs of cold and a fever.

Well, you know, after you rip open all those presents today, the next thing you're going to have to rip open is the credit card bill. According to a recent survey from personal finance Web site NerdWallet, 28 percent of shoppers are still paying off their holiday credit card debt from last year. Personal finance guru Larry Winget, who's the author of \"You're Broke Because You Want to Be,\" joins me now. Larry, what's your advice to people this holiday season, as they confront these growing credit card debts? LARRY WINGET, AUTHOR, \"YOU'RE BROKE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE\": Well, listen, when you get that bill, realize that you lost control of your self-control, and now you need to get back in control by paying this debt off quickly. Give yourself 60 days to do that. And that means you're going to have to cinch your belt and kind of suck it up in other areas of your regular life in order to do that. But the nice thing is, if you pay it off in 60 days, you will be used to that. And then you can continue and pay off all that other credit card debt that you probably have. And that will give you the highest return on your money you're ever going to find, because you're not getting 17 percent on it any place else."

When it's easy to buy, and we're buying out of ego or out of guilt or out of trying to keep up with other folks, then we overbuy, which means we overspend. And that's where we really have to have some control and check our core values on what our true priorities are. Listen, nobody's ever been sad that they had no debt and a lot of money in savings. So, try that for a while."

What's really important to you should be your commitments. Your commitments are your bills and your family. So put them at the very top of your list.

So, dump the resolutions and make a commitment. We think differently when we use the word commitment. So, make the commitment to pay off your debt. Make the commitment to keep your spending under control. Make a commitment to save more money. That makes more sense than just saying that I make a resolution.

We know we can go to the shop, eventually return it, we can return it without a bill. Wal- Mart's really great at doing that. You can use this stuff and just return it.
