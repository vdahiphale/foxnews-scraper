K0URTZ: Justin Fairfax looked like he was at the verge of becoming governor and then these accusations come out. There were all of these anchors and commentators including liberal commentators demanding that Ralph Northam resign over his admitted use of black face, impersonating Michael Jackson. There is dispute about whether or not it was him in the yearbook photo, another racist photo.  We learned that the state attorney general, Mark Herring, second in line to the governorship, also admitted doing black face back in 1980.

And yet many news organizations including The New York Times and the broadcast networks initially ignored that part of the story as if it didn't happen and just focused on Bezos's divorce. But now, Bezos is accusing the Enquirer of extortion. President Trump's close friend, David Pecker who owns the tabloid, was granted immunity by prosecutors after admitting being involved in hush money payments to women who accused Trump of extramarital affairs. Federal prosecutors are now reviewing Bezos's allegations against AMI. In a piece on the blog news site medium, Bezos says that because of The Washington Post coverage, the president considers him an enemy. He has called him Jeff Bozo. Parent company, American Media Inc., denies pursuing the story because of outside political forces. Bezos now says the company executives warned him or threatened him. \"They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn't stop our investigation.\" Bezos made public a letter from Dylan Howard, AMI's top news executive, listing photos it has of the Amazon chief. These include a below the belt selfie, a naked selfie in the bathroom with only a white towel, and sexy shots of Lauren Sanchez.  Bezos says he was told the Enquirer would run these pictures unless he falsely told the press that he has no basis for suggesting the affair story was politically-motivated. Bezos says, \"If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can? Of course, I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\" AMI says the company fervently believes it acted lawfully in handling the story but that it is more decided that it should properly and thoroughly investigated the claims made by Bezos. Now, whether or not David Pecker was doing this to please Donald Trump, that kind of threatening letter from a newspaper is extremely troubling. Bezos, a man who almost never talks to the press, could wind up doing further damage to what remains of the National Enquirer's reputation. Next on \"Media Buzz,\" I've got some new reporting on this whole mess and the behind the scenes sniping among people close to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez.

      "sentences": "As Jeff Bezos takes on the National Enquirer with the story on his affair with television personality Lauren Sanchez, a deep and sometimes bitter divide has emerged among some of those defending the couple. Michael Sanchez, Lauren's brother, and he says are on and off manager, spoke to me about his strong objections to the strategy which has been overseen by Gavin de Becker, the Amazon founder's longtime security consultant. Sanchez who knew about the affair praises Bezos. He says, \"a brilliant man who doesn't bow down to bullies of the time.\" Unfortunately, Gavin de Becker, a very powerful bully, currently wheels a strange puppet master control over Jeff. Sanchez told me that while he was negotiating with Enquirer parent American Media Inc. owned by the president's pal David Parker to soften the story on the extramarital affair, de Becker, quote, \"launch World War III against the AMI,\" in part, by advising Bezos to preempt the scoop with what Sanchez called a misleading tweet about his divorce from his wife Mackenzie. Everything Gavin has gotten Jeff to do has only amplified the magnitude of the scandal, Sanchez told me. He said it's a disgrace that filthy rich and Uber powerful men are using the media to take shots at each other. The simple truth, Jeff and Lauren fell madly in love risk everything for each other. Now Sanchez is also been on the receiving end. De Becker has told the Washington Post, which of course Bezos owns, and the Daily Beast that he is looking into the leak to the Enquirer and has spoken to Sanchez as part of that investigation. De Becker is traveling overseas and declined to comment, but believes that as the man looking into these matters, he has to take an aggressive posture. And then those being investigated sometimes deflect attention by criticizing the investigators. Sanchez who is a registered Democrat, and Trump's supporter has denied being the source of the leak. He told me it's irrelevant, that he's an acquaintance of Roger Stone, a Republican operative who has not pleaded not guilty to witness tampering and lying to Congress in the Mueller investigation and that he wants to do small business deal with Carter Page.  Former Trump campaign advisors who has come under scrutiny in the special counsel's probe has consulted Page about the leak. Sanchez is friends as well with top executive Dylan Howard quote, \"my friendships are being used as a weapon against me, but the dots don't connect.\" Sanchez has urged Bezos and his sister to order De Becker to stand down this matter. He argues, for instance, that de Becker risk exposure of the affair by allowing the high-profile Bezos and his sister to appear together at restaurants, on private jets and at the launch for Bezos' Blue Origin aerospace company. De Becker who has decades of experience in protecting big celebrities maintains there were no lapses in security, that photographers were tipped off about the couples' outings and it's not his job to prevent them from being photographed. Meanwhile, Sanchez told me that Jeff Bezos and Lawrence Sanchez are in a force separation while precisely they agreed not to be together for one month as a precaution in this white-hot atmosphere. Joining us now Buck Sexton, a radio host and co-host at Hill TV, and in New York, Jessica Tarlov, a Fox News contributor. So, Buck, this is pretty heated disagreement over P.R. strategy, but also Michael Sanchez is saying just because I have friendships with people in Trump world and at the Enquirer there's no way I'd be involved in a leak that would be damaging to my sisters. And no one knows yet where this leak came from.",

It is also true that people come forward with stories for any number of reasons and due process means that you do believe someone is innocent until they are proven guilty. Having someone who seems credible or having someone who seems sympathetic is not the same as actually meeting that standard. It is important for the country to remember that allegations are easy to make actually and that proving them is much more difficult. But just to the larger point too of the media coverage, you don't have to work that hard to imagine what would be happening if the three top people in a state's government were Republican and going to a KKK photo scandal, credible allegations of rape and a black face scandal. These are all happening. You would see protests. You would see narratives. You would say what is wrong with the Republican Party and why is this happening? The coverage of Virginia seems to treat it as if it's just very localized, as if Virginia is a weird place. You're not seeing those national discussions about what is the Democratic Party's problem with race, with sex and power?"

I mean, I received so many -- every major national media outlet in the country sent reporters down to Richmond, the number of them that called me at my office to say, what is going on with the Virginia Democratic Party? Is it imploded? I mean, I think when it comes to issues of race and issues of sexual assault, both parties have now had to deal with some very, very difficult conversations and that the national media has played a very large role in opening up these conversations and picking at some scabs that were barely covering some impeachment. K0URTZ: Justin Fairfax looked like he was at the verge of becoming governor and then these accusations come out. There were all of these anchors and commentators including liberal commentators demanding that Ralph Northam resign over his admitted use of black face, impersonating Michael Jackson. There is dispute about whether or not it was him in the yearbook photo, another racist photo. We learned that the state attorney general, Mark Herring, second in line to the governorship, also admitted doing black face back in 1980. As despicable and as offensive as those black face images are, are the media in some ways imposing retroactively the stems (ph) of 2019 on stuff that happened decades ago?"

Black Virginians seem to be more open to forgiveness than a lot of us in this town are. And so I do think -- I agree with Gillian that the media has played a huge role in furthering a conversation about not just race and sexual assault, but conversations about redemption, about how we gone -- are we digging too deep at times? What is appropriate and what is not? And I don't think anybody has real answer to that."

Are we just had a zero tolerance level for anything?"

That scandal is happening right now. It relates to policy right now. And so to move the conversation away from this issue of having a governor who supports this barbaric practice and changing it to a conversation about what happened 35 years ago, it is good to have that conversation but you shouldn't leave the policy items there in play right now on the table."

I mean, you had some leaks saying he's going to throw a warm and fuzzy -- I think I saw that, but other leaks saying he's going to come out swinging. So I think the White House did a good job of creating some media discord there and purposely. But, look, I think that was probably -- the investigation thing was probably the newsiest thing that the president said. Everything else he said with the exception of the one moment he had that I think actually spoke to bipartisanship was his applause of the Democratic women in Congress. But beyond that, everything else he said was pretty much what he had been saying every day leading up to that."

He's trying to end the 18-year in Afghanistan. They are trying to keep us there for another 18 or so years, who knows how long. And so I think that was actually the interesting policy subtext. But even on the investigation thing, you heard people, oh, well, you know, during previous administrations you have been investigated for Benghazi or IRS scandals or fast and furious scandal. The thing that makes those a little different, and I am a huge fan of congressional oversight for whatever they want to do it for, is that those were actually investigating administration issues. Investigating someone's personal life in the decades before they become president, that is actually very different than how we normally do congressional oversight, even if they have the right to look into it."

      "utterance": "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, was embarrassed when the National Enquirer revealed he was an affair with former L.A. television host Lauren Sanchez, complete with steamy texts. And yet many news organizations including The New York Times and the broadcast networks initially ignored that part of the story as if it didn't happen and just focused on Bezos's divorce. But now, Bezos is accusing the Enquirer of extortion. President Trump's close friend, David Pecker who owns the tabloid, was granted immunity by prosecutors after admitting being involved in hush money payments to women who accused Trump of extramarital affairs. Federal prosecutors are now reviewing Bezos's allegations against AMI. In a piece on the blog news site medium, Bezos says that because of The Washington Post coverage, the president considers him an enemy. He has called him Jeff Bozo. Parent company, American Media Inc., denies pursuing the story because of outside political forces. Bezos now says the company executives warned him or threatened him. \"They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn't stop our investigation.\" Bezos made public a letter from Dylan Howard, AMI's top news executive, listing photos it has of the Amazon chief. These include a below the belt selfie, a naked selfie in the bathroom with only a white towel, and sexy shots of Lauren Sanchez. Bezos says he was told the Enquirer would run these pictures unless he falsely told the press that he has no basis for suggesting the affair story was politically-motivated. Bezos says, \"If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can? Of course, I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\" AMI says the company fervently believes it acted lawfully in handling the story but that it is more decided that it should properly and thoroughly investigated the claims made by Bezos. Now, whether or not David Pecker was doing this to please Donald Trump, that kind of threatening letter from a newspaper is extremely troubling. Bezos, a man who almost never talks to the press, could wind up doing further damage to what remains of the National Enquirer's reputation. Next on \"Media Buzz,\" I've got some new reporting on this whole mess and the behind the scenes sniping among people close to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez. And later, \"The Mooch\" is here on the ongoing warfare between the president and the press."

      "utterance": "As Jeff Bezos takes on the National Enquirer with the story on his affair with television personality Lauren Sanchez, a deep and sometimes bitter divide has emerged among some of those defending the couple. Michael Sanchez, Lauren's brother, and he says are on and off manager, spoke to me about his strong objections to the strategy which has been overseen by Gavin de Becker, the Amazon founder's longtime security consultant. Sanchez who knew about the affair praises Bezos. He says, \"a brilliant man who doesn't bow down to bullies of the time.\" Unfortunately, Gavin de Becker, a very powerful bully, currently wheels a strange puppet master control over Jeff. Sanchez told me that while he was negotiating with Enquirer parent American Media Inc. owned by the president's pal David Parker to soften the story on the extramarital affair, de Becker, quote, \"launch World War III against the AMI,\" in part, by advising Bezos to preempt the scoop with what Sanchez called a misleading tweet about his divorce from his wife Mackenzie. Everything Gavin has gotten Jeff to do has only amplified the magnitude of the scandal, Sanchez told me. He said it's a disgrace that filthy rich and Uber powerful men are using the media to take shots at each other. The simple truth, Jeff and Lauren fell madly in love risk everything for each other. Now Sanchez is also been on the receiving end. De Becker has told the Washington Post, which of course Bezos owns, and the Daily Beast that he is looking into the leak to the Enquirer and has spoken to Sanchez as part of that investigation. De Becker is traveling overseas and declined to comment, but believes that as the man looking into these matters, he has to take an aggressive posture. And then those being investigated sometimes deflect attention by criticizing the investigators. Sanchez who is a registered Democrat, and Trump's supporter has denied being the source of the leak. He told me it's irrelevant, that he's an acquaintance of Roger Stone, a Republican operative who has not pleaded not guilty to witness tampering and lying to Congress in the Mueller investigation and that he wants to do small business deal with Carter Page. Former Trump campaign advisors who has come under scrutiny in the special counsel's probe has consulted Page about the leak. Sanchez is friends as well with top executive Dylan Howard quote, \"my friendships are being used as a weapon against me, but the dots don't connect.\" Sanchez has urged Bezos and his sister to order De Becker to stand down this matter. He argues, for instance, that de Becker risk exposure of the affair by allowing the high-profile Bezos and his sister to appear together at restaurants, on private jets and at the launch for Bezos' Blue Origin aerospace company. De Becker who has decades of experience in protecting big celebrities maintains there were no lapses in security, that photographers were tipped off about the couples' outings and it's not his job to prevent them from being photographed. Meanwhile, Sanchez told me that Jeff Bezos and Lawrence Sanchez are in a force separation while precisely they agreed not to be together for one month as a precaution in this white-hot atmosphere. Joining us now Buck Sexton, a radio host and co-host at Hill TV, and in New York, Jessica Tarlov, a Fox News contributor. So, Buck, this is pretty heated disagreement over P.R. strategy, but also Michael Sanchez is saying just because I have friendships with people in Trump world and at the Enquirer there's no way I'd be involved in a leak that would be damaging to my sisters. And no one knows yet where this leak came from."

And from the analysis that I've read so far from people who worked in VIP security, they are looking at Lawrence Sanchez's phone and not Jeff Bezos's phone as the one that would have been hacked or the leak would have come from."

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "So, there's more to see there. But I would also like to point out that Ronan Farrow, Terry Crews, the Daily Beast have all come forward saying that AMI has used the same tactics against them to try to get them to squash stories or to pay them off. And I do think that it's important that people know exactly how this company operates, and I do think that making it clear that they are directly linked to President Trump and he has paid them off in the past himself is something that the media should be discussing."

This lawyer also said that the source of this it was close to Jeff Bezos and Lawrence Sanchez that it was a male and has been providing information to the Enquirer for seven years. So, you know, I don't want to speculate but that's the line AMI is taking. What's your take, Buck, on Bezos, you know, taking the stuff of going so public, a guy who was never public to the press, calling out the extortion at Enquirer for what he sees as extortion and for trying to pressure him into dropping his investigation with the Washington Post investigation into this whole mess."

That when you play games with billionaires and decided that you are going to ruin the reputations put pressure on them and use your media outlet to do that you open yourself up to this kind of retribution and counterattack. I think Jeff Bezos understands that it's likely these photos once they got out of positive control over two individuals, they are consenting adults in this relationship, it was like that somebody somewhere is going to leak them but you can't allow people to hold this over your head. And I also think that people's perceptions of how damaging this really use consenting adults not illegal, I think that's changing as we go on longer too."

There was an effort to have a truce among the parties around Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez but that fell apart. All right. Ahead on the program, guys, stick around, we'll bring you back a little while. Ahead on the program, liberal anchors can't get enough as a White House source leaks Donald Trump's private schedule. Straight ahead with the president battling the press and House Democrats. Anthony Scaramucci is on deck."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "With President Trump fresh after the State of the Union again battling with House Democrats as they gear up for investigations. Joining us now from New York Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director. And when the president warned the House Democrats now speak against ridiculous partisan investigations, otherwise he won't cooperate on legislation he says, many in the media said, hey, Republicans during the Obama administration lots of investigations, aggressive investigations. Does the president really believe that House Democrats are not going to hold hearings and issue subpoenas and investigate his administration?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI, FORMER WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he's resolved and resigned do the fact that they are going to do that but I think he likes saying those things as it's very important for the president right now to galvanize his base. And he knows that the base doesn't like these investigations. And so just by tweaking them every once, Howie, he sends them that galvanizing message. I think one of the main reasons that's always been overlooked by the pundits why he shut the government down aloud that the state stay close is he's got to get those people whether it's 36, 37 percent to return to the polls in 2020 with the same voter participation level. So, I think he does that intentionally and it is strategic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The way it seems like you just acknowledge one of the criticisms of the president was that he shut the government down for 35 days disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and not helping the economy so he could energize his base? I mean, I know he's trying to get the wall but, we're five days from another deadline. Is that what I just heard you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a combination of things. I would say that it's got three layers too. Layer number one is he promised the wall. He wants to deliver the wall. He's very, very concerned about border security. Layer number two. He knows that he's got to bring those people out. He wants to -- he wants to send them a message that he is fighting for them. And then the third, the third layer is that as a result of the shutdown I do believe he'll get a deal, there'll be an intersection of a deal where you can really start building."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "So, yes. I think it was -- I think it will prove to be a winning strategy when we look back at the 2020 reelect -- when the president has won reelection, you'll go back to December 21st to say that was the day that he started the deal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I notice -- I notice how you just describe as a foregone conclusion. But let me nevertheless ask you this. You book is \"Trump the Blue-Collar President.\" And the media handicapping is that Donald Trump is going to have a hard time in 2020 for these reasons. The shutdown would be one having trouble getting above 40 percent in the polls, doing poorly among women, playing to the base instead of sort of trying to appeal to more moderate voters all the energies on the Democratic side. These are all things that I read in every news analysis. So why is that wrong?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, it's wrong because if you go back to where President Obama was at this time and the rhetoric around President Obama, he had similar numbers to President Trump. It's wrong because the economy is actually doing quite well despite the volatility in the stock market. You know, I'm a trained economist and believe that the economy will trend higher into the 2020 reelection. It's very, very hard to unseat a sitting president then. It's also --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What about the president's personal conduct, do you think that people are just sort of used to Donald Trump style now whether they particularly like it or not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, listen. Now he was 69 years as a business person and every single flaw the president was out there, one of the problems that somebody like Elizabeth Warren, is because they're sitting at the podium with great sanctity and more rectitude and all this other nonsense is that when they're lying on their bar applications they get blown through the door. But the president has been out there as a business person, not as a politician for the greater part of his life. So, I think people have sort of accepted that whatever his flaws are he's very effective. But I just want to make this last point. Very hard to unseat a sitting president in a rising economy. And if you look at where he was at the State of the Union address, if he continues with that messaging, he'll attract the independents he needs to win reelection."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. We've been talking about Jeff Bezos. The president obviously does not like him. And accusing the National Enquirer of blackmail for threatening in a letter to publish certain photos unless he does what the tabloid wants. And of course, everybody points out was the Enquirer trying to help the president because his close friend David Pecker runs the tabloid. As someone who is tangled with the media, what do you make of Bezos calling out the Enquirer and do you think it's fair to at least for the media to raise the question about whether or not the effort here was to help the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "Well, people are leaving out the fact that Mr. Pecker actually got immunity a couple of months ago and so I don't know if that created --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCARAMUCCI",
      "utterance": "OK. You did. But most people don't. And I don't understand why people don't think there might be a strain there with President Trump as a result of that immunity situation. Look, I liked David a lot. I know him personally. I don't know Jeff Bezos. I think it was a very aggressive strategy. You know, at the end of the day sometimes you're putting a propane tank on top of a Duraflame log. I don't -- I don't know if Jeff was a friend of mine, I probably would not have recommended that to him. You know, you know I've been in the media crosshairs. I took a month or two off and then went back at it pretty aggressively. I don't like people defining me. But I think the way Jeff is going about this by the way it's creating too much unseemly in this around him. And you know, look, the guy is a brilliant guy, arguably richest person in the world and we're all benefiting from his services. If I was his advisor, I would have said let's go a little slow here. There's no reason to go in this direction."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, certainly has enflamed the story once again but he feels like he's standing up to tabloid pressure. Before we go I got to play a little sound bite for you. Roll it. Hang on."

The American people are watching that sort of stuff. And by the way, if he gets invited on celebrity big brother, I'll personally recommend that you go. It was one of the most fun things I did in my life out."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "Well, it shows that there are people in the White House and with access to the president's schedule that he can't trust. So, you know, there are people who are obviously are out to get him and I think that that once again is problematic for the whole country. And then when you look at what the pundits are saying they have no idea. All they're doing is parading their Trump derangement syndrome. They don't know what goes on. They don't know enough about the scheduling process to know what they don't know, which is that he could be on the phone. He could be doing this that aren't on the schedule."

I think that the president does have an issue with people in his orbit and not being able to trust them. And this is one that we've seen consistently since he entered office at all levels and in all departments. Hopefully he can get some better people or people who are more interested in working for him and for the betterment of the country in there."

But there was another off-the-record lunch with network anchors this week and there was one a few weeks ago that one leaked, this one leak and the president was reported to have said off-there-record that he called Joe Biden dumb. He called Chuck Schumer a nasty SOB. He criticized the late John McCain. Was this a betrayal by somebody in that room who agreed to the off-the- record ground rules?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "It absolutely was but it serves two important purposes for the president. One, is that it shows once again that journalists are willing to discard the ethics that they pretend to care about when it comes to this president. We've seen that time and time again. And I think it's good because the American people now we're never getting the old media back if there's this nonpartisan neutral national political press corps. That's a joke and that's never coming back. So that's a good thing. And the other thing is he gets to say stuff that I think the president really wants to say and it gets out there, and it's like it's not his fault but we get to hear it anyway."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You anticipated my question to Jessica, which is, first of all, I don't have any problem with the New York Times reporting this but whoever was in the room, obviously somebody did violate that agreement. But the president having been (Inaudible) once in off-the-record launch with anchors I suspect that he's not all that upset and indeed suspected that this might have gotten out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Yes, I don't think so. I mean, these were just iterations of things that he has already said publicly. He's been feuding with the McCain family for years. We know it's crying Chuck and he has nicknames for everybody. So, yes, it wasn't new information. His base loves it. I see on twitter all the time."
    },

I mean, a couple days later we have his attacks on Elizabeth Warren and, you know, talking about the trail of tears. And this president calling for unity and saying that we should get past revenge politics. No one is buying it even the people in his own orbit. And I understand that, you know, he got his applause lines for that --"

      "speaker": "SEXTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. The president is keeping in place all of his rights to fight back. And I think that what you see here is the president. I think his outreach isn't heard. He just realizes that the other side is not going to meet him half way and he's not going to put his fire away until they do."
