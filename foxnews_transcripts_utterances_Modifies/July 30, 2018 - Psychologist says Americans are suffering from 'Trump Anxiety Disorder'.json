Well, that's in part the strategy behind that would be to help frame that sculpted frame then that narrative, but, obviously, has a lot more potential for detriment than not. And I think if I could throw in my two cents about Cohen, you know, obviously, everyone keeps repeating, well, it's a one party consent state in New York, sure. His lawyer says, well, he recorded all of his conversations because it replaced him taking notes, right? And because there's so many -- there's almost 200, that speaks to that, but you still have a duty of confidentiality to your client, which is a broader duty than privilege, for example. So, you never release it and you never - - you essentially vow not to do harm to your client with their confidence they've given you. And they also begged the question so the privilege was waived by that tape and I think that was a smart move because, A, the conversation doesn't continue about, well, there must be something in that tape and there must be something recorded that's nefarious. And also, because it takes out the fight the government could have argued, A, it is privilege, or, B, then there's a crime fraud exception.

And the amount of resources it takes to prepare for a furlough and execute on it and then have backup after, it is inordinate. And so, to me, it's just a tremendous hemorrhage, again, of those resources. And also, I feel like -- you know we've talked about this but the southern border issue, we cannot overstate or underestimate the power that -- of the corruption in Mexico, and the Central American countries, and the transnational drug cartels. Almost 150 politicians have been murdered in Mexico ramping up to their election, and then five since their election this month. And so, to men, again, if we could just have a little bit more dialogue I think from those border or the districts along the border by those reps, by those southern border senators and have a more engaging conversation in detail, then we can get out of that hyperbole, especially coming up to the midterm election.

So -- but is it different for President Trump? If he's going to shut down the government, could it turn out better for him? I don't know. He's got really good instincts on politics. He knows that the economy, as good as it is, is not what's driving voters to the polls. He needs to turn out his base. Will his base turn out for something like this? Possibly. The other thing about the politics is, I don't think that the members of Congress actually believe him. So they're like, \"Oh, he's just, like, threatening to shut down the government. He won't really do it.\" What I think the president should do, if he can, is to send up to the Congress the exact -- exactly what he would veto.

And we're seeing now that this -- to me, also, it's another oversimplification of the matter. Oh, I have this Trump anxiety syndrome, and so that must mean X, Y, and Z. Well, what is that the root of, right? Fear and fright is usually from lack of education.

He's taking down institutions. He's fighting with people. He's on twitter. And we've never had a president like that before and people can't process that. And then, three, people are frustrated because they haven't been able to take him down. They've thrown everything at this guy and he's still at 45 to 46 percent.

I know people that are just like I don't like to watch the news anymore. It's too negative. Or especially if it was violent, you know, they don't want to watch that. So you do have a choice. You know it's been the serenity prayer, you ask for wisdom for the things you cannot change and the courage to know the difference and the things that you can't. And so, I think that -- the other thing is, and I do think the Democrats have done this at large extent, and so have Trump supporters, which is channel that energy into something else. Run for office, donate, decide to turn something into action so that you can actually get involved. If you feel like you're more involved and you're actually being able to do something on either side, then you can deal with your anxiety better.

      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "That's absolutely one argument for sure, but there's also been a lot of question as to -- well, is there even a strategy, right? And certainly what we saw today might be evidence that it's more of a reactionary one even though it's always trying to get in front of the new cycle, in front of the statement to put out there with the narrative should be and that's partly, for example, this -- you know, should he sit down with Mueller, should he not. Well, that's in part the strategy behind that would be to help frame that sculpted frame then that narrative, but, obviously, has a lot more potential for detriment than not. And I think if I could throw in my two cents about Cohen, you know, obviously, everyone keeps repeating, well, it's a one party consent state in New York, sure. His lawyer says, well, he recorded all of his conversations because it replaced him taking notes, right? And because there's so many -- there's almost 200, that speaks to that, but you still have a duty of confidentiality to your client, which is a broader duty than privilege, for example. So, you never release it and you never - - you essentially vow not to do harm to your client with their confidence they've given you. And they also begged the question so the privilege was waived by that tape and I think that was a smart move because, A, the conversation doesn't continue about, well, there must be something in that tape and there must be something recorded that's nefarious. And also, because it takes out the fight the government could have argued, A, it is privilege, or, B, then there's a crime fraud exception. So, I certainly think that was wise, but I also think that this, either purposeful or not strategy of being mired in the details, it's a little bit taking us away from the bigger picture."

And the amount of resources it takes to prepare for a furlough and execute on it and then have backup after, it is inordinate. And so, to me, it's just a tremendous hemorrhage, again, of those resources. And also, I feel like -- you know we've talked about this but the southern border issue, we cannot overstate or underestimate the power that -- of the corruption in Mexico, and the Central American countries, and the transnational drug cartels. Almost 150 politicians have been murdered in Mexico ramping up to their election, and then five since their election this month. And so, to men, again, if we could just have a little bit more dialogue I think from those border or the districts along the border by those reps, by those southern border senators and have a more engaging conversation in detail, then we can get out of that hyperbole, especially coming up to the midterm election.

And the shutdown was just, like, a terrible idea. And President Trump absolutely won on that, and he was able to ride that for about eight weeks afterwards. So -- but is it different for President Trump? If he's going to shut down the government, could it turn out better for him? I don't know. He's got really good instincts on politics. He knows that the economy, as good as it is, is not what's driving voters to the polls. He needs to turn out his base. Will his base turn out for something like this? Possibly. The other thing about the politics is, I don't think that the members of Congress actually believe him. So they're like, \"Oh, he's just, like, threatening to shut down the government. He won't really do it.\" What I think the president should do, if he can, is to send up to the Congress the exact -- exactly what he would veto.
