Equity is about everybody getting a leg down. It's forced equality from above rather than creating an on ramp to get on the ladder of opportunity or success. Punish everybody. Put everybody down a run. And that's what you're seeing here. It's like, you know what, rather than help these people, everybody is going to be treated crappy. And what's amazing, this is an area, an American -- the American response to disaster is always really impressive because there's no team sport politics, there's no race card, there's no gender debate. It's just everybody pitching in. They don't ask you who you voted for, where they pick you up in their pickup truck. Kamala proves once again that you can inject politics and wokeism and us versus them ideology into everything. And once you do it, it kills it. It's like a poison. And this is one of the most powerful aspects of America is the melting pot, right? Other countries don't have this, and it usually attracts the most interesting people because we self-select for risk takers. That's why America, that's the real trait of the melting pot. And the only thing that could beat the melting pot is wokeism. By saying no, what -- what -- you are different. And that means you can't have the same conversation. And every time you try to reach out and be the same, that's actually appropriation. So instead of the melting pot, it's splitting everybody into tribes.

She knew what she said was divisive. Why in that moment did she decide to be that divisive? And you go back to the press secretary's words on that gaggle, that was on for on, Air Force One today. Full stop. Period she said. She should have ended it there because she went on actually to defend the vice president's words, saying what she meant to say. What she was talking about was helping people in lower income communities, those that have a harder time accessing health, ensuring everyone has access. That's not what she said. She precisely said the administration would focus on communities of color and resources would be based on equity. And that's really important to keep focusing on exactly on her words. I'll finish with this though. Bill Maher was amazing reacting to this. I mean, the left is reacting to this, calling her out on this.

And I thought that Van Jones made a really important point in that panel discussion along with Caitlin Flanagan from The Atlantic. He was talking about identity politics and how Democrats are the only ones who get smeared for playing identity politics. But what was choosing Mike Pence, for instance, right? Donald Trump, he said, not a particularly saintly fellow, right? He went out and he found a strong Evangelical partner who could stand by him even through the grab her by the you know what tape. And that politicians connect with different groups for a lot of times immutable characteristics and their experiences, and it's not only Democrats that do that.

So something that's special about a New York, a Paris a London, is that everybody is on public transport, right? Like you can get into the subway and you'll see someone in black tie going to Lincoln Center, and then you can see someone a nurse who's commuting home, who's going to be staying on and heading further uptown, et cetera. And that's what makes New York City fantastic and you're not seeing that anymore, even though things are reopening and there was all this speculation, you know, what will New York City look like after COVID? And people were really concerned about would you know, Broadway reopen, will, restaurants reopen, et cetera, hospitals, you know, obviously being glass crowded and things like that. And I don't think this was one that we really pegged as not being reversible. That it would go -- it wouldn't go back to how it was.

Now, the U.S. interest to Americans is to prevent the United States from getting into a war with Russia. So, they have to figure out what that means. And that may mean Ukraine having to come to the table and saying the areas that have been annexed are now Russia's and moving forward or it may mean continuing the war in a lot of ways because people feel like they're winning against Russia as they try to recruit 65-year-olds and 18 -- you know, more 18-year-olds in the fighting force. But in terms of the deterrence, there hasn't been a lot there from the beginning of this. And all I hear is escalation about the United States getting involved in a war that Americans haven't signed up for and that Congress hasn't agreed to sign Americans up for either.",

He's been the face of the international organization of leadership in supporting President Zelenskyy. You can hear it in the way that Zelenskyy talks about him versus other leaders in fact. There is no more that he can do at this point. And probably to a lot of Americans, if they looked at the dollars that have gone out, they were always say it's actually too much that he's done in support of Zelenskyy at this point. Vladimir Putin thought he would win this in 11 days. That had moved to a couple of months. Last week, he illegally annexed four provinces. They've already taken one back.

I don't know the last time I heard a Democrat talk about that other than who was it, Mark Pocan, Democrat Wisconsin, bashing the Republican Party for worshipping the altar of the free market, taking on capitalism saying America is a nation based on grift. That is tough for Americans to hear in a period of economic peril.",

Equity is about everybody getting a leg down. It's forced equality from above rather than creating an on ramp to get on the ladder of opportunity or success. Punish everybody.

Other countries don't have this, and it usually attracts the most interesting people because we self-select for risk takers. That's why America, that's the real trait of the melting pot. And the only thing that could beat the melting pot is wokeism. By saying no, what -- what -- you are different. And that means you can't have the same conversation. And every time you try to reach out and be the same, that's actually appropriation. So instead of the melting pot, it's splitting everybody into tribes. And in the long run it will destroy this country because it's start -- it's the one of the greatest powers we have."

That's pretty, that's pretty amazing considering what we're still seeing down there as far as damage, the massive number of people affected. You have to ask yourself why. She knew what she said was divisive. Why in that moment did she decide to be that divisive? And you go back to the press secretary's words on that gaggle, that was on for on, Air Force One today. Full stop. Period she said. She should have ended it there because she went on actually to defend the vice president's words, saying what she meant to say. What she was talking about was helping people in lower income communities, those that have a harder time accessing health, ensuring everyone has access. That's not what she said. She precisely said the administration would focus on communities of color and resources would be based on equity. And that's really important to keep focusing on exactly on her words. I'll finish with this though. Bill Maher was amazing reacting to this. I mean, the left is reacting to this, calling her out on this.

He was talking about identity politics and how Democrats are the only ones who get smeared for playing identity politics. But what was choosing Mike Pence, for instance, right? Donald Trump, he said, not a particularly saintly fellow, right? He went out and he found a strong Evangelical partner who could stand by him even through the grab her by the you know what tape.

And something that's so upsetting to me about it personally, and I've lived here my whole life, is that I feel that we're on the precipice of a fundamental change in the character of the city. So something that's special about a New York, a Paris a London, is that everybody is on public transport, right? Like you can get into the subway and you'll see someone in black tie going to Lincoln Center, and then you can see someone a nurse who's commuting home, who's going to be staying on and heading further uptown, et cetera. And that's what makes New York City fantastic and you're not seeing that anymore, even though things are reopening and there was all this speculation, you know, what will New York City look like after COVID? And people were really concerned about would you know, Broadway reopen, will, restaurants reopen, et cetera, hospitals, you know, obviously being glass crowded and things like that.

He'd probably die in a bloody coup if he did that because we'd just destroy every target in Ukraine and take out the, , as Petraeus said, their black fleet -- black sea fleet and everything in Crimea. What I worry about is Joe Biden, because I don't know who Joe Biden is listening to. Is he listening to Secretary of Defense Austin who's fresh on the job, who I don't even know what he thinks about anything. I just know he thinks white supremacy is our biggest threat. Is he listening to these other hawkish Russian -- anti-Russian advisors that want more than anything to win their new cold war against the Russians because the Democrats have been so soft on foreign policy for years? Or is he listening to his rank amateurs like, like Ron Klain? So, we don't know. But we know that we have to have a little finesse because we have to manage the Russian decline. It seems like we have given them enough military capability to really eventually route the Russians in the East. And how does Putin save face? I mean, you're going to back the guy into a corner. I don't think he's going to launch a tactical nuke, but he's going to do something. And we just have to make sure we manage this appropriately. I don't know if Joe Biden is up for that."

You know, what you keep hearing is something you heard before the invasion, which is if Putin does X, the United States will respond in some way. It's always been following what Vladimir Putin wanted to do. There hasn't been a lot of deterrence on the front end of that. And when I hear people like General Petraeus talking about what we would do if Putin were to use a nuclear weapon, he's saying, The United States is going to be drawn into a full-scale war against Russia. If he's saying you're going to sink all their ships, get rid of their fleet, target every single military installation in the country in Russia and Ukraine. That is the United States getting involved in World War III at a level that is not just giving Ukrainians weapons. Now, the U.S. interest to Americans is to prevent the United States from getting into a war with Russia. So, they have to figure out what that means. And that may mean Ukraine having to come to the table and saying the areas that have been annexed are now Russia's and moving forward or it may mean continuing the war in a lot of ways because people feel like they're winning against Russia as they try to recruit 65-year-olds and 18 -- you know, more 18-year-olds in the fighting force. But in terms of the deterrence, there hasn't been a lot there from the beginning of this.

He's been the face of the international organization of leadership in supporting President Zelenskyy. You can hear it in the way that Zelenskyy talks about him versus other leaders in fact. There is no more that he can do at this point. And probably to a lot of Americans, if they looked at the dollars that have gone out, they were always say it's actually too much that he's done in support of Zelenskyy at this point. Vladimir Putin thought he would win this in 11 days. That had moved to a couple of months. Last week, he illegally annexed four provinces. They've already taken one back. The Ukrainians are doing the absolute best they can because of American assistance, because we are giving them all of the systems that they need to fight their way out of this themselves without sacrificing American lives."

I do kind of get the feeling that Russia is in trouble because the dueling banjos of propaganda have actually kind of gone away. That makes me think that maybe they're in trouble. But I don't understand the problem with the P word. Every time you bring up the word peace, somebody thinks you're saying Putin. And this is the thing that really is wrong about it. I have a problem that everybody is pro-war, and it's on the backburner. We're not even really covering it anymore. We're just put pouring the money in and meanwhile Elon Musk, you know, he tweets suggestions about seeking peace and who attacks him, Zelenskyy and other diplomats. right? And it's like, look, you can't -- you can't attack people who are paying for your war, right? I understand it. It is your country and you were invaded, but look, we're paying for it. We can have an opinion here. And I do think that my fear has always been that the billions of dollars is extending the duration of the war without changing the outcome. And I think what Katie said is true, that we have to have as kind of a sober analysis of what exit ramp you can give to Putin, right, even if it's what he already had. To pretend that all of us knew the names of these places two weeks ago, that's phony. It's like, oh, we they annex these places and we all have to look and figure out what they are.

Even though you won't show up at the debate stage, let's talk about your extreme views on the issue. But when it comes to how they're running away from Biden still, I mean, a couple of weeks ago, you had all the media outlets saying Joe Biden is making a comeback. His approval rating is up. And I remember asking the question, OK, we'll see if any of these candidates who said they don't want him on the campaign trail will invite him to come campaign for them. He's - - they're not doing that. They want him to stay as far away as possible. There's a new Gallup poll that came out today showing that Republicans are plus 20 on issue of safety and plus 10 on the issue of economy. And Joe Biden's approval with independence is just atrocious. So, abortion and fear-mongering are the only things they're trying to do.
