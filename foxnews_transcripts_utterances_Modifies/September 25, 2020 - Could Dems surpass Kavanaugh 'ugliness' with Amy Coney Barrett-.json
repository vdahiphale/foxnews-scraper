He'll be here on the Angle exclusively in minutes to tell us why.   And the pick is in. Tomorrow afternoon, President Trump will nominate 7th Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. We will have full reaction ahead. But first, let's get back to the president's rally in Newport News, Virginia. Virginia is tightening as are so many states across the country. And if Trump won Virginia, well, I can tell you this, it would be a Trump landslide but he's very positive there. He's making a lot of news tonight. Let's listen in.",

He would terminate our travel bans and jihadist regions, you know I've got the travel ban. Remember everyone said you couldn't do that.  I want a travel ban from people that want to blow up our country. Do you think that's OK? People said, we don't like that. Took a little heat and we got it. They said I didn't get it. They were right. We lost at one court, lost at the second, then we won in the Supreme Court. They don't say that, but we have a strong travel ban. And we will use it. We do use it. We use it plenty and increased refugee admissions. They want to increase refugee admissions, 700 percent. Opening the floodgates for radical Islamic terrorism. They want to ban school choice and charter schools in a second term. I will provide school choice to every parent in America, every parent.  Vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It's so true. And in conclusion, I love you people, but I've been doing this since early in the morning. I'm getting the hell out of here. I would only do this for Virginia.  I've got a guy who stays in his damn basement all day long and I'm doing this. I don't know - if he wins, I'm going to be very embarrassed, I'll say, I've worked so hard and he didn't work at all. We're going to win. I think we're going to win, and I think we're going to win big. I think we're going to. I think we're going to win bigger than anyone understand. I think there's a vote out there. There's a hidden vote out there. The pollsters are fake. They're controlled by the same people, the Right. The bad stories, the fake stories. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will hire more police. Increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, ban them.  We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, Virginia. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of the ridiculous horrible endless foreign wars countries that you've never even heard of. We will keep you out of them. And by the way, we have weapons, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before. We have a level of the degree of which nobody from Russia to China to North Korea, nobody has ever seen what we've built and just hope to God, we never have to use them, but we have never had anything like the arsenal that we've built over the last three years.  I hope to God we never have to use them. We're the envy of the world in that way. We have the greatest people for our ability. There's nobody can do what we can do. There's nobody - but when I came in your military was totally depleted, you had old planes, you had old everything. We have now the F-35s and we have things, the bombers, the new bombers, the tankers, the ships that were building, some right here, Newport News.   But we have built an arsenal the likes of which the world has never seen. And you know what that will make it a lot easier for us not to have to use them. That's really what we need. We needed it. We were in bad shape. We were in bad shape We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. And that's what we've done. We will end surprise medical building, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance. The health insurance is a disaster and we are bringing the price of health insurance way down, premiums and costs of prescription drugs.   We're instituting favored nations. We pay the highest in the world for drugs. I negotiated with Big Pharma and I just got tired of negotiating. I said, I'm sorry, we're instituting favored nations. We're the largest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world. And I institute it--",

We have over 1.1 million students and face-to-face instruction for K through 12. We have college students that are on campus. We've had big events such as NFL with fans, college football with fans. We had a NASCAR race with 30,000 people. So, we've been open. The final kind of piece to the puzzle was this capacity limitation on the restaurants at  50 percent. And so that was the announcement today, kind of brought that in for a landing. And a lot of those folks in that industry have had a really, really rough time.

It's on my Twitter and Facebook with three very eminent scientists yesterday talking about all these issues. Dr. Martin Caldor from Harvard Medical and Jay Bhattacharya and Michael Levitt from Stanford Medical. And I asked, should lockdowns be off the table?   And they all said unequivocally, yes, lockdowns should be off the table. At best what they do is just delay infections. They do not reduce mortality, but they cause catastrophic damage. And so that should be off the table in this country going forward. We need our society to function because COVID-  19 is one health issue.

It's tried, true and safe. So, if people want to vote that way, they should absolutely do it. But we are not indiscriminately sending out ballots all over the state of Florida. That doesn't work.   And you also have to have send in the ballot by Election Day at 7 PM. There's not going to be a situation where ballots are just showing up a week after the election. I think that that's very chaotic. Look, I think he's in good shape. It's always tough here. It's never an easy race. But if you look in 2016, he did rarely poorly in Miami-Dade County, still won the state. He's doing a lot better in Miami-Dade. He's got really strong support from Hispanics. I think he'll win Hispanics in Miami-Dade County. And if he holds the support elsewhere, I think he's definitely going to be in good shape. Biden has really not done much in Florida. We have a ground game. We're registering voters going door-to-door. Their campaign hasn't wanted to do that because of the pandemic. When Trump won in 2016, we had a   340,000 deficit with Democrats for registration. We've now shrunk that to under 190,000 thousand.

I think it takes a lot of courage for anybody to be willing to be nominated to the Supreme Court after what happened to Bret Kavanaugh and how people in the media and other partisans tried to destroy his life and his reputation and his family.

So, what exactly was wrong with what the president said there. Democrats who have explicitly and implicitly encouraged BLM and the ANTIFA rioters are now accusing Trump of planning what exactly to mobilize troops against the Biden transition team, if Biden actually wins?  It's ridiculous. Now, to normal Americans, it's obvious what the president is saying, but I was thinking about it today. If your party, the Democrats, doesn't actually have a candidate who campaigns like Biden. Well, what else are you going to talk about?",

Now, the only administration that has tried to derail the peaceful transition of power is Obama's. And Trump was on to them from the beginning. Back on January 3rd, 2017 in oppression tweet, he said this, the intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange. This is why they don't like Trump's tweets. Now, the media lambasted him for that, but newly released text messages between FBI officials included one from January 5th, 2017, that read Trump was right. In other words, the Intel briefing was absolutely being delayed to cook up more evidence against him. The text went on to say, still not put together. Why do we do this to ourselves? What's wrong with these people? Now, I should note that this FBI text was set the same day of that infamous White House meeting that we've previously reported on. This is the meeting where Obama and Comey discussed withholding information from incoming Trump officials. Well, so much for doing things by the book. Barack? Well, five days later, when CNN leaked that Trump had been briefed on the bogus Steele dossier, one FBI agent texted this to a colleague. We all went and purchased professional liability insurance. I wonder why? And speaking of Christopher Steele, we learned today that the primary source for his infamous dossier was a suspected Russian spy going back to 2009. More damning, however, is the fact that the FBI knew this in December of 2016 but kept spying on the Trump campaign anyway. In other words, the Democrats funded Russian disinformation, which was taken up by rogue deep state actors, one of whom was Peter Strzok. Two years ago, he gave this impassioned defense of the FBI's horrific misconduct.",

But in the end, he said what he saw was a team had an attitude of get Trump, and where everything was being called by the lawyers, and the attorneys were only in this in order to get some big takedown of the president, and who were looking at the average investigators as nothing more than speed bumps in their way.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes, this case agent in charge had been instructed to close the Flynn investigation prior to that first week in January because there was literally nothing there to go after Mike Flynn for. But then early in January he is told to keep it open, to investigate the Logan Act. He actually has to look up what the Logan Act is because it hasn't been used in hundreds of years. He doesn't think that it applies. That's about how private citizens are not to communicate with the foreign governments. But of course, Mike Flynn is not a private citizen. He was the incoming national security adviser who was speaking in completely appropriate ways. There is this meeting in in the Oval Office with Obama and Biden and various other people where they talk about the Logan Act. Soon thereafter, those phone calls with Ambassador Kislyak, between Mike Flynn and he, are leaked to the \"Wall Street Journal\" and to the \"Washington Post.\" That's used to ramp up the investigation again. And now we are still dealing with this Mike Flynn investigation. Next week there will be a hearing. The judge is not letting the Department of Justice stop the prosecution, even though that's their authority to do that. And so that's why we have more of these documents coming out as they are found, they have to be turned over to Flynn. They just show so much corruption and the abuse of power in this Flynn investigation, I don't see how the judge can continue the case. He seems to have a personal vendetta --",

They're hurting people every single night out there on the streets. And they had a mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio, the day after the El Paso mass shooting.",

We will have full reaction ahead. But first, let's get back to the president's rally in Newport News, Virginia. Virginia is tightening as are so many states across the country.

I want a travel ban from people that want to blow up our country. Do you think that's OK? People said, we don't like that. Took a little heat and we got it. They said I didn't get it. They were right. We lost at one court, lost at the second, then we won in the Supreme Court. They don't say that, but we have a strong travel ban. And we will use it. We do use it. We use it plenty and increased refugee admissions. They want to increase refugee admissions, 700 percent. Opening the floodgates for radical Islamic terrorism. They want to ban school choice and charter schools in a second term. I will provide school choice to every parent in America, every parent. Vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It's so true. And in conclusion, I love you people, but I've been doing this since early in the morning. I'm getting the hell out of here. I would only do this for Virginia. I've got a guy who stays in his damn basement all day long and I'm doing this. I don't know - if he wins, I'm going to be very embarrassed, I'll say, I've worked so hard and he didn't work at all. We're going to win. I think we're going to win, and I think we're going to win big. I think we're going to. I think we're going to win bigger than anyone understand. I think there's a vote out there. There's a hidden vote out there. The pollsters are fake. They're controlled by the same people, the Right. The bad stories, the fake stories. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will hire more police. Increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, ban them. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms, Virginia. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of the ridiculous horrible endless foreign wars countries that you've never even heard of. We will keep you out of them. And by the way, we have weapons, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before. We have a level of the degree of which nobody from Russia to China to North Korea, nobody has ever seen what we've built and just hope to God, we never have to use them, but we have never had anything like the arsenal that we've built over the last three years. I hope to God we never have to use them. We're the envy of the world in that way. We have the greatest people for our ability. There's nobody can do what we can do. There's nobody - but when I came in your military was totally depleted, you had old planes, you had old everything. We have now the F-35s and we have things, the bombers, the new bombers, the tankers, the ships that were building, some right here, Newport News. But we have built an arsenal the likes of which the world has never seen. And you know what that will make it a lot easier for us not to have to use them. That's really what we need. We needed it. We were in bad shape. We were in bad shape We will maintain America's unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength. And that's what we've done. We will end surprise medical building, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance. The health insurance is a disaster and we are bringing the price of health insurance way down, premiums and costs of prescription drugs. We're instituting favored nations. We pay the highest in the world for drugs. I negotiated with Big Pharma and I just got tired of negotiating. I said, I'm sorry, we're instituting favored nations.

We have over 1.1 million students and face-to-face instruction for K through 12. We have college students that are on campus. We've had big events such as NFL with fans, college football with fans. We had a NASCAR race with 30,000 people. So, we've been open. The final kind of piece to the puzzle was this capacity limitation on the restaurants at 50 percent. And so that was the announcement today, kind of brought that in for a landing. And a lot of those folks in that industry have had a really, really rough time. They've learned a lot about how to create a safe environment. I think that they'll be able to do that going forward. So, I think it'll end up being good for jobs. I think it'll end up being good for their business. And I also think, Laura, we have to have a situation where individuals can make decisions about what makes sense for them.

I am worried, though, about this. I mean, Joe Biden has said he will lockdown the country if a scientist tells them to do it. I had a great roundtable. It's on my Twitter and Facebook with three very eminent scientists yesterday talking about all these issues. Dr. Martin Caldor from Harvard Medical and Jay Bhattacharya and Michael Levitt from Stanford Medical. And I asked, should lockdowns be off the table? And they all said unequivocally, yes, lockdowns should be off the table. At best what they do is just delay infections. They do not reduce mortality, but they cause catastrophic damage. And so that should be off the table in this country going forward. We need our society to function because COVID- 19 is one health issue.

Governor DeSantis given how close it was last time around, the president has expressed his extreme concern with mail in voting, not absentee voting, which is very popular in your state, but with mail and voting. How do you think things stand now in your state, given where the polls are and given where you think the people are after this very difficult year?"
    },

      "speaker": "DESANTIS",

It's tried, true and safe. So, if people want to vote that way, they should absolutely do it. But we are not indiscriminately sending out ballots all over the state of Florida. That doesn't work. And you also have to have send in the ballot by Election Day at 7 PM. There's not going to be a situation where ballots are just showing up a week after the election. I think that that's very chaotic. Look, I think he's in good shape. It's always tough here. It's never an easy race. But if you look in 2016, he did rarely poorly in Miami-Dade County, still won the state. He's doing a lot better in Miami-Dade. He's got really strong support from Hispanics. I think he'll win Hispanics in Miami-Dade County. And if he holds the support elsewhere, I think he's definitely going to be in good shape. Biden has really not done much in Florida. We have a ground game. We're registering voters going door-to-door. Their campaign hasn't wanted to do that because of the pandemic. When Trump won in 2016, we had a 340,000 deficit with Democrats for registration. We've now shrunk that to under 190,000 thousand. That's as close as we've ever been, probably in modern history in terms of registration, I think that bodes well for us."

And so, by all that we know historically, this should be apocalyptic. But I do wonder if because of who Amy Barrett is, not just as a woman, as a mother of seven, but also that she just has a really good reputation among her friends and colleagues at Notre Dame and on the court, whether it will be more difficult for the Left to engage in the type of smear operation that they did against Kavanaugh. I think it takes a lot of courage for anybody to be willing to be nominated to the Supreme Court after what happened to Bret Kavanaugh and how people in the media and other partisans tried to destroy his life and his reputation and his family. It takes a lot of courage for someone to do this. And I think it's really remarkable to what we're about to experience here."

She's a textualist. She's consistent. Go and look at it. Secondly, she's been through this process. She handled it with amazing aplomb and grace. She has been through the process. And that's going to help her a lot this time. And third, as you mentioned, how cool is it to get a working mom on the Supreme Court and by the way, a working mom of seven kids.

Now, the only administration that has tried to derail the peaceful transition of power is Obama's. And Trump was on to them from the beginning. Back on January 3rd, 2017 in oppression tweet, he said this, the intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange. This is why they don't like Trump's tweets. Now, the media lambasted him for that, but newly released text messages between FBI officials included one from January 5th, 2017, that read Trump was right. In other words, the Intel briefing was absolutely being delayed to cook up more evidence against him. The text went on to say, still not put together. Why do we do this to ourselves? What's wrong with these people? Now, I should note that this FBI text was set the same day of that infamous White House meeting that we've previously reported on. This is the meeting where Obama and Comey discussed withholding information from incoming Trump officials. Well, so much for doing things by the book. Barack? Well, five days later, when CNN leaked that Trump had been briefed on the bogus Steele dossier, one FBI agent texted this to a colleague. We all went and purchased professional liability insurance. I wonder why? And speaking of Christopher Steele, we learned today that the primary source for his infamous dossier was a suspected Russian spy going back to 2009. More damning, however, is the fact that the FBI knew this in December of 2016 but kept spying on the Trump campaign anyway. In other words, the Democrats funded Russian disinformation, which was taken up by rogue deep state actors, one of whom was Peter Strzok. Two years ago, he gave this impassioned defense of the FBI's horrific misconduct."

Now, one would assume that this is all of supreme interest to John Durham, the U.S. attorney assigned by AG Bar, to examine the Obama FBI's handling of that Russia investigation. If an outgoing administration can do this to a candidate of an opposing party and then to a sitting president of an opposing party, and do it all with impunity, then the peaceful transition of power is the least of our concerns as a nation.

      "utterance": "Yes, so it was remarkable, because what you have here is what you think of as an honest FBI guy giving his perspective of what he saw first at the FBI as they were doing their Trump- Russia collusion probe, and then by the way, at Special Counsel Mueller's team where he reluctantly went over because he was trying to prevent what he called groupthink. And he never said that he saw anything to the Flynn case. He was so appalled. He said it was so problematic by the end that he asked to be taken off of it because he was concerned there would be an inspector general report. When he went to the Special Counsel, he said he didn't want to touch the case. He thought that there were other pieces of it that might be more valid. But in the end, he said what he saw was a team had an attitude of get Trump, and where everything was being called by the lawyers, and the attorneys were only in this in order to get some big takedown of the president, and who were looking at the average investigators as nothing more than speed bumps in their way. And he was just -- it's remarkable what he laid out in that interview. And it really confirmed a lot of the worst suspicions about how all of this worked."

      "utterance": "And Mollie, the comments today, or lack thereof, in the American media are just stunning. We'll get to one of them in a moment. But take us back to that first week of January in 2017, Mollie, and why that was so critical in ultimately unraveling this whole thing. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes, this case agent in charge had been instructed to close the Flynn investigation prior to that first week in January because there was literally nothing there to go after Mike Flynn for. But then early in January he is told to keep it open, to investigate the Logan Act. He actually has to look up what the Logan Act is because it hasn't been used in hundreds of years. He doesn't think that it applies. That's about how private citizens are not to communicate with the foreign governments. But of course, Mike Flynn is not a private citizen. He was the incoming national security adviser who was speaking in completely appropriate ways. There is this meeting in in the Oval Office with Obama and Biden and various other people where they talk about the Logan Act. Soon thereafter, those phone calls with Ambassador Kislyak, between Mike Flynn and he, are leaked to the \"Wall Street Journal\" and to the \"Washington Post.\" That's used to ramp up the investigation again. And now we are still dealing with this Mike Flynn investigation. Next week there will be a hearing. The judge is not letting the Department of Justice stop the prosecution, even though that's their authority to do that. And so that's why we have more of these documents coming out as they are found, they have to be turned over to Flynn. They just show so much corruption and the abuse of power in this Flynn investigation, I don't see how the judge can continue the case. He seems to have a personal vendetta --"

The man is the disgraced, fired, former head of the FBI who has now been shellacked three times by the inspector general in separate reports talking about his abuse of his power while in office. Talking to him as a credible source is not something the media should be doing in any way, shape, or form. But of course he's going to blow off the dossier. Look, here's the other problem that they have is that even when you go back to Michael Horowitz, the inspector general of the Department of Justice report last year, he laid out all the problems with the other, quote, evidence that they had, which was also incredibly flimsy. And this is what Durham is looking into. We're going to get a final answer from Durham as to whether or not he thought there was an adequate predicate from the probe, and then let's hear from Jim Comey then."

But the former second lady made two stops to Maine to speak on her husband's behalf. She sounded more presidential than the guy, you know the one, you know.

They have really become nothing more than shakedown artists and extortioners and gangsters. Black Lives Matter, the slogan as a principle, as a precept, the slogan is good. Black lives matter also. But the organization has contributed nothing to the well-being of the black community. Think about this -- they have been rioting and tearing up for months and have zero to show for it. When Martin Luther King peacefully protested, he had an agenda which led to policy, the Civil Rights Bill was signed. There is no agenda here. There's no policy. There's no legislation being passed by the Black Lives Matter. They are simply shaking down corporations. They extorted the NBA, they shook down the NFL, they are shaking down the corporations.

      "utterance": "Well, it's a very interesting question, Laura, because I have been investigating this for my work, and what I discovered is that Black Lives Matter actually is an umbrella organization for a number of different Black Lives Matter organizations that fall under this umbrella. So there is, for example, the Black Lives Global Network, right, which is now being run by the Tides Foundation. And if you look at the Tides Foundation, they are funded by the Open Society Foundation amongst others. And really there is a whole lot of money that's going round and round a network of these charities who are funding all of this. And it is a very good question to see what is going to happen with Black Lives Matter because their agenda, the difference between them and Antifa at the moment is actually quite interesting, because you will hear in the media and you'll hear from politicians all the time that Antifa has done no harm and never hurt anybody. It's even being written today with this news. They're saying it can't be a terrorist organization, they haven't hurt anyone. And that's a total lie. They're hurting people every single night out there on the streets. And they had a mass shooter in Dayton, Ohio, the day after the El Paso mass shooting."
