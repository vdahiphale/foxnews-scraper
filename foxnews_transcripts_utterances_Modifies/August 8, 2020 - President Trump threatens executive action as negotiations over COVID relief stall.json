The event opens today, this year is the 88th anniversary of the gathering. In normal years, it brings in upward of a half-million motorcycle enthusiast. The rally injects $800 million into South Dakota's economy. Up next, the Democratic mayor of Portland condemns protesters who tried to burn police officers alive. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 6 in Milwaukee, as an oversight board demotes Police Chief Alfonso Morales. The panel questioned how he handled multiple incidents, including ordering officers to fire tear gas and pepper spray at protesters demonstrating over George Floyd's death. FOX 10 in Phoenix, with the discovery of what authority say is the most sophisticated illicit tunnel in U.S. history. The incomplete tunnel intended for smuggling ran from San Luis, Arizona to a Mexican neighborhood. Federal officials say it had a ventilation system, water lines, electrical wiring, a rail system, and extensive reinforcement. And this is a live look at Orlando from FOX 35. One of the big stories there tonight, SpaceX successfully launches a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral early this morning.

Well, Lebanon's president says there are two possibilities behind Tuesday's deadly warehouse blast, either negligence or external intervention by a missile or a bomb. Michel Aoun, says he has requested satellite imagery from France to determine if any planes were in the area. The blast is believed to have been caused when a fire touched off 2,800 tons of ammonium nitrate. About 150 people have been killed and thousands injured. A federal appeals court has revived the effort by House Democrats to force former White House Counsel Don McGahn to appear before a congressional committee. The judges voted 7-2 that the House Judiciary Committee can pursue its claims in court, reversing the judgment of a three-judge panel that would have ended the court fight. The Justice Department, says it will continue to make its arguments before the proper panels.  Liberty University president and chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr. has agreed to take an indefinite leave of absence. The school's executive committee made the request after Falwell posted an Instagram photo, showing him posing with a young woman who is his wife's assistant, while holding a glass of dark liquid and with his pants unzipped. Falwell later deleted the post. North Carolina congressman and former Liberty University instructor Mark Falwell, says Falwell -- Mark Walker, says Falwell should resign. Portland's mayor is condemning the actions of rioters in his city, saying, some of them were trying to commit murder, and are being used as props for the Trump re-election campaign.

And going back to the point made by my colleagues here, he has a problem with enthusiasm with the African American vote. He needs black voters not to just support him but to come out for him in numbers that they did for Barack Obama. The Democrats chose him because he's Barack Obama's vice president, he could recreate the Obama coalition. African American voters, particularly younger African American voters, only 68 percent support Joe Biden, and that's 17 points behind their support for Hillary Clinton in 2016.

I think the challenge that Trump has is that he has a pretty narrow path, he has to basically replicate his path from 2016. The Biden campaign is trying to play offense in some of these other states.

There are now nearly five million coronavirus cases and 160,000 COVID-19 deaths nationwide and it'll get worse this winter. The CDC projects up to 30,000 more deaths by the end of August. The University of Washington projects nearly 300,000 American COVID-19 deaths by December 1st. Researchers say if 95 percent of the public wear masks, 66,000 lives could be saved. Meanwhile, as the debate continues over opening schools, Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis emphasize schools should not only reopen, but students' sports should be allowed too."

Michel Aoun, says he has requested satellite imagery from France to determine if any planes were in the area. The blast is believed to have been caused when a fire touched off 2,800 tons of ammonium nitrate. About 150 people have been killed and thousands injured. A federal appeals court has revived the effort by House Democrats to force former White House Counsel Don McGahn to appear before a congressional committee. The judges voted 7-2 that the House Judiciary Committee can pursue its claims in court, reversing the judgment of a three-judge panel that would have ended the court fight.

And this all relates back to the DACA case in the Supreme Court a few weeks ago where the Supreme Court basically ruled that the president of the United States has broad executive powers to enforce or not enforce laws as he sees fit, and that his successor can't undo those things easily. And so John Yoo, my colleague at the American Enterprise Institute, had a great piece in \"National Review\" where he pointing out that the president can apply that to lots of other things, including the tax code and all sorts of things. So I think what the president is going to do is he's going to use the powers the Supreme Court granted him in basically making him a king and take executive action to do a lot of things that would have been done in the legislative if the Democrats had been willing to negotiate."

I think the reality, though, is that the president can't do as much by executive action as Congress could've done if they were able to reach a deal, but it was very clear coming out of those negotiations today that the two sides remain incredibly far apart. It's almost hard to find areas where they actually were in agreement. And so it appears that everybody has basically made the decision that it's not worth going back and talking again only to keep banging their heads against the wall, and that from the White House side, the Republican side, that they see the only way forward here right now is through executive actions that could at least address some of what might've been in a final package."

I wouldn't use the word \"significant,\" but he doesn't need to gain significant amounts to make a difference, especially if it's a close race in some of these swing states where you've got urban centers like Milwaukee and Philadelphia and Detroit. Julie is exactly right. Younger African American voters are not sold on Joe Biden, and so a comment like this is extremely unhelpful. And it does open the window and opportunity for Trump to make his pitch. And again, I'm not sure how many folks he might win over, but he doesn't need to win over a lot of the African American community to make a difference in a very close race."

      "utterance": "So let's look, by the way, at the Real Clear Politics national average. We know state-by-state is very important, but this is some movement we've seen in the national averages over the last couple of weeks. Two weeks ago, Biden had an 8.7-point lead on average, then close to 7.8, the latest today is 6.4. Marc, not unusual, as we get closer to elections, we often see a narrowing. Would you read much into it if you're the Trump campaign or Biden campaign?"

    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, the race is tightening, and it's tightening really before we've taken off. We haven't had the conventions. We haven't had the debates. It was inevitable that it was going to tighten. But I think Joe Biden, his big problem is he has an enthusiasm gap with the president of the United States. Trump's base is very enthusiastic. They would walk over hot coals to go vote for Donald Trump. Joe Biden doesn't have that same enthusiasm. And going back to the point made by my colleagues here, he has a problem with enthusiasm with the African American vote. He needs black voters not to just support him but to come out for him in numbers that they did for Barack Obama. The Democrats chose him because he's Barack Obama's vice president, he could recreate the Obama coalition. African American voters, particularly younger African American voters, only 68 percent support Joe Biden, and that's 17 points behind their support for Hillary Clinton in 2016. So he has an enthusiasm gap problem overall, but he has an enthusiasm gap with the African American community."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "OK, so let's put some of the battleground states up. These again, are Real Clear Politics averages in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida, and Arizona. In all of those there is a significant lead, or in most of them outside the margin. Some of them you're closer in and within that margin of error. But in each of these situations, Julie, the former vice president had the edge, and these are critical states for either side to win."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PACE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And look, if you talk to Trump campaign officials privately, they will acknowledge that they are running from behind at this point in most of these key battleground states. You also when you talk to Biden campaign officials, they don't think that their lead is quite as big as it looks in some of these public polls right now, and everybody does expect that the race is going to tighten. I think the challenge that Trump has is that he has a pretty narrow path, he has to basically replicate his path from 2016. The Biden campaign is trying to play offense in some of these other states. One of the warnings always there when you're talking about Democrats playing in Texas or Georgia or Atlanta is that you can sometimes take your eye off the ball of some of those other states like Michigan, Wisconsin, that of course were so crucial for Donald Trump in 2016."

So let's bring back in the panel. We understand the president is going to talk about the negotiations over phase four of COVID relief. Part of that is fighting over funding for schools, and there's been a big shift in conversations about schools and kids going back. I want to play a little bit of the homeschooling conversation. We'll talk about that."

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "Certainly, I'm a fan of homeschooling, particularly if it's a choice, but it's not a choice for working class parents who can't afford to, who have to go to work. They depend on schools not just to educate their children, but to feed them, provide them health care, and take care of them during the day so they can go out and earn a living. So there was a terrific article in \"The Atlantic\" this week by an intensive care nurse, and the headline was I'm a nurse in New York. Teachers do their jobs just like I did. I think that says it all. During the pandemic, doctors and nurses showed up for work, and not just doctors and nurses -- grocery clerks, factory workers, food processors, truck drivers. Everybody showed up because their jobs are essential. Teachers are essential. Kids are the least likely to get COVID, the least likely to spread it. They need to show up and do their jobs and show us they're essential."

And you saw Governor Cuomo mention that as he announced just a couple hours ago that New York's schools are going to stay open or are allowed to have in-person teaching. It's a huge issue and it's really hitting home now as we approach the new school year."

I think it remains a question of what teachers do. There have been conversations about strikes, about deciding not to show up. And this would be the largest school district in the nation where we could see this fight play out."

I learned this week through a great story for my colleague Mark Sherman that he owns an R.V., one of the hardest to come by items in the middle about pandemic. Definitely read the story. My loser is Karen Bass, who has been really near the top of the list for Vice President Biden's running mate, but she's not as well-known nationally, and sometimes when you're not well-known, that means there's a lot of stuff in your background that starts to come out. She really took a lot of hits in the public eye this week."

He told me that he is confident that by the end of the year we will have a vaccine that is highly effective, as much as 90 percent effective. That means people either will not get sick if they take it or will get very mild disease. That would change the world and we're lucky to have him. My loser are the Senate Democrats who voted down Senator Martha McSally's bill to extend the $600 unemployment insurance subsidy while they were negotiating. They don't care about people. They care about political points."
