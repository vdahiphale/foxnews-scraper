Across the country, Americans are hitting the roads, planes and trains for the Memorial Day weekend, as we kick off the unofficial start of the summer travel season.  In case you're counting, a record 43 million of us will be making some sort of a trip. So, just how jammed will those roads and airports be? We thought we'd help you out before you get out.  Welcome, everyone. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\"  And we are all over it, no matter where you're going, with FBN's Jackie DeAngelis on the big getaway, Jeff Flock in Chicago on the big traffic headaches, and meteorologist Rick Reichmuth on some big storms that could be on the way. We begin with Jackie in New York City on how this big travel day and weekend is shaping up -- Jackie.",

      "sentences": "Good afternoon to you, Neil. That's right. AAA is the authority on this. And they are saying that nearly 43 million people, as you said, are going to travel in some way for the long holiday weekend. So, the big question is, how are they going to do it?  Well, 37.6 million of them are going to hit the road. And that is up about 3.5 percent from last year. AAA says watch out what time you're going to travel, because peak times are going to be difficult. So try to go off- peak, if you can.   Three-and-a-quarter million people, they're going to hit this skies. That is up almost 5 percent from last year. And bus, train, ships, almost two million passengers, up about 4 percent. I'm guessing a few of these folks are going to attend a barbecue, maybe they're going to host a barbecue. If they are, they're going to have to brace for rising food prices. Let's go through that, because hamburgers are up a little more than 1 percent. If you're serving hot dogs, a little bit less than 5 percent of an increase from last year. The buns, you're going to get a break there, three-tenths of a percent of an increase. Chicken prices are actually down. That might be your best met. And if you're planning to use lettuce in your meal, look for a whopping 34 percent increase on lettuce prices.   Now, the hot dog prices are up because of the African swine flu epidemic. That's got pork prices going up. And that sharp increase in lettuce is actually due to the E. coli outbreak last year that we saw with romaine. So, iceberg shot up. And this is sort of the residual leftover impact of that, Neil.",

As you report, about 37 million people on the roads of that 43 million total, that is an increase of about 4 percent compared to last year, and the second busiest day on the roads, Memorial Day weekend, since 2005. National gas prices, though, kind of cooperating. We have had a run-up, as you know, most recently for it -- I think it's -- what is the number, $2.88, I think, right now. We were $2.23, as low as $2.23, as recently as January. That was the lows, but up about 30 percent since then.  But if you look at the one-year -- and that's going to give you a little more cheer -- if you look at the one-year, you see that, one year ago, Memorial Day weekend, we were actually cheaper than we are right now. So that's a positive.  As I said, as we started, the guys at AAA said 3:00 local time, which it is right here in the Midwest right now on Interstate 294. It's going to start getting crowded. In fact, it is. According to AAA, today, the worst places to drive at this hour, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles. I leave you on a positive note, which is, Neil, if it wasn't for this booming economy, everybody with jobs and money in their pocket, by golly, we wouldn't have such a crowded road, would we? There's your positive.",

Three different areas that we're watching for tornadoes today, one across Illinois, another one down here from Kansas down across parts of West Texas.  One tornado warning right now outside of that watch box just north of the Big Bend. We have had a lot of tornadoes over the last week. And, in fact, some of those tornadoes have caused major problems, obviously, that we have seen those problems. But you get an idea of exactly where that is from parts of West Texas, then a lot of wind reports here across parts of the Great Lakes, and then another tornado yesterday across areas just to the north of D.C.  That exact pattern is not going to change. This high pressure is really strong, and it's not letting anything kind of budge out of here. It's also keeping things really hot across the Southeast. Feels like mid-July, and it has for days. It's going to continue all weekend long, unfortunately.  Then, back behind this, that kind of storm track just continues to bring round and round of rain there with the severe weather. And that goes all the way through Monday and into Tuesday. Today, we have this severe threat, everywhere you see that yellow. Tomorrow, even a bigger chance. This is tonight's tornado threat, I should say, and then, tomorrow, a bigger chance of severe weather, especially across the West, Western Kansas, and back again across the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma.  Along with that severe weather, we continue to get the rain. This picture here, especially across Arkansas -- excuse me -- Oklahoma, and Kansas, and Missouri has been incredible, these rainfall totals. That's why we have seen all of those flooding pictures. But take a look at how extensive this is. We still have flooding going on across rivers way up to the North and across the Dakotas and Minnesota. All that water has to funnel down in towards the Mississippi eventually that we saw crest about a month ago. We're seeing more crests of that again, and kind of top five to top two range.   And then take a look at this, through Monday, more rain, the exact same spot throughout the much better part of the next week. More here across the South again. So we have a major problem for our farmers, Neil. I'm very concerned about this with the planting season and the fields being so wet, and then obviously the flooding that's going on, causing major problems for so many folks.",

And I think it's going to keep Pelosi kind of elevated in this criticism of the president and making these remarks about him being -- engaging in a cover-up and perhaps covering up a crime. I just don't see it going away. She's under a lot of pressure to put forward that message. And I think that that's not going to end. And that's probably -- more than what happened last week, that's probably why things are not going to get resolved between her and the president anytime soon.",

I want to help him out because we have mutual interests here that could benefit Democrats, as well as Republicans.

When we look back in time and in history, they were able to actually do that and have these arguments in backrooms, and it was kind of more of a gentleman's game than it is today. It's unfortunate, but it's the world that we live in. And I think Susan to -- is correct. Both bases are as divided as Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump are. I mean, if you look at Trump's base, they sent him to Washington, D.C., to deliver on promises, like economic growth, on border security, and not let liberals push him around.

Let me tell you what he said about it on Twitter, Neil, not terribly long ago, the president talking about this new trip to Japan. By the way, he will go back there just about a month from now. He said: \"Departed the White House, am now on Air Force One with the first lady heading to Japan and looking forward to honoring on behalf of the U.S. His Majesty, the emperor of Japan. We will also be discussing trade and military with my friend Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\" Also a bit of golf in for the two leaders in the offing. Now, before leaving for Tokyo, Mr. Trump was eager to talk about his decision to declassify material related to the Russia probe, tasking the A.G., Bill Barr, with the job of doling out to the public that which he sees fit. Now, you no doubt saw the memo late last night, Neil. It said, among other things, from Sarah Sanders: \"Today's action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred and the actions that were taken during the last presidential election.\" That, of course, in line with what the president has been saying for quite some time. He's called it a hoax. And we will find out why as we look at all that material which will be coming out, Neil, in the days, months, and weeks ahead -- in the meantime, back to you.

In case you're counting, a record 43 million of us will be making some sort of a trip. So, just how jammed will those roads and airports be? We thought we'd help you out before you get out. Welcome, everyone. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World.\" And we are all over it, no matter where you're going, with FBN's Jackie DeAngelis on the big getaway, Jeff Flock in Chicago on the big traffic headaches, and meteorologist Rick Reichmuth on some big storms that could be on the way.

      "utterance": "Good afternoon to you, Neil. That's right. AAA is the authority on this. And they are saying that nearly 43 million people, as you said, are going to travel in some way for the long holiday weekend. So, the big question is, how are they going to do it? Well, 37.6 million of them are going to hit the road. And that is up about 3.5 percent from last year. AAA says watch out what time you're going to travel, because peak times are going to be difficult. So try to go off- peak, if you can. Three-and-a-quarter million people, they're going to hit this skies. That is up almost 5 percent from last year. And bus, train, ships, almost two million passengers, up about 4 percent. I'm guessing a few of these folks are going to attend a barbecue, maybe they're going to host a barbecue. If they are, they're going to have to brace for rising food prices. Let's go through that, because hamburgers are up a little more than 1 percent. If you're serving hot dogs, a little bit less than 5 percent of an increase from last year. The buns, you're going to get a break there, three-tenths of a percent of an increase. Chicken prices are actually down. That might be your best met. And if you're planning to use lettuce in your meal, look for a whopping 34 percent increase on lettuce prices. Now, the hot dog prices are up because of the African swine flu epidemic. That's got pork prices going up. And that sharp increase in lettuce is actually due to the E. coli outbreak last year that we saw with romaine. So, iceberg shot up. And this is sort of the residual leftover impact of that, Neil."

As you report, about 37 million people on the roads of that 43 million total, that is an increase of about 4 percent compared to last year, and the second busiest day on the roads, Memorial Day weekend, since 2005. National gas prices, though, kind of cooperating. We have had a run-up, as you know, most recently for it -- I think it's -- what is the number, $2.88, I think, right now. We were $2.23, as low as $2.23, as recently as January. That was the lows, but up about 30 percent since then. But if you look at the one-year -- and that's going to give you a little more cheer -- if you look at the one-year, you see that, one year ago, Memorial Day weekend, we were actually cheaper than we are right now. So that's a positive. As I said, as we started, the guys at AAA said 3:00 local time, which it is right here in the Midwest right now on Interstate 294. It's going to start getting crowded. In fact, it is. According to AAA, today, the worst places to drive at this hour, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles. I leave you on a positive note, which is, Neil, if it wasn't for this booming economy, everybody with jobs and money in their pocket, by golly, we wouldn't have such a crowded road, would we? There's your positive."

      "utterance": "Oh, I don't like it. All right, but it's pretty cool. Here you go, big storms again today and tomorrow, Sunday, Monday. We still continue to have it. Three different areas that we're watching for tornadoes today, one across Illinois, another one down here from Kansas down across parts of West Texas. One tornado warning right now outside of that watch box just north of the Big Bend. We have had a lot of tornadoes over the last week. And, in fact, some of those tornadoes have caused major problems, obviously, that we have seen those problems. But you get an idea of exactly where that is from parts of West Texas, then a lot of wind reports here across parts of the Great Lakes, and then another tornado yesterday across areas just to the north of D.C. That exact pattern is not going to change. This high pressure is really strong, and it's not letting anything kind of budge out of here. It's also keeping things really hot across the Southeast. Feels like mid-July, and it has for days. It's going to continue all weekend long, unfortunately. Then, back behind this, that kind of storm track just continues to bring round and round of rain there with the severe weather. And that goes all the way through Monday and into Tuesday. Today, we have this severe threat, everywhere you see that yellow. Tomorrow, even a bigger chance. This is tonight's tornado threat, I should say, and then, tomorrow, a bigger chance of severe weather, especially across the West, Western Kansas, and back again across the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. Along with that severe weather, we continue to get the rain. This picture here, especially across Arkansas -- excuse me -- Oklahoma, and Kansas, and Missouri has been incredible, these rainfall totals. That's why we have seen all of those flooding pictures. But take a look at how extensive this is. We still have flooding going on across rivers way up to the North and across the Dakotas and Minnesota. All that water has to funnel down in towards the Mississippi eventually that we saw crest about a month ago. We're seeing more crests of that again, and kind of top five to top two range. And then take a look at this, through Monday, more rain, the exact same spot throughout the much better part of the next week. More here across the South again. So we have a major problem for our farmers, Neil. I'm very concerned about this with the planting season and the fields being so wet, and then obviously the flooding that's going on, causing major problems for so many folks."

It's always been a problem, especially when it's under different control, right, I mean, the White House under one, and the House, let's say in this case, under another. But there was a time when at least they were able to let bygones be bygones and try to get things done. I know it's a lot easier said than done these days. Democratic strategist Nathan Rubin. We got Republican strategist Ash Wright and The Washington Examiner's Susan Ferrechio. Susan, people may hearken come back to Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill, started out as a bit of an acrimonious relationship. A couple of years in, they were pals trying to deal with each other. Maybe the same will happen here between the president and Nancy Pelosi, but there's been a lot of scorched earth. How do you un-scorch that?"

And that's Democrats are going to keep pushing for these investigations, the subpoenas, court fights over Trump's tax records and financial documents. And it's going to lead to more calls for impeachment. And I think it's going to keep Pelosi kind of elevated in this criticism of the president and making these remarks about him being -- engaging in a cover-up and perhaps covering up a crime. I just don't see it going away. She's under a lot of pressure to put forward that message. And I think that that's not going to end. And that's probably -- more than what happened last week, that's probably why things are not going to get resolved between her and the president anytime soon."

But they learned to find common ground and work with each other. But there was a sense Ronald Reagan had, I want to - - he was getting a lot of his way. But he would always advise his people, don't shove it in the other guy's face. And it can be the same of the part of the speaker. I want to help him out because we have mutual interests here that could benefit Democrats, as well as Republicans. He was particularly that way when Democrats picked up a lot of seats in the midterm election of Ronald Reagan's first term. So he figured out, look, I have got to got to do something, so that we can both be productive here. Do you sense any of that happening now?"

And one of the things that's mainly different is, they're having this fight, these personal arguments in front of the entire country and in front of the entire world. When we look back in time and in history, they were able to actually do that and have these arguments in backrooms, and it was kind of more of a gentleman's game than it is today. It's unfortunate, but it's the world that we live in. And I think Susan to -- is correct. Both bases are as divided as Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump are. I mean, if you look at Trump's base, they sent him to Washington, D.C., to deliver on promises, like economic growth, on border security, and not let liberals push him around. And he's doing that exact same thing. And Nancy's base is asking the exact same thing from her against the president. And then so that's where we're at today. I don't see any end to it, unfortunately, anytime soon."

But, Nathan, Nancy Pelosi came out of that meeting with Democrats different. I don't how to -- whether chastened or reminded that many of them, many more than maybe she suspected, want the president impeached, and maybe that is where she got the thought about him covering things up. But saying that, and knowing full well you have a meeting with the president hours later, she had to recognize that would change the tone.

And that is, when they get in at the end of July, straight into the holiday, the summer holidays, and then straight into the party conference season. So it's not until October that Parliament's really sitting seriously again. And at the 31st of October, England leaves by default, because Article 50 clicks in, and we're out. And so the new prime minister has a wonderful way, if he can't manage to get the House together to sort the thing out, of just letting things lie, play the ball into the long grass, and wait until the end of play, which will be the 31st of October.

If you look at the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, logging their third straight weeks of losses, longest since December '18, so a little closer, if you like, then the Dow's performance. Now, the tone on Friday turned a little more positive. President Trump saying the ongoing trade war could be over quickly, but the week's pattern shows that investors long term are worried about the U.S.-China trade were hurting economic growth. So, tech, the largest sector, as we know, by weight on the S&P 500, it 2.5 percent during the past five days, one of the worst-performing sectors for this week. Chip stocks really under pressure. Qualcomm, Broadcom, they were among the worst performers. Apple also down this week 5 percent, several analysts raising concern over the company's exposure to China. Worries about the U.S.-China trade war, its length, its consequences hitting the retail sector as well this week, Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, Kohl's, Macy's, it's a long list, others as well, saying that the tariffs have forced them to either alter their financial outlooks, remodel their supply chains, and ones which, by the way, were pretty well thought out, or consider raising prices for consumers.

I mean, we have an internal government agency investigating a political opponent.

One of the things that has come up, though, Andrew, in this whole pursuit is, what do we find out if this was more than a report based on a now disputed and pretty much trashed dossier, that there might have been other stuff that we didn't know?

But it appeared to me that she was asking whether we were going to eliminate the prohibitions against discrimination against the LGBTQ community. And we would never do that. I wonder what she would say if she knew how much I have had to resist people who wanted the rule taken down altogether."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "The rule is to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ. And, of course, we would never take that down, or I wouldn't, not during the time that I'm here, even though there is a lot of pressure to do so. I think we have to be fair to everybody. But being fair to everybody means exactly that. It doesn't mean that you take one group and let their rights supersede other groups. So, we try to be extraordinarily fair. And that's why we're opening things up to public comment. We're looking at having a forum at HUD where we invite the various stakeholders in, LGBTQ community, as well as shelter providers, as well as people who take advantage of the shelters and a whole group of others. And I want all of them to be able to express to each other what their concerns are, before we make any definitive rule alterations."

At one point in this hearing, the word Oreo, which when I believe one of the congresspeople questioning was saying it was the acronym REO, REO, which stands for Real Estate Owned. And you said you just misheard her."

      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "I think we have reached a very sad point in our country, where a hearing that is supposed to be about what the policies are becomes just attack, attack, attack, not really being very interested in what the answers are. And I hope we can move beyond that and really deal with the issues. As far as REO, is concerned, REO, it used to be a very common thing. We used to have over 65,000 properties 10 years ago. We're down to 6,500. I can honestly say no one has ever used that term since I have been at HUD. But I know what they are just from having grown up in Detroit. And there were a lot of properties."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, let me get your -- when you took on this job, there was a sentiment -- obviously, you're a world-renowned surgeon, people who don't know your past, and impeccable credentials. You have done unprecedented surgeries, separating conjoined twins that have put you in the history books. And when your basic intelligence is being questioned, at some level, that's got to tick you off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it probably would. But, for me, it's really not about me. It's about what we're called to do. I want to change this agency from one that just harbors people to one that puts people on a trajectory to success, recognizing that our people are our most valuable resource. And if we don't develop them appropriately, we will not be able to compete in the world in the future. So I know that I'm going to be attacked a lot just because I'm in this administration and I'm with Trump. And I know people won't look back over your life and the things that you have done. They just want to destroy. But that's OK. I expected that. I fully expected that, knew that was coming. I probably should be a little more prepared in these hearings for just hostility and attacks. My general modus operandi is, you be nice and respectful to them, they will be nice and respectful to you. That obviously doesn't work in this particular setting. Maybe some adjustments need to be made. But we will always continue to try to do what is right for the people."
