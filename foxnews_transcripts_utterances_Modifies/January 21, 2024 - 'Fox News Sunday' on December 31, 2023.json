      "sentences": "Well, I think on New Year's Day, a good place to start is let's look at what folks were saying last New Year's, at the beginning of this year. You had most financial outlets and many economists assuring us that a recession was inevitable and that the unemployment rate would have to rise many points in order to get inflation down. Go back to year and a half and the price of gas was north of $5 a gallon. Today, as I sit and talk to you on New Year's Eve day, there is no recession. Unemployment has been below 4 percent for 22 months in a row. Price of gas this morning was $3.11 on average across the nation and below $3 a gallon in 28 states. Now, this combination of lowering inflation and inflation is on a solid glide path back to its pre-re -- pre-pandemic rate, this combination of tight labor market and easing prices has led to real wage gains. On a yearly basis, wages for midlevel workers have been beating prices for nine months in a row. That's a trend, Mike, not a blip. Now, you reasonably ask, why isn't that reaching more Americans? Well, if we look at our two most closely watched measures of consumer sentiment, consumer confidence, they both rose big time in December. One was up 10 percent, the other a whopping 14 percent. That's one month. That's not yet a trend, but it's certainly suggestive that the measures that this president is taking to help provide support and relief to families like the one he grew up in are working and people are starting to feel it.",

      "speaker": "BERNSTEIN",
      "sentences": "Well, people have been through a lot over the past few years -- a 100-year pandemic, a global supply chain snarl up that led to global inflation. We've seen geopolitical conflicts and so on. And so, I think some of that is definitely in the mix. But I think you have to look, yes, at what people say. And I pay a lot of attention to that. They're the best arbiters of their views of the economy. But I think we also have to look at what people do. Now, if you look at just the last couple months from November 1st to Christmas Eve, we saw spending at restaurants go up 8 percent. That's less than two months. We saw spending on online sales go up 6 percent. Overall retail spending up 3 percent in just a couple of months. This has been a very strong Christmas season. Look at entrepreneurship, we've seen huge gains in folks starting businesses, especially, by the way, people of color. I don't think you start businesses at this rate unless you have some optimism, some confidence about where we're going. So, if you actually look at trend in economy, the strength of consumer spending, real wage gains for nine months in a row year over year for mid- level workers, I think you see some real momentum getting us in a good -- a good start for the New Year.",

In fact, for people in communities of color, we've seen record numbers of increase in wealth. And that's one of the reasons why household balance sheets have actually been in very good shape this time of year. Now, some of what you're calling ballooning is really a return to kind of normal levels of credit card delinquencies or debt levels. But if you actually look how much it costs people to service their debts, even as interest rates have gone up, they're in quite good shape. And, in fact, if you look at after tax or disposable income, that's up 3.7 percent over the past year and that's one of the tailwinds that's helping to support consumer spending. Now, remember, we're an economy that's 70 percent consumer spending. So, with the strong tailwind of this job market behind consumers, with easing inflation coming back to where it was pre-pandemic, with actual lower prices -- in eggs, TVs, toys, airfare, used cars, that's starting to really make a difference to families. And as I said, some of that is showing up in our consumer confidence measures, especially we saw that this month.",

And I think it's very important here to look at contrast between who this president is fighting for and who those on the other side of the aisle appear to be fighting for. It looks to us like their economic agenda going into '24 is to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires, to repeal this president's legislative measures to lower the cost of insulin, to lower the cost of prescription drugs, to lower the cost of clean energy and health coverage, and to defund the IRS so millionaires and billionaires can continue to do -- to evade hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes.",

Now, look, he has a proposal -- I'm talking about our last budget now -- he has a proposal to reduce the deficit by $2.5 trillion over 10 years. Now, we can't do that ourselves. We need Congress to work with us. How do we do that? By returning some fairness to the tax code. Nobody under $400,000 would pay a dime more in taxes. But those at the very top, many of whom I just suggested have been evading hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes, we know Republicans are trying to actually cut back the IRS funding that would help to reduce that tax evasion and close that tax gap. Our idea is to lower the costs. It's not just -- it's not just high end tax increases, it's to lower the cost of healthcare spending, of prescription drugs, of the cost of insulin, of healthcare coverage -- again, measures that look to us like opposition wants to com -- wants to repeal. So that's going the wrong way. That both raises the budget deficit -- we saw that this year in some of their proposals -- that raises the budget deficit. It raises cost for middle class families. It raises costs for seniors. That's not what you'll see in our budget.",

The numbers are still low, but again, if you look at some of the real world, you know, experiences that we have everyday at the gas pump or buying eggs and bread, you start to see these prices going down and Americans have reason to think, oh, things are getting better. And other part of the conversation is, Julia touched on it, you know, pre- pandemic, people understand, we went through something horrible and had damage done.

DAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): 2024, a year marked by an intense presidential campaign and one filled with trips to the courtroom if your name is Hunter Biden or Donald Trump. The former president facing four state and federal prosecution with possible trials smack dab in the middle of the election year. Trump is taking his fights to a federal appeal court on January 9th, hoping the judges will throw out charges relating to his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election. His attorneys argue, \"President Trump has absolute immunity from prosecution for his official acts as president. The indictment alleged only official acts, so it must be dismissed.\" The filing comes a day after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to fast track the case, a temporary blow for special counsel Jack Smith, who wants to take Trump to trial on March 4th, one day before Super Tuesday. That date is expected to slide.",

You have people testifying that this business would not have existed without Joe Biden. You also have people saying that he was intimately involved, and you also now have receipts showing that some money from this business did make it to the Biden family. More troubling, I think, is this other issue, which is that every step of the way, when officials started looking into Biden family business, they were obstructed and shut down. And even quite recently you had President Biden admitted that he knew that Hunter Biden planned to obstruct Congress in their investigation of this Biden family business where foreign oligarchs give a lot of money to the Biden family in exchange for access to Joe Biden. And he says that he knew that he -- the White House said that they - that Joe Biden knew Hunter Biden planned to obstruct Congress and that didn't do anything to - to encourage him to follow the law and testify in front of Congress.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERNSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think on New Year's Day, a good place to start is let's look at what folks were saying last New Year's, at the beginning of this year. You had most financial outlets and many economists assuring us that a recession was inevitable and that the unemployment rate would have to rise many points in order to get inflation down. Go back to year and a half and the price of gas was north of $5 a gallon. Today, as I sit and talk to you on New Year's Eve day, there is no recession. Unemployment has been below 4 percent for 22 months in a row. Price of gas this morning was $3.11 on average across the nation and below $3 a gallon in 28 states. Now, this combination of lowering inflation and inflation is on a solid glide path back to its pre-re -- pre-pandemic rate, this combination of tight labor market and easing prices has led to real wage gains. On a yearly basis, wages for midlevel workers have been beating prices for nine months in a row. That's a trend, Mike, not a blip. Now, you reasonably ask, why isn't that reaching more Americans? Well, if we look at our two most closely watched measures of consumer sentiment, consumer confidence, they both rose big time in December. One was up 10 percent, the other a whopping 14 percent. That's one month. That's not yet a trend, but it's certainly suggestive that the measures that this president is taking to help provide support and relief to families like the one he grew up in are working and people are starting to feel it."

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "More from the FOX poll, only 14 percent say they've been helped by President Biden's economic policies, 46 percent say they've been hurt. That helped number has dipped from December '21 and December '22. Why do you think Main Street may be so upset?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERNSTEIN",
      "utterance": "Well, people have been through a lot over the past few years -- a 100-year pandemic, a global supply chain snarl up that led to global inflation. We've seen geopolitical conflicts and so on. And so, I think some of that is definitely in the mix. But I think you have to look, yes, at what people say. And I pay a lot of attention to that. They're the best arbiters of their views of the economy. But I think we also have to look at what people do. Now, if you look at just the last couple months from November 1st to Christmas Eve, we saw spending at restaurants go up 8 percent. That's less than two months. We saw spending on online sales go up 6 percent. Overall retail spending up 3 percent in just a couple of months. This has been a very strong Christmas season. Look at entrepreneurship, we've seen huge gains in folks starting businesses, especially, by the way, people of color. I don't think you start businesses at this rate unless you have some optimism, some confidence about where we're going. So, if you actually look at trend in economy, the strength of consumer spending, real wage gains for nine months in a row year over year for mid- level workers, I think you see some real momentum getting us in a good -- a good start for the New Year."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERNSTEIN",
      "utterance": "It's obviously something we want to look at, but one of the things we've seen that's been very important is an increase in the net worth or the wealth of not just folks at top of the scale, but middle and lower income people, as well. In fact, for people in communities of color, we've seen record numbers of increase in wealth. And that's one of the reasons why household balance sheets have actually been in very good shape this time of year. Now, some of what you're calling ballooning is really a return to kind of normal levels of credit card delinquencies or debt levels. But if you actually look how much it costs people to service their debts, even as interest rates have gone up, they're in quite good shape. And, in fact, if you look at after tax or disposable income, that's up 3.7 percent over the past year and that's one of the tailwinds that's helping to support consumer spending. Now, remember, we're an economy that's 70 percent consumer spending. So, with the strong tailwind of this job market behind consumers, with easing inflation coming back to where it was pre-pandemic, with actual lower prices -- in eggs, TVs, toys, airfare, used cars, that's starting to really make a difference to families. And as I said, some of that is showing up in our consumer confidence measures, especially we saw that this month."

Lowering the cost of insulin, make sure that the measures that this president legislated to keep down the price of prescription drugs, of healthcare coverage, to continue fighting against junk fees, whether they're at concert events, airfares, banks, hotels, to continue to build on this progress we've made, and not just lower inflation but actual lower cost in key areas of consumer spending. And I think it's very important here to look at contrast between who this president is fighting for and who those on the other side of the aisle appear to be fighting for. It looks to us like their economic agenda going into '24 is to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires, to repeal this president's legislative measures to lower the cost of insulin, to lower the cost of prescription drugs, to lower the cost of clean energy and health coverage, and to defund the IRS so millionaires and billionaires can continue to do -- to evade hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes."

And that budget will show continued deficit reduction under this president. Now, look, he has a proposal -- I'm talking about our last budget now -- he has a proposal to reduce the deficit by $2.5 trillion over 10 years. Now, we can't do that ourselves. We need Congress to work with us. How do we do that? By returning some fairness to the tax code. Nobody under $400,000 would pay a dime more in taxes. But those at the very top, many of whom I just suggested have been evading hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes, we know Republicans are trying to actually cut back the IRS funding that would help to reduce that tax evasion and close that tax gap. Our idea is to lower the costs. It's not just -- it's not just high end tax increases, it's to lower the cost of healthcare spending, of prescription drugs, of the cost of insulin, of healthcare coverage -- again, measures that look to us like opposition wants to com -- wants to repeal. So that's going the wrong way. That both raises the budget deficit -- we saw that this year in some of their proposals -- that raises the budget deficit. It raises cost for middle class families. It raises costs for seniors. That's not what you'll see in our budget."

And so, despite what they may be saying publicly, I think, there is concern in the West Wing and in the campaign in Delaware about how do we make Americans realize that the Biden economy is actually pretty strong. Americans just don't see it that way."

      "utterance": "I think they make them very vulnerable. Obviously, the economy is one of the top priorities. Voters tend to vote on it. If this is Trump versus Biden match up and polling won't seem to suggest that, Trump can easily look back on his pre- pandemic economic numbers and point to low inflation and low unemployment throughout that. So, that makes Biden vulnerable. Now, I think you're going to see the Biden campaign point to maybe Trump's economy during the pandemic, I think end of the day, it's still a bad issue for President Biden."

And in the poll numbers hat we've just gone over this morning, you know, poll numbers from FOX, good news for Biden, if you will, is it's headed in the right direction. In other words, people feel better about 2023 than they did about 2022 and way better than they did about 2020. The numbers are still low, but again, if you look at some of the real world, you know, experiences that we have everyday at the gas pump or buying eggs and bread, you start to see these prices going down and Americans have reason to think, oh, things are getting better. And other part of the conversation is, Julia touched on it, you know, pre- pandemic, people understand, we went through something horrible and had damage done. So, Biden has something to work with here, all numbers that Jared Bernstein went through this morning, I think what you hear on the campaign trail. And he's right, consumer confidence, consumer sentiment is up, holiday spending is up and he's going to talk not just about the economy, he's also going to talk about chaos on Capitol Hill in the last year and he's going to talk about a lot of issues regarding Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "Yeah, it's interesting. The Biden administration is extremely rosy when they talk about the economy. They seem to think everything is going incredibly well, it sounds like for Jared Bernstein, things are going well for him personally. The problem for the Biden administration, is that the American people do not share that rosy outlook. You know, by two to one margin, they think the economy is going to get worse. And hearing the Biden administration talk about how great the economy is and that prices are going down, I think it makes a lot of people feel that the Biden administration just has no relationship to reality or no understanding what it's like to go to the grocery store, put the same items in your cart and have the price skyrocket. This is a problem for American voters and they want to feel like someone actually understands how difficult it is or how difficult it is to sell or buy a house, what the mortgage rates are like. I mean, these are real issues and they're not getting a feeling from the Biden administration, I don't think, that they understand how difficult the economy is for the average American."

It's the pull factor. If we don't address that by addressing detention, giving them the quick hearing, and then deporting -- most of them are going to be deported because asylum cases, if you look at the last 25 years, 87 percent are going to be rejected.

It's time to deport those that illegally come into the United States.

That's my concern is the training part of it. But I join them in the frustration.

Right now, we're talking about New York City, and Chicago, but next year, we're going to be talking about Denver and L.A. and Philadelphia.

According to the Trump campaign, quote, \"we are witnessing, in real-time, the attempted theft of an election and the disenfranchisement of the American voter. There are currently 13 states with lawsuits seeking to bar Trump from the GOP primary ballot. They all lean on a Civil War era provision in the U.S. Constitution that bans a person engaged in insurrection from holding public office. An appeal by Colorado's Republican Party leaves interpreting the 155-year-old clause up to the U.S. Supreme Court. For now, Trump's name will appear on Colorado primary ballot unless the high court sides with Colorado's earlier decision to kick him off."

There's a general Democrat strategy to bring criminal or civil charges against the president, try to steal his family business, try to remove his name from the ballot. And this is viewed by a lot of Americans as just completely unfair and antidemocratic. In the United States, when we complain about other countries not practicing free and fair election, usually that means that they have removed the opposition party from the ballot or they've tried to imprison opposition party members. But the idea that Americans won't be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, that does not reflect well on the Democrat Party."

I mean she has the power, as the secretary of state, and she looked at the law and said that without a doubt an insurrection took place in this country on January 6, 2021, there was violence at the Capitol and she saw Donald Trump as having a key role in the insurrection and, therefore, said that he can't run on the Maine ballot. There was a similar finding in Colorado. So, the problem for Republicans is, they say, oh, this is a matter of politics. This is like, you know, some third world country. They're pushing your political opponents off the ballot. But in reality, I can't think of another country where a political leader would try to overthrow the government and then come back and say, I'm running for president.

      "utterance": "Well, I think, you know, that's certainly something that his critics and perhaps even his supporters think he's doing. It's - it's part of the strategy. And I was just counting up in my head the number of elections that I've covered. I think this is number five. 2024 is just going to be so unprecedented because of the dual action of the campaign, the primaries, the general election, once we get there, and these legal battles. It's -- it will underpin the entire - the entire race. And just going back a little bit to the debate on the other side of the table, one thing I think we can, I think, all agree on, and this is related to both the legal cases and the politics, is January 6th is big part of the 2024 election. Regardless of what side you're on about what happened that day, this election is not just going to be about the economy, it's not just going to be about Israel and foreign policy, it's going to be about what happened at the end of former President Trump's term in office."

And I think it reinforces his own message that he is a victim of a legal and political establishment in this country. Now, in terms of how it impacts the general election if he's the nominee, that has yet to be seen. I'm curious to see if voters look at that and say, oh, this is more noise from inside of Washington or if there's something serious here. But it is an interesting juxtaposition when you have Trump going through the - his own legal issues, and then the sitting president's son going through other legal issues. I'm curious to see whether voters, at the end of the day, think it's noise or something to look into."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, you know, Hunter Biden is the president's son. He's not the president. And, clearly, he's a very troubled person, you know, even to the point of addiction and trouble that you can see online if you have a lurid interest. But, you know, it seems to me, so far, I'm open to see what's going on. If he's a tax cheat, go get him, I say. And, you know, I say that from either side of the political aisle. But when you look at what they are say - suggesting is the basis for impeaching the president of the United States, I think the Republicans so far, you know, are looking for smoke because they believe there's a fire. But so far they don't even have smoke. They don't have anything. And I think, in large part, it looks like they are acting as if they are political extensions of the Trump campaign and trying to create an equivalence between what is going on with all the legal troubles that afflict President Trump, Rudy Giuliani being found guilty, $140 million, I believe, Sydney Powell, Jenna Ellis, all of that on the Trump side, and saying, oh that's - that's similar to what's going on with the Democrats. But so far there is no evidence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "So, I think the problem for President Biden, he actually has two major problems dealing with this impeachment. One is the Biden family business. The Biden family business traded on the name of Joe Biden, the president, for -- and they got a lot of money from foreign oligarchs and foreign entities. You have people testifying that this business would not have existed without Joe Biden. You also have people saying that he was intimately involved, and you also now have receipts showing that some money from this business did make it to the Biden family. More troubling, I think, is this other issue, which is that every step of the way, when officials started looking into Biden family business, they were obstructed and shut down. And even quite recently you had President Biden admitted that he knew that Hunter Biden planned to obstruct Congress in their investigation of this Biden family business where foreign oligarchs give a lot of money to the Biden family in exchange for access to Joe Biden. And he says that he knew that he -- the White House said that they - that Joe Biden knew Hunter Biden planned to obstruct Congress and that didn't do anything to - to encourage him to follow the law and testify in front of Congress. So, when you look at recent impeachments, like President Trump's, President Bill Clinton's, this one is actually much more serious than either of those impeachments."

That being said, though, I really have my eye on New Hampshire. I know we're talking about Iowa because it's first, but New Hampshire is so interesting to me because you have Trump and then Haley in second place. \"The Hill's\" decision desk average shows Haley about 17 points behind Trump. Now, that's still a lot, but you have Christie at 10 percent. So if Christie were to drop out, he's given no indication he will, that would bump Haley much closer to Trump. Now, before the - sort of the drama and the fallout from her comments about slavery and the Civil War, I think we were talking a lot - a lot about that possibility. But Christie sort of dug into that. So, he's given no indication he's dropping out. So, I think we're going towards a race for second place. But New Hampshire, I think, is one to watch."

We certainly saw them wrong in 2016 and there could be some voters who aren't saying what they're going to do or haven't decided. But the polling largely -- the difference between these candidates is so huge. It's - it's pretty hard to imagine that it's not a Trump v Biden 2024 race."

So, even if Ron DeSantis, you know, pulled out a miracle and got pretty close in Iowa, and if Nikki Haley wins in New Hampshire, it still doesn't really change the contour of the race that much. The American voter, the Republican Party voter, very much seems to have already committed to President Trump. He's essentially getting to run as an incumbent.
