      "utterance": "Hello, and welcome to Justice. I'm Judge Jeanine Pirro. Thanks so much for being with us tonight. And thanks for keeping our streak going and making last week's show number one all weekend long, all day Saturday, Saturday night, Sunday, Sunday night. I am so grateful. Thank you to all my viewers. Tonight, we've got House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, dan Bongino, and Congressman Matt Gaetz, former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik and more. And later, I take you inside the New York White House, aka Trump Tower, for an exclusive sit down with Eric and Laura Trump and the first ever exclusive look on television at newborn daughter Carolina Trump. But first, my open. It was everything we said it was and everything they said it was not. We now have confirmation, corroboration that the deep state exists, that it worked to spy on and frame a presidential candidate and plant the seed for his overthrow in the ugliest, most corrupt attempted political coup in U.S. history. That it occurred at all is stunning. But that it wasn't manipulated to take down a president and remove him from office almost as soon as we put him there, essentially overthrowing a government, is an outrage that demands the most severe consequence our criminal justice system has to offer. Now, you put this together with the Russia collusion and Nancy this week saying --"

      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "That's right, Nancy. And you still haven't come up with a real reason to impeach him, but you radicals are dug in on getting rid of Donald Trump. And since you can't find anything real, you make stuff up at a whack a mole speed. So the inspector general decides the opening of the investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russians, dubbed Crossfire Hurricane was legitimate and commenced without bias. But almost immediately, Attorney General William Barr and United States Attorney John Durham begged to differ, saying, quote, \"We do not agree with the Inspector General report's conclusions as to predication in how the case was opened.” The Comey FBI counterintelligence division believes they can investigate anyone based on what someone heard in a bar and then run with it. But these guys, they didn't just run with it. They took every left turn and ran every red light in their effort to get their man. And although the warrant was to surveil American citizen Carter Page, in truth, Page was nothing more than the window through which to view and investigate Donald Trump. Thereafter, every one of the 17 errors that the inspector general identified was indicative of the desire to get Donald Trump, to continue spying and wiretapping. That's right. I said it, \"spy.\" The IG confirmed confidential human sources, CHS, were used. Notice I used the plural, there was more than one spy. And we're not just talking about wiretapping now, for which we now know there was no basis, no basis because the dossier -- paid for by Hillary Clinton with money laundered through the law firm and fusion GPS, written by a foreign agent, Christopher Steele, based on sourcing by an individual who told the FBI on three separate occasions it was exaggeration. It was hyperbole. He never expected it to be printed. But when we talk about human sources, we're talking about spies who are actually walking among the Trump campaign and recording in that campaign, including a high level official in the Trump campaign. So if the premise of the investigation was that the Russians may be infiltrating the Trump campaign, why not tell the American presidential candidate? Hell, the same FBI told Dianne Feinstein they believed the Chinese were infiltrating her ranks, but they don't alert a presidential candidate? My, my. Could it be as simple as the FBI treats Republicans as the enemy and the Democrats as part of the home team? And even more sinister is that the target, ladies and gentlemen, really wasn't the campaign. The target was Donald Trump himself. Carter Page was not the man they were interested in. He was the vehicle through which they could watch and listen, or so they thought. Now, the IG admits there were significant inaccuracies and omissions and that agents failed to meet their basic obligations. He made clear for the IG that every step of this operation was briefed up to the highest level of the FBI, that'd be Comey. They found there were, quote, \"so many basic and fundamental errors made by three separate hand-picked teams on one of the most sensitive FBI investigations.\" There was a failure of not only the operational team, but the managers, the supervisors, and the senior officials in the chain of command. So what do you think the chances of that are? Do you really think that there is no bias when everyone on three different experienced teams, all supposedly smart, all make the same mistake, all against Donald Trump? A primer. Every FBI agent is smart. They are trained. Every one of these agents had years of law school training, courtroom experience. The chances of every one of those getting every one of the 17 mistakes wrong that work in their favor against Donald Trump is slim to none. And it ends up in a four letter word, \"bias.\" And although Cardinal Jim Comey says, \"I feel vindicated,\" the truth is that even dull, dry Horowitz makes the truth clear."

      "speaker": "Michael Horowitz",
      "utterance": "You know, I think the activities we found here don't vindicate anybody who touched this thing."

      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "So Donald Trump was right from the beginning. He said they were spying on him and wiretapping him, and they made fun of him, and they ridiculed him and condemned him and belittled him. And although his law enforcement terminology may not have been on point, he was right, wasn't he? And every one of the 17 errors identified by the IG going against the president and in favor of the radical leftist ideologues indicate no conclusion other than bias. Struck [spelled phonetically] and Page are their premiere examples. Quote, \"He's an effing idiot.\" Quote, \"He's never going to become president. No, we'll stop it.\" And so they created their insurance policy just in case he actually got in. And after he won, they texted each other, \"I figure I need to brush up on Watergate.\" No bias? The only reason there is no bias is because no one admitted to bias. It's about testamentary and documentary evidence of bias. But it's now up to the United States attorney to draw a conclusion as to whether or not the 17 separate errors, the violation of FBI regulations, the stunning irregularities, the failure to identify wrongdoing in their own ranks, amounts of bias, and even worse. Jim Comey actually lied, what a shock, and said to our own Bret Baier that the dossier was but one piece of the mosaic of evidence presented to the FISA court -- baloney -- when we now know that it was the only piece. They knew it was written by Trump-hating Christopher Steele, paid for by Trump-hating Hillary Clinton, actually denied by the source who allegedly gave Steele the fraudulent information in the first place. Now, Andrew McCabe, the other hater who put the team together, was a Clintonite who got money from the Clinton Foundation for his wife’s Senate campaign. He’s been referred for criminal prosecution himself separate and apart from this. Jim Comey was the United States attorney in the Southern District investigating the Clinton Foundation that ended with nothing. Shock. The bottom line is the violation of FBI regulations, the stunning irregularities, the failure to identify wrongdoing in their own ranks, is a textbook example of illegality. You have to be pretty damn coordinated, smart, conspiratorial, and razor-precise for absolutely everyone to be on that same illegal page. They were willing to lie and cheat in a way that America has never witnessed before. It was an all-out effort by what was once the most esteemed law enforcement agency in our country to take down the man 63 million Americans put in the Oval Office. Why? Because they think they know better than we do; because in their sanctimonious, condescending world, we know nothing. Their arrogance is only surpassed by their ignorance. They thought they could get away with it. They have not, and they will not. History will not look kindly on Cardinal James Comey, who has now surpassed J. Edgar Hoover as the most corrupt director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in history, and might I add, no one deserves it more. And that’s my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine. And here now with reaction to my open and all the latest developments in this impeachment battle, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, thanks so much for being here tonight. You know, Congressman, there’s so much to go through, but I just want to hit a couple of points. It came out of Judiciary, the recommendation of two articles of impeachment, totally along partisan party lines, and it’s going to the full House, these two articles of impeachment, next week. So, what we’ve got now is the $64,000 question of 31 congressmen and -women in the Trump-leaning districts who may suffer a penalty if they go along those partisan party lines. And you know, I don’t know if you can see them all, but it’s everyone that I’m sure you already know. How much danger are they in if they go through with this?"

The only thing I would add to that -- I would have added Adam Schiff to it. Remember what he wrote in his FISA report? This was as much denouncing that and the lies in there as it was Comey. Remember what Nancy Pelosi -- you put at the very beginning. She has worked two and a half years to impeach this president, long before any foreign phone calls. And remember, you had Nadler, who is the committee about impeachment. He campaigned to win the chairmanship based upon what he said that he would be the best chairman for impeachment, and these freshmen that came in and gave them the majority -- Congresswoman Tlaib; remember what she said on the very day she swore into office --"

I mean, they were high-fiving each other in the background. But I want to focus on one guy who’s gotten a lot of attention in the last few days, and that is Congressman Jeff Van Drew from New Jersey. Now, there’s talk that he may not only not vote for impeachment, but that he may come to the other side of the aisle. That’d be your side, Congressman."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kevin McCarthy",
      "utterance": "Well, it’s true, he voted against inquiry, and he’s also said he’s going to vote against impeachment because he does not believe it rises to that occasion. Now, the one thing I would say, only Jeff can make that decision, is he going to leave the Democratic Party, but anyone who believes in freedom, anyone who believes in the Constitution, and anyone who believes this new socialist Democrat Party has left them, I want to tell Jeff Van Drew that he is welcome in the Republican Party not just by me, but by our conference, and we would support him, and we would welcome him to join. And any of your viewers out there who are independents or Democrats who are frustrated with what’s happening with the rule of law --"

      "speaker": "Kevin McCarthy",
      "utterance": "Well, I am the minority leader, but it’s more money than any Republican has ever raised as speaker and others, and it’s not only just for my campaign, but for the NRCC, and that’s a real indication. When you talk about these 31 Democrat members, it only takes 19 members of elections to make the Republicans in the majority. It’s a real sign out there across this country that they want to see a change. Even CNN says that the intensity level is on the Republican side."

      "speaker": "Kevin McCarthy",
      "utterance": "Yes, we do. Eighteen is a smaller number than the Democrats needed to win last time. Democrats had to meet a much higher number. Not only could we win the majority, because if the Democrats keep the majority, think of this: They promise to keep impeaching the president."

And if the congressman switches, that’ll only be 18, and that’s not a very big hill to climb when you have 55 other seats out there that you can make them change and [unintelligible] president get a second term."

Now, Congressman, look, as I said, you have been in there pulling no punches, but I want to ask you a question that I don't think you’ve been asked. For the last several weeks, and maybe the last month, however long it’s been, what was the most ridiculous thing that you saw play out among the Democrats in this impeachment -- you know, this nonstop impeachment effort on their part?"

      "utterance": "-- of the president’s transcript, and it was really bizarre to the country. And then even this week as we were having hearings, there were two Democrats who misquoted the president when they were talking about the transcript when the president has always been acting in our nation’s interest, and I think we proved that effectively by showing that he said, “Do us a favor, though. Our country has been through a lot.” When he’s talking about “doing us a favor,” he means our nation, and then he immediately says that we’ve been through a lot, and that we deserve cooperation from an ally like the Ukraine to make sure that there’s not the type of deep-seated corruption that would negatively impact our country. I’m grateful our president was doing that."

      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",

I mean, I don't think there was anything more absurd than -- I don’t know who it was; Kaplan [spelled phonetically], whatever that professor is who won’t walk on the same side of the street as Trump Hotel in Washington -- where she said that that’s the king saying “I” instead of “we.” I mean, the king’s “we.” It was just lunacy.

So rather than working with Republicans to try to advance an America first agenda, Democrats are wholly obsessed with delegitimizing the president who won the election.

I just think AOC and this group has them believing that America is a far left country. It's just not true. I mean, I don't know where they got this from, but it's totally inaccurate. They are going to -- if they continue this, they may be in for a big, brutal upset. I mean, can you imagine if the president takes the states he took last time and then adds New Mexico and Minnesota in the mix? Again, I'm on the predictions game, but that would be a slap in the face politically like we haven't seen in decades."

Authorities say ransomware was found in the city’s computer system yesterday, forcing the government to shut down all its city computers and offices. Mayor LaToya Cantrell says no information has been compromised, but it is unclear who is behind it. The city is investigating the incident, along with the FBI. And former Kentucky governor Matt Bevin is facing intense backlash after issuing hundreds of pardons on his way out of office. State legislatures in Kentucky are calling for a federal investigation, especially after it was revealed some of the pardons went to convicted killers and rapists, including one man who had previously raised money for Bevin’s campaign.

The first day it was obstruction, then it’s bribery, and then they’re going out to various states and polling which word, you know, resonates best with voters. I mean, that’s how desperate these people are. They know they can’t win. They can’t believe that an outsider went to Washington, won, beat all of them. They’ve all had these positions for lots and lots of years. They’ve been -- all been in the swamp way too long. And a guy comes out of total left field and beats all of them at their own game, and has done a phenomenal job and has done more than he even ever said he would do, has the greatest economy this country has ever seen, has the lowest unemployment this country has ever seen, and they can’t stand the fact that his message won the day over one of their own.

      "utterance": "Well, in New York they were shooting them from a couple years ago and throwing water cans at them, and the police aren’t even responding. I mean, the police are -- every time they turn around, someone is suing them or accusing them of something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernie Kerik",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, I will give credit to the new police commissioner, Shea. He is -- he was very vocal when he took over a few weeks ago, “We’re not going to tolerate people abusing the cops verbally, physically, or otherwise. We’re not going to take it.”"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "But what about this case in particular? I mean, there’s nothing worse than the idea of bringing your daughter as a freshman to college and then having to come back to take her body home. I mean, there’s nothing worse than that. She’s a beautiful college student, stabbed to death. These three kids, 13 years old. Do we know if they had a record? I mean, obviously, it would be a juvenile record."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernie Kerik",
      "utterance": "Yeah, they may have had a juvenile record. You’re not going to know it. The 13-year-old -- he could be charged with second-degree murder, weapons possession."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "Right now, it’s in family court. Do you think they’ll move it to as an adult -- try him as an adult?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernie Kerik",
      "utterance": "That’s up to the DA, but these days, this DA and others around the country -- you know, they’re letting people out of prison."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "Cyrus Vance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernie Kerik",
      "utterance": "They’re not prosecuting many cases. You know, in a case like this, you don’t know where it’s going to go, but I would hope that the police commissioner and the police department, the detectives, who are the best detectives in the world -- I would hope they pursue the most stringent elements of the law to prosecute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "All right. So, thank you, Commissioner Kerik. I mean, the message is not just about this case, but it’s about continuing the law enforcement efforts of the past to make sure that this kind of thing doesn’t happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Bernie Kerik",
      "utterance": "That’s right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "All right, former NYPD commissioner Bernie Kerik, thanks, and we’ll be right back."

      "speaker": "Jeanine Pirro",
      "utterance": "That's it for us tonight. Remember to keep up with me throughout the week on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
