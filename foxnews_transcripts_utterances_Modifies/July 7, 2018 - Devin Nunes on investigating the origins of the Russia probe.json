Thanks for being with us tonight, and thanks again for making \"Justice\" number one again last week. What a show on deck. CPAC Chair, Matt Schlapp is here, so is Tomi Lahren and a powerful political panel with David Avella and Chris Hahn. We'll be discussing the President's big decision on the Supreme Court on Monday night and more. But first, just how badly were the Feds out to get Donald Trump and where does the House Intelligence Investigation stand now. Joining me to discuss that and more is the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes. All right, good evening, Congressman.",

So there's lots of ways that it made it through, so what we are rally asking for, though, is for these 42 people to be interviewed in public. I would suggest - I can't control how they do the interviews and conduct the interviews, but I would think that they would want to do more deposition types. So, let the Republicans ask an hour of questions of these witnesses - of the witness at a time and then let the Democrats give them an hour. Have it be televised because these 42 people really help us get to the bottom of was Trump really colluding with Russia or was this an orchestrated effort by the left working with the FBI and DOJ to frame the President and many people involved to dig up dirt to start this investigation. That's why I think it would be helpful to have all this done in public.",

Now, let me preface all of this with a couple of thoughts. Number one, Ronald Reagan was able to put three judges on the Supreme Court and there are Republican Presidents like Bush Senior who put Souter on who he thought was a conservative and he turns out to be a liberal, and then Junior Bush ends up putting John Roberts on who was the one vote, the deciding vote in Obamacare.

That's why I like Brett Kavanaugh - Judge Brett Kavanaugh because he has over 300 decisions on every issue under the sun, everybody could read the opinions. You can see where he is. He upholds the Constitution in each and every case and more of his opinions have actually become the basis for Supreme Court decisions, almost 12 times than any other candidate, so he's got the track record and that's what we need.

Thanks for being with us tonight, and thanks again for making \"Justice\" number one again last week. What a show on deck. CPAC Chair, Matt Schlapp is here, so is Tomi Lahren and a powerful political panel with David Avella and Chris Hahn. We'll be discussing the President's big decision on the Supreme Court on Monday night and more. But first, just how badly were the Feds out to get Donald Trump and where does the House Intelligence Investigation stand now. Joining me to discuss that and more is the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican Congressman Devin Nunes. All right, good evening, Congressman."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, it's great to have you on tonight. Yesterday, you sent yet another letter to Congressman Gowdy and Goodlatte asking that they question individuals openly in this continuing Trump-Russia - alleged Trump-Russia collusion investigation. And now it appears your letter includes up to 42 names, letters, some of them from the executive office of President Obama, as well as the State Department, DOJ and FBI. What is different about your third letter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "The third letter is about Fusion GPS and all of the people that are in that realm of Fusion GPS that could have been involved handling the dossier, digging up the dirt and feeding it into the FBI."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And right now, in terms of this information going to the FBI, it seems that you went from the initial who paid for this dossier? What was it all about? And you seem to have gotten answers to that. We know it was the DNC and Hillary Clinton - the Hillary Clinton campaign - but now the issue seems to be a little more fine-tuned. And that is how did this dossier get from the Clinton campaign and Steele to the FBI? Do you know what the answer to that is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "We don't know the answer to that. We think it could have come from many directions, right, so we know that one of John McCain's former staffers did it. We think that many people in the press had this and actually also gave it to the FBI, at the same time Christopher Steele was supposedly working with the FBI. So there's lots of ways that it made it through, so what we are rally asking for, though, is for these 42 people to be interviewed in public. I would suggest - I can't control how they do the interviews and conduct the interviews, but I would think that they would want to do more deposition types. So, let the Republicans ask an hour of questions of these witnesses - of the witness at a time and then let the Democrats give them an hour. Have it be televised because these 42 people really help us get to the bottom of was Trump really colluding with Russia or was this an orchestrated effort by the left working with the FBI and DOJ to frame the President and many people involved to dig up dirt to start this investigation. That's why I think it would be helpful to have all this done in public."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, clearly in public, but when you talk about a deposition, that is somewhat different than the run-of-the-mill hearing where the right gets up and says, \"I'm the greatest guy that ever lived and you are awful.\" Or the left gets up and says \"We're the greatest guys who ever lived and you are awful.\" You never get answers from these witnesses. It's almost like a circus. It's the same all the time. You think that this deposition would get into more in depth information? Will it allow for the basis of a criminal predicate prosecution in the event that they lie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I also believe, Judge, that there is a task force that the Oversight Committee and Judiciary Committee have set up made up of five Republicans and five Democrats. So, let each one have an hour at a time to ask questions of these witnesses so that you don't get the grandstanding, you don't get the political speeches. I think that would be worth a lot more for not only the Congress, but ultimately the American people to understand what information each witness has that's relevant to this matter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, and Congressman, one of the things that I find so fascinating is that the House, I believe it was last week, gave the Department of Justice until yesterday to give them information, this House resolution for- or a deadline for DOJ and the FBI to come clean on the beginning of the Trump investigation or as the FBI called it, Operation Hurricane. Do you know, number one, did Congress get any information from the FBI and DOJ, and number two, if they didn't, where are we with this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, as always, we have to pound and pound and pound to get information from DOJ and FBI. They did give us a lot more information last week or expecting more information on Monday, but let me - you mentioned something about crossfire hurricane that we know was opened July 31st. One of the key outstanding questions that we have is, what happened before July 31st."

What I want to know now is if the y don't give you that information and maybe we can pull the Congressman back up, if they don't give you that information, what can you do to the FBI and DOJ? You've given them more deadlines. Now, we had yesterday they were supposed to give us stuff. Now, maybe Monday or Tuesday. This investigation has been going on for a year. At some point, don't you guys feel impotent?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, look, there is a couple things here. So before July 31st, for a couple of months, we've been really zeroing in on that, and the FBI and DOJ have had plenty of opportunities to tell was happened before July 31st."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But they haven't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "They have not. They have not. Now, ultimately here, the President of the United States, it's his DOJ and his FBI. And at some point here, he need to gets involved. And look, were there informants used or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "No, Congressman, I don't want to go there yet. I don't want to go there yet. Here is the thing. You guys have oversight over the Department of Justice. I know you are intel, I get that. The American people have been watching this circus play out where you guys tell the DOJ and the FBI, we want these records. You then go through the charade. Not you in particular, Congressman, of sending a letter and saying, \"We want this by Friday.\" You don't get it Friday, maybe we'll get it Monday or Tuesday. What my viewers want to know, what the American people want to know with all due respect to you, and I don't think anyone has had more pushback than you, and for that I give you tremendous kudos, I really do. But it's almost as though Congress shouldn't even bother at this point. And we can talk about the president, but what do you have in terms of a sanction? Otherwise, you guys should be working on legislation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, look, ultimately we have the job of oversight. They have to comply with us. They've slowly complied and look, part of what we've uncovered here, let's not forget, it's Congress that's helped uncover the dossier, the dirt, who paid for it. It's just been - look, people are trying to hide this like the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign were trying to hide in conjunction with the FBI, the FBI and DOJ didn't want the American public to know any of this. So, we do have a few outstanding documents that they do need to give us, okay, it's very, very important. So, what steps do we have? Look, we have other steps we can take. We can hold them in contempt, but at the end of the day here, we do need to know what happened before July 31st. That's what we are really trying to get to. If you look at phase three of the investigation like we talked about just a moment ago, having the 42 people come and testify, I think will be very powerful for the Congress and for the American people to have transparency and sunlight in this whole mess."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, but what we are looking at on that full screen is what the beginning of what the FBI and the DOJ says is the investigation into President Trump. July 31, 2016, then, candidate Trump. If FBI and DOJ right where that middle line is say that's when we began the investigation, and you now find out that a counter-intelligence investigation was started against a Presidential campaign a week after the guy gets the nomination to be Republican candidate for President. And in fact, it's before that, then we have got a counter-intelligence at the level of a third world country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "That is correct. So, I think any involvement, even in crossfire hurricane of an informants being paid to go into the Trump campaign is something that - a red line that we've never crossed before, but what could be even worse is if there were informants that were being run into the Trump campaign and their associates before July 31st, which would be even worse. So, this is why at the end of the day, we have to hold these hearings, we have to ask these questions, and ultimately, the President of the United States is going to have to declassify all of this information so the American public knows exactly what the counter-intelligence resources that we have in this country, what were used for."

    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "I don't know. The FISA is very frustrating to me because I think that pieces of the FISA that was gotten on Carter Page, right, that - we have had an ongoing feud about this for many, many months. I think the FISA is totally fraudulent, 100% fraudulent. You have James Comey and others currently at the FBI and DOJ who are defending the FISA which is unbelievable to me. So why not the President ought to just solve this once and for all. Declassify - you don't have to expose sources and methods, but most of that FISA, the pertinent parts of it could be declassified. And he could help answer for all of us who was telling the truth. Were they justified to get a FISA warrant on Carter Page or not? I don't think they were and I think the American people have the right to know and the President should declassify."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

And Congress has been pretty impotent up to this point. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "I like the idea. I think the problem - this whole question about Russian collusion, the Mueller investigation and what happened with all the hanky-panky with the FISA courts, I think the American people deserve just to see the straight facts, but I'm not sure we're going to get it any other way. I am not sure Congress can get it, so I do think it's a fair charge back to the executive branch, make these documents public, the taxpayers should know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, they really should know, but it's been - it seems an ongoing battle where you have someone like Tom Fitton and some other guys who have to go to court to get more than Congress has, which is kind of crazy under freedom of information. However, let's talk about 48 hours from now when the President gets on national television and announces who his pick should be for the United States Supreme Court. Now, let me preface all of this with a couple of thoughts. Number one, Ronald Reagan was able to put three judges on the Supreme Court and there are Republican Presidents like Bush Senior who put Souter on who he thought was a conservative and he turns out to be a liberal, and then Junior Bush ends up putting John Roberts on who was the one vote, the deciding vote in Obamacare. Number one, can you ever be sure who you're nominating will be the true conservative, and number two, who do you want?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "Great questions. The first question is, is it a good strategy to pick somebody without a track record and hope they turn out be a conservative? Terrible strategy. Fifty percent of the picks to the Supreme Court by Republican Presidents have turned out to not to be very solid when it comes to upholding the Constitution. That's why I like Brett Kavanaugh - Judge Brett Kavanaugh because he has over 300 decisions on every issue under the sun, everybody could read the opinions. You can see where he is. He upholds the Constitution in each and every case and more of his opinions have actually become the basis for Supreme Court decisions, almost 12 times than any other candidate, so he's got the track record and that's what we need. John Roberts actually didn't have an extensive track record and it was a mistaken pick."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "I played that because it seems that there was at that hearing two years ago, especially not just by Dick Durbin, but Senator Dianne Feinstein, there was a pushback saying that it seems that you're living the dogma of your religion as though her being a Christian is a problem. I think that tees itself up for a certain amount people on her side saying enough of this anti-Christianity stuff. Let's put her on. What do you think?"

It was a disgusting un-American moment, but she had such grace. My only concern with her nomination, and I would support her wholeheartedly if the President picks her, it's just that, once again, she's only been on the Court for a short time, less than a year. We know where she is on a lot of issues."

We've made so many mistakes, Judge. Think about it, 50% of the picks to the Supreme Court by Republican Presidents have been off the mark. We can't afford one mistake. Neil Gorsuch, a fantastic pick. We've got to keep the streak alive."

Why does this thing keep happening? Joining me now to discuss that and more is Fox News contributor, Tomi Lahren. Tomi, thanks for being here. Tomi, you experienced your own situation. I have had situations like this as well. And right now, I still have not heard from anyone on the left who says, \"Oh, it happens on both sides, it does, it does.\" Able to identify someone from the right going after someone on the left and saying they don't like their politics, spitting at them, threatening them, telling them to resign and things like that."

But Judge, I've got to tell you, since Maxine Waters came out and she encouraged her followers and her supporters to, I guess, continue the attacks on the right, it has gotten worse. I have seen it in my personal life get worse in the last couple of weeks."

Where are the feminists that are about female empowerment? Time's up? #MeToo? Where are their voices in this?

I mean, it is a fraud, the whole thing is a fraud. But I want to move on from that, Tomi, to John Brennan tweeting today to President Trump, \"You are to governance and politics what Bernie Madoff was to the stock market and investment advice. The two of you share a remarkably unethical ability to deceive and manipulate others. Building Ponzi schemes to aggrandize yourselves. Truth and justice ultimately caught up with Bernie.\" Now, here you have a guy, John Brennan who is the head of the CIA, who as far as I'm concerned in my book that's coming out in less than two weeks, is part of the swamp that created and made up this anti-Trump collusion narrative, still going after the President. They are not afraid of us, but we are always under the gun from them."

It's almost like some of these former Obama administration officials, it's almost as if they are jealous that they are not part of a winning administration. I hear time and time again from Hollywood liberals, from former administration officials how terrible this President is, but they give no example of how terrible he is. Terrible for whom? For illegal immigrants? For tariffs? For overregulation? Because for the average American, this President is doing wonderful things and they fail to acknowledge it. I honestly think it's jealousy."

We don't know what her family history is and I don't think it is going to be relevant.

Though it is worth noting that if you saw the survey results this week, you now have voters saying that it's Republicans who are more for the working class and it's Democrats are for the wealthy and the elite and the business community.

And in fact, I even saw another video showing black people who had gone to Trump rallies to support him and when CNN showed up, they intentionally cut them out of the shot so it appeared that there were only white people there.

But you can preorder it now on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. And if you have any questions about anything that we've talked about with the Russia collusion and Strzok and Page and all of that stuff, and Brennan in particular, read my book. We'll explain it all to you. But don't forget to friend me on Facebook, follow me on Twitter and on Instagram @judge_jeanine. I love to read your comments. You never have to miss \"Justice.\" If you can't watch, set your VCR. Thanks for watching. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating for truth, justice and the American way.
