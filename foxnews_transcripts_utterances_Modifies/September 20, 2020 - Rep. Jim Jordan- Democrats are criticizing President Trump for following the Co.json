Flags across the country are at half-staff this morning to honor the life and legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who passed away on Friday at the age of 87.  Take a look at a growing memorial outside of the Supreme Court, flowers, candles and signs blanketing the steps to mourn the feminist pioneer and liberal icon, who was the second woman confirmed to the high court bench.  President Trump celebrated Ginsburg's 27 years of service, calling her a trailblazer, an inspiration to all Americans.  As we remember her this morning, we are reminded also of what's at stake on November 3. Senator Ted Cruz underlined the importance of the next disappointment when he joined me just last week.",

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo toured the region last month and witnessed the geopolitical implications of this treaty firsthand. He joins me right now.  Secretary, good morning to you.

      "sentences": "Yes, so, it's the right question.   These overnight successes, as you know, Maria, in life are from years of hard work. For three years, President Trump has taken a fundamentally different approach. The establishment Middle East policy was that you had to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians first. The president came to understand quickly that the real threat to these countries was the Islamic Republic of Iran. So we flipped the narrative.  We worked to deliver a coalition to get the Gulf states to work together, to convince them that they could, in fact, work alongside and partner with and do commerce with the state of Israel and recognize them and that they would be safer, their people be more prosperous.  Those are the central underpinnings. It then took action. It took principled action on behalf of President Trump and our administration to convince them that the Americans would be there. And whether that was the decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem, to acknowledge that the Golan Heights properly belong to Israel, all things previous presidents has just said were nuts, that you couldn't do, it was against the establishment's vision for how to create stability in the Middle East. And then the work we did to kill Qasem Soleimani and take down an enormous threat to everyone in the region. I think those things gave these Middle Eastern states the trust, the confidence that the United States would stand behind its commitments and have created the space for not one, but two agreements, the first two in over a quarter-of-a-century, between Israel and the UAE and between Israel and Bahrain, that will make the lives better for each of the people of each of those three countries. It's really quite a momentous day. We hope there's more to follow.",

I saw the number of LinkedIn exchanges between the United Arab Emirates and Israel off the charts the day after this announcement. The people of those countries understand that this historic rejection of Israel and its right to exist was the wrong thing to do.  So, I think you will see more nations follow and make the right decision. What created the opportunity was the recognition that the way to create stability was to make Iran more isolated. And we have done that. It's been talked about how America has been isolated in the region. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Israel has now more partners, more friends. The United States now has more partners and more friends in the region than at any time in recent history. And they did that because they came to trust President Trump and his team would be there with them, would do the right thing by them, and that we would support them when they made the right decision to recognize the state of Israel.",

And then ,last night at midnight, the U.N. sanctions snapped back, putting in another increasing restraint on the capacity for the Islamic Republic of Iran to create harm in the Middle East. We now, the United States has led and will prevent arms trafficking by Iran. It was -- the previous deal Secretary Kerry and Vice President Biden signed off on was to allow the Iranians on October 18, just a couple weeks from now, to traffic in weapons. Again, it's nuts, absolutely nuts.   We have stopped that. We stopped it last night with action at the United Nations. We will talk more about that tomorrow. But Iran has been fomenting terror in the region for 40 years, since the resolution. There's no reason to expect that, in the short run, they have any way of getting out of the box and changing their ideology and their theocratic, kleptocratic nature. And what President Trump has said is, we're going to deny them the resources. We're not going to send crates of cash. We're not going to allow them to do business in the world. We're not going to allow them to create the very wealth that destroys the opportunity for peace in the region.   I will give you another example. Everyone wants Lebanon to get better.  President Macron is leading an effort there. And yet the Europeans have not joined us in stopping arms trafficking. Those weapons -- those weapons that Iran will sell will end up in the hands of Hezbollah and make life tragically worse for the people of Lebanon. But the world needs to unite around the central idea that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the greatest threat. And when that regime changes its behavior, we have a chance to create true global stability in the region.  It's what we have been working on. It's what President Trump asked us to do. And now, three years in, we can show the fruits of that effort.",

Security Council resolutions coming back into effect last night.  Arms sales, tanks, air defense systems, all of those in a couple weeks would have been permitted to have been sold. And the Europeans have not joined us in this. They know we're right. They tell us privately, we don't want the arm sales to come back. Indeed, they put it in a letter that they are very concerned about these arms sales. But they haven't lifted a finger. They haven't done the work that needs to be done. They have no option, no alternative to what we have done to ensure that that doesn't happen. I hope they will join us. I hope they will get to the right place. They are still wedded to this silly nuclear deal that was signed now five years ago. I hope they will come to understand that, if you really want to lead, if you want to be part of a global coalition to reduce risk in the Middle East, then you need to join us. We need these sanctions to snap back. Europe is getting better, Maria, with respect to how they're thinking about China. We have spent a couple years just sharing the risks with them. We will begin an E.U.-China dialogue before too terribly long, where will begin to have conversations about how we can, together, put down this threat from the Chinese Communist Party that it presents to the freedom, to religious freedom, to commerce and trade, all of the things that Western nations value...",

And now the president is giving his blessing to this deal between TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart. Can you explain how this is not a national security risk, Secretary, because ByteDance, the Chinese company, still going to own 80 percent of this TikTok global?

It will end up in the hands of their MSS, their security apparatus, their military, their civil-military fusion program. So that's the rule President Trump laid down. As for the transaction around TikTok, I have seen the outlines of it. The president now has said he's conditionally OK with what they're doing. This deal, if approved, in the end, if ultimately approved, will ensure that no Americans' data has any access to anyone in China that has any capacity to move this to a place we don't want it.  We will ensure that that firewall is real, that the protection is serious, that the data resides in places that are connected to the Chinese information system. Whether there's still some Chinese ownership, where they still collect a royalty check from the benefits of the business, there will be an American headquarters, it'll be controlled by Americans, and the data, most importantly, the data, the very reason we have gone after TikTok, that data will be in a place that we have confidence that no American will have the risk that their data will end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.",

We pointed out to -- those things, for example, the reliance on the dossier that actually the intelligence community, including the CIA, told the FBI not to use those documents, that they weren't reliable. Every single one of the intelligence agencies, separate from the FBI, said that the dossier was not the kind of document they should be relying on, we shouldn't even be talking about it, because it could very well be something the Russians completely made up and put out there, sort of the information, in order to create all sorts of havoc. The implications here are frightening. And that is, you can go and hire some former spy from anywhere in the world to go up and make up stories and put it in this document and get someone in the U.S. government to put the official seal of approval on it as something that is serious and have it leaked on the eve of an election...",

And if you are, which is OK, because you're in the United States of America, but let the American people know, because trained Marxists do not believe in American ways, do not believe in a nuclear family, do not believe in religion, even though they said that they did. But if you believe in religion, what you believe in is togetherness. You believe in forgiveness. And I said, I cannot let that stand.

I was hearing so many things said about this man that was not true, because I have known him for 37 years, that I wanted the people to know the truth. The truth is, he is not a racist. The truth is, he loves the United States of America. I'm tired of people listening to his tweets, saying that that's the type of man he is, because he's not. Look at the action that he does.

President Trump celebrated Ginsburg's 27 years of service, calling her a trailblazer, an inspiration to all Americans.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Yes, so, it's the right question. These overnight successes, as you know, Maria, in life are from years of hard work. For three years, President Trump has taken a fundamentally different approach. The establishment Middle East policy was that you had to resolve the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians first. The president came to understand quickly that the real threat to these countries was the Islamic Republic of Iran. So we flipped the narrative. We worked to deliver a coalition to get the Gulf states to work together, to convince them that they could, in fact, work alongside and partner with and do commerce with the state of Israel and recognize them and that they would be safer, their people be more prosperous. Those are the central underpinnings. It then took action. It took principled action on behalf of President Trump and our administration to convince them that the Americans would be there. And whether that was the decision to move the embassy to Jerusalem, to acknowledge that the Golan Heights properly belong to Israel, all things previous presidents has just said were nuts, that you couldn't do, it was against the establishment's vision for how to create stability in the Middle East. And then the work we did to kill Qasem Soleimani and take down an enormous threat to everyone in the region. I think those things gave these Middle Eastern states the trust, the confidence that the United States would stand behind its commitments and have created the space for not one, but two agreements, the first two in over a quarter-of-a-century, between Israel and the UAE and between Israel and Bahrain, that will make the lives better for each of the people of each of those three countries. It's really quite a momentous day. We hope there's more to follow."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And the American negotiations have tried this for years, decades, and with no success. What was it about this administration's prodding this administration's laying out the potential for peace and progress that really moved the needle here? And are there other countries lining up to perhaps engage in a similar deal to normalize relationships with Israel?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Yes, Maria, there will be other countries that will make the right decision to recognize that Israel has its right to exist, and they will want to do business with them, and they will want to connect with them, and they will want their people to have exchanges. I saw the number of LinkedIn exchanges between the United Arab Emirates and Israel off the charts the day after this announcement. The people of those countries understand that this historic rejection of Israel and its right to exist was the wrong thing to do. So, I think you will see more nations follow and make the right decision. What created the opportunity was the recognition that the way to create stability was to make Iran more isolated. And we have done that. It's been talked about how America has been isolated in the region. Nothing could be further from the truth. Israel has now more partners, more friends. The United States now has more partners and more friends in the region than at any time in recent history. And they did that because they came to trust President Trump and his team would be there with them, would do the right thing by them, and that we would support them when they made the right decision to recognize the state of Israel."

    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Well, remember there's two things going on. One, we had this deal. And then ,last night at midnight, the U.N. sanctions snapped back, putting in another increasing restraint on the capacity for the Islamic Republic of Iran to create harm in the Middle East. We now, the United States has led and will prevent arms trafficking by Iran. It was -- the previous deal Secretary Kerry and Vice President Biden signed off on was to allow the Iranians on October 18, just a couple weeks from now, to traffic in weapons. Again, it's nuts, absolutely nuts. We have stopped that. We stopped it last night with action at the United Nations. We will talk more about that tomorrow. But Iran has been fomenting terror in the region for 40 years, since the resolution. There's no reason to expect that, in the short run, they have any way of getting out of the box and changing their ideology and their theocratic, kleptocratic nature. And what President Trump has said is, we're going to deny them the resources. We're not going to send crates of cash. We're not going to allow them to do business in the world. We're not going to allow them to create the very wealth that destroys the opportunity for peace in the region. I will give you another example. Everyone wants Lebanon to get better. President Macron is leading an effort there. And yet the Europeans have not joined us in stopping arms trafficking. Those weapons -- those weapons that Iran will sell will end up in the hands of Hezbollah and make life tragically worse for the people of Lebanon. But the world needs to unite around the central idea that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the greatest threat. And when that regime changes its behavior, we have a chance to create true global stability in the region. It's what we have been working on. It's what President Trump asked us to do. And now, three years in, we can show the fruits of that effort."

Security Council resolutions coming back into effect last night. Arms sales, tanks, air defense systems, all of those in a couple weeks would have been permitted to have been sold. And the Europeans have not joined us in this. They know we're right. They tell us privately, we don't want the arm sales to come back. Indeed, they put it in a letter that they are very concerned about these arms sales. But they haven't lifted a finger. They haven't done the work that needs to be done. They have no option, no alternative to what we have done to ensure that that doesn't happen. I hope they will join us. I hope they will get to the right place. They are still wedded to this silly nuclear deal that was signed now five years ago. I hope they will come to understand that, if you really want to lead, if you want to be part of a global coalition to reduce risk in the Middle East, then you need to join us. We need these sanctions to snap back. Europe is getting better, Maria, with respect to how they're thinking about China. We have spent a couple years just sharing the risks with them. We will begin an E.U.-China dialogue before too terribly long, where will begin to have conversations about how we can, together, put down this threat from the Chinese Communist Party that it presents to the freedom, to religious freedom, to commerce and trade, all of the things that Western nations value..."

And now the president is giving his blessing to this deal between TikTok, Oracle, and Walmart. Can you explain how this is not a national security risk, Secretary, because ByteDance, the Chinese company, still going to own 80 percent of this TikTok global? And we know that, if the Chinese company -- the Chinese Communist Party wants that data of American citizens, they're going to get it, given the civil-military fusion laws in China.

As for the transaction around TikTok, I have seen the outlines of it. The president now has said he's conditionally OK with what they're doing. This deal, if approved, in the end, if ultimately approved, will ensure that no Americans' data has any access to anyone in China that has any capacity to move this to a place we don't want it. We will ensure that that firewall is real, that the protection is serious, that the data resides in places that are connected to the Chinese information system. Whether there's still some Chinese ownership, where they still collect a royalty check from the benefits of the business, there will be an American headquarters, it'll be controlled by Americans, and the data, most importantly, the data, the very reason we have gone after TikTok, that data will be in a place that we have confidence that no American will have the risk that their data will end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."

Nine out of 10 times when the party in the White House is the same party that's controlling the Senate, nine out of 10 times during an election year, you put someone forward, they get confirmed. But only once out of eight times has someone, when the party -- when there's a difference in who has the White House and who has control of the Senate, only one in eight times when someone's been brought forward in an election year. So this is following the law, following the Constitution, and, frankly, following the historic norms of our country. So, I hope we move forward, and I hope we put someone in there who is going to respect the Constitution, follow the Constitution, understand the First Amendment and Second Amendment are critically important.

I think about what we see in the last six months. Democrat -- Democrat governors, Democrat mayors have said, you can't go to church, you can't go to work, you can't go to school, but you can protest, riot, and loot. So there's all been kinds of limits on your fundamental liberties, your fundamental rights. We need someone on the court who will respect those liberties, who understands how important the Bill of Rights and the Constitution really are. That, to me, is what's most important. So, I think that's what we should focus on. Those two individuals fit that. I think they would be great, great selections and great additions to the court. I hope we put people on the court in the Scalia, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, mold and, frankly, not in the John Roberts mold. I hope that's what happens. But we should move forward with this.

They tried to stop President Trump from winning the election. He won. Then priority number one becomes, how do we cover up what we did? And they had to focus on getting rid of Michael Flynn. And that all happened there they plan and structure how they are going to take down Michael Flynn in that January 5 meeting in the White House, Obama, Biden, Comey, Yates, Rice all in that meeting. They plot and strategize how they are going to take down Michael Flynn, because they had to, because Michael Flynn, as former defense intelligence and now as the incoming national security adviser to President Trump, was going to figure out what they did. So I'd want to ask him, what all took place in there? Remember, Joe Biden brings up the Logan Act in that meeting. We have the notes that show that. So I'd want to ask Jim Comey about that meeting. Frankly, I would want to ask Susan Rice at some point, why did you send a memo to yourself? Why did you send an e-mail to yourself? You ever done that before? Because she obviously does that on the 20th on Inauguration Day, reflecting back on that January 5 meeting. So, I would really want to focus on what took place in that meeting on January 5, 2017."

And we are going to have to see what Bill Barr and John Durham do. I hope they do. I think Jim Comey has been at the center of all this. He's in every important meeting. He was the guy who went from one administration to the other. He's the one who designed the cover-up. He's the one who pushed when he leaked his memos to get Bob Mueller, the special counsel, appointed, which, in fact, happened. The very people on that team wiped their phones, as you just indicated. So, Comey is the key to all this. I'm glad he's coming in. I'm sure he's going to get some tough questions.

A few weeks later, Michael Horowitz issues a report and says the 29 FISA cases that he looked at, in a random sample case that he looked at, there were major problems with every single one. So, that is a concern to me, when you think about the history of what took place when they when they used the FISA court to get the warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, and then what may have happened since then with these 29 other cases. So I have real concerns there. Chris Wray really hasn't helped us get information.

That's the way -- that's where it's going to wind up. I actually feel pretty good for the president's chances here. He's overperforming in areas like Southern Florida, where, traditionally, where, if he's going to lose, like Miami-Dade County, it's a big Democratic county, where -- down where my home is, but he's going to lose by less than he did in 2016. And he's going to narrow margins, and that helps him. And he's just be as strong, if not stronger, in other parts of the state. So I feel pretty good about the trend lines for the president, you know, in Florida, but it'll be a close race."

But what are your thoughts on the proposal being presented so far? The Communist Party wants to own a majority stake in this TikTok agreement with Oracle. The U.S. wants to own it. How -- what do we need to know about this situation? Because we already know that the Communist Party is trying to get swathes of people's information and mine that data of American citizens."

      "utterance": "I think Oracle has worked really hard to put together the best deal possible. My concern remains this. If that code, the code that gives the instructions to the system on what to do, if China continues to control the code, as I understand they would in this deal, they could put in that code an instruction to secretly send data back to China, to the mainland. No matter where the actual data is housed, there can be something embedded in that code that sends it the other way. Oracle says, no way, that they know enough about this that they can prevent it from happening. I think we have to be very careful in looking at that provision, because if anything -- if there's any opportunity whatsoever for China to continue to collect personal data on Americans, then we can't be supportive of that deal. So that's the core and the crux of it that we are going to be looking at."

      "utterance": "Yes. All right, I want to ask you another question about our intelligence. And that is having to do with the -- what I call the coup that failed. In my new book, that's what I call it, the coup that failed. And that is this effort to take down Donald Trump. We have spoken with your colleague Senator Ron Johnson many times on this program. And we know that Ron Johnson is trying to get documents from the Senate Intel Committee, but the Senate Intel Committee denied Johnson and Senator Grassley access to the documents that they need to see to continue to investigate the transition period from the Obama administration to the Trump administration. Why not just release those documents, Senator?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, two things. The first is, they're not asking for documents. They are asking to review the transcripts of interviews. And when that deal was put together, I wasn't chairman at the time, but Senator Burr and Senator Warner told the witnesses that we won't turn over your testimony to our committee unless you agree to that. So, that's the problem. That's the crux there. The second thing about the Intelligence Committee everybody has to understand is, unlike these other committees, where a chairman can do whatever they want, both the co -- the vice chairman and the chairman have to agree. The third is, they have -- if they want to interview these people, they most certainly have the right to issue subpoenas and interview whoever they want."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, but, at the same time, look, a lot of people, our viewers know exactly what happened here. I mean, Jim Comey is going to testify in front of Senator Lindsey Graham's committee, the Judiciary Committee, where he's chairman. That's happening on September 30. And now we know that there are -- there is more of a likelihood that we will see other subpoenas as well from Obama administration officials. It doesn't appear that your colleagues on the left, Mark Warner included, really want to get to the bottom of this. But we know that they used our intelligence agencies as weapons, Senator, didn't they, against their political enemies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the key actually would be -- well, in fairness, I think the real weapon was the FBI individuals in the FBI. And the report says that. Our Russia report makes it very clear that the FBI's -- and it wasn't the Russia report -- the 2016 election report makes very clear that the FBI behaved very poorly with -- the things they did in 2016 in the aftermath of that election were terrible. We pointed out to -- those things, for example, the reliance on the dossier that actually the intelligence community, including the CIA, told the FBI not to use those documents, that they weren't reliable. Every single one of the intelligence agencies, separate from the FBI, said that the dossier was not the kind of document they should be relying on, we shouldn't even be talking about it, because it could very well be something the Russians completely made up and put out there, sort of the information, in order to create all sorts of havoc. The implications here are frightening. And that is, you can go and hire some former spy from anywhere in the world to go up and make up stories and put it in this document and get someone in the U.S. government to put the official seal of approval on it as something that is serious and have it leaked on the eve of an election..."

We have spent two years fighting off the ridiculous things that were in that dossier. And the intelligence community told them, this - - we don't know what this thing is. Some of the stuff doesn't even add up. Don't use it. And they insisted on using it anyway for their own internal purposes, and went to a court and relied on it for a court. So there was clearly wrongdoing. And that's in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. And that's why I'm glad Senator Graham is taking it on, and we will learn more here."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

They knew in January of 2017, and yet just a couple months later and then a couple months after that, they got two new re-ups for the renewals for that warrant to spy on Carter Page. We will see what John Durham has to say about this."

I have a feeling that there are things that they did that we don't even know about yet that are far worse than what's been publicly revealed. We will find out. It's just a feeling. But given some of the body language I'm seeing, I have a feeling that they're the some of the conduct goes beyond anything any of us know yet."

And, usually, when you plead guilty to charges, it's because -- I'm speculating here, but it's because you're cooperating. So, I anticipate that we will see some criminal charges here. Clearly, there was perjury and lying to a court. But the question goes deeper than that, is, was it knowingly? Was it part of a broader effort, a coordinated effort, where a bunch of people in law enforcement, sworn to uphold the law, colluded to violate it? Look, we will let the facts speak for themselves. We will find out soon enough, I imagine."

      "utterance": "Well, what I was referring to is, I have heard something about BLM many times, probably a million times, and it didn't hit me until I happened to be sitting at my desk, and I watched the co-founder of BLM. In a statement she made, she said that they were trained Marxists. And this little voice in the back of my head said, did you hear what she just said? And then I felt so guilty. I felt so guilty, because I always consider myself a person to tell the truth. And I said, I haven't been telling the American people the truth, because I did not know that -- well, I didn't hear anyone ever tell me that she was a trained Marxist. And so I said I need to tell the American people, all you athletes out there, all you companies, all you professional teams that's promoting BLM, are you telling me that you're promoting someone that said they are a trained Marxist? And if you are, which is OK, because you're in the United States of America, but let the American people know, because trained Marxists do not believe in American ways, do not believe in a nuclear family, do not believe in religion, even though they said that they did. But if you believe in religion, what you believe in is togetherness. You believe in forgiveness. And I said, I cannot let that stand. You know, one of the reasons I spoke for the president had nothing to do with the president of the United States, but it had to do with, I want the people to know the truth. I was hearing so many things said about this man that was not true, because I have known him for 37 years, that I wanted the people to know the truth. The truth is, he is not a racist. The truth is, he loves the United States of America. I'm tired of people listening to his tweets, saying that that's the type of man he is, because he's not. Look at the action that he does. You know, I can tweet that I'm the best basketball player in the world, but, unless I prove it, it doesn't mean anything."

They're stopping and looking at everything. They are stopping to look at it, study it, and get into the history of what's going on. And I'm not going to take anything away from former President Obama, because he showed all people of color you can be president of the United States. But I go back and I say, guys, look at, what did he do for the African- American community? I'm sorry. What did he do? Well, President Trump has done incredible things for the African-American community. And he didn't do it for a vote. That's what people don't realize. He didn't do it to try to get a vote. He did it because he said it was the right thing to do. He did it before this election even came about. And he was doing it for the American people, not just for African-American community, but for the American people. This man has been fighting for America since he got into office, with all these obstacles standing in his way. You want to talk about the pandemic? During the pandemic, what he was dealing with? He was not only dealing with that. He was dealing with the Russian probe. He's dealing with impeachment. He's dealing with these leakers. He's dealing with all these different things that we domestically is throwing on him, along with the pandemic. And this man has been doing a heck of a job. And I think people got to give him recognition for it. One of the biggest things that have happened that no one seems to want to talk about is this historical peace deal. Why is no one talking about that? Well, this is historical, but no one want to talk about it. They only want to talk about the election. Well, let's talk about this election. What I believe in is the Constitution of the United States. Well, it seems that this party, the Democratic Party, want to go against the Constitution of the United States.
