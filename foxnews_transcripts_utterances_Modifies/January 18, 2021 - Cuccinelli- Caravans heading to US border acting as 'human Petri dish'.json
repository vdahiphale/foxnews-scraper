      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" All right. Tonight, we start with troubling news that we must report. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, and Chucky Schumer are only two days away from implementing their radical platform, and what can only be described as a chilling Orwellian effort now has emerged to silence, cancel, erase any opposition voices. It's rising up, believe it or not, right here in the USA.  Now, couple all of this with the most radical big governments, socialist agenda ever even proposed in American history and a commitment to implementing it. And, of course, starting with this radical new environmental Green New Deal and regulations, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, amnesty for illegal immigrants and so much more, everything we warned you about.  Noticeably missing from the Biden Harris agenda, anything actually related to unity. After an extremely close, contentious election, it is clear no one on the left actually wants to bring 75 million Trump voters into the fold, quite the opposite. Instead, Democratic leftists -- they are now looking for ways to squash any and all dissent, and silence any and all rivals and any opposition voices, and pretty much cancel anybody anywhere that dares to get in their way.  At the top of the list is, of course, the president who has been banned from almost every social media platform in the country. These powerful big tech companies are now working in statist solidarity to stop any legitimate competition even from emerging, another voice, another platform. A dangerous alliance of these powerful institutions starting with the Democratic Party in conjunction with the mob and the media, big tech all working together, and now, hundreds of writers, book agents. Now, their very livelihoods actually depend on something called freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of the press. They are actually demanding that publishers ban any future books from President Trump. We'll silence him that way.  One publisher has already canceled a book deal with Senator Josh Hawley, all because he supported a ten-day audit of the election results. You don't have to like him. You don't have to agree with him. They want to silence, shutdown, muzzle, shame out of existence any and all dissent Dangerous times. Even so-called moderate Democrat, Joe Manchin, he's caved into the mob pressure. He wants to consider a plan to remove Senator Hawley and Senator Ted Cruz from Congress. He wants to use the 14th Amendment. In other words, bypass the will of the people in Texas and Missouri. Just totally ignore what they want, and again, all because they supported what was a perfectly legal audit of the election results as part of an electoral challenge, something the Democrats themselves did in 2000, 2004, 2016.  Meanwhile, Democrat Andrew Yang is now demanding that the federal government regulate which guest can appear on this program and programs like it, what topics will be allowed to cover. We get this new Orwellian fairness doctrine.   So, let's see, what government agency and who actually gets to decide what they deem is acceptable or not acceptable? Naturally, the music industry, they are also plagued by censorship demands. One musician was just dropped from a record label for merely attending the president's January 6 rally. He didn't participate in the Capitol riot, nor did by the way the 99 percent of people that were in D.C. the day of that rally. Now he watched the president's speech and then he went back to his hotel room, probably ordered room service and opened the mini bar. And according to Miranda Devine who will join us tonight from \"The New York Post\", the far left quote, it's not enough to just arrest and prosecute actual lawbreakers who smash their way into the Capitol. No, anyone who supported the president, voted for him, worked for his administration now has to be hunted down and purged. Forbes.com say, yeah, we can't hire people that worked for Trump. Have you or have you ever been a Donald Trump supporter?   Don't just take her word for it. Listen to this, now former PBS lawyer. This is a guy caught on tape just a short time ago talking about reeducation camps. Remember? For children of Trump supporter's and sending them to PBS school every day.

According to the fresh wing of the Democratic establishment party and the socialist party, you, we, the people, we need to be deprogrammed or cancelled, or put in reeducation camps because of our political opinion, and the different from theirs. Sadly, after decades on TV and radio, let me just tell you what this is really all about. Now, this effort from the left, it is not new. It is only accelerating. I'm not complaining but this is really been my reality in radio and television, conservative talk radio's reality, a few of us here on FOX News for decades. There are now entire organizations extremely well- funded, millions and millions of dollars dedicated and have been for many years to put some of us on this network and in talk radio out of business. There are paid professional stockers of the media mob. They watch every minute, every second of the show in hopes that we might slip up and say one thing that will get us fired or boycotted or silenced forever. And of course because that we don't meet their standards.   There are Democrats all over the country who would cheer for our demise and the demise of the few conservative voices that are out here. I have dealt with this my entire career. For them, clearly dissent is evil, debate is evil, difference of opinion, outright evil. Now, these Democrats, they're not liberals. You know, they are little totalitarians. Their one goal is to shut you up, shut us up.  Point in case here, despite his liberal views, late-night host Bill Maher actually himself has long been the target of the far left mob and far right mob, if you will. Just crazies on left and right, because he doesn't always toe the party line on political correctness.  Remember when ABC kicked them off the air, \"Politically Incorrect\"? Yeah, I was one of those few conservatives that actually spoke out against firing him and I hate the guy but I believe in free speech. Now to his credit, he is the only one of Democrats, liberals, leftists, libertarians, whatever he actually is who will actually stand up for millions of Trump supporters, the overwhelming 99 percent are good, hardworking, law-abiding, taxpaying, decent people that want a better country that believe in limited government, energy independence, secure borders, don't want judicial activists on the court, free and fair trade deals, and peace through strength.

Here with more is the host of \"FOX & Friends\" weekend, Pete Hegseth, \"New York Post\" columnist, FOX News contributor, Miranda Devine. Miranda, you wrote a great column. In this column, I want to just -- because what you said, when you talked about the petition at Harvard, that would demand that Trump staffers have their degrees revoked, and you talk about, you wrote, a feverish mood is afoot evoking the spirit of McCarthyism and the Salem witch trials in which irrationality and hysteria point fingers at the innocent.  Now, 99 percent, I always said, of the deep state, law enforcement are good people. I would even argue 99 percent of the people peacefully protesting this summer, good people. I just disagree with them. I agreed with their protests after the tragic and horrific death of George Floyd which can't happen again. Ninety-nine percent of the people that raided the capital, most of the people at that rally didn't go, 99 percent.   But what is it? Are you now or have you ever supported Donald Trump? Is that where we're headed?",

I'll tell you what -- I mean, it seems like they start here and then eventually you must be a good little robot liberal Democrat socialist, or they'll come for anybody apparently. You know, I worry about that Pete Hegseth in what, as I sit here, okay, everybody was genuinely rightly outraged over George Floyd. Ninety-nine percent of protesters, they weren't violent, a lot of people were outraged over the deep state. You know what, 99 percent of FBI agents I believe are good people. Ninety-nine percent of the people at that rally did not partake in what happened at the Capitol nor would they.   PETE HEGSETH, FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND CO-HOST: That's true, but what this is ultimately about, Sean, is intimidation, silencing and marginalizing a political viewpoint.  Miranda is entirely correct. Eventually, they move the sliding scale further and further left, and if you're not woke enough, you eventually meet the fire break and you're included as well. You know on CNN, you had a Democrat congressman today go on and say that 75 percent of the National Guardsmen that are on Capitol Hill today probably voted for Trump and as a result they should all be seen as suspects. So, if you're wearing the uniform have sworn an oath, you're a white male, you supported Trump, you're a suspect.  What does that say about every voter out there who voted for President Trump, maybe thought the election wasn't above board? You're a suspect too eventually, at whatever platform they could come at you. Or how about Madison Cawthorn who I know you're going to have on your program? His Democratic opponent said that you know he's guiltier than 95 percent of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Sean, I spent a year of my life at Guantanamo Bay. I had guys threatened by the guys inside the camp. They couldn't wear name tapes because they said, I'm coming for you and your family.  He's saying a congressman who objected to an election is as bad as al Qaeda, what will they say to people that don't have that congressional lapel pin, who don't have a show on FOX News Channel, who don't have a column at \"The New York Post\"?  They will say, you better shut up and you should be ashamed of the fact that you supported a president who put America first. Ultimately, this is all about intimidation they go as high as they can including silencing the president United States and they will go to every single person to say you're canceled.",

They're preemptively silencing and crushing their opposition and they know because their policies, their prescriptions for America are disastrous. They've been proven to be disastrous in the cities that they control and they know that most Americans don't want them.

I wonder if they're going to wear masks after his mask mandate. Now, Biden told them, don't come yet, because he said the situation at the border isn't going to be transformed overnight. Biden also promised to cancel, yes, energy independence. By the way, if you work on the Keystone XL pipeline, and you have a great high paying career job, it's probably going away, destroying countless jobs in the energy sector. And, of course, now, creating higher oil energy prices and yes, more dependence on nations that hate our guts, like Russia and China and countries in the Middle East. And he vowed to re-enter, yes, the insane Paris climate accords. China is viewed as a developing nation. We pay full freight and it's going to provide student loan, debt relief, raise the minimum wage. Nancy Pelosi wants D.C. statehood and yes, COVID election laws, you know, to be permanently implemented. And unity so far, not a part of the plan instead according to \"The L.A. Times\", Biden wants to, quote, make America California again. Oh, you left California, you thought you got out of there, forget it. Now, it's the whole country.

You need not and should not be a part of this unconstitutional post-presidency impeachment. Oh, we'll just -- we'll keep going after Trump.

One thing that is interesting is when I spoke to government officials on the ground, they said that the flood of migrants that came through appeared to be very political and very organized, very structured. The Guatemalan government has told the Honduran government that they don't want to see this happen again, that they had a meeting on January 12th and the Honduran government was supposed to work with them to stop the blood.

      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" All right. Tonight, we start with troubling news that we must report. Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, and Chucky Schumer are only two days away from implementing their radical platform, and what can only be described as a chilling Orwellian effort now has emerged to silence, cancel, erase any opposition voices. It's rising up, believe it or not, right here in the USA. Now, couple all of this with the most radical big governments, socialist agenda ever even proposed in American history and a commitment to implementing it. And, of course, starting with this radical new environmental Green New Deal and regulations, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, amnesty for illegal immigrants and so much more, everything we warned you about. Noticeably missing from the Biden Harris agenda, anything actually related to unity. After an extremely close, contentious election, it is clear no one on the left actually wants to bring 75 million Trump voters into the fold, quite the opposite. Instead, Democratic leftists -- they are now looking for ways to squash any and all dissent, and silence any and all rivals and any opposition voices, and pretty much cancel anybody anywhere that dares to get in their way. At the top of the list is, of course, the president who has been banned from almost every social media platform in the country. These powerful big tech companies are now working in statist solidarity to stop any legitimate competition even from emerging, another voice, another platform. A dangerous alliance of these powerful institutions starting with the Democratic Party in conjunction with the mob and the media, big tech all working together, and now, hundreds of writers, book agents. Now, their very livelihoods actually depend on something called freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom of the press. They are actually demanding that publishers ban any future books from President Trump. We'll silence him that way. One publisher has already canceled a book deal with Senator Josh Hawley, all because he supported a ten-day audit of the election results. You don't have to like him. You don't have to agree with him. They want to silence, shutdown, muzzle, shame out of existence any and all dissent Dangerous times. Even so-called moderate Democrat, Joe Manchin, he's caved into the mob pressure. He wants to consider a plan to remove Senator Hawley and Senator Ted Cruz from Congress. He wants to use the 14th Amendment. In other words, bypass the will of the people in Texas and Missouri. Just totally ignore what they want, and again, all because they supported what was a perfectly legal audit of the election results as part of an electoral challenge, something the Democrats themselves did in 2000, 2004, 2016. Meanwhile, Democrat Andrew Yang is now demanding that the federal government regulate which guest can appear on this program and programs like it, what topics will be allowed to cover. We get this new Orwellian fairness doctrine. So, let's see, what government agency and who actually gets to decide what they deem is acceptable or not acceptable? Naturally, the music industry, they are also plagued by censorship demands. One musician was just dropped from a record label for merely attending the president's January 6 rally. He didn't participate in the Capitol riot, nor did by the way the 99 percent of people that were in D.C. the day of that rally. Now he watched the president's speech and then he went back to his hotel room, probably ordered room service and opened the mini bar. And according to Miranda Devine who will join us tonight from \"The New York Post\", the far left quote, it's not enough to just arrest and prosecute actual lawbreakers who smash their way into the Capitol. No, anyone who supported the president, voted for him, worked for his administration now has to be hunted down and purged. Forbes.com say, yeah, we can't hire people that worked for Trump. Have you or have you ever been a Donald Trump supporter? Don't just take her word for it. Listen to this, now former PBS lawyer. This is a guy caught on tape just a short time ago talking about reeducation camps. Remember? For children of Trump supporter's and sending them to PBS school every day. After you empower the government to take your kids. Take a look."

According to the fresh wing of the Democratic establishment party and the socialist party, you, we, the people, we need to be deprogrammed or cancelled, or put in reeducation camps because of our political opinion, and the different from theirs. Sadly, after decades on TV and radio, let me just tell you what this is really all about. Now, this effort from the left, it is not new. It is only accelerating. I'm not complaining but this is really been my reality in radio and television, conservative talk radio's reality, a few of us here on FOX News for decades. There are now entire organizations extremely well- funded, millions and millions of dollars dedicated and have been for many years to put some of us on this network and in talk radio out of business. There are paid professional stockers of the media mob. They watch every minute, every second of the show in hopes that we might slip up and say one thing that will get us fired or boycotted or silenced forever. And of course because that we don't meet their standards. There are Democrats all over the country who would cheer for our demise and the demise of the few conservative voices that are out here. I have dealt with this my entire career. For them, clearly dissent is evil, debate is evil, difference of opinion, outright evil. Now, these Democrats, they're not liberals. You know, they are little totalitarians. Their one goal is to shut you up, shut us up. Point in case here, despite his liberal views, late-night host Bill Maher actually himself has long been the target of the far left mob and far right mob, if you will. Just crazies on left and right, because he doesn't always toe the party line on political correctness. Remember when ABC kicked them off the air, \"Politically Incorrect\"? Yeah, I was one of those few conservatives that actually spoke out against firing him and I hate the guy but I believe in free speech. Now to his credit, he is the only one of Democrats, liberals, leftists, libertarians, whatever he actually is who will actually stand up for millions of Trump supporters, the overwhelming 99 percent are good, hardworking, law-abiding, taxpaying, decent people that want a better country that believe in limited government, energy independence, secure borders, don't want judicial activists on the court, free and fair trade deals, and peace through strength. Gee, oh, the thought of it all. Take a look."

They will eventually, I can assure you, they will come back around and try to silence him at some point. But here we are, in just two days, Democrats will be in charge of the federal government and dissent is clearly not welcome. Here with more is the host of \"FOX & Friends\" weekend, Pete Hegseth, \"New York Post\" columnist, FOX News contributor, Miranda Devine. Miranda, you wrote a great column. In this column, I want to just -- because what you said, when you talked about the petition at Harvard, that would demand that Trump staffers have their degrees revoked, and you talk about, you wrote, a feverish mood is afoot evoking the spirit of McCarthyism and the Salem witch trials in which irrationality and hysteria point fingers at the innocent. Now, 99 percent, I always said, of the deep state, law enforcement are good people. I would even argue 99 percent of the people peacefully protesting this summer, good people. I just disagree with them. I agreed with their protests after the tragic and horrific death of George Floyd which can't happen again. Ninety-nine percent of the people that raided the capital, most of the people at that rally didn't go, 99 percent. But what is it? Are you now or have you ever supported Donald Trump? Is that where we're headed?"

And we don't think --"

      "utterance": "I'm not really sure, Miranda. I'll tell you what -- I mean, it seems like they start here and then eventually you must be a good little robot liberal Democrat socialist, or they'll come for anybody apparently. You know, I worry about that Pete Hegseth in what, as I sit here, okay, everybody was genuinely rightly outraged over George Floyd. Ninety-nine percent of protesters, they weren't violent, a lot of people were outraged over the deep state. You know what, 99 percent of FBI agents I believe are good people. Ninety-nine percent of the people at that rally did not partake in what happened at the Capitol nor would they. PETE HEGSETH, FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND CO-HOST: That's true, but what this is ultimately about, Sean, is intimidation, silencing and marginalizing a political viewpoint. Miranda is entirely correct. Eventually, they move the sliding scale further and further left, and if you're not woke enough, you eventually meet the fire break and you're included as well. You know on CNN, you had a Democrat congressman today go on and say that 75 percent of the National Guardsmen that are on Capitol Hill today probably voted for Trump and as a result they should all be seen as suspects. So, if you're wearing the uniform have sworn an oath, you're a white male, you supported Trump, you're a suspect. What does that say about every voter out there who voted for President Trump, maybe thought the election wasn't above board? You're a suspect too eventually, at whatever platform they could come at you. Or how about Madison Cawthorn who I know you're going to have on your program? His Democratic opponent said that you know he's guiltier than 95 percent of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Sean, I spent a year of my life at Guantanamo Bay. I had guys threatened by the guys inside the camp. They couldn't wear name tapes because they said, I'm coming for you and your family. He's saying a congressman who objected to an election is as bad as al Qaeda, what will they say to people that don't have that congressional lapel pin, who don't have a show on FOX News Channel, who don't have a column at \"The New York Post\"? They will say, you better shut up and you should be ashamed of the fact that you supported a president who put America first. Ultimately, this is all about intimidation they go as high as they can including silencing the president United States and they will go to every single person to say you're canceled."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And, Miranda, I'm never changing my views. I'm America first. I want low taxes, less bureaucracy. I want constitutional justices, energy independence. I want secure borders. I want peace through strength and better trade deals. Not that complicated. That's the average conservative I know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVINE",
      "utterance": "Yes, but that is exactly the problem and this is the reason why conservatives are have to be silenced, because we now have -- the Democrat Party has power in both houses and in the White House. This is their once- in-a-lifetime opportunity to push through all their wish list and to entrench one party rule. And what they're trying to do is silence dissent before they do it. They're preemptively silencing and crushing their opposition and they know because their policies, their prescriptions for America are disastrous. They've been proven to be disastrous in the cities that they control and they know that most Americans don't want them. And so, what they're doing is ensuring that the very Americans who have common sense and who don't want the -- who aren't radical, who aren't far right wing and just sensible common sense, what used to be sort of moderate Democrats even, they don't want those policies. They don't want one party rule."

There's taking over city blocks, burning down police stations, but there's no violence whatsoever. Two thousand cops hurt, 25 dead. And now, we're going to investigate and the National Guard that's there that will protect us when we should be doing a nine -- the equivalent of a 9/11 commission to get to the bottom of how that could have happened on the sixth?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEGSETH",

That's the equivalent, guarding a virtual inauguration when people watch their own city blocks be burned to the ground, watch graffiti say \"kill the police, kill Trump\", that's insurrectionist language if I've ever seen it. Yet it was governors and mayors unwilling to bring in the National Guard in those moments, to protect citizens. Yet, when our lawmakers, when our representatives in something that we all have said should not have happened are threatened, that requires 25,000 unprecedented footprint, it's because the big lie all along. They've been talking all about the big lie across media. People have heard it. The big lie all along is that the media ever gave anyone a fair shake. Katie Couric, she was always a leftist, just didn't just didn't expose herself as such. Now because of Trump derangement syndrome, which is a real thing, because he really fought the way conservatives and Republicans never did, they've exposed themselves."

We've overcome incredible challenges as a nation and we've done it before and we will do it again. We'll do it by coming together, by uniting after years of pain and loss.

He first compared Trump supporters to Nazis, as I said. He announced plans to offer amnesty to 11 million immigrants, saying as we speak, another massive caravan from Central America headed straight to our borders. I wonder if they're going to wear masks after his mask mandate. Now, Biden told them, don't come yet, because he said the situation at the border isn't going to be transformed overnight. Biden also promised to cancel, yes, energy independence. By the way, if you work on the Keystone XL pipeline, and you have a great high paying career job, it's probably going away, destroying countless jobs in the energy sector. And, of course, now, creating higher oil energy prices and yes, more dependence on nations that hate our guts, like Russia and China and countries in the Middle East. And he vowed to re-enter, yes, the insane Paris climate accords. China is viewed as a developing nation. We pay full freight and it's going to provide student loan, debt relief, raise the minimum wage. Nancy Pelosi wants D.C. statehood and yes, COVID election laws, you know, to be permanently implemented. And unity so far, not a part of the plan instead according to \"The L.A. Times\", Biden wants to, quote, make America California again. Oh, you left California, you thought you got out of there, forget it. Now, it's the whole country. Meanwhile, unity be damned and other top Democrats are obsessed with another impeachment Schiff show charade. Now, forget the fact the president will be out of office, the left is hell-bent on conducting yet another latest political smear. Now, to weak Republican senators and there are a lot of weak ones, if you're going to participate, you shouldn't in what is a sham Schiff show Senate trial. It's unconstitutional. It will do nothing to actually help Americans improve their lives and instead, it will inflame tensions and this is just political theater. You need not and should not be a part of this unconstitutional post-presidency impeachment. Oh, we'll just -- we'll keep going after Trump. And the American people have seen enough of these Schiff shows to last a generation. Here with reaction, North Carolina Congressman Madison Cawthorn and Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. I mean, Senate Republicans, really? My suggestion is, they don't show up, the president not send any lawyers, and when it comes time for a verdict, Republican senators walk in, they vote to acquit and say, are we ready to do the country's business? Because it's not constitutional. Why can't they do that?"

They want to digitally erase us online, pursue us in the flesh, make us unemployable and make it difficult for conservatives to be able to assemble and share ideas. I'm deeply troubled at the initial plans we're seeing from the Biden administration. They want to shut down America's businesses but open up the borders. They want to close the Keystone pipeline, opening opportunity for Russia and some of America's adversaries. And then they want to take the treasure of America's people and they want to spread it around the world through the Paris Climate Accord and America last organizations like the U.N. and the World Health Organization. That won't benefit American prosperity and success. And, Sean, listening to -- you talk about these things, it's hard to think it's anything other than abjectly depressing, not just like tear-rolling- down-the-side-of-the-cheek depressing but draw-the-warm-bath-and-get-the- sharp-blade depressing.

Where is Mr. Free Speech @Jack now? By the way, are the ayatollah still allowed to speak on Twitter? And, tonight, Project Veritas has yet another undercover video from inside of twitter. The video features twitter's legal policy and talking about the company's plans for yet more censorship. As always, we report. We'll let you decide."

There's also been a lot of questions about retros, and, of course, we're going to do a retro. I mean, we're in the midst of a retro around the election and generally this will most definitely be folded into it. What we saw on Wednesday morning was really concerning to us, obviously. So, a small team gathered from Trust and Safety, and were discussing the potential for violence to happen. And we decided to escalate our enforcement of the Civic Integrity Policy and use a label that disabled engagements, to stop the spread of potentially inflammatory content which is the content around election interference, election fraud, stealing the election, that type of thing."

And, by the way, joining us with reaction, he is the founder, CEO of Project Veritas. James O'Keefe is with us. You know, as I watch that and I put that together with @Jack's tape that you released last week, and even put it with the NPR guy that you got on tape saying that he wants the government to take our children and send them to reeducation PBS camps, which I can't believe -- what dawns on me, what really struck me is that I hear we've tried this. We've been able to perfect this and other places. Now, we are just going to implement the strategy long-term here. Am I interpreting that the right way? How did you interpret it?"

      "utterance": "Yeah, Sean. This is Vijaya Gadde from the Orwellian-sounding Trust and Safety Council with Twitter. And she talks about how they're going to go beyond the de-amplification. Sean, this is something that Twitter has denied doing previously with their shadow banning and de-boosting. Now, they are saying they are going to go beyond de-amplification. She also says in this tape potentially inflammatory content. Not just inflammatory content but potentially inflammatory content needs to be censored, anything touching something like voter fraud, and we've done stories on voter fraud that has led to people being arrested. But according to Twitter, even that could lead to violence. So, I think that's the keyword there was potentially and I said they are taking this whole thing global now, Sean. They are going to go well beyond anything that we could imagine. And, again, I know they are private companies, but at Veritas, we just want these private companies to be honest. We don't think that's too much to ask given they have more power than all three branches of government."

Joining us now to explain is the Parler CEO, John Matze is with us. You know, I said this to Dan who is a part of your group. You know, I'm really genuinely heartfelt sorry that this is happening to you, guys. I know other people involved. You believe in the freedom of speech, even the freedom to criticize Dan Bongino on a platform he's part of."

You know, really what had happened I feel like is Amazon and these other tech companies ran a PR campaign against us, claiming falsely, you know, without any evidence really other than a couple of articles that didn't have evidence either that, you know, Parler somehow is responsible for inciting violence, which is crazy because their statements alone on the first day that it was released, you know, had over 1,000 death threats to our lawyer alone. Our employees are harassed. You know, we're harassed. And so I feel like really the ones who are inciting violence is AWS, Amazon, who incited, you know, economic violence against our company and has, you know, created people who actually want to threaten us and our employees, too."

I've got to believe that there are some brilliant -- I'm not one of them when it comes to this, conservative tech minds that will be able to create a usable platform for you, the equivalent of what you had. Yet, you're not dependent on Apple or Amazon or any of these other companies moving forward. Now, I understand you are working towards that. How far away do you think you are from making all that happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MATZE",
      "utterance": "Well, our first step is to get onto infrastructure, you know, servers, DDoS protection, WAF protection, other tech-related things that don't rely on Amazon or any of the other big tech companies. You know, we've reached out to over six vendors, all of whom, you know, are capable hosting us, all of whom said no and cited almost exactly what Amazon cited when they said no to us. So we really need to build our own infrastructure and our own technology. And I think it needs to be more than just liberal versus conservative. I myself am a libertarian. I'm not a conservative. But what I do believe is that we need to have principles, that free speech and privacy should be respected. And, apparently, that's too much for big tech. And so, we really need an alternative set of resources so people can develop software without learning about these technology companies going after you."

Remember, years ago, There's message boards, and then it devolved into Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and all this. All of the horrible things, lies, smears, slander, besmirchment, attacks, even memes that are actually pretty funny against me, not one time what I say they shouldn't be allowed to say that. Not one time. Now, you would take down racist comments. Your site took down virulent anti-Semitic comments. You wouldn't put up with calls for violence, correct?"

      "speaker": "MATZE",

We'll continue to follow it. Hoping you can get back up soon, maybe we can have some platforms out there, where our voices can be heard. Now, this migrant caravan I told you about on its way to the U.S., they might be disappointed at -- yes, the ever weak, frail, cognitively struggling Joe and what he is saying, next."

Oh, that would be an incentive. Our very own Sara Carter has an investigative report with explosive details about the caravan -- Sara."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right, Sean. I mean, this has been since Friday. I have been speaking with sources in Guatemala, as well as government officials in Guatemala who say that between 7,000 and 9,000 migrants have come through the border area in Chiquimula. And that was an area that I was in in 2019 when we saw some caravans. In these caravans, they have also diagnosed people with COVID. At least 25 people in the caravan have had COVID. One thing that is interesting is when I spoke to government officials on the ground, they said that the flood of migrants that came through appeared to be very political and very organized, very structured. The Guatemalan government has told the Honduran government that they don't want to see this happen again, that they had a meeting on January 12th and the Honduran government was supposed to work with them to stop the blood. But I've got to tell you this, they are expecting tens of thousands more people moving towards the U.S. and despite what President-elect Biden is saying that don't come in yet, we're not prepared for you, that's not going to stop the flood. The Mexican government right now has multiple buses waiting at the border to try to stop the flood from coming into Mexico, but they are very concerned that they are just going to break through like the wave and come straight into Mexico and head straight toward the U.S. border."

And while I don't like it or appreciate it or think it's consistent with the law, it's not like Joe Biden snuck up on anybody with this, right? I mean, this is what he said he was going to do. And while -- and what we were saying along with the Department of Homeland Security was, hey, look, you are going to get way more then you are bargain for. And we saw the Trump effect, you know, this amazing drop, voluntary drop in illegal immigration when President Trump was sworn in because of the expectations he created. And now, we are seeing the Biden effect because of the expectations that he has created. But your reporter, Sara, made a really critical point and that is the COVID in there. So, when these caravans come up and really the whole illegal immigrant pipeline, Sean, they are in tight conditions that they don't control with people who don't care about them. Let's be very clear about that. And it is an absolute human Petri dish opportunity for the transmission of a demonstrably very transmissible virus. And, of course, we have to worry about this new strain now."

      "utterance": "Well, and, Sean, you know, the Guatemalans have fought this really hard, I mean, with yeoman's effort really for a nation of their resources. That's a result of the accomplishments of this administration. I mean, a big part of the way we fought illegal immigration was with partnerships with El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico. And they've done more. This is the first caravan that's gone anywhere since early 2019 because of the relationships that President Trump achieved. And let's face it. He -- it was hard-nosed negotiating if you will remember almost two years ago when the president was criticized substantially on both sides of the aisle for being so tough. But it worked. We have the most for fruitful relationship in this area with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries, if ever. And I hope the new administration will not flush all of that very productive effort down the drain."

Dan Bongino had nothing in common with Barack Obama, but that man would have taken a bullet for Barack Obama.

What he is really accusing the men and women in the Guard is being of traitors. The only loyalty they have is to Donald Trump. He is insulting all of them. Where does it stop? Should we ask our doctors what -- who they voted for? Should we ask our dentists who they voted for?
