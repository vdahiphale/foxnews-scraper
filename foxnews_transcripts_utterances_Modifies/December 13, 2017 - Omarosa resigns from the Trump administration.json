There are those on the right who are bummed because a Republicans loss makes it harder to fulfill Trump's agenda. To them, I say relax. The silver lining to this cloud is actually bigger than the damn cloud. First, this is no referendum on Trump. It's a referendum on a state election that made all of us squirm -- including you. You can tell by Trump's polite tweet after he was relieved not to have this albatross across his neck -- around his neck. Now the party must get to work and find a real candidate to unseat Jones.  But here's the real good news: The only reason we had this election was because Donald Trump won. It's true. Imagine it's October 2016 and a genie offers you this deal: You can win the White House, change the political landscape, dump the Clintons, but you'll lose a Senate seat in a year. Wouldn't you take that deal? Of course you would. Sure, the Republicans blew the primary which got us this mess, but it could be far worse. You could still have that seat, but under Hillary. As for you, Doug Jones, stop grinning and open your mind. You're already a lame duck. A lefty in Alabama is like a popsicle in a sauna, which is why you nearly lost to the most flawed candidate ever -- your butt saved only by Republican write-ins. So grab lunch with the president. You already have something in common with him: Your opponent sucked.  All right. Let's get to the big news here, Omarosa. Dana, devastated?",

And then, unfortunately, wasn't able to get it over the finish line for those that supported him. It was pretty shocking, the fact that the race was as close as it was, given all the news and people who are calling for him to drop out.

And now, I think this is happening with President Trump. So, he wins and he has some majority, but then if you look at the special elections that have happened since, if he's not at the top of the ticket, even if he's campaigning, even if he's supportive and tweeting about you, it's not working. And the generic ballot for the congressional races in the midterms are not good for Republicans right now. There's a 15-point gap in the poll today.

Let's take a look at the first one. It's from August of 2016. This is a text message from FBI agent Peter Strzok to the FBI lawyer Lisa Page, and he writes to her, you laid out a path in Andy's office that he couldn't get elected. Now, Andy is importantly believed that's the deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe. Remember, he's at the center of the inspector general's investigation. His wife took over $700,000 in political donations from Democrats for a 2015 state senate race. And Agent Strzok continues, we can't take that risk. It's kind of like an insurance policy. What we understand here at Fox is that this particular text is the focus of congressional investigators and other governmental officials because it speaks to the possibility of a conspiratorial or some sort of level of coordination. If you go to the next one which you mentioned leading in to me is also August of 2016. And you can see Agent Strzok talking about going down to this Walmart in Virginia, and he says in caps, I could smell the Trump supporters, so he is really diminishing these people. And then the FBI lawyer responds that she's having lunch with a friend and we hate everyone. We hate everything, she writes. So this is at a peak period of the campaign. It's also shortly after the Clinton email investigation was closed for the first time by the FBI, and they have just opened the FBI's Russia counterintelligence investigation. But even if you go back a few months, we'll take a look at this final text. This is from the spring. You can see there does seem to be this real anti-Trump sentiment that is expressed by the FBI agent, calling him an idiot and then using the F-bomb to talk about candidate Trump. The final point if I could, this agent, Peter Strzok, is one of the most senior counterintelligence agents at the FBI. His job is tracking spies and blocking espionage directed at the United States. And one of my contacts said to me today, it was really in some ways unbelievable that he would have such bad tradecraft and he will be so sloppy to send these types of sentiments on thousands of text messages to someone that he worked with.

I will tell you that it's to me it's very, very, just very important to get this vote not because of that but because -- and I don't know what the vote will be. I don't know what exactly the final.

We wouldn't be having this conversation if they have backed Luther Strange to begin with, but they -- you know, the fridge candidate push forward and was able to garner the votes. And then, unfortunately, wasn't able to get it over the finish line for those that supported him. It was pretty shocking, the fact that the race was as close as it was, given all the news and people who are calling for him to drop out. And he was down by how many percentage, you know, poll points, etcetera. So I think what the president is focusing on right now is a good messaging there, which is like, all right, let's unite the party. Obviously, it would have been great if we had it. A lot of Republicans feel differently. But I'm all focused about the American people and getting tax reform put through. So he's already -- he's done. That's in the rearview mirror."

And now, I think this is happening with President Trump. So, he wins and he has some majority, but then if you look at the special elections that have happened since, if he's not at the top of the ticket, even if he's campaigning, even if he's supportive and tweeting about you, it's not working. And the generic ballot for the congressional races in the midterms are not good for Republicans right now. There's a 15-point gap in the poll today. So, you can make up a little bit of that with the tax reform bill if the economy continues to improve. But I think Marie is right that there is something different happening this time."

      "utterance": "So the deputy attorney general was up here on Capitol Hill defending the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and the integrity of the Russia probe, but it was really a series of texts that garnered all the attention. Let's take a look at the first one. It's from August of 2016. This is a text message from FBI agent Peter Strzok to the FBI lawyer Lisa Page, and he writes to her, you laid out a path in Andy's office that he couldn't get elected. Now, Andy is importantly believed that's the deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe. Remember, he's at the center of the inspector general's investigation. His wife took over $700,000 in political donations from Democrats for a 2015 state senate race. And Agent Strzok continues, we can't take that risk. It's kind of like an insurance policy. What we understand here at Fox is that this particular text is the focus of congressional investigators and other governmental officials because it speaks to the possibility of a conspiratorial or some sort of level of coordination. If you go to the next one which you mentioned leading in to me is also August of 2016. And you can see Agent Strzok talking about going down to this Walmart in Virginia, and he says in caps, I could smell the Trump supporters, so he is really diminishing these people. And then the FBI lawyer responds that she's having lunch with a friend and we hate everyone. We hate everything, she writes. So this is at a peak period of the campaign. It's also shortly after the Clinton email investigation was closed for the first time by the FBI, and they have just opened the FBI's Russia counterintelligence investigation. But even if you go back a few months, we'll take a look at this final text. This is from the spring. You can see there does seem to be this real anti-Trump sentiment that is expressed by the FBI agent, calling him an idiot and then using the F-bomb to talk about candidate Trump. The final point if I could, this agent, Peter Strzok, is one of the most senior counterintelligence agents at the FBI. His job is tracking spies and blocking espionage directed at the United States. And one of my contacts said to me today, it was really in some ways unbelievable that he would have such bad tradecraft and he will be so sloppy to send these types of sentiments on thousands of text messages to someone that he worked with. This was alone surprising in itself, Dana."

I think it goes to the core of the credibility, you know, the integrity of the investigation that this is someone that you had who was just blatantly just basically bleeding out vitriol about the president, and about people involved with him, and how is it in any way proper for him to be involved in an investigation like that?"

That always amps up the intensity of the bravado of the language, you know, I'm the only one who can stop Trump. I'll do it. Oh, please. Like, he was the hero. It's part of that initial foolish euphoria of an affair. But still, it does taint the objectivity because it was so intense. But having said that, we all kind of do this stuff when we're texting.

Well, the president's job performance has been rough. You know, we had the travel ban rejected, couldn't repeal Obamacare. We had Charlottesville, all that mess, special counsel. But I think every fair-minded person can agree within the last three months, the president has performed much better. Kelly has straightened out the White House personnel. Great recovery efforts with the hurricane. The Asia swing was a very good success. And the stock market and the GDP have been astonishing. And no collusion proven, yet anyway.

They weren't doing investigative journalism because they didn't want to hurt their leader. But now what's happening is Trump has made the media better. I said as a couple days ago, because every mistake they make validates his opinion that it is fake news. So they have an extra incentive not to screw up, because if they screw up, Trump looks better.

By the way, to your point, this is the same show that couldn't do ISIS, because they felt that evil -- the evil wasn't sophisticated enough. It was just too evil, and they needed a gray area.

If you go to FOXNews.com/podcasts, I've got a fantastic interview with the great Walter Kern, one of the best writers in America. We talk about Trump's effect on the media. We talk about the election from last night. We talk about so many different things. He's really a fantastic writer. He wrote the book \"Up in the Air,\" which was made into the movie with George Clooney, an old friend of mine. George and I go way back."

So they'll just say about your actions, \"Well, we find your actions very problematic.\" And you're supposed to say, \"What is that? Is it wrong?\" \"No, it's just problematic.\" But if anybody tells you that something you did is problematic, tell them to shut the hell up.
