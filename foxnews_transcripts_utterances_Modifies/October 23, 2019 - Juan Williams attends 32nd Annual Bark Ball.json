I'm sorry.  So what does the establishment loser response? A secret anonymously driven coup which is egged on by the media. That -- to your point, that is the thing that I don't understand. There's only one explanation for this. Because of the results of Trump's White House so far, they realize they can't beat him, so they need to eliminate him. So what they're doing is they're willing to divide and create division among our country as a political weapon to solve their political humiliation. I have one question for libertarians, for leftists, true leftists, and pacifist. You now have a president whose primary goal is not spilling anymore blood anywhere, where are you? This is like the most progressive foreign policy I've seen in my life. You're going to let the New York Times, you're going to let Hillary Clinton, you're going to let CNN and Adam Schiff basically replace him with a Hillary pod because they don't like him, after what he's doing?

But when the majority of the House Democrats have the gavel they're not affected by the transparency argument, they just keep rolling down until they see something in their polling, or in their focus groups, or the pressure from their constituents gets to a fever pitch on transparency, they're probably not going to change it.

I'm sorry. So what does the establishment loser response? A secret anonymously driven coup which is egged on by the media. That -- to your point, that is the thing that I don't understand. There's only one explanation for this. Because of the results of Trump's White House so far, they realize they can't beat him, so they need to eliminate him. So what they're doing is they're willing to divide and create division among our country as a political weapon to solve their political humiliation. I have one question for libertarians, for leftists, true leftists, and pacifist. You now have a president whose primary goal is not spilling anymore blood anywhere, where are you? This is like the most progressive foreign policy I've seen in my life. You're going to let the New York Times, you're going to let Hillary Clinton, you're going to let CNN and Adam Schiff basically replace him with a Hillary pod because they don't like him, after what he's doing?

The stunt today of going down -- you know the president said I want the Republicans to get tougher, so that -- they'll win the news cycle on that today. Like, they'll be able to drive the news. But when the majority of the House Democrats have the gavel they're not affected by the transparency argument, they just keep rolling down until they see something in their polling, or in their focus groups, or the pressure from their constituents gets to a fever pitch on transparency, they're probably not going to change it. The other thing is, I think -- I feel like the goal posts from both sides are moving so much that even if there was to say -- like there was a quid pro quo, I'm pretty sure it would be like, oh, OK.

Adam Schiff is running such a tight ship with the closed door policy here, yet he's allowing the leaks, he's allowing this narrative to build up full of like inflated verbiage, and I just think it continues to divide the country, and that just seems to be their number one goal right now is massive division for 2020 election.

But they're doing the exact same thing over and over again with their impeachment and with just trying to discredit everything that President Trump does. They're falling into their same pattern of don't vote for him, only vote for us because it's not him, They're not really putting forth anything great that's gonna move our country forward again. I personally don't think she's running at all. I think this is all just silly. But, you know, she can't endure the thought of having another woman in the front, in the lead.

Well no, this is what happens when you pretend crazy is never going to get out of its crazy little box. The crazies out of the box, which was the college campus, then the California legislature. Now it's spread to media, to HR, to government. When sane people go for shelter, the crazy comes out. The socialist runs for president. Words get banned. Secret cabals undermine a duly elected government egged on by the media. And they call you crazy. No, real crazy is on the march. Crazy wants to turn math into gibberish. It wants to ditch school grades. It blocks people from going to work. It throws fluid on politicians and mobs' people at their houses, spits and punches at those for wearing hats, concocts hoaxes to incite violence, keeps the sick and drug addicted on the streets.

On the left-hand side, he gets down to propose to his girlfriend. he is 20-year-old and he trips that little girl and the little girl's mom; it was like scolded like ruining the moment. But then, you know, the couple was very happy. They felt bad. It was a cute little moment there in Texas. And congratulations to the lovely couple. And then we have a new podcast. It's called. I'll Tell You What. And I talk all about how I thought I had appendicitis, but apparently, I don't."

And they've already rescued 1500 dogs this year and they raised about $50,000 last night. And I almost ended up taking out this little dog home with me until they told me it would grow up to be 60 pounds. And then someone else took off."

This is Justin Ownby in Tennessee, he hollowed out a 910-pound pumpkin and turned it into a boat. And as you can see, he was rowing around when he lost balance and fell into the water. That's a little bit like what happened to Cinderella's pumpkin carriage at midnight. By the way, you should know there are pumpkin regatta races on lakes and ponds in Minnesota, Oregon, Nova Scotia. Maybe Justin will start his own pumpkin paddling contest."

This one friend, Michael, told me that I would still achieve every goal that I set out for. I would just be on a little bit different of a path. And I still hear him to this day.
