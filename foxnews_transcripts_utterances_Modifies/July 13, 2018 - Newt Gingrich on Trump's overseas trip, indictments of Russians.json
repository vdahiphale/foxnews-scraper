      "sentences": "Good evening from Washington, I'm Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" I thought things were supposed to slow down in the summer time, what happened? Well of course, there's no such thing as a slow news cycle these days, certainly not with President Trump. And we're going to have insight and analysis that you cannot and will not get anywhere else tonight. President Trump meeting with the British Prime Minister and the Queen today and on Monday, he's set for that one on one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Newt Gingrich is going to be here in just a moment. He's going to analyze the president's entire overseas trip and preview what's instore for Monday. Back here at home, a major development in the Mueller probe, interesting timing too. The DOJ will be announcing today, new charges against 12 Russians for hacking the Democrats in the 2016 election. But is there any evidence of collusion? Doesn't look like it.  It's the end of the week so you know Raymond Arroyo's going to be here for Friday Follies, a special London edition. And we're going to bring you the latest on that overhyped Trump protest balloon flying madness above London. And then discuss the president's meeting with her majesty. Plus Dinesh D'Souza joins us to unpack some of the most curious statements by the new odd couple, George W. Bush and his pal Bill Clinton.  But first our top story, thousands of demonstrators hit the streets of London to protest the president's visit to England today where Trump continues to challenge the global status quo. And as we reported last night, President Trump gave an interview with the London Sun newspaper and he said British Theresa May's approach to Brexit could put a trade deal with the United States at risk, talk about ruffling some feathers. At a press conference today though, President Trump clarified things and he shared his view on several international matters.",

Joining me with reaction about this and a lot more, Pam Bondi, Florida's Republican attorney general. Pam, we have seen this issue pop up in California where there's been a push for, of course, full health care benefits for illegal immigrants and driver's licenses, and everybody has driver's licenses, concern about voter fraud.

Well of course, there's no such thing as a slow news cycle these days, certainly not with President Trump. And we're going to have insight and analysis that you cannot and will not get anywhere else tonight. President Trump meeting with the British Prime Minister and the Queen today and on Monday, he's set for that one on one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Newt Gingrich is going to be here in just a moment. He's going to analyze the president's entire overseas trip and preview what's instore for Monday. Back here at home, a major development in the Mueller probe, interesting timing too. The DOJ will be announcing today, new charges against 12 Russians for hacking the Democrats in the 2016 election. But is there any evidence of collusion? Doesn't look like it. It's the end of the week so you know Raymond Arroyo's going to be here for Friday Follies, a special London edition. And we're going to bring you the latest on that overhyped Trump protest balloon flying madness above London. And then discuss the president's meeting with her majesty. Plus Dinesh D'Souza joins us to unpack some of the most curious statements by the new odd couple, George W. Bush and his pal Bill Clinton. But first our top story, thousands of demonstrators hit the streets of London to protest the president's visit to England today where Trump continues to challenge the global status quo. And as we reported last night, President Trump gave an interview with the London Sun newspaper and he said British Theresa May's approach to Brexit could put a trade deal with the United States at risk, talk about ruffling some feathers. At a press conference today though, President Trump clarified things and he shared his view on several international matters."

Based on just trade in general and our other relationship, which will be fine, but the trade is a little bit tricky.

She's got a very weak government in a lot of trouble and that certainly didn't help anything. But I thought the press conference actually helped her. The tone was right and Trump has actually had a very good trip and I think even the New York Times admitted in a shock editorial that he had accomplished a great deal of what Obama had tried to do with NATO but had failed to do. And I thought you know, Trump must have gotten a lot done if even the New York Times had to say it."

They represented a world view of quote, \"Leading from the rear\" John Carey's model of being secretary of state was any four star hotel with any five star restaurant any time and he then thought that that was negotiating. I think that if you watch what Trump is achieving, for example, NATO members have now absolutely committed to get to the level of commitment that President Bush asked for, President Obama asked for, Trump got him to say yes. And there are a number of these things happening that I think represent substantial gain, partly by force of his personality."

I mean a lot of these smart people, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution, all of these well-heeled think tanks, they spent their lives dedicated to geopolitical understanding and foreign policy. Written these long articles most people haven't read and a lot of them were responsible for screwing up the post-Cold War eras as Pap Yucanon said on my show today. This guy comes along with no experience and it's like, this is ridiculous. Why are we paying so much of this burden? Some of you are going to have to start coughing up more money. And why shouldn't we have a better relationship with Putin? We're not going to agree on a lot but we talked to China and they certainly have a much bigger military and in many ways more aggressive, more of a threat. And, \"Oh you can't say that. Why?"

These people on the right, and they're this many five, they're talking just to themselves and maybe a few people on MSNBC and that's dwindling audience, God bless them. Today these indictments were handed down, very long indictments, Russian GRU officers, intelligence officers what do you make of this? There's serious allegations, hacking into American accounts, placing malware into prominent American accounts like Podesta, the DNC, very serious."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "They're very serious. They raise two questions in my mind, the first is why is it that Mueller would decide to release this just before the president sees Putin? Now it's just an odd timing but I don't care personally because I think it actually strengthens Trump's hand to walk in say to Putin, \"You tell me your guys didn't do that, we just indicted 12 of your people\" But the second question I'd raise which is a very interesting question, if we're going to start going after people, if we engage in hacking in the United States, there are going to be so many Chinese that we should be indicting. That I think this is a very serious standard to start setting, probably the right standard. But it does mean we're going to go after other country's nationals in their own homeland and indict them, that will be very big change."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well we'd be talking about meddling and I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'd have any, \"Gee I did it, I did it, you got me\" There won't be a Perry Mason here I don't think but you never know what happens, right but I will absolutely firmly ask the question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They have a narrative that they can't get off Trump's cozy to Putin and mean to our allies. This is a just a drum beat you hear all day long and sometimes with you're friends, you have to have a real honest relationship."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "If they listen to what President Trump said to Chancellor Merkel when he went right at her and said, \"Don't accept the Russian pipeline for natural gas, buy our liquid natural gas instead\" He's threatening Putin with billions of dollars of losses and that was certainly not the act of somebody who is in Putin's favor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And the more we are able to triangulate with Russia and China that's also a good thing. We don't want to drive Russia into the arms of China, that would be a disastrous point for us and Trump sees that. Again, someone who has had no experience until running for president on all these issues, I think he continues to show up so many of these people on their supposed expertise on matters that, they are complicated, they are important but Donald Trump's like, \"It doesn't have to be this linear on all these things, we can have better relationships with more countries."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GINGRICH",
      "utterance": "He also has a model in his own head that we live in an age where leaders can communicate directly with leaders. It changes the whole nature of diplomacy. He does that with Kim Jong-un and North Korea. He does it with president of China, he's doing it now with the president of Russia. As Churchill once said, \"Jaw, jaw, jaw is better than war, war, war\" I would much rather have them talking than have us drifting more and more towards a conflict."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

I have to ask you something, speaking of the `80s. They're making this big deal of the balloon. We're going to talk about it later with Raymond Arroyo, the big Trump balloon and their protest. Yeah there are protests in London. Remember the protest against Reagan and against Bush, we have some of the video. Reagan in '82, Bush many times, London, Berlin hundreds of thousands of people in Spain. That was '82 in Berlin and for Reagan we had fires, we had huge mass protests and yet we're supposed to believe it's only Donald Trump. We're the most hated we've ever been because of Donald Trump, you hear that all day long today."

I think that people on the left react like people on the left. And of course a lot of the Reagan demonstrations were paid for by the Soviet Union which was actually subsiding the peace movement, something that Liberals don't like to concede. But I think that, so somebody puts up a big balloon, my first reaction is, this is the best they've got? This they're idea of intellectual answer to Trump?"

The whole issue here is that America and DOJ but importantly particularly the White House has got to take this meddling seriously and I think these indictments further that process along. What I worry about most, whether I'm a Democrat or a Republican, is if this president doesn't accept it or doesn't take it seriously, what are administrative agencies and our government doing to prevent this from bothering or affecting the midterms or even 2020? It's a real risk."

    {
      "speaker": "SOL WISENBERG, FORMER DEPUTY INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, WHITEWATER",
      "utterance": "Well that's a lot of questions. Let me start with the timing being curious or suspicious. I don't know how long the Putin trip or summit has been planned. I've heard it's only a few weeks so I seriously doubt that. A couple of things though, you talk about indictment counting and you talk about the investigation being about collusion originally. From the beginning the investigation was also about Russian interference OK. Also whether they colluded with the people here but also about Russian influence in the election and I think this indictment goes to the heart of that. And it's real and it's serious and it certainly buys Bob Mueller a lot of time and he can say, \"Hey folks, this is what I've been doing and it wasn't very easy to do and to put together\" Now to Scott's point and this may seem petty but you talk about indictment counting and being counting. This is not 12 indictments, it's one indictment id 12 people OK and he's had a perennial mis--"

Not of it has to do with obstruction of justice from the Trump team as Rosenstein made very clear and as he did the last time they named Russian nationals who they had charged with hacking and being engaged in our election. And I think that this is the one disingenuous aspect of the Mueller probe which frustrates a lot of Americans out there, which is if he's spending 95 percent of his time looking to unravel Russian plots to infiltration here, it would be nice if he could come out and make that clear. Because the press certainly doesn't want to go there, the Democrats they still are obsessing everyday making it out to sound like as though there's an imminent arrest of a Trump official coming at any moment. When in fact even those convictions or guilty pleas or indictments that the special counsel has filed have been unrelated to any of the original accusations.

This is consistent with what we have been saying all along' Scott another thing a friend raised with me and I hadn't thought of it, I wish I had. Doesn't it underscore how important it was for Hillary or anyone else in high levels of government not to have unsecure email servers? Remember back when we discovered that this email server had been unsecure that she was using, very unusual the way she was keeping her emails. Peter Strzok when this issue was raised with him about whether this could have been compromised, pretty much every expert believes the Russians probably were able to hack into her system. They were going into Podesta's, they were trying to go into hers. He decided not to engage on that issue.

The measure is reportedly at a standstill because some of the councilmembers are getting flooded with calls and emails from residents who are understandably quite angry about the idea, what a surprise. Joining me with reaction about this and a lot more, Pam Bondi, Florida's Republican attorney general. Pam, we have seen this issue pop up in California where there's been a push for, of course, full health care benefits for illegal immigrants and driver's licenses, and everybody has driver's licenses, concern about voter fraud. But in Boston it would be people with green cards but lots of categories of people who are illegally in the country but not yet citizens. What do you think about that?"

      "speaker": "PAM BONDI, R-FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "That's right. Well, we're obviously a nation of laws. They're doing this in Maryland, too. They've started it in various cities in local elections in Maryland. It's not illegal in local elections but it is in state and federal. So Laura, just talking about the voter fraud, my gosh, how do you distinguish in Florida on the ballot, you have multiple races. So how do you know that people -- first of all, what kind of I.D. are they going to use. And then what are they going to use, their green card to come vote. And then are they going create separate ballots to ensure that they don't vote in state and federal races, because if they do they could go to prison or be deported. So I don't even know from a practical standpoint how they're going to make that work."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It reminds me of some of the push for legalized marijuana. You start with, oh, it's OK, it's medical marijuana. Then it's the door was open and all of a sudden you're in Colorado, which I love, but lots of people think it's a dooms day. I have got to move on to what they're doing to Brett Kavanaugh. The Hill had a piece today saying that Murkowski and Collins, two more pro-choice type Republican senators both look like they were inclined to view his nomination favorably, I guess perhaps to support his nomination. Tat would kill the Democrats' chances of derailing Kavanaugh. This is just great, now they are trying to get him by association by this Me Too movement by saying a judge he clerked for, Alex Kozinski, on the ninth circuit, himself was charged abusing or accused of abusing clerks. How did Brett Kavanaugh not know about this? This is how low it gets. Tell us about the story and where you think this is going to go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "I think these are the extremists of the party and they have nothing on Judge Kavanaugh, so that's why they're going to go after him with everything they got. This ridiculous rhetoric, they started off right away saying he threatens American lives by his opinions is ridiculous. Let me tell you about my senator, Bill Nelson in Florida. Bill Nelson, before -- after President Trump said four people, gave us four nominees, said he would blanketly oppose all four. How absurd is that, when he previous had supported one of them to be on the bench? So it makes no sense. And these Democrats can either stand shoulder to shoulder, Bill Nelson can, with the extremists of his party, or they can follow the laws. Elections have consequences, and this is our nominee. The three things I always say are so important in a judge and especially a justice, are intelligence, integrity, and humility. He's brilliant. You and I know he's beyond reproach. And I got to know him, you know him much better than I, but I got to know him on person level because I hired his law clerk as my solicitor general. And getting to know him, what was impressive to me about Judge Kavanaugh is his humility. He is a real guy."

And next up, a group of young interns, speaking of interns, claim that they were refused an Uber service because of what they were wearing, and they're going to be here to tell us the whole story, and it's good. Don't go away."

To tell us what caused this expulsion from Uber we're joined by the 20-year-old Matthew Handy along with fellow Congressional interns Elijah Allison and Adria Barrington who were also in the car at the time. First of all, isn't it fun to be an intern in Washington in the summer? Come on, guys. This is the coolest thing to do. Congrats on getting the internships. Let's start with you, Matthew. What the heck happened? I'm getting a hint because of what's in front of you. Where were you going, by the way? You're all together. Where were you heading?"

And he's like, I'm serious, I can't do this ride. So I had this happen -- so last month the same thing happened but the Uber was joking, so that's why we didn't even try to pursue anything."

But as an African-American woman, as a conservative Republican, apparently you're not allowed to think certain things, that's what goes through my mind, you're not allowed to think certain things, otherwise you don't deserve to be in the car. I find that to be reprehensible. It's funny to joke about it, but it's not funny in another way. What was going through your mind?"

So you see this, but you said you respected his decision. I would respectfully say to you, I don't respect his decision because it is not up to us to judge people based on whether -- you can say I disagree with you. You're a Trump supporter, or get a funny comment, but to say you're not worthy of a ride, you're not worthy of a ride, I mean, I think of they'll great civil rights leaders who struggled for people to be able to be who they are without regard to skin color and gender, and now it's your mind. You can discriminate against someone for their mind, for their opinions. Matthew?"

For this to happen, and you always hear about these things so with Sarah Huckabee and all the others, and I'm like, this would never happen to me because, first, I'm not in the public eye, and there's really no reason for this to happen to people like us.

No, we can't take you. If that's the Uber policy, that's fine. Let's just know what that is, you can discriminate on their basis of thinking, their political opinion, and their mind. Adria, I've got to say it doesn't surprise me. You had that horrible thing at Starbucks where you had African-American men who were I think treated unfairly, and that got a lot of coverage. We'll see if we can get some coverage for this. You guys have a great summer, OK? Great to have you in. Let's go hand out with them after the show. We'll be right back. Stay there."
