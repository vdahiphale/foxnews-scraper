He is here to defend that claim, plus the GOP offering impeachment witnesses that the Democrats immediately reject. Lee Smith author of \"Plot Against The President\" is here to explain what they have in common. Also tonight Harmeet Dhillon tells us the shocking biography of the individual we were just speaking about, this new San Francisco D.A. She practices law in San Francisco. She has all the details. Candace Owens is going to reveal why the top 2020 Dems are striking out with black voters.  But first, the socialists versus the globalists that is the focus of tonight's Angle. This was the lead of today's big AP story. Bloomberg's potential entry in the Democratic Presidential Primary has heightened doubts about front runners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.  Now, what have I been telling you for months? The 2020 Democrat field is just as weak as it is wide. For many months, the media's visceral loathing of President Trump has clouded their ability to see reality.",

This Democrat inter-party warfare, it was bound to happen. After all, look, top Trump took down his party's establishment in 2016. As we see a lot of those guys are still working against him in the Intel Community and the deep State Department and the media. And even in his own White House. The problem for the Democrats is that whichever direction they take now, the policies underneath it all, they don't work. So Europe is running away from socialism. America is going to run toward it? Okay, then what? Hope for better employment numbers on a higher GDP? Unlikely and by the way, the new Populist Party in Spain just doubled its numbers in parliament over the weekend there.  Nations from Sweden to Greece are rebelling big time against the wave of Middle Eastern refugees that genius Angela Merkel punished the E.U. with four years ago. So leave it to America's Democrats to side with the parties losing clout in Europe.  The choice we have next election is between preserving our booming economy, our history, and our heritage, the good and bad of it. And reversing or reversing and repudiating all of that.

He is here to defend that claim, plus the GOP offering impeachment witnesses that the Democrats immediately reject. Lee Smith author of \"Plot Against The President\" is here to explain what they have in common. Also tonight Harmeet Dhillon tells us the shocking biography of the individual we were just speaking about, this new San Francisco D.A. She practices law in San Francisco. She has all the details. Candace Owens is going to reveal why the top 2020 Dems are striking out with black voters. But first, the socialists versus the globalists that is the focus of tonight's Angle. This was the lead of today's big AP story. Bloomberg's potential entry in the Democratic Presidential Primary has heightened doubts about front runners Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. Now, what have I been telling you for months? The 2020 Democrat field is just as weak as it is wide. For many months, the media's visceral loathing of President Trump has clouded their ability to see reality."

The two dominant strains in today's Democratic Party spell disaster for them, and for America have met for a bit if they get power back. Now one action is the European-style globalism represented by Biden and Bloomberg. Now what does this look like? Well, think of Emmanuel Macron's friends. A place with a powerful cadre of really rich people who rule over beleaguered working class. We saw this philosophy in action during Bloomberg's nanny state style rules of New York City as Mayor.

It's the favorite of the party's emerging brain trust and it provides passion on the energy. Of course I'm talking about Bernie and AOC and all the new radicals who think life is one come along college campus sit in. Liz Warren a phony by both genealogy and etiology pretends she's not socialist or anti-capitalist, but of course, her policies would seek free market and bankrupt Medicare.

Meanwhile, the Democrats messages, we think some of you are homophobic, but vote for us anyway. It is just pathetic. We will have more on that later in this hour with Candace Owens. This Democrat inter-party warfare, it was bound to happen. After all, look, top Trump took down his party's establishment in 2016. As we see a lot of those guys are still working against him in the Intel Community and the deep State Department and the media. And even in his own White House. The problem for the Democrats is that whichever direction they take now, the policies underneath it all, they don't work. So Europe is running away from socialism. America is going to run toward it? Okay, then what? Hope for better employment numbers on a higher GDP? Unlikely and by the way, the new Populist Party in Spain just doubled its numbers in parliament over the weekend there. Nations from Sweden to Greece are rebelling big time against the wave of Middle Eastern refugees that genius Angela Merkel punished the E.U. with four years ago. So leave it to America's Democrats to side with the parties losing clout in Europe. The choice we have next election is between preserving our booming economy, our history, and our heritage, the good and bad of it. And reversing or reversing and repudiating all of that. On this Veterans Day, we honor all of those who served our armed forces over the years.

His article was titled, \"Laura Ingraham tried to blame immigrants for Democratic success on Tuesday. It's a bad argument. Well, you can clearly see the narrative that he's trying to set.

I think you're agreeing with me. Now I'm confused. This was published in \"The Washington Post\" but when in the end, he basically concedes my thesis. Things got even worse for Bump over the weekend, another bump in the road. It's too easy of a pond, come on. His competitors at \"The New York Times\" then published this inconvenient piece. The fields of Loudoun County are disappearing and their place is row upon row of cookie-cutter townhouses, clip lawns and cul-de-sacs. A suburban landscape for as far as the eye can see. Unlike three decades ago, though the residents are often from other places like India and Korea and when they vote, it is often for Democrats. I look forward to Bump telling \"The New York Times\" why it's factual analysis is racist. Ahead this week will be the most important for the impeachment inquiry that's how you want to call it. I guess we have to. And the GOP. has ample reason to go on offense. Alan Dershowitz and the Clinton Impeachment Manager Bob Barr explain how they can do it.

Collusion that was not a crime, exposing a whistleblower that is not a crime having a conversation with the President of Ukraine that is not a crime. So far, we have no crimes, no high crimes, no misdemeanors, no treason, no bribery.

The frames of the constitution had a great debate and they rejected impeachment on the ground of maladministration. They are trying to redo that they are trying to go back and undo the debate that resulted in the constitutional criteria. It is extremely dangerous. When you allow Congress to make up crimes that means any of us can be the victim of a made up crime. In my book, \"Guilty By Accusation\" I talk about how people make up facts and make up stories, but it is even worse when you make up crimes and when you make them up against duly elected President.

She is the Pentagon top Official on Russia. Here is one revelation I think that is being ignored. Former Ukraine Ambassador Kurt Volker sought a statement that the government of Ukraine would make that would somehow disavow any interference in the U.S. elections and will commit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election interference.

So I believe that they would like to interview them and ask what was going on at Burisma. I will say, it's interestingly to note that they had another partner, as well, Christopher Heinz who is the stepson of former secretary of state John Kerry. It appears that Mr. Heinz knew better. This was part of the reason for him stopping doing business with them, because obviously walking into a situation like that, a government, unfortunately, typically historically plagued by corruption, he knew better than to get involved with that. Hunter Biden, it appears, did not."

I wouldn't have wanted to go to the courts three years out of law school, but maybe he's super smart. But the bottom line is, the way this case has unfolded is very strange, is it not? Elaine Duke, \"New York Times\" writing today was the acting secretary of Homeland Security. She didn't want her name on the policy rationales that were put forth by Jeff Sessions or Stephen Miller, who argued the program encouraged new waves of illegal immigration. Her refusal to cite their policy objections to the program is now at the heart of what legal experts are saying is a major weakness in the government's case, defending the termination of the program. Do you buy that?"
    },

I've been a judge.  A judge can no more till the prosecutor that he can or cannot bring a case or she cannot bring a case then the judge can tell them to fly. It's just not something that within the province of the judiciary. I don't even think this is a close case."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARTHUR",
      "utterance": "And that leads to the central question. There are two questions in this case. One is whether or not the court has judicial review. They don't. This is something that is completely left to the executive branch's discretion, prosecutorial discretion. The other thing is whether they were right, whether the Trump administration was right in winding it down. And they absolutely were. It was an illegal policy. It was about to be challenged by a number of different states. And Attorney General Jeff Sessions, DHS Secretary Elaine Duke had no choice but to unwind the program, to wind it down."

It probably will be five-four, because that is how pathetic it is sometimes at the court. Also, get ready, San Francisco. There is a new radical D.A. in town, Chesa Boudin, who was elected to be the next D.A. this past Saturday. So who is he? He's the son of Weather Underground members in prison for helping murder cops. He was raised by terrorists Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn in Chicago, remember them? Talk about walking down memory lane. And finally, he spent some time as Hugo Chavez's translator. This is like an \"Onion\" article. This is true, I kid you not. So what will his tenure look like? And what will his prosecutorial -- talk about prosecutorial discretion, he'll be doing what? His prosecution of cases will not involve things like quality of life crimes, cries just as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, et cetera.

He ultimately ended up defeating the machine candidate, the candidate who was endorsed by Kamala Harris, Dianne Feinstein, Governor Gavin Newsom, and every luminary in the mainstream Democratic Party here in California.

      "utterance": "I know a lot of you like the Last Bite on our who. It served us well these past two years. It's not going away, don't worry. But we're also going to try something new. Now, you viewers have asked for more input, and we're going to give it to you. So send us your reaction to segments, questions, thoughts on the show, even video questions if you have to impress us. Well, that's fine. We like that. At the end of each show we're going to share them. Go to ingrahamangle@foxnews.com, ingrahamangle@foxnews.com. And happy Veterans Day to all of our soldiers, sailors, air men and marines. Your sacrifice gives us all the opportunity to prosper and live in the greatest nation on the face of the earth. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream and \"Fox News @ Night\" take it all from here. Shannon. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
