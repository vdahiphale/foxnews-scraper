When you hear the party in power and inflation is as high as it is, who cares if we are above or below some other country. It's bad. Inflation is the most important economic indicator politically because it eats away at wages and wage gains, and every single time an ordinary person, anybody goes to the store, they feel it.

In the developing world, I just wrote down here, Japan, Switzerland, France, South Korea, Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, Singapore all have lower inflation than we have. And part of his argument seems to be, well, it's beyond our control. This is a global phenomenon. True to some extent, but that's not the full picture. And there are whole slew of Democratic aligned economists from Larry Summers to Steve Rattner who said the huge spending binge that the Democrats engaged in, especially earlier in the Biden administration really fueled what we're experiencing right now. And for them to try to kind argue, well, it's really not so bad and look at what we have achieved on the economy, there's a \"Politico\" story out just a few days that quoted a Democratic pollster saying that is our worst performing message.

I think that when it comes to the crime issue, when it comes to these education issues, the Democratic Party has really been unable to reset the narrative in a way that would allow them to compete in this election, and it's one of the reasons why I think that we are headed now toward historic wave as opposed to one that, perhaps, even four weeks ago seemed to be more of just a modest normal midterm.",
