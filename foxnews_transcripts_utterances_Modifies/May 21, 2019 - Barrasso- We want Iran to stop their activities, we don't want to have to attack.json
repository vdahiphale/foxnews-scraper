We have got Steve Harrigan in Stillwater, Oklahoma, where they are dealing already with massive flooding, and meteorologist Adam Klotz on where these storms right now could be heading.

A lot of roads like this are basically becoming rivers.  Since this morning, we have been here. We have seen crawfish, fish, snakes with their heads above the water and a pretty strong current. If you look down the road behind me, you can see some cars either completely underwater, or just the tops, just the roofs coming out of the water.   These tornadoes, though, have not been as deadly as predicted. They were expected to be extremely violent, but, as of Tuesday morning, zero casualties from the tornadoes themselves. And that is in part because people were making very quick decisions to save their lives, like this woman.",

These are still being counted up by the National Weather Service. But we're still tracking this line of storms. It's moving off to the east. Now we have got tornado watches in portions of Arkansas, stretching up into Southern Missouri. This entire line of storms is going to be a problem. Now, it's probably not going to make another 20 or 30 tornadoes. But it's going to continue to bring very strong winds and unfortunately heavy rain that's going to end up being some flooding.  We saw that there with Steve widespread, four to eight inches of rain across portions of Northern Oklahoma, running up into Kansas, that as a result becoming a real issue with flooding across the huge area.   And then tracking this system farther to the north, eventually, we're going to be talking about flooding across portions of Illinois. This ground has been absolutely saturated all spring because of rounds of heavy rain and then snowmelt a little farther north. This is not going to help that, as we're looking at a slow mover that's going to be dropping some more rain. Here's your future radar with this system. There's your time stamp. So if you're out in front of this, pay attention to it. It's still going to bring very strong winds, possibly some hail, and an isolated tornado or two overnight, shifting its way through Illinois, eventually into Indiana, up into Michigan by early tomorrow morning. All areas to pay attention to. Not as maybe dangerous as when we were talking this time yesterday. The system has weakened, isolated tornadoes, not widespread tornadoes. But, Neil, still, we're going to be talking about damaging winds up to 60 miles an hour, large hail, and then this flooding issue that we have been seeing. That is something that's definitely going to linger today into tomorrow morning also .",

I use Twitter to get those alerts out to the public when there's a tornado on the ground, so that people that are -- potentially don't have cable TV, they only have smartphones, and they use social media, that they will maybe see that warning and be able to get out of the way of the storms.

And, certainly, you should be watching for that. But, ultimately, tornadoes, usually, they show themselves on the ground first as a swirling dust swirl that looks like -- some people mistake it for smoke if they're not a storm chaser, and they don't know what they're looking at -- looking for.  So you look for that, that swirl on the ground. And the way those storms form is, I mean, you have got -- we got wind coming from multiple directions there. You got what's called the rear flank downdraft that comes wrapping back behind the storm and brings cold, dry air. And that meets that warm, moist air. And those two air masses swirl right there. And that's ultimately how you get that tornado to start forming. And the rotation in the cloud up in the atmosphere, it's usually horizontal, but the updraft from that -- from that supercell bends that horizontal, rolling down to the ground. And that's what forms that tornado.",

      "sentences": "Well, we're a bit above normal this year. But it's a rare year. Since 2011, the unbelievable season back then, most of the years have been at or below normal. And so this particular year, we're running above normal.  Now, what's interesting about this is, in the preseason, looking at it, there was so much warmth predicted by computer modeling across all of the United States, with the exception of Arizona into West Texas, that it had this signature on the models of another very low year.  So I predicted average to below normal this year. What has happened is and what's fascinating is, it seems like the long-range modeling can't detect cold air anymore. So you look at models and say -- we have these climate models go out two, three months. And it's just warm all over the place. In this particular case, the last four, five, six, months have been brutal from Southern Canada into the Central and Northern Plains. Meantime, it's warm in the Southeast. That's the classic setup, cold vs. warm, for what you're seeing out there. So it's winding up being a bigger-than-average year. Now, one thing I will say, Neil, is the amount of water in the ground. And people wonder, well, yesterday, there were only 26 tornadoes, but it had a high risk. Usually, a high risk has more than 26 tornadoes.  It may be that the amount of water in the ground may be capping the temperature just a bit. So we're seeing a lot more heavy rain events, getting rid of the imbalance of the atmosphere through heavy rain, hail, high winds, rather than the widespread tornadic activity. I thought yesterday and today, we would have an over and under of 60 or 70 tornadoes. And we're well under that right now. So that is fortunate.",

Then it starts to diminish after that.   Looking at the overall pattern, though, there's still going to be a lot of chilly air relative to averages across much of the Central part of the United States. And nothing is really going to budge that that Southeast heat wave way that's going on for next couple of weeks. So I would say that there's going to be above normal overall the next couple of weeks or so. By the way, this current feature is weakening. But look out Thursday. It comes across the Great Lakes, starts sliding east- southeast. And it wouldn't be surprising in the Northeast, New York, Pennsylvania, on to Western New England, if we saw some tornadic activity on Thursday.",

He didn't invoke executive privilege, because I think his lawyers have understood that by letting Don McGahn speak to the FBI, and we think -- we don't know -- testify before a grand jury, the president waived executive privilege. So they have another privilege called immunity. And the argument is this. The Congress can't subpoena the president and make him explain his thoughts. Therefore, it can't subpoena the president's inner circle and make anyone in the inner circle reveal their thoughts. That is not the same as executive privilege. The question is, will it will it last? The last time the courts looked at this, the president lost.

These are still being counted up by the National Weather Service. But we're still tracking this line of storms. It's moving off to the east. Now we have got tornado watches in portions of Arkansas, stretching up into Southern Missouri. This entire line of storms is going to be a problem. Now, it's probably not going to make another 20 or 30 tornadoes. But it's going to continue to bring very strong winds and unfortunately heavy rain that's going to end up being some flooding. We saw that there with Steve widespread, four to eight inches of rain across portions of Northern Oklahoma, running up into Kansas, that as a result becoming a real issue with flooding across the huge area. And then tracking this system farther to the north, eventually, we're going to be talking about flooding across portions of Illinois. This ground has been absolutely saturated all spring because of rounds of heavy rain and then snowmelt a little farther north. This is not going to help that, as we're looking at a slow mover that's going to be dropping some more rain. Here's your future radar with this system. There's your time stamp. So if you're out in front of this, pay attention to it. It's still going to bring very strong winds, possibly some hail, and an isolated tornado or two overnight, shifting its way through Illinois, eventually into Indiana, up into Michigan by early tomorrow morning. All areas to pay attention to. Not as maybe dangerous as when we were talking this time yesterday. The system has weakened, isolated tornadoes, not widespread tornadoes. But, Neil, still, we're going to be talking about damaging winds up to 60 miles an hour, large hail, and then this flooding issue that we have been seeing. That is something that's definitely going to linger today into tomorrow morning also ."

But, I mean, actually, if I could have, I was trying to get closer to that storm. But I got stuck in the mud right there, and I couldn't go any further because I was a -- there's a farmer's house right there, and I couldn't get through it."

Like, you can't -- I couldn't go out there day after day and chase these storms across the country and spend just hours and thousands of miles per week chasing after the storms. It comes out of the passion. So I have a passion for storms and weather. I just love being in it and experiencing it. And I -- and, ultimately, I like to document it as well. And documenting -- a part of the documentation is giving those warnings out to the public. And so I use Twitter. I use Twitter to get those alerts out to the public when there's a tornado on the ground, so that people that are -- potentially don't have cable TV, they only have smartphones, and they use social media, that they will maybe see that warning and be able to get out of the way of the storms. And also the National Weather Service also watches Twitter for those reports."

      "utterance": "You know, Aaron, anything different in these tornadoes you're seeing? We're told that they're a little bit more severe, they hang around for a while, cover a wider radius, in some cases up to 12 miles. I don't know what the truth is here, but anything distinct about these latest ones?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAYJACK",
      "utterance": "Well, they're -- certainly, tornadoes don't get as big as 12 miles. The biggest one has been about two-and-a-half miles. But the supercell themselves, now, all those can cover counties and multiple counties, and they can be 40, 50 miles wide. And the tornado itself generally covers a little smaller area. But, I mean, the storms, I don't think the storms are getting any worse than they potentially were in the past. They may be more frequent. But I think we see the same strength of storms. And the tornadoes are just like the trails they were several years ago. I'm not seeing anything different with tornadoes right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So when they hit the ground -- the 12 miles, I meant to say that the area they cover once they do hit, and that that's why -- and I don't know how true that is. But what's the process? I mean, what do you see? They zig and zag? It's hard to get an estimate of where it goes. I mean, it could come right at you, for example. But what do you see?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAYJACK",
      "utterance": "Well, so a lot of times, most people -- like, when you're looking at a storm, you think you're going to be -- you're going to looking at the cloud, the deck of the cloud to look for that funnel to come down. And, certainly, you should be watching for that. But, ultimately, tornadoes, usually, they show themselves on the ground first as a swirling dust swirl that looks like -- some people mistake it for smoke if they're not a storm chaser, and they don't know what they're looking at -- looking for. So you look for that, that swirl on the ground. And the way those storms form is, I mean, you have got -- we got wind coming from multiple directions there. You got what's called the rear flank downdraft that comes wrapping back behind the storm and brings cold, dry air. And that meets that warm, moist air. And those two air masses swirl right there. And that's ultimately how you get that tornado to start forming. And the rotation in the cloud up in the atmosphere, it's usually horizontal, but the updraft from that -- from that supercell bends that horizontal, rolling down to the ground. And that's what forms that tornado."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE BASTARDI, WEATHERBELL CHIEF FORECASTER",
      "utterance": "Well, we're a bit above normal this year. But it's a rare year. Since 2011, the unbelievable season back then, most of the years have been at or below normal. And so this particular year, we're running above normal. Now, what's interesting about this is, in the preseason, looking at it, there was so much warmth predicted by computer modeling across all of the United States, with the exception of Arizona into West Texas, that it had this signature on the models of another very low year. So I predicted average to below normal this year. What has happened is and what's fascinating is, it seems like the long-range modeling can't detect cold air anymore. So you look at models and say -- we have these climate models go out two, three months. And it's just warm all over the place. In this particular case, the last four, five, six, months have been brutal from Southern Canada into the Central and Northern Plains. Meantime, it's warm in the Southeast. That's the classic setup, cold vs. warm, for what you're seeing out there. So it's winding up being a bigger-than-average year. Now, one thing I will say, Neil, is the amount of water in the ground. And people wonder, well, yesterday, there were only 26 tornadoes, but it had a high risk. Usually, a high risk has more than 26 tornadoes. It may be that the amount of water in the ground may be capping the temperature just a bit. So we're seeing a lot more heavy rain events, getting rid of the imbalance of the atmosphere through heavy rain, hail, high winds, rather than the widespread tornadic activity. I thought yesterday and today, we would have an over and under of 60 or 70 tornadoes. And we're well under that right now. So that is fortunate."

    {
      "speaker": "BASTARDI",
      "utterance": "Well, the core of that tornado season -- it's like we're at the height of the hurricane season right now. Core of the tornado season is late May. Then it starts to diminish after that. Looking at the overall pattern, though, there's still going to be a lot of chilly air relative to averages across much of the Central part of the United States. And nothing is really going to budge that that Southeast heat wave way that's going on for next couple of weeks. So I would say that there's going to be above normal overall the next couple of weeks or so. By the way, this current feature is weakening. But look out Thursday. It comes across the Great Lakes, starts sliding east- southeast. And it wouldn't be surprising in the Northeast, New York, Pennsylvania, on to Western New England, if we saw some tornadic activity on Thursday."

A redacted version of the special counsel Mueller's report documented what he calls alarming misconduct on obstruction of justice by the president. Others disagree with that. Donaldson and Hicks, he says, were critical witnesses to this behavior and must be heard from. We will have more after this."

Today, I walked them through what the Department of Defense has been doing since May 3, when we received credible intelligence about threats to our interests in the Middle East and to American forces, and how we acted on that credible intelligence. That intelligence is borne out in attacks. And I would say it's also deterred attacks. We have deterred attacks, based on our reposturing of assets, deterred attacks against American forces. Our biggest focus at this point is to prevent Iranian miscalculation. We do not want the situation to escalate. This is about deterrence, not about war. We're not about going to war. This is about continuing to protect our interests in the Middle East and conducting the missions that they're -- we are there to perform."

We don't know what that intelligence is. We hope to get a sense of whether the administration succeeded at justifying this upped ante in the region with Senator Barrasso in just a second. Ahead of that, we do want to keep you up to date on what's going on with subpoenas. Every day, there seem to be more going out. Chairman Jerry Nadler of the House Judiciary Committee issuing of subpoenas now for Annie Donaldson, a former chief of staff for Don McGahn, the former White House chief counsel, who has also been subpoenaed to testify, and has passed up the opportunity, and also for Hope Hicks, former White House communications director.

But Collins says his colleagues don't want to hear directly from the messenger. And more on these subpoenas that were issued in the last few minutes, Neil, for Annie Donaldson and Hope Hicks. Annie Donaldson is like the note taker in chief when it comes to the special counsel investigation. She was the one whose notes documented these interactions between then White House counsel Don McGahn and the president over these allegations of obstruction. So her notes are really part of the record of the backbone of the special counsel report. And then Hope Hicks also had a ringside seat, if you will, as the White House communications adviser and a direct adviser to the president on all of these issues related to Russia, Neil."

The argument that was made by the Justice Department yesterday as to why the president doesn't want Don McGahn to testify was an interesting one. He didn't invoke executive privilege, because I think his lawyers have understood that by letting Don McGahn speak to the FBI, and we think -- we don't know -- testify before a grand jury, the president waived executive privilege. So they have another privilege called immunity. And the argument is this. The Congress can't subpoena the president and make him explain his thoughts. Therefore, it can't subpoena the president's inner circle and make anyone in the inner circle reveal their thoughts. That is not the same as executive privilege. The question is, will it will it last? The last time the courts looked at this, the president lost. And it was Harriet Miers, the exact same situation, former White House counsel, now in private practice. She was White House counsel for George -- President George W. Bush."

So I think, ultimately, Don McGahn will testify. He doesn't need my advice, but, if I were his lawyers, I would have told him to go there today and say, look, I'm here because I respect this body and I respect the subpoena. But I have a client, a former client, not the president, the presidency. And that client says, I shouldn't testify. So, you want me to testify? Go to court, I'll do whatever the court says."

    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "I think that's probably the case. If you want me to predict how this is going to go, it'll depend upon the preceding. Example, if the House of Representatives begins formal impeachment proceedings, which takes months to get going, that will narrow the president's executive privilege and expand the number of people who will have to testify and have to produce documents, because, when the House is in impeachment mode, and the target of the impeachment is the president, he can't impede that. We know that from the Nixon and Clinton experiences."

Republican strategist John Thomas, Democratic strategist David Burstein, and, last but not least, Kat Timpf. So, Dave, to you first on this notion. When Americans were polling, even though a majority still are against it, it's only 51 percent; 43 percent don't have a problem with it. What did you make of that?"

I think most people don't actually know what socialism is. So people aren't necessarily saying they want Swedish-style socialism, as the president likes to say. But the reality is that people are frustrated, and capitalism does need improvements. And even Republicans have said this, too. As people are looking around, they're looking at their pocketbooks, they're looking at interest rates, they're looking at their dwindling portfolios, and they're saying, can't we be doing better?"

They absolutely should be aware, and the people who have said that they are sympathetic with socialism or with some form of socialism, like AOC or like Bernie Sanders, have done a good job of kind of branding it as, look at -- we're going to give you. We're going to give you these things. They don't mention that in order for the government to give anyone anything, they have to take from someone else. And it might be some of the people who support it that they would be taking from. So I think that Republicans need to do a better job of making that more clear, because you come off as being generous if you're a socialist.

And to do that, we wanted to show that we have the capacity to attack them if need be, and we have the willingness to do it if we have to. But no one wants to do that. We want them to stop the activities that they have been doing. We know that by the sanctions and the increasing pressure against them, they're feeling the heat. They're feeling the heat in Iran, and they're feeling the heat in terms of the money that they have been giving to their -- to the Houthis and Hezbollah and Hamas. They're not able to do the sort of terrorist activities because the money just isn't there for them anymore."

      "utterance": "Well, of course Iran has -- part of its income is selling oil. Now, we have increased sanctions on that oil. And that's why Iran is feeling the pressure. I know China would love to be involved and get that source of energy. Energy is called the master resource for a reason. But, clearly, what the United States has done with sanctions against oil, against their metals, has really impacted their economy and their ability to fund the kind of terror that they're used to funding."

And everyone in the party came down on -- like a ton of bricks. What do you think of what he said?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRASSO",
      "utterance": "Well, he's one man who has his own personal opinion. I have come to a very different opinion from reviewing the documents. Look, no collusion, none. No conspiracy, none. To me, this is over. It's beyond us. If the House of Representatives wants to do what they seem to want to do, which is travel the path to impeachment, let them. There's going to be no appetite for that in the United States Senate."

There may be sort of a chill between he and the White House. Wouldn't be the first time it's been reported. But that already promising to primary the guy for departing from the president seems a bit much. What do you think?"

Let's keep it going. Let's keep doing the things that the Republicans have been doing in terms of lowering taxes, letting people keep more of their hard- earned money. And the other thing I here at home is, do not take away the health insurance that I get through work, and do not put me on a one-size-fits-all health insurance plan. But I'm not hearing anything..."

      "speaker": "BARRASSO",
      "utterance": "Well, that's not come up with my colleagues. We had a full lunch discussion on trade and the importance of what the president is doing on trade. But these other things have not come up. As far as the Senate's concerned, this -- the investigation is complete. This is over."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRASSO",
      "utterance": "Well, once you talk about what socialism means, which is one- size-fits-all health insurance, people losing their Medicare Advantage, losing their health insurance they get from work, when they see what happens -- and you saw this in the elections in Australia the other day. People don't want to pay higher taxes and higher cost of living. They want to deal with what's going on in their own lives. And I think that the definition of socialism, once you explain what it means for people in this land of opportunity, where the government can either crush or create opportunity, and taxes and regulations, which is what socialism brings, make it a lot harder in a land of opportunity to do the kind of things we'd like to do to continue with a strong, healthy, and growing economy."

Today, 20 separate complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and five lawsuits alleging everything from groping to indecent exposure to lewd comments to requests for sex. One woman we heard from, her name is Jamelia Fairley from Sanford, Florida, said she was asked by someone she works with at McDonald's how much it would cost to have sex with her 1-year-old daughter. Here's what else she told the protest."

      "speaker": "FLOCK",
      "utterance": "The workers today, Neil, joined by the \"Top Chef\" host. Her name is Padma Lakshmi. Perhaps you watch that show. She was on hand to talk about her support for the workers. McDonald's says, well, 95 percent of our restaurants are operated by franchisees, and we can't control them. She said, no, you control what kind of pickle they put on their sandwich and don't let them do any variation from that. You should be able to enforce a no-tolerance policy when it comes to sexual harassment. Take a listen."

      "utterance": "McDonald's needs to do way more than just encourage.

      "utterance": "\"By strengthening our overall policy, McDonald's is sending a clear message that we are committed to creating and sustaining a culture of trust where employees feel safe, valued and respected.\" Employees say they have complained about this before and have -- the company's done nothing. I leave you with a picture perhaps of another protest going on outside McDonald's today. These are the folks, McDonaldsCruelty.com. They don't like the way McDonald's treats their chickens. Apart from having people eat them, they don't think it's humane treatment of chickens. They will be at the company's shareholders meeting, which will be Thursday in Dallas. I think McDonald's should never have left their corporate headquarters in the suburbs, where you couldn't really get out in front to protest. It was set way back off the street. Now they're here in Chicago, and, well, all bets are off ."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No sooner had Republican Congressman Justin Amash indicated that he thinks the president had impeachable conduct than he was already challenged, a promised primary challenge coming for him. Maybe it doesn't matter to Congressman Amash, though he is apparently gearing up for a run against the president of the United States as a Libertarian candidate. The Federalist senior editor, Fox News contributor Mollie Hemingway on that. Is that true?"
    },

      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm not sure if he will be running for Libertarian candidate for president, but he certainly would be a strong contender if he did. I'm a little surprised we're getting this much coverage of his call for impeachment, because he has been calling for impeachment of Donald Trump for at least two years. He did it in May of 2017, June of 2018. And now he's done it again. And this case, this time, it's, I think, not even his strongest version of the argument. He didn't explain exactly why he should be impeached. He smeared William Barr unfairly, saying that William Barr had mischaracterized Mueller's Russia report, which is just not true. He says he read the whole report and somehow came to a different conclusion than Barr, even though we all know that there were no indictments for treasonous collusion with Russia to steal the 2016 election, and no indictments for obstruction of justice. And I know that's disappointing to people who dislike Donald Trump. But that's just the fact."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I don't know. But just speaking as someone with libertarian sympathies, it would be good if libertarians who claimed to care about surveillance of people in the country would reflect that, when you have a high-profile case of people surveilling political opponents using wiretaps, national security letters, overseas intelligence assets, and a number of things where we actually could use some leadership from people, including people who dislike Donald Trump, to say, were these things appropriate and were they right?"

I mean, they're piling up like planes at La Guardia now, but what do you make of them?"

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I don't know. I think Jerry Nadler, I sat across from him on the train the day after the election, where he revealed his impeachment plans for Donald Trump on that day. So we know this is all part of an impeachment effort, which is -- that is his right as Judiciary Committee chairman, but he doesn't seem to be having a good go of it thus far. He's had trouble getting people to actually testify, in part because I think he's being too aggressive and not working with people ."

But the president realized this was really an issue that was impacting Americans, that Americans were dying at an alarming rate. And so, since day one, the president has made this a priority. And there's really three prongs about what we're doing. We're making sure to educate young people, so they don't go down this path. We're educating doctors, so they don't make the high-dose prescriptions that they used to. We're getting more and more people into treatment every day than ever before. And we're also supporting our law enforcement, both at the national, state and federal level, to make sure that we're going after this in every way we can ."

And therein lies this dependence. But the pharmaceutical companies come back and say, we didn't create that problem. Why are you pointing the finger at us? You say?"

One of the programs that I fund here at the White House is a $100 million grant to communities, to local coalitions to have them educate kids from 12 to 18 about the dangers of drug use. And what we're seeing in these communities -- and it's a record level of support from any administration -- so, from this president, these drug-free communities, there are almost 800 across the country.
