Any Democrat who might have been inclined to support him fell away after the Attorney General's report. And the reason he resigned today had nothing to do with the whole COVID nursing home thing, it was because he saw that after the Attorney General's report, he did not have the minimum level of support necessary to stay in office. And today was very strategic. His event was very strategic. It began with his lawyer going on for nearly an hour attacking that report, nearly line by line, questioning the credibility of all of the allegations. And then, the governor himself came out, and again, attack the report, questioning its credibility. And he admitted to small things. He said, well, you know, my sense of humor can offend people sometimes. And maybe I'm an old fogy, and I haven't realized how the rules for interactions between men and women in the workplace have changed. But he was clear to say that he did nothing wrong. And this is for really, for a couple of reasons. He still might face criminal charges. He couldn't very well come out today and admit it. So, he denied everything in terms of any potential charges against him. And the other thing is, he's 63 years old. He thinks maybe in a few years, things could change, conditions could change, something unexpected could happen, and he might be able to run for office again.

That could put the infrastructure bill on hold for weeks if not months.\" So it's not exactly the finish line as of yet. We're back with our panel, Bill Bennett, Harold Ford Jr., and Byron York. Byron, that is the key, this linkage, and what happens in the Housee. BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": It is, and progressives are going to make a lot of noise about it in the House. But really, I think the thing to look at here is we are entering this era of just crazy federal spending. Congress has already passed in March, signed into law by the president, a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill. Now we have this $1.1 trillion infrastructure bill. That's $3 trillion in extra spending right there. And now they want to add the $3.5 trillion on top of that. I don't think they are going to get it. I don't think they are going to get all $3.5 trillion, but they are going to get a lot. So we may be looking at $5 plus trillion in extra spending this year. And Democrats have pulled it off without having a majority of seats in the Senate. It's tied 50-50.

Let that not be forgotten, and let's carry forward on that. But I'm glad this chapter is over. I think there are a lot of lessons here too, and a major win for the media.

Any Democrat who might have been inclined to support him fell away after the Attorney General's report. And the reason he resigned today had nothing to do with the whole COVID nursing home thing, it was because he saw that after the Attorney General's report, he did not have the minimum level of support necessary to stay in office. And today was very strategic. His event was very strategic. It began with his lawyer going on for nearly an hour attacking that report, nearly line by line, questioning the credibility of all of the allegations. And then, the governor himself came out, and again, attack the report, questioning its credibility. And he admitted to small things. He said, well, you know, my sense of humor can offend people sometimes. And maybe I'm an old fogy, and I haven't realized how the rules for interactions between men and women in the workplace have changed. But he was clear to say that he did nothing wrong. And this is for really, for a couple of reasons. He still might face criminal charges. He couldn't very well come out today and admit it. So, he denied everything in terms of any potential charges against him. And the other thing is, he's 63 years old. He thinks maybe in a few years, things could change, conditions could change, something unexpected could happen, and he might be able to run for office again. So, that's what this resignation today was about."

It was Democrats nationally, and state and local New York Democrats that eventually brought in into his governorship right now. They're going to be those who quarrel with his resignation speech, but at the end of the day he resigned. And it allows the state to move forward, it allows the new governor -- Lieutenant Governor Hochul to take over and manage the recovery, managed the surge, the COVID-19 surge and tackle the crime and restore public safety across the state. But it's important to note, Democrats held him to the same standard that they've held others around these issues.

We will follow this likely to the Supreme Court. The National Security Agency's internal watchdog says it will investigate allegations that the agency, quote, improperly targeted the communications of a member of the U.S. news media. This follows Tucker Carlson's claims the NSA tried to shut down his show. Conservatives have for weeks demanded an investigation into Carlson's claim that a major U.S. spy agency targeted his program in any way. A northern Virginia school board is holding its first meeting right now since a fiery session in June we brought you, featured parents upset over a new transgender policy. Correspondent Anita Vogel tells us what's happened tonight in Loudoun County, Virginia. Good evening, Anita."

      "utterance": "Well, good evening, Bret. Tonight the board is considering a number of policies about how to treat transgender students. And it is really dividing the community over what exactly is a priority. Let's take a look at what's on the agenda tonight. First, whether children should be able to use the bathroom or locker room of their choice. Second, whether to require teachers and students to call fellow students by their preferred pronoun, and whether to allow students consistent with their gender I.D. to have access to participate in extracurricular activities, including sports. Right now, inside the building they are taking a break. But when they come back, they may also talk about whether to allow students to keep their gender preference at school private from their parents if they choose. While a number of parents support all of these policies, others say somewhere in this social agenda, education got lost."

      "utterance": "Now the student got -- the district, rather, got quite a lesson in how not to run a meeting back in June, so they are doing a lot of things differently tonight. First of all, they have hired extra private security, and they are limiting the number of parents who are allowed inside the building at one time to just 20. Some parents have been speaking virtually, but most are speaking in person. And you can really feel the extra security here. So far people have been very passionate inside, but also very calm. Now, the board will plan to meet tonight as late as 10:00 p.m. But if they don't finish up this evening, then they will take a vote tomorrow. And very interesting, there is media here from all over the world very interested in what is happening in U.S. public education. There are crews here from Japan, from Denmark, and even Sweden. Bret, back to you."

First, here what some of our FOX affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 32 in Chicago where another round of severe storms is expected today. Forecasters confirmed at least six tornadoes touched down Monday. Severe weather knocked down trees and power lines, causing some outages. And this is a live look at St. Louis from FOX 2, the arch there, the big story there tonight, Missouri's 200th birthday. Missouri became the nation's 24th state in 1821. Ice cream socials are being held across the show me state to celebrate the bicentennial. That's tonight's live look outside the beltway from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "It was significant, this passage of this infrastructure bill today. The vote alone was a statement. You had 69 senators voting yea, 30 nay. Again, a bipartisan piece of legislation. However, this is how \"The New York Times\" looks at it going forward. The measure faces, quote, \"a potentially rocky and time-consuming path in the House where Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a majority of the nearly 100 member progressive caucus have said they will not vote on it unless and until the Senate pass as separate, even more ambitious $3.5 trillion social policy bill this fall. That could put the infrastructure bill on hold for weeks if not months.\" So it's not exactly the finish line as of yet. We're back with our panel, Bill Bennett, Harold Ford Jr., and Byron York. Byron, that is the key, this linkage, and what happens in the Housee. BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": It is, and progressives are going to make a lot of noise about it in the House. But really, I think the thing to look at here is we are entering this era of just crazy federal spending. Congress has already passed in March, signed into law by the president, a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill. Now we have this $1.1 trillion infrastructure bill. That's $3 trillion in extra spending right there. And now they want to add the $3.5 trillion on top of that. I don't think they are going to get it. I don't think they are going to get all $3.5 trillion, but they are going to get a lot. So we may be looking at $5 plus trillion in extra spending this year. And Democrats have pulled it off without having a majority of seats in the Senate. It's tied 50-50. And if they're able to pull off $5 trillion or $6 trillion in extra spending, that's an astonishing accomplishment with terrible, terrible repercussions for the economy."

But, talking about this bill, Bill Bennett, it is a bipartisan effort, and there is no doubt that people argue there has to be improvement to infrastructure around the country. But by tying it to this second bill, don't Democrats risk -- you worked for Ronald Reagan, and he said you have got to take the win. You've got to take half-a-loaf. Don't they risk not getting it across the finish line."

      "utterance": "I do think they risk that. I'll defer to the former member Harold and to close observer Byron, but yes, I do think they risk that, very much so, because this one they've got. They had 19 Republicans sign on to this. But this monster, this $3.5, $3.7 trillion, are they confident that they have Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, or do they just believe that under reconciliation, which is the vehicle they will use to get this monster through, that they will just pare it down, satisfy their conscience that way, Manchin and Sinema, and still have this huge thing? They have Scylla and Charybdis. Scylla is the House progressives, and the Senate they have got Sinema and Manchin. Those are serious obstacles to navigate."

But why isn't it phrased the other way? Why isn't the pressure on House Speaker Pelosi to put this bill, now passed the Senate, on the floor for an up or down vote and see what happens?"

This is the largest and most significant infrastructure bill that has passed since the 1950s, the national highway bill, transportation bill which Eisenhower passed along with the help of the very first Al Gore, Al Gore's father, who was a U.S. senator. Two, it was done in a bipartisanship way. Hopefully we build some legislative muscle and memory about how to address big things, including maybe they will deal with crime and immigration and how we more easily distribute economic growth to urban and rural America alike. To your direct question, Bret, the pressure does move to the House. Speaker Pelosi has proven to be very adept, an adept legislator. We shall see. Thee got the healthcare bill passed for Obama, and it sounded today like President Biden was asking in the kindness and most strenuous of ways, pass this fracture bill."
