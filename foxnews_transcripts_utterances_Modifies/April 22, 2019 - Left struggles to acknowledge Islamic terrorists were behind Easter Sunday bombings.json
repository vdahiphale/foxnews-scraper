      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" The holiest day of the Christian calendar turned to tragedy yesterday as you know in Sri Lanka. In a series of coordinated attacks, suicide bombers struck three Catholic Churches, as well as hotels in cities across the country. At least 290 people were murdered, hundreds more were wounded.  Sri Lankan authorities say the attackers were affiliated with a local terror group. The attackers were radical Muslims. Their motives were religious. Their targets were Christians. None of that is speculation.  It is true. And maybe because it is so true and so obviously true nobody in authority wanted to say it out loud.  So instead, they went to great lengths to avoid the clear language, quote, \"The attacks on tourists and Easter worshipers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity,\" tweeted Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton used the same awkward phrase. \"I am praying for everyone affected by today's horrific attack on Easter worshipers and travelers in Sri Lanka,\" she wrote.  Easter worshipers. Why don't you say Christians? Nobody worships Easter.  There is a reason for course, euphemisms are never accidental. Our leaders believe Christians are the problem, they are the dangerous ones. They can't be trusted. Tell them the truth and they might go crazy and organize a new Crusade, unsheathe their swords and march on Jerusalem. You never with Christians. Just tonight, \"The Washington Post\" ran a story with his headline, quote, \"Sri Lanka church bombing stoke far-right anger in the West.\" As if you have to be some kind of Nazi to be upset about church bombings. That's what they seem to think. That's why our leaders consistently ignore the persecutions of Christians around the world when U.S. policy contributes to that persecution and it does, they say nothing about it.  For example, less than 20 years after we overthrew Saddam Hussein, three quarters of Iraq's once thriving Christian population is gone. They have either been murdered by Islamic extremists, ISIS in some cases, or they have been driven out of the country as refugees. In Syria, Christians live for generations under protection of the Assad family. They don't all have to say that anymore or even know it, but it doesn't make it any less true, it is true and you can talk to the hundreds of thousands of Christians who fled the country since the U.S. began supporting the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad if you want to know details.  But no one in the American media ever asks their opinion and nobody cares.  Nobody cares that so many of our allies in the Middle East, countries that receive billions in U.S. tax dollars every year repress Christianity.   Afghanistan for example, receives billions from us every year. Why? So we can turn it into Belgium. But right now in Afghanistan converting to Christianity carries a death sentence, if you are a Muslim. The same is true in Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- both countries backed by the United States. In Egypt, conversion is legally restricted and while it doesn't carry a death sentence, poll shows that most of the public in Egypt wishes it did.  So where is our State Department in all of this? The State Department who spends a lot of time looking out for the human rights of people in countries we can't pronounce. They ignore it. When was the last time, the United States pushed another country to treat Christians better? Well, in some cases, it would be pretty easy to do that, we could demand that Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or Afghanistan -- countries were dependent on us -- implement full freedom of religion before we give them any more USAID. Why would we do that? Because we are afraid of being criticized by the nihilist at \"The Washington Post?\" Maajid Nawaz is the founder of Quilliam and the author of \"Radical: My Journey Out of Islamist Extremism,\" and he joins us tonight. We are always happy to have him. So, explain if you would the thinking behind not just being straightforward with the public about an event like the one we saw yesterday in Sri Lanka.",

Unfortunately, some of our leaders and in particular some of the political leaders that you've named are suffering from what I believe is an intellectual and moral retreat from our enlightenment values and also there's a level of political cynicism involved here as well. The political -- the intellectual and moral side, they, for a while now whether when Barack Obama was President or even after, they had been unable to, and I've been calling it the Voldemort effect even on your show, they've been unable to name Islamist extremism by name and jihadist terrorism being as violent manifestation because they genuinely believe that a bigger threat due to their political perspective is white supremacy and far-right extremism, and then of course, there's the pragmatic political side of things they are pandering to a certain vote base and they fear that by naming these things, even if they wanted to, it would cause them trouble with their vote base.  And that's not how I operate. It's not how I think any decent human being should operate. What happened in New Zealand was a white supremacist terror attack and what happened what's happened in Sri Lanka now is a jihadist terror attack and it behooves us all to speak plainly about this so that we can address these problems head-on.",

It is lazy bait journalism and I advise fellow journalists and broadcasters not to stoop to this level.  I could do that for example after the New Zealand white supremacist terrorist attack. I could have said that the East fears a backlash from jihadists and I could have hand-selected and quote not only Islamist and jihadist reactions to the New Zealand attack to try and portray the fact that only the jihadists and Islamists what upset about it. It's a dishonest way to address any issue post-crisis. I think sadly, Tucker, too many people play politics with tragedy and they allow for their own framework and their own biases to influence how they view human tragedy and then I use that to peddle their own political narrative and it is often not the right thing and I think we should all try and be as consistent as possible.",

These occurred on Palm Sunday, a coordinated attack a couple of years ago on Christians in December around Christmas time at the seat of the Coptic Pope, Saint Mark's Cathedral in Cairo.

Instead of fixing this or even trying, politicians tell us that we need to just bring in new people in order to keep our population stable. Elizabeth Warren recently proposed giving a $50,000.00 student loan amnesty to all American college grads. Here's a counterproposal. Why not forgive all the student loans of Americans who get married and have kids? It might help. Why is that crazy? Penny Nance is the President of Concerned Women for America and she joins us tonight. Penny, thanks very much for coming on. So most Americans want to have more children than they can afford.

We were out in California all week in Los Angeles, supposedly one of the richest cities in the world and in some ways, it is. But the video you're watching shows something else. California is poor meandering trash filled streets right in the middle of the city, right downtown, block after block, homeless encampments along the sidewalks blanketing downtown LA. The footage you're watching starts at 5th Street and San Pedro and goes west. Again block after block, tent after tent. This is how the poor spend Easter Sunday in California. They weren't clustered along a single road either, it wasn't just like Skid Row. It was like many Skid Rows. We drove down three completely different blocks and the encampments just continued. It looks like Tegucigalpa or Port-au-Prince, but it's not; it's America's second largest city. The encampments begin just two blocks away from Little Tokyo, one of LA's major tourist destinations. Nearby apartments rent for 3,500 bucks a month. You might be wondering with so many people priced out of local housing, the people are literally living in RVs, miles of RV's parked along the streets and as you're watching here, in tents. Why wouldn't local leaders want to slow or stop the flow of new arrivals to get prices under control? To opening up new housing? %They're doing the opposite. LA is a sanctuary city in a sanctuary state. Every politician there with any ambition will denounce our borders an atrocity and that immigration enforcement is an abomination. The poor in California are an afterthought, one of the reasons why they're multiplying. That's why when California Governor Gavin Newsom decided to fight poverty last week, he flew to another country to do it, El Salvador.  The same people who want no limits on people moving here, he can't even house the people who already live here. It tells you a lot. Well, today is Earth Day as you may know, a day to celebrate the Earth.  That's a good thing for the record. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio presides over the dirtiest city in the United States. He enjoys taking his SUV convoy all over the city or taking a helicopter ride to the gym, but don't worry, he has got a plan for absolving his own guilt, restrict the behavior of other people. He wants to pass the Green New Deal, which he says will ban New York's iconic skyscrapers. Watch this.",

I know where that three percent of tree cover went, I think they were all used to print transcripts of the Mueller report and it's killing the planet, but that's what Earth Day is meant to be -- doing something about the filth in your own cities. It goes back to the way Labor Day has been transformed. Labor Day was partly in its 19th Century origins about the order and cleanliness that man had imposed on a wild environment and now, as you see on the streets of Los Angeles; even that has to be returned to a primitive and brutish state.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" The holiest day of the Christian calendar turned to tragedy yesterday as you know in Sri Lanka. In a series of coordinated attacks, suicide bombers struck three Catholic Churches, as well as hotels in cities across the country. At least 290 people were murdered, hundreds more were wounded. Sri Lankan authorities say the attackers were affiliated with a local terror group. The attackers were radical Muslims. Their motives were religious. Their targets were Christians. None of that is speculation.  It is true. And maybe because it is so true and so obviously true nobody in authority wanted to say it out loud. So instead, they went to great lengths to avoid the clear language, quote, \"The attacks on tourists and Easter worshipers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity,\" tweeted Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton used the same awkward phrase. \"I am praying for everyone affected by today's horrific attack on Easter worshipers and travelers in Sri Lanka,\" she wrote. Easter worshipers. Why don't you say Christians? Nobody worships Easter.  There is a reason for course, euphemisms are never accidental. Our leaders believe Christians are the problem, they are the dangerous ones. They can't be trusted. Tell them the truth and they might go crazy and organize a new Crusade, unsheathe their swords and march on Jerusalem. You never with Christians. Just tonight, \"The Washington Post\" ran a story with his headline, quote, \"Sri Lanka church bombing stoke far-right anger in the West.\" As if you have to be some kind of Nazi to be upset about church bombings. That's what they seem to think. That's why our leaders consistently ignore the persecutions of Christians around the world when U.S. policy contributes to that persecution and it does, they say nothing about it. For example, less than 20 years after we overthrew Saddam Hussein, three quarters of Iraq's once thriving Christian population is gone. They have either been murdered by Islamic extremists, ISIS in some cases, or they have been driven out of the country as refugees. In Syria, Christians live for generations under protection of the Assad family. They don't all have to say that anymore or even know it, but it doesn't make it any less true, it is true and you can talk to the hundreds of thousands of Christians who fled the country since the U.S. began supporting the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad if you want to know details. But no one in the American media ever asks their opinion and nobody cares.  Nobody cares that so many of our allies in the Middle East, countries that receive billions in U.S. tax dollars every year repress Christianity. Afghanistan for example, receives billions from us every year. Why? So we can turn it into Belgium. But right now in Afghanistan converting to Christianity carries a death sentence, if you are a Muslim. The same is true in Saudi Arabia and the UAE -- both countries backed by the United States. In Egypt, conversion is legally restricted and while it doesn't carry a death sentence, poll shows that most of the public in Egypt wishes it did.  So where is our State Department in all of this? The State Department who spends a lot of time looking out for the human rights of people in countries we can't pronounce. They ignore it. When was the last time, the United States pushed another country to treat Christians better? Well, in some cases, it would be pretty easy to do that, we could demand that Saudi Arabia or Pakistan or Afghanistan -- countries were dependent on us -- implement full freedom of religion before we give them any more USAID. Why would we do that? Because we are afraid of being criticized by the nihilist at \"The Washington Post?\" Maajid Nawaz is the founder of Quilliam and the author of \"Radical: My Journey Out of Islamist Extremism,\" and he joins us tonight. We are always happy to have him. So, explain if you would the thinking behind not just being straightforward with the public about an event like the one we saw yesterday in Sri Lanka."

      "speaker": "MAAJID NAWAZ, FOUNDER, QUILLIAM",
      "utterance": "Look, Tucker, let me begin by saying I am a Muslim and I express my deepest condolences to Christians around the world due to this and after this horrific jihadist terrorist attack in Sri Lanka that claimed nearly 300 lives and look, I am married to -- your viewers may not know, I am married to an American from a Catholic family and it's why it's so important for me personally to make this point that there are Muslims around the world that find this horrific. Unfortunately, some of our leaders and in particular some of the political leaders that you've named are suffering from what I believe is an intellectual and moral retreat from our enlightenment values and also there's a level of political cynicism involved here as well. The political -- the intellectual and moral side, they, for a while now whether when Barack Obama was President or even after, they had been unable to, and I've been calling it the Voldemort effect even on your show, they've been unable to name Islamist extremism by name and jihadist terrorism being as violent manifestation because they genuinely believe that a bigger threat due to their political perspective is white supremacy and far-right extremism, and then of course, there's the pragmatic political side of things they are pandering to a certain vote base and they fear that by naming these things, even if they wanted to, it would cause them trouble with their vote base. And that's not how I operate. It's not how I think any decent human being should operate. What happened in New Zealand was a white supremacist terror attack and what happened what's happened in Sri Lanka now is a jihadist terror attack and it behooves us all to speak plainly about this so that we can address these problems head-on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean what does it say about how they feel about their own populations in this supposed democracy that we have that they can't be straightforward as if most Americans can't handle the idea of knowing that Islamic extremists did this and still -- you know, and not hate all Muslims? I mean, they have a opinion, I think of their own population."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAWAZ",
      "utterance": "Well \"The Washington Post\" analysis you referenced that feared a far-right backlash and I've read the article in question and it selects only those who are from the right of the political spectrum and their reactions to the terror attack in Sri Lanka, the jihadist terror attack.  It's very easy to do that, by the way. It is lazy bait journalism and I advise fellow journalists and broadcasters not to stoop to this level. I could do that for example after the New Zealand white supremacist terrorist attack. I could have said that the East fears a backlash from jihadists and I could have hand-selected and quote not only Islamist and jihadist reactions to the New Zealand attack to try and portray the fact that only the jihadists and Islamists what upset about it. It's a dishonest way to address any issue post-crisis. I think sadly, Tucker, too many people play politics with tragedy and they allow for their own framework and their own biases to influence how they view human tragedy and then I use that to peddle their own political narrative and it is often not the right thing and I think we should all try and be as consistent as possible."

    {
      "speaker": "SHEA",
      "utterance": "Well, let me just say that first that this was a message not just to those Christians who were attacked and killed over the weekend -- over Easter weekend -- but it was a message that there is basically a war on Christianity from a certain segment of the Muslim population, a Muslim extremist population and we're seeing that intensify over the last decade in places like Egypt where Sam Tadros who works at the Hudson Institute and is an analyst there who is a copt himself estimates there were about 500 church attacks in the last couple of years. These occurred on Palm Sunday, a coordinated attack a couple of years ago on Christians in December around Christmas time at the seat of the Coptic Pope, Saint Mark's Cathedral in Cairo. I was just there and saw that sight. It's heartbreaking and it happens quite often in the village including last week in Egypt."

      "utterance": "It's not saying enough and the President of Egypt tends to go after those bombing attacks that ISIS does, but that there are extremist Muslims in the local neighborhoods that are attacking churches with impunity and have been for quite a while in Egypt. Thereabout, 10 percent of the population are Christians there. Nigeria estimated 900 Church attacks in one recent five-year period. So these are again happening on Christmas, on Easter and it doesn't matter what stripe of Christianity you are, it's across the board."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So I mean, there are powerful churches in the United States, rich churches for sure, powerful clergymen, I don't hear this issue addressed by them ever. Why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEA",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think people are aware of it. They're afraid of talking about it. Some of them are afraid that they will get retribution by the extremists if they talk about it back in those countries, so there are varied reasons why people don't talk about it, but the short term solution is security."

      "utterance": "Yes."

      "speaker": "SHEA",

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So we've sent, you know, untold billions into Afghanistan which is an entirely separate debate, but you think that would at least buy us, a majority Christian country a change in the law that makes it a death penalty offense to convert to Christianity. Why would we ever fund the government --"

And maybe they have to basically again, bring everybody else under oath.  Is it a waste of time? It's not only in so far as, if you think the Watergate hearings that Sam Ervin conducted were a waste of time, then you'd think these were too. I think most people in the public contemporaneously, I was, thought that was actually a good airing of the facts."

Well, no, not unless you rob your clients including an NBA player's ex-girlfriend. Alexis Gardner had hired CPL to represent her against Miami Heat star Hassan Whiteside. Creepy porn lawyer succeeded in getting a $3 million settlement, but according to prosecutors, he immediately stole two and a half million from the settlement to buy a jet share. His poor client received less than a tenth of that. Keep in mind CNN told CPL was a presidential contender. Maybe, he was just trying to get used to traveling private. Well, virtually everything you hear repeated on television if they repeat it enough probably untrue. Border is a racist. We're stronger, the less we have in common with other people. Kentucky high schoolers are privileged elites while journalists and DC are warriors for the oppressed.  It's all fake. These are lies and they repeat them over and over and punish people who dissent because the lies give them power.

Look we're not being dispatched to the gulag for saying this, but the pain comes in the form of pressure on your career, pressure on your public presence if you at all try to speak up against this stuff. And it goes to -- look, at the bottom of this is this desire for radical autonomy. Autonomy to the level of, \"I can also redefine what it means to be a man or a woman,\" and you define autonomy that wide enough for me, Tucker, for me to be able to experience my fullest autonomy, you have to say your name isn't Sohrab, it's actually Sabrina and you know that I'm a woman and vice versa.

Instead of fixing this or even trying, politicians tell us that we need to just bring in new people in order to keep our population stable. Elizabeth Warren recently proposed giving a $50,000.00 student loan amnesty to all American college grads. Here's a counterproposal. Why not forgive all the student loans of Americans who get married and have kids? It might help. Why is that crazy? Penny Nance is the President of Concerned Women for America and she joins us tonight. Penny, thanks very much for coming on. So most Americans want to have more children than they can afford. Why is this not like the basic promise every politician running for every office is making? If elected I will help you have as many kids as you want."

And so security and even like new markets for corporations, there's -- it means, if we have less children, if the population continues to decline we're not at replacement rate. Replacement rate is 2.1, we're at 1.7.  We're not going to be able to retire nearly as soon and we're going to have to work harder. And so this is an important issue. American women say the vast majority want to have children and women with minor children, 60 percent say they want to spend more time with them, and if they had their ideal situation, 60 percent would only work part-time; another 19 percent would actually stay at home with their kids while they are little."

The way to think about it is the business model they've built is really they're trying to use data to take away uncertainty for advertisers. The problem is, in doing so, they're taking away the choices for us, the consumer and choice is what America is all about. It's about our freewill and our ability to lead our own lives.

I mean, Tucker, I want to go -- I'm saying to every single person who is running for office, whenever I'm on your air or anybody else's, I'm just saying we need to ask the simple questions -- why is it legal for there to be a third-party market in our personal data without our involvement or our permission?"

      "utterance": "So the footage on your screen, the picture you're looking at right there was shot by one of our producers last week. We were out in California all week in Los Angeles, supposedly one of the richest cities in the world and in some ways, it is. But the video you're watching shows something else. California is poor meandering trash filled streets right in the middle of the city, right downtown, block after block, homeless encampments along the sidewalks blanketing downtown LA. The footage you're watching starts at 5th Street and San Pedro and goes west. Again block after block, tent after tent. This is how the poor spend Easter Sunday in California. They weren't clustered along a single road either, it wasn't just like Skid Row. It was like many Skid Rows. We drove down three completely different blocks and the encampments just continued. It looks like Tegucigalpa or Port-au-Prince, but it's not; it's America's second largest city. The encampments begin just two blocks away from Little Tokyo, one of LA's major tourist destinations. Nearby apartments rent for 3,500 bucks a month. You might be wondering with so many people priced out of local housing, the people are literally living in RVs, miles of RV's parked along the streets and as you're watching here, in tents. Why wouldn't local leaders want to slow or stop the flow of new arrivals to get prices under control? To opening up new housing? %They're doing the opposite. LA is a sanctuary city in a sanctuary state. Every politician there with any ambition will denounce our borders an atrocity and that immigration enforcement is an abomination. The poor in California are an afterthought, one of the reasons why they're multiplying. That's why when California Governor Gavin Newsom decided to fight poverty last week, he flew to another country to do it, El Salvador.  The same people who want no limits on people moving here, he can't even house the people who already live here. It tells you a lot. Well, today is Earth Day as you may know, a day to celebrate the Earth.  That's a good thing for the record. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio presides over the dirtiest city in the United States. He enjoys taking his SUV convoy all over the city or taking a helicopter ride to the gym, but don't worry, he has got a plan for absolving his own guilt, restrict the behavior of other people. He wants to pass the Green New Deal, which he says will ban New York's iconic skyscrapers. Watch this."

      "utterance": "Author and columnist, Mark Steyn joins us tonight. So I have mixed feelings about this. I am just going to get it right out on the table. I think Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius and all of the creeps who destroyed the world's landscape with worker housing and then I am paying the steel and glass stuff, they should all be punished posthumously. So I'm against steel and glass, but I don't think that de Blasio wants to replace it with something better. That's my suspicion."

      "speaker": "MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "No, I'm with you. I mean, I'm opposed to that look on aesthetic grounds and I am horrified at the talk that they might be -- I am paying up the new roof at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Exactly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "So I'm with you on aesthetic grounds, but I don't want to ban it on climate grounds, which I think is just ridiculous even on Earth Day, which after what you've just shown on the streets of Los Angeles is a perfect reminder that climate change is essentially a boutique issue, it's almost like an accessory for Western liberal politicians to flaunt how much they care while actually doing nothing about the people and the jurisdictions for which they're actually responsible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It couldn't really be clearer, could it? So why wouldn't you take Earth Day, which at least theoretically I completely support. I love the outdoors. I went fishing this morning. It's really important, I think to be outside. Why wouldn't you take this opportunity to clean up the actual Earth like starting how about in front of City Hall? Why wouldn't you do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Well you're looking at it all wrong, Tucker. Earth Day is about flying a politician in to do the last bit of tree planting that several of his staffers and environmental activists have been spending the whole day working on. I live in a town in New Hampshire that's 95 percent tree-covered, but we're all -- we've got the climate change Earth Day fever. We need to get it back up to 97 percent - 98 percent or the planet is going to die. I know where that three percent of tree cover went, I think they were all used to print transcripts of the Mueller report and it's killing the planet, but that's what Earth Day is meant to be -- doing something about the filth in your own cities. It goes back to the way Labor Day has been transformed. Labor Day was partly in its 19th Century origins about the order and cleanliness that man had imposed on a wild environment and now, as you see on the streets of Los Angeles; even that has to be returned to a primitive and brutish state."

      "utterance": "What do you think the people who started America's Conservation Movement -- John Muir for example or Teddy Roosevelt who protected millions of acres of now Federal land, what would they make of Bill de Blasio's variety of environmentalism where you never go outside?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "No, I think that's where the whole bit about him traveling by SUV and everything comes in because I think they would see it as a class thing.  In other words, what we've seen in the last 150 years has really been the democratization of mobility that things you had to be the second son of a Grand Duke to do like travel wildly are now available to everyone and Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Gore and Mayor de Blasio think no, it's just those guys who need the SUVs and the private planes. The rest of us should be standing outside waiting for a bus every 40 minutes on a cold winter's morning and instead of using a washer dryer, we should be beating our clothes down by the river on the rocks. It's actually -- it's the most explicit expression of the new class politics that modern-day liberalism is imposing on us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That's fascinating and so that's why de Blasio for example has hiked the tolls to come into New York City because the idea is if you don't already live in Manhattan like what are you doing here? I mean, it's snobbery."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "No, no and he says he has to go to his gym in Brooklyn to commune with the people, so he's not in the bubble. In fact, he's driven there in an SUV by guys with reflector shades and telephone cords hanging out of their ears and if any member of the masses try to get near him during his photo op at the Brooklyn gym, they'd be taken out by the SWAT team. So it's this phony poser communing with the people and phony poser environmentalism, too."
