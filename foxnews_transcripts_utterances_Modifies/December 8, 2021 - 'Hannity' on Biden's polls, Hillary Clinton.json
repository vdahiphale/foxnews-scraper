Tonight, we're tracking multiple stories including news surrounding Hillary Clinton sadly kind of pathetically she's once again foisting herself into the public spotlight now openly fantasizing about her presidency that never happened. Wait until you hear these really, really pathetic remarks coming up. Also, is the media mob trying to cancel Dr. Oz? I mean, literally, cancel Dr. Oz. That's straight ahead. And tonight, sad news, our 50-foot FOX News Christmas tree was destroyed early this morning by a suspected arsonist. He apparently scaled the tree, ignited a massive fire, endangering hundreds of people in and around our FOX News headquarters. Crime in New York City under Comrade de Blasio is so out of control. This is what you get with a billion dollar cut to the NYPD. And now, by the way, he could be out on bail -- as out on bail as early as tomorrow, thanks to, of course, New York state's generous bail reform laws where there's no bail. We'll have a full report tonight. And first, we can somebody please remind Joe Biden, pretty please with sugar on top, that our fellow citizens are still trapped in Afghanistan. Joe has not even mentioned these Americans not one time in over a hundred days.",

Do they care how bad this is for this country? Do they care how dangerous it is for this country and for the entire world? How long is everyone in the White House going to pretend that he's not a cognitive mess which we all know he is?

And I need to say this if you're an American in Ukraine and somehow you hear my voice get out now if you have loved ones there my advice is get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Now, given what happened in Afghanistan, I have no faith and neither should anyone else that Joe will prevent chaos and carnage in Eastern Europe. Our enemies, our allies all know that Joe Biden is in a severe cognitive decline and is in way over his head the American people also now know and realize that Joe Biden is not fit for this job. According to a poll published in \"The Boston Herald\" yesterday, only 22 percent of Americans now support any Biden reelection. And get this, Kamala Harris, she's polling even lower at 12 percent. A Rasmussen poll shows that half of all likely voters have a very unfavorable opinion of Kamala. Meanwhile, \"The Wall Street Journal\" poll reveals a massive -point swing among Hispanic American voters who are now evenly split in a head-to-head rematch between Trump and Biden. The same poll shows a majority of voters are pessimistic about Biden's leadership, the economy, a variety of other issues. In other words, Biden is one of the worst performing presidents of all time and it's getting worse. Where do we get Friday's numbers? Where do we get that CBO scoring that doesn't include the sunset provisions that Democrats want? In other words, the fake accounting where do we get Friday's inflation numbers? I would imagine we stay at a 31-year high. Don't worry, the administration knows just how to right the ship. They decided what we really need is a rebranding campaign and to beg the media to sell our build back better nonsense for us. And by the way, now, big signs with the slogan building a better America. That will follow Joe Biden all over the country as he touts his many great achievements I can't name one but whatever they are. The Biden administration laughably believing their poll numbers are so low because what the messaging is bad? What, they need the Madison Avenue campaign to somehow if they did -- if they just message it better messengered it better, they do better? These numbers are so low because their policies are that bad, it's that simple. Their execution is even worse. Their agenda is even more destructive their great Green New Deal socialist Marxist ideas are insane, and their leader Joe is cognitively declining by the day. And the results are palpable. In 2020, we warned everyone that Joe Biden was not competent in any way, I honestly wish we were wrong. Sadly, it might be even worse than we thought. And his radical staff has now hell-bent on ramming his socialist agenda if he even knows what it is. The Bernie-Biden manifesto through Congress. Here's an idea, let's talk to the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell. He said for months, two months, that Republicans would not help the Democrats raise the debt ceiling and he did just that and now he's doing it again. Mitch McConnell needs to stop bailing the Democrats out. Mitch McConnell is breaking his word. Mitch McConnell is lying to every Republican and he's scheming with Pelosi and Schumer behind the scenes and he is giving them a lifeline when they totally completely have kept Republicans out of the budgetary process. He gifted them with more time to raise the debt ceiling after two months of saying he wouldn't, giving them a window to pass Build Back Better socialism. He promised he'd never do it again and guess what? Mitch McConnell, well, now ready to capitulate one more time. He just needs nine other senators to help him. Lindsey Graham tonight was furious.

We just have a choice between default and keep spending, and no one has ever gone after the spending program, Sean. Nobody talks about Medicare or Social Security or meaningfully cutting spending. Nobody in either party really. So the debt limit is obscure. It is just an excuse to get into last-minute brinksmanship over default. It serves no practical purpose anymore.

Scott Brown, this is why Mitch McConnell in my view shouldn't be the majority leader for Republicans anymore. He's -- he breaks his word except for judges, he's not been very good about keeping promises. He represents to me the quintessential swamp creature that makes backroom deals with Schumer and Pelosi, bails out Democrats and he had no business bailing them out.

Well, respectfully, the late Senator Coburn had a book like this of all the stuff we could have gotten rid of, the duplication, triplication, the waste, the fraud, the abuse. Yeah, we -- our country is a financial mess right now. The stock market is doing great if you're one of those wonderful people that can afford to be in the stock market, that's great. But if you look at home heating oil, food prices, inflation, the pocketbook and wallet issues. You know, this country is hurting and the Biden administration, their policies are just out of control.

But when it comes to standing out of the way and letting the Democrats implode, I want to go back to the way you began this, with Putin and with Russia and Ukraine. Because it occurred to me, Sean, it doesn't really matter what Joe Biden said in the summit meeting with Vladimir Putin reading off of index cards, the Russians have a dossier on Joe Biden and the dossier shows that Joe Biden will cut run and retreat on every important matter when it comes to foreign policy. We saw it in Afghanistan. We saw when he opposed the rescue mission to take out Osama bin Laden. We saw on Iraq where he supported the war in and as soon as it got bad, he cut and ran. He opposed the original Persian Gulf War, and he wanted to divide Iraq into three pieces. His judgment on everything military foreign policy for his entire career has been a one of weakness and cut run and retreat. Putin knows that. So it doesn't matter what Biden says on the South Lawn of the White House, it's his track record. It's the dossier that the Russians know about Biden that invites weakness and that's why if they invade, they're going to know it's because they're dealing with a weak American president.",

And what happened with Russia after the Olympics, they went into Ukraine and Georgia and then you have obviously what's happening right with China after the Olympics. They're going to go in with Taiwan. The problem is that there's a complete lack of respect now after President Trump. And by the way, your viewers may not know that President Trump single-handedly put on the most draconian sanctions against Russia, the so- called Russian collusion, draconian sanctions that can only be removed by Congress. And to think we've already taken military options off the table and we allowed the pipeline that Russia is promoting, giving them that lifeline in their economy because as you remember when oil was very low, their economy was about to crash. We can still make economic hits and make them hurt and feel the pain for doing what they're doing but we need to have a strong president and respectfully I feel badly for our country.

Wait until you hear these really, really pathetic remarks coming up. Also, is the media mob trying to cancel Dr. Oz? I mean, literally, cancel Dr. Oz. That's straight ahead. And tonight, sad news, our 50-foot FOX News Christmas tree was destroyed early this morning by a suspected arsonist. He apparently scaled the tree, ignited a massive fire, endangering hundreds of people in and around our FOX News headquarters. Crime in New York City under Comrade de Blasio is so out of control. This is what you get with a billion dollar cut to the NYPD. And now, by the way, he could be out on bail -- as out on bail as early as tomorrow, thanks to, of course, New York state's generous bail reform laws where there's no bail. We'll have a full report tonight. And first, we can somebody please remind Joe Biden, pretty please with sugar on top, that our fellow citizens are still trapped in Afghanistan. Joe has not even mentioned these Americans not one time in over a hundred days."

Now, given what happened in Afghanistan, I have no faith and neither should anyone else that Joe will prevent chaos and carnage in Eastern Europe. Our enemies, our allies all know that Joe Biden is in a severe cognitive decline and is in way over his head the American people also now know and realize that Joe Biden is not fit for this job. According to a poll published in \"The Boston Herald\" yesterday, only 22 percent of Americans now support any Biden reelection. And get this, Kamala Harris, she's polling even lower at 12 percent. A Rasmussen poll shows that half of all likely voters have a very unfavorable opinion of Kamala. Meanwhile, \"The Wall Street Journal\" poll reveals a massive -point swing among Hispanic American voters who are now evenly split in a head-to-head rematch between Trump and Biden. The same poll shows a majority of voters are pessimistic about Biden's leadership, the economy, a variety of other issues. In other words, Biden is one of the worst performing presidents of all time and it's getting worse. Where do we get Friday's numbers? Where do we get that CBO scoring that doesn't include the sunset provisions that Democrats want? In other words, the fake accounting where do we get Friday's inflation numbers? I would imagine we stay at a 31-year high. Don't worry, the administration knows just how to right the ship. They decided what we really need is a rebranding campaign and to beg the media to sell our build back better nonsense for us. And by the way, now, big signs with the slogan building a better America. That will follow Joe Biden all over the country as he touts his many great achievements I can't name one but whatever they are. The Biden administration laughably believing their poll numbers are so low because what the messaging is bad? What, they need the Madison Avenue campaign to somehow if they did -- if they just message it better messengered it better, they do better? These numbers are so low because their policies are that bad, it's that simple. Their execution is even worse. Their agenda is even more destructive their great Green New Deal socialist Marxist ideas are insane, and their leader Joe is cognitively declining by the day. And the results are palpable. In 2020, we warned everyone that Joe Biden was not competent in any way, I honestly wish we were wrong. Sadly, it might be even worse than we thought. And his radical staff has now hell-bent on ramming his socialist agenda if he even knows what it is. The Bernie-Biden manifesto through Congress. Here's an idea, let's talk to the Republican leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell. He said for months, two months, that Republicans would not help the Democrats raise the debt ceiling and he did just that and now he's doing it again. Mitch McConnell needs to stop bailing the Democrats out. Mitch McConnell is breaking his word. Mitch McConnell is lying to every Republican and he's scheming with Pelosi and Schumer behind the scenes and he is giving them a lifeline when they totally completely have kept Republicans out of the budgetary process. He gifted them with more time to raise the debt ceiling after two months of saying he wouldn't, giving them a window to pass Build Back Better socialism. He promised he'd never do it again and guess what? Mitch McConnell, well, now ready to capitulate one more time. He just needs nine other senators to help him. Lindsey Graham tonight was furious.

We just have a choice between default and keep spending, and no one has ever gone after the spending program, Sean. Nobody talks about Medicare or Social Security or meaningfully cutting spending. Nobody in either party really. So the debt limit is obscure. It is just an excuse to get into last-minute brinksmanship over default. It serves no practical purpose anymore. It never limits the debt."

Scott Brown, this is why Mitch McConnell in my view shouldn't be the majority leader for Republicans anymore. He's -- he breaks his word except for judges, he's not been very good about keeping promises. He represents to me the quintessential swamp creature that makes backroom deals with Schumer and Pelosi, bails out Democrats and he had no business bailing them out.

It's up to almost $30 trillion, either just spending, spending, spending. And you -- and Ari just said, there's no one there looking at it. Well, respectfully, the late Senator Coburn had a book like this of all the stuff we could have gotten rid of, the duplication, triplication, the waste, the fraud, the abuse. Yeah, we -- our country is a financial mess right now. The stock market is doing great if you're one of those wonderful people that can afford to be in the stock market, that's great. But if you look at home heating oil, food prices, inflation, the pocketbook and wallet issues. You know, this country is hurting and the Biden administration, their policies are just out of control. The socialist agenda is taking away individual rights and freedoms, taking away our ability to compete on a worldwide basis, raising taxes on our mom-and-pop businesses and small and medium-sized businesses, it's just a recipe for disaster."

I think Mitch would say he honored his promise to make sure that only Democrats voted for it, but traditionally it always has been done on reconciliation. Lindsey Graham makes a good point there. But when it comes to standing out of the way and letting the Democrats implode, I want to go back to the way you began this, with Putin and with Russia and Ukraine. Because it occurred to me, Sean, it doesn't really matter what Joe Biden said in the summit meeting with Vladimir Putin reading off of index cards, the Russians have a dossier on Joe Biden and the dossier shows that Joe Biden will cut run and retreat on every important matter when it comes to foreign policy. We saw it in Afghanistan. We saw when he opposed the rescue mission to take out Osama bin Laden. We saw on Iraq where he supported the war in and as soon as it got bad, he cut and ran. He opposed the original Persian Gulf War, and he wanted to divide Iraq into three pieces. His judgment on everything military foreign policy for his entire career has been a one of weakness and cut run and retreat. Putin knows that. So it doesn't matter what Biden says on the South Lawn of the White House, it's his track record. It's the dossier that the Russians know about Biden that invites weakness and that's why if they invade, they're going to know it's because they're dealing with a weak American president."

Scott Brown, I would argue Putin is -- he's not amassing 175,000 troops on the border with Ukraine without the intention of going in there and I would argue right after the Olympics, the winter Olympics in China, you can watch China take over Taiwan as they have been shown to be so aggressive in their efforts to, quote, reunify, meaning take over Taiwan."

And Ari and Secretary Gates are right, he's been wrong on every major foreign policy decision. And what happened with Russia after the Olympics, they went into Ukraine and Georgia and then you have obviously what's happening right with China after the Olympics. They're going to go in with Taiwan. The problem is that there's a complete lack of respect now after President Trump. And by the way, your viewers may not know that President Trump single-handedly put on the most draconian sanctions against Russia, the so- called Russian collusion, draconian sanctions that can only be removed by Congress. And to think we've already taken military options off the table and we allowed the pipeline that Russia is promoting, giving them that lifeline in their economy because as you remember when oil was very low, their economy was about to crash. We can still make economic hits and make them hurt and feel the pain for doing what they're doing but we need to have a strong president and respectfully I feel badly for our country. It's not this Biden-Harris administration. It just isn't, and we have a choice in a few months and about a year to make a difference."

Here with more is the author of \"Do What You Said You Would Do\" -- by the way, Mitch McConnell, get a copy of this book and read it. Ranking member of the important House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, who was not allowed to participate in the January 6 Commission, along with former Trump White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.

And he was still willing to work with this committee to answer the questions he's permitted to answer but they said no, no, no. We want you to answer every single question we ask and violate that that fundamental privilege that has always existed in our country. That shows you how partisan. This is no different than Adam Schiff's anonymous whistleblower doing depositions and impeachment proceedings in the bunker in the basement of the Capitol. It's the same kind of effort, and it's clear for everyone to see. Mark Meadows is a good man who was willing to do the right thing but this committee said no. We want you to answer everything and he was forced to take this action. I think the reason they're doing it all is because they're afraid they're going after Mark, they're going after President Trump because they know President Trump is going to run again in 2024 and he's going to win.

They kicked Jim Jordan off the committee, Jim Banks off the committee. They put Trump haters on there like Liz Cheney who has one mission.

But I don't want to forgive this guy just yet. This Craig Tamanaha, an Asian guy apparently, 49 years old, with at least three priors in New York, three more priors in Texas reportedly. I mean, this guy is really off the deep end. What his motive was, we don't know. Did he intend to kill people? Did he intend to hurt people? If the wind was blowing, if you -- if you show that -- the smoke shot again of the tree, you see the wind was blowing from the west, blowing the flames away from the building. What if the wind was blowing the other direction toward our headquarters? It could have started a fire that really imperiled many, many people. This was a wretched act of civic malice. This guy polluted the holiday spirit. He frightened New Yorkers and visitors alike. Everybody should be outraged. Now, what you do with him now? I mean, he's charged with criminal mischief, arson, reckless endangerment, criminal trespass, disorderly conduct. Most are misdemeanors, true, but the arson charge could be a felony depending on intent for instance, did he use an accelerant? Under New York law, if you use like kerosene or gasoline, that makes the crime more serious. Were lives in danger? I think that this time, they may have this creep. The least of his problems is homelessness. He's a junkie. He's an attention seeker, according to his dad. He exposed himself at the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, according to \"The New York Post\". He took his pants down and showed his privates to some female reporters. I mean this guy is really off the deep end, but I cannot believe that even with the liberal policies in Manhattan County, in New York county, that Cy Vance, the district attorney, will allow this guy back on the street where he will be a peril to the other residents of this town and to himself as well, Sean."

They don't believe in taking care of the victims. They only believe in the criminal. And this is that -- thank God this didn't involve any human injury. But at the same time, everyone who walks outside anymore is subject to some kind of violent crime. And until we get the liberal progressive leftists out of office, until we change that ridiculous so-called bail reform law, we're going to continue to have this kind of problem. And that guy is horrible as he is ruining Christmas, the peace, the tranquility and the happiness we got from that tree, there are people in hospitals people have been shot and stabbed and beaten and brutalized, and they let them out.

Does it mention anything about the leading subpoenaed emails or paying for the dirty Russian Steele dossier that was used to spy on your opponent Donald Trump? Here with reaction, author of the bestseller \"Laptop from Hell,\" FOX News contributor Miranda Devine, along with FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett.

And you know, you have to note that she's you know very emotional about this loss from five years ago but she wasn't as emotional. She was quite callous actually when she was testifying about Benghazi. So I just look at those tears and they leave me cold.

I kept thinking, what kind of a person does this? Well, a person who yearns for relevance to be sure, but an embittered person who refuses to accept personal responsibility for her own failure. She lost because she ran a hideous campaign with unpopular policies and came across as unlikable. And yet, she's obsessed with blaming others. She wrote an entire book blaming everybody else but herself. You know people like this, Sean, you know can't stand defeat. They can't stand criticism. She seems like a classic case of narcissistic personality disorder, this overwrought sense of entitlement, an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and no sense of self-awareness. But on top of it, as you point out, scandal in malfeasance follows her everywhere she goes. Miranda's right, she didn't give a damn about the murdered Americans in Benghazi. She said what difference does it make? She invented and financed and disseminated the Russia hoax and lied about it. She insisted she did nothing wrong in her email scandal and lied about that and her so-called charity. Well, that's a quid pro quo personal enrichment scheme. So, you know, Hillary Clinton sow the seeds of her own demise. When she looks in the mirror, there's no reflection there. She's like the picture of Dorian Gray who sold her soul and destroyed herself."

And despite the overwhelming evidence and testimony pointing to Smollett's lies about being targeted by Trump and MAGA supporters in Chicago, Black Lives Matter is still in his corner saying that the police cannot be trusted. Of course, the extremism inside the Democratic Party doesn't stop there, as Vice President Harris met with a radical activist this week in Washington who once said, quote, F white women. Here with reaction Leo 2.0 Terrell, along with \"FOX and Friends\" reporter and occasionally a HANNITY reporter, started as a HANNITY reporter, was stolen by \"FOX and Friends,\" former friend and co-worker, LJ. Sorry, I'm just telling the truth. I don't hold back. LJ, if anyone ever said anything in reverse that's called racism and it's gotten away with. The evidence to me in this case has been fairly overwhelming against Jussie Smollett, that, you know, he -- the day before he goes through a trial run, we got the text messages or the direct messages on Instagram, whatever you call those things, back and forth between the people involved in this. I think the evidence was pretty overwhelming. Thoughts? LAWRENCE JONES, ENTERPRISE REPORTER FOR \"FOX & FRIENDS\": Yeah, it's pretty overwhelming but, Sean, I think -- look, there's obviously the wrong doing that that he did. But there's something really demented that you have a guy that costs resource. I mean, people were shot just in Chicago over the weekend, nine people dead. Then you have a hundred and thirty thousand dollars that were that was paid for the detectives, two dozen just for their overtime. So they dedicated the entire police force based on a lie.
