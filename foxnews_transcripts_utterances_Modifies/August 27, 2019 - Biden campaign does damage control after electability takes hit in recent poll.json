It's 5:00 in New York City and this is “The Five.” Joe Biden's campaign doing some damage control as some doubts creep in about his electability pitch to voters. The concern coming from the former V.P. sliding 13 points in a new poll and into a three-way tie with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.  Biden's campaign is pushing back calling that poll an outlier. Two new polls do show Biden back on top, but is the damage already done. Some on the media is starting to doubt him. Watch.",

But also, it's interesting to me, the question about young voters and Black voters. Young voters in the internals of the first poll, the Monmouth poll, really did, as you just saw there in that little graphic, I mean, they're just not excited about Joe Biden. I think when we talk about crowd size with Elizabeth Warren, even Bernie Sanders, you don't see it, and I think you don't see the level of passion. It's more like, yes, I'm settling for them because I think he can beat Trump.   The second part of this, though, as Black voters.

I mean, it is. It's getting up there age-wise. But I do think that like, I go back to my theory that you stole from me last week, yes.

All right, the \"New York Times\" is outraged that a Trump affiliated group is exposing old bigoted tweets made by a \"Times\" staffer. Now, I'd agree with their concern, except that if there are journalists did the same thing to you, they'd call it journalism. Yes, the media hasn't thought twice about using past words to cancel the careers of anyone outside their own political world. They will use just about anything that by today's standards looks problematic. But it's hypocrisy.  When the \"Times\" unearths a controversial comment, they call it \"scrutinizing people in positions in power.\" But return the favor, exposing one of their own journalist for anti-Semitic tweets, it's \"seeking to harass and embarrass anyone affiliated with a leading news organization.\" They pretend their organization hasn't been in a position of power for a century, using it and abusing it as they see fit, making billions pushing an ideology that holds you in disdain. Meanwhile, \"HuffPost\" editor Lydia Polgreen says, \"this outing of public statements should worry anyone who cares about independent journalism.\" But why? Surely journalists should welcome this scrutiny, or is this the kind of speaking truth to power that they hate? So maybe it's time to give the gander what it's been doing to the goose, by targeting the hall monitors with their own words. The media is being taught a lesson about ruining the lives of others for spite and sports.

And we have to be reminded, the media does a really bad job on the story. We have to remind ourselves of the fact when they are pushing those overdose numbers, primarily due to a mixing of drugs. They are mixing opioids with other drugs. More people have died from other common medications than pure prescribed opioids. This isn't a prescription problem. It is street problems driven by elicit fentanyl coming from China. So America is left with a moral question that Trump has some how pushed on us which is would you favor your cheap goods, your cheaper iPhones and have 60 to 100,000 people die, or would you rather have higher goods and stop the influx of fentanyl into our country?

So right now, he is up I think plus seven in the Emerson poll, plus 13 in the Morning Consult political poll, Dana. And I think this is reassuring for Biden's team. But also, it's interesting to me, the question about young voters and Black voters. Young voters in the internals of the first poll, the Monmouth poll, really did, as you just saw there in that little graphic, I mean, they're just not excited about Joe Biden. I think when we talk about crowd size with Elizabeth Warren, even Bernie Sanders, you don't see it, and I think you don't see the level of passion. It's more like, yes, I'm settling for them because I think he can beat Trump. The second part of this, though, as Black voters.

Now you have, you know, you have a Bernie, Joe, and Liz Warren three way, Dana, which is like a sequel to Cocoon 2, extra loud and cranky. Eearly bird special -- where the hell is Wilford Brimley? I mean, it is. It's getting up there age-wise. But I do think that like, I go back to my theory that you stole from me last week, yes. Biden needs to get to a number that's larger than Bernie and Liz combined before Bernie or Liz drops out because when one of them drops out, the other one absorbs that person like a strange demon.

I think the problem with this poll, even if its an outlier one, is that it affirms a sense that people have that Joe Biden confirmed for everybody.

He is who everyone came out of the gate supporting while they figured out what other candidate was actually who resonated with them.

Now, I'd agree with their concern, except that if there are journalists did the same thing to you, they'd call it journalism. Yes, the media hasn't thought twice about using past words to cancel the careers of anyone outside their own political world. They will use just about anything that by today's standards looks problematic. But it's hypocrisy. When the \"Times\" unearths a controversial comment, they call it \"scrutinizing people in positions in power.\" But return the favor, exposing one of their own journalist for anti-Semitic tweets, it's \"seeking to harass and embarrass anyone affiliated with a leading news organization.\" They pretend their organization hasn't been in a position of power for a century, using it and abusing it as they see fit, making billions pushing an ideology that holds you in disdain. Meanwhile, \"HuffPost\" editor Lydia Polgreen says, \"this outing of public statements should worry anyone who cares about independent journalism.\" But why? Surely journalists should welcome this scrutiny, or is this the kind of speaking truth to power that they hate? So maybe it's time to give the gander what it's been doing to the goose, by targeting the hall monitors with their own words. The media is being taught a lesson about ruining the lives of others for spite and sports.

Although some are cheering that decision, \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board, they are saying Johnson & Johnson is being used as a \"scapegoat\" for the scourge of addiction and that the ruling now creates a slippery slope for more product liability lawsuits. What's the problem with holding people accountable if, in fact, they were pushing opioids and leading people to become addicts and not killing people?"

And we have to be reminded, the media does a really bad job on the story. We have to remind ourselves of the fact when they are pushing those overdose numbers, primarily due to a mixing of drugs. They are mixing opioids with other drugs. More people have died from other common medications than pure prescribed opioids. This isn't a prescription problem. It is street problems driven by elicit fentanyl coming from China. So America is left with a moral question that Trump has some how pushed on us which is would you favor your cheap goods, your cheaper iPhones and have 60 to 100,000 people die, or would you rather have higher goods and stop the influx of fentanyl into our country? That is a very moral question because human beings actually tend to ignore foreign tragedy or tragedy for temporary or goods that are near them. So, it forces them to pay the piper, so to speak."

They have settled some of these lawsuits and the reason is that there was evidence that they were pushing these drugs aggressively on doctors, without indicating the degree to which they were addicted. They were saying, oh, this is less addictive than other drugs and it turns out it was pretty addictive."

    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Purdue and TIVA (ph) settled respectively without admitting culpability. The ruling regarding Johnson & Johnson out of Oklahoma obviously found them specifically culpable and the core of the judge's ruling is that they had an unbranded and branded marketing campaign that was totally at fault. They said the judge ruled that the branded element was the sales guys going to doctors that they knew already prescribed opioids. They were pill mills. People were lined up out the door. They provided faulty data and said look A, pain management is being under treated and B, there is no risks associated with over prescribing opioids. And then the unbranded part is the fact that Johnson & Johnson led a concerted effort to literally which happened changed medicinal policy. That's why pain management is now the fifth vital sign and also changed government regulations so that hospitals would push those prescriptions. So, all of these Big Pharmas are facing different results, but I think this is a good one albeit an interesting legal question of whether it arises under the Public Nuisance rubric."

So, there's more responsibility than just the company. I mean Johnson & Johnson constitutes per that article less than 1 percent of Oklahoma's prescription opioid market. How much do you pay when you represent only 1 percent. So, I do think, and they apply - all the approved - all the drugs are approved and had the warning labels on them. There are processes that were violated in ways in which they maneuvered around that.

The only way to get that down is for more innovation to happen. But it takes a lot of money on the front end in order to find that innovation. Believe me if they could figure out a way to alleviate pain for people without having to do opioids and it would be cost effective, they would do it because we have a free market. So, in some ways I think we're barking up the wrong tree and trying to find money. OK. So, what are you going to do with $572 million in order to help treat people? Are you going to try to get the drugs off the streets? Are you going to help people don't mix the drugs and then if they do mix the drugs then who is at fault, and who's going to pay that price? And there is also just a deeper problem here that why do people feel like they need to have these drugs. Why are they doing it in a way that harms them. Because then it is hurting other people because doctors are now saying oh god, I don't think that I should do that, here try to take a Tylenol 3 or take two Advil in the morning."

She was invited by Missy Elliott to perform one of Elliott's big hits Work It. Now there is an incredible story here for a hint. Take a look at this video from 2002. Yes, that's the same dancer Allison Stoner. In the second video. She's just nine-years-old. And that you see there dancing in Missy Elliott's video for the song Work It. That set her on the road for an entertainment career. She has become an actress, singer, dancer, choreographer. She and Missy Elliott remain friends to this day, it's a wonderful story because entertainment can be a cutthroat business. And to have friends and keep friends, friends and talent do count."

I had the honor of attending one of my best friend Daniel Peterson's retirement ceremony from the United States Marine Corps MARSOC, the elite unit out of North Carolina. And speaking of nine-years-old, I mean he wanted to be a Marine. Growing up since before we were nine. I learned more about the military than most adults because of him through his 23-year career with the United States Marine Corps. He went through 11 deployments and really protected our freedom every day. So, congratulations my dear friend. Thank you for your service. I'm proud of you and it was an honor to watch your dream unfold for the last 30 years."
