The savvy with which dictators, terrorists, et cetera, can play the propaganda game, it shouldn't be stunning to us anymore but it is. You think that you are listening to like one, Putin sits down for an interview, or Lavrov sits down and they know every buzzword. Xi Jinping, right? Like they know exactly how to trigger us, to use her favorite woke word that way. So, I think it's really interesting especially since we heard that the World Bank is going to be withholding funds from them now that they are not a normal country and they're a terrorist organization run land. One thing that I did think was positive out of Secretary Blinken's briefing is we actually got some numbers about how many Americans were in Afghanistan and how many have been evacuated. So, he said that there were 6,000 Americans who had it since August 14th -- sorry, 6k Americans registered August 14th, 4,500 evacuated since, he believes there will be less than a thousand still in the country. And I thought the idea of people who do want to keep staying there, it was interesting. Like I can't imagine at this moment being like, hey, no, I'm going to wait this one out. And I get it, there are dual nationals there. So, it will be interesting to see where that goes. But the 82,000 evacuees, a lot of people are getting out, obviously foreign nationals but a lot of Afghans are getting to other places. They're going to Qatar. They're going to Western Europe and those all seem to be positives.",

I'm OK with that. You've got to remember; these are the three things from 2020 that the media performed so they'll do anything. Number one, they buried the laptop story to sway an election, that worked because when the poll shows that if they knew about that they would've voted differently. They bragged about their secret cabal after the election in Time magazine, that massive piece that talked about all the institutions working together and if you dare question any election discrepancy unless it's a Democrat loss you are guilty of the big lie. So, they are also going to push, they're also going to bring back the insurrection even though obviously it's not an insurrection. The FBI found evidence of some plot. But they are going to be using the I word and the I word bring back those visuals to make you feel that the Republicans are the kind of the Taliban of America which is what they are really going to try to go for.

And now that Democrats have backed themselves into a corner, the only thing that they can brag about is spending more money. They are going to brag about and it's more like $5 trillion over 10 years, they are going to brag about spending money when they are claiming ownership of causing the inflation if they do that. So, they have to be very careful about that. Also, all of these new entitlement programs they've created to get the middle class hooked on government like the extra child tax credit that expires but what's in this plan that the Democrats are pushing, that's one of the reasons in the short run that all these jobs are unfilled.

And it is their legal right to seek asylum here. And they should go through the process. But of course, the interpreter should come, people who fought alongside us, but you shouldn't talk about them like that just because they're coming from a different place. And hopefully, that will get figured -- I'm literally hearing hurry up. Anyway, the point is, on the Supreme Court ruling, it's actually very unclear. They didn't say what the violation actually was. And the policy, the remain in Mexico policy hasn't been in place since March 2020 anyway. So, it seems like Secretary Mayorkas can just go back to them with more thorough explanation of why they don't want the remain in Mexico policy. They had taken it down because of COVID. And to the point about the Taliban people getting here, under Trump March 20, 2020, the peace pact, the Afghans had to release 5000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for only 1000 Afghan prisoners.

The savvy with which dictators, terrorists, et cetera, can play the propaganda game, it shouldn't be stunning to us anymore but it is. You think that you are listening to like one, Putin sits down for an interview, or Lavrov sits down and they know every buzzword. Xi Jinping, right? Like they know exactly how to trigger us, to use her favorite woke word that way. So, I think it's really interesting especially since we heard that the World Bank is going to be withholding funds from them now that they are not a normal country and they're a terrorist organization run land. One thing that I did think was positive out of Secretary Blinken's briefing is we actually got some numbers about how many Americans were in Afghanistan and how many have been evacuated. So, he said that there were 6,000 Americans who had it since August 14th -- sorry, 6k Americans registered August 14th, 4,500 evacuated since, he believes there will be less than a thousand still in the country. And I thought the idea of people who do want to keep staying there, it was interesting. Like I can't imagine at this moment being like, hey, no, I'm going to wait this one out. And I get it, there are dual nationals there. So, it will be interesting to see where that goes. But the 82,000 evacuees, a lot of people are getting out, obviously foreign nationals but a lot of Afghans are getting to other places. They're going to Qatar. They're going to Western Europe and those all seem to be positives."

But it goes to that point, so the Biden administration with the Taliban has -- treated it as the de facto government from all along recognizing it, elevating it and legitimizing it, trusting it, going back to 2013 when Obama and Biden provided a diplomatic presence to Doha, Qatar for the Taliban but then you throw in they abandoned the Afghan Security Forces, left the power vacuum. You know, Al Qaeda's ascendant now, 15 provinces since then, but also, remember, why is Al Qaeda a concern now? You know, they had bioweapons lab 20 years ago. You don't think that they've look at China and what's going on with the Wuhan virus killing four and half million people around the globe, that's a possibility and then our allies in Europe are apoplectic.

I don't see how he survives this. Now tactically, what is this, the costliest military blunder in United States history?

In this poll he's at 39 percent in the economy and in various other polls he's in the 20s and 30s for the border, energy crisis and Afghanistan. And it's not just policy, it's personal too, in the CBS poll. The majority of American people don't think the guy is competent or focused. And foreign policy has dogged the Democratic Party since the Cold War and they have really struggled to gain the trust of the American voter over the last several decades and this bungling of Afghanistan is going to set the Democratic Party back pretty far.

I don't know is the things are that sexy that they're going to run on. COVID relief, infrastructure, that's not going to jazz people up. Meanwhile, you have Afghanistan, gas prices, crime, open borders, inflation. That's going to be tough and I'm not really sure it's going to work out too well for the Democrats."

He's the one who always said, open borders a little scary, like we're not, you know, we're not giving away all this free stuff, I'm not Bernie Sanders, I've never been a socialist my whole life. You know, you're a dogged face phony soldier and like, you know exactly who I am. Now Democrats on the congressional level - and I'm not sure as much on the Senate level - are going to have to make an estimation, what's good for me if you are on the border, they're talking a lot tougher about it. You have Seth Moulton and Peter Meijer bipartisan coalition they went to Afghanistan yesterday really pissed off. Everybody in leadership to see what was going on there. That's a little bit of a fissure that I think is going to be happening amongst the veterans versus the establishment there where they are saying, you know, I may typically be with you but I feel a kindred spirit to this region, we fought for this in Iraq and Afghanistan, I want to be there.

Because that, the choice is never going to be right or wrong. It's always going to be good and evil. And the media knows exactly what side they're on which is the good side. We're evil. I'm evil. I'm OK with that. You've got to remember; these are the three things from 2020 that the media performed so they'll do anything. Number one, they buried the laptop story to sway an election, that worked because when the poll shows that if they knew about that they would've voted differently. They bragged about their secret cabal after the election in Time magazine, that massive piece that talked about all the institutions working together and if you dare question any election discrepancy unless it's a Democrat loss you are guilty of the big lie. So, they are also going to push, they're also going to bring back the insurrection even though obviously it's not an insurrection. The FBI found evidence of some plot. But they are going to be using the I word and the I word bring back those visuals to make you feel that the Republicans are the kind of the Taliban of America which is what they are really going to try to go for. And it might work because when you are a Republican you are always running against, it's two against one, it's Democrats and the media. So, you got to try harder. And that's why we need more vets running for office because we need some clear idealism in this government."

In terms of the -- why Biden is polling so badly on the economy is purely inflation, consumer confidence has fallen to a 10-year low, real wages, or inflation-adjusted wages have fallen every month that Biden has been in office. And now that Democrats have backed themselves into a corner, the only thing that they can brag about is spending more money. They are going to brag about and it's more like $5 trillion over 10 years, they are going to brag about spending money when they are claiming ownership of causing the inflation if they do that. So, they have to be very careful about that. Also, all of these new entitlement programs they've created to get the middle class hooked on government like the extra child tax credit that expires but what's in this plan that the Democrats are pushing, that's one of the reasons in the short run that all these jobs are unfilled. It's more than 10 million jobs. So, when you go to the airport, or stuff is not in stock, the reason that customer service is so bad is because these companies can't hire people."

And it is their legal right to seek asylum here. And they should go through the process. But of course, the interpreter should come, people who fought alongside us, but you shouldn't talk about them like that just because they're coming from a different place. And hopefully, that will get figured -- I'm literally hearing hurry up. Anyway, the point is, on the Supreme Court ruling, it's actually very unclear. They didn't say what the violation actually was. And the policy, the remain in Mexico policy hasn't been in place since March 2020 anyway. So, it seems like Secretary Mayorkas can just go back to them with more thorough explanation of why they don't want the remain in Mexico policy. They had taken it down because of COVID. And to the point about the Taliban people getting here, under Trump March 20, 2020, the peace pact, the Afghans had to release 5000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for only 1000 Afghan prisoners. So, if there is Taliban terrorists coming over here to hurt us, it could have been very well released under President Trump but no one talks about that, or you don't talk about that."

Trump's policy of remain in Mexico seems like a really innocuous solution to a problem, right? You work with Mexico over a porous border. We cooperate. But out of spite and no logic, Joe killed that because he killed a lot of things that were -- that were related to Trump just because it was Trump.

He was with the band nearly 60 years joining in '63. Tributes poured in, obviously, from everywhere, all of his bandmates. The tributes from the living Beatles I thought were particularly incredible. He's just an amazing guy. He also had the Charlie Watts orchestra. He was a huge jazz enthusiast. Married 57 years. I got to see them perform in Hyde Park when I lived in London, which was one of the coolest experiences of my life. Mick Jagger actually went to the school of economics where I went for one year.
