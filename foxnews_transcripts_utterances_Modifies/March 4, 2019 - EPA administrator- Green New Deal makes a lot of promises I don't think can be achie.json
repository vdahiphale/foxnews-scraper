Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto.

And, to be blunt, they were completely overshadowed by the Cohen testimony. Did that bother him?  Manifestly so.  Let me take you to Twitter. The president not only talking about that in particular. He's been talking about Democrats at great length lately, in particular talking again about this idea of collusion. He said this: \"There is no collusion. All of these investigations are in search of a crime. Democrats have no evidence to impeach President Trump.  Ridiculous.\"   He was quoting there Devin Nunes, of course, the congressman from California. Now, the president also took that tack in his speech, Charles, over at CPAC over the weekend, two-hours-long-plus. He touched on his frustration with the Mueller probe, which he said is baseless.",

Let's hold on impeachment, though there are many things that could be considered impeachable offenses up to this point, because we frankly just won't have the votes from Republicans in the Senate in order for this to go anywhere. Let's instead acknowledge the fact that there have been likely many multiple felonies conducted from the president.

I think what's really reflective too is not only was there that poll, but recently they did a state-by-state analysis of how President Trump stacks up in each state. And it's fascinating, because California, New York and some other Northeastern states, he doesn't poll that well, but pretty much the rest of the country, he polls wonderfully.

We don't want to get out in front of our skis on this. But this is going to be -- make no mistake of it -- the next two years of a House Democratic majority.

But optimism seemed to turn to skepticism, as investors questioned the substance of that deal and also whether it will actually eliminate all tariffs. In the end, the Dow putting in, well, one of its worst performance in a month. Same story for the S&P, seeing its worst day in a month. But it could have been a lot worse, the Dow off more than 400 points at one stage. Financial and health care stocks saw the biggest losses, but the sell-off pretty broad-based in the end. We also, by the way, saw a disappointing report on construction spending in December. It fell 0.6 percent, when a slight gain was expected. But, as the markets reversed course, the U.S. dollar gained strength. We also saw treasury yields slip a little bit, as investors looked for a safer haven.  You know what, though, Charles? Investors will get a snapshot of consumer spending this week, as we will hear from a host of retailers reporting their latest earnings, including Costco, Kohl's, and early tomorrow morning Target. But perhaps the biggest piece of economic data comes at the end of the week, when the government releases its monthly jobs report for February.  That will be on Friday.

      "sentences": "And in the three decades leading up to the early '90s, the crime rate had tripled. But, since 1992, thanks to critical legal reforms and improved policing tactics and better technology, we have made a great deal of progress. The national murder rate and violent crime grade have both been cut in half over the past three decades. The U.S. attorney from the Eastern District of New York was in my office the other day, and he threw out a figure that caught my attention. He said, you know, when you were attorney general last time, we had 2200 murders in New York City, and today we have 289 a year. It's 86 percent reduction. In 2015 and '16, there was a bit of an uptick -- uptick in violent crime, but I'm happy to say that crime is falling once again. And, according to the FBI's UCR report, both murder and violent crime went down in 2016. Just last week, the FBI released its preliminary crime statistics for the first six months of 2018. They are only preliminary numbers, but they show a 6.7 percent decline in murders, a 12.5 percent decline in robbery, and a 12.7 percent decline in burglary, compared to the first six months of 2017. While we can't rest on our laurels, we should acknowledge the massive progress that has been made. And that's why I'm committed to implementing the FIRST STEP Act. As you know, that act is going to help us use our prison space more efficiently, imprison only those who need to be there, and help those who have completed their sentences transition back to being productive members of society. As we go forward, we will be vigilant to ensure that the public safety is not adversely affected. Sadly, there's one area in which far more progress needs to be made, and that is with regard to drug abuse. We're facing a grave situation today. In 2017, as you know, 70,000 Americans lost their lives to drugs, more than ever before. And this was largely because that the drugs on the street are far more potent than they have ever been. As you know, fentanyl is so potent, that it only takes the equivalent of a pinch of salt to be fatal.  And carfentanil is even more deadly, with one grain sufficient to put someone into an overdose. Over the last two years, we have gained ground in reducing opioid prescriptions. Prescriptions for the seven most frequently abused prescription opioids are now down 21 percent, to the lowest level in at least a decade. The DEA has lowered the legal limits on the production of the active ingredients in these prescription opioids by 47 percent since 2016. And I'm sure, as you have discussed in the panel preceding this, we have been moving aggressively with our state partners to go after legal opioids and traffickers. The number of defendants charged with opioid-related crimes increased by 28 percent from fiscal year 2017 to 2018. Most importantly, thanks to these and other efforts, drug deaths have finally stopped arising, it appears. According to preliminary -- preliminary data from the CDC, overdose deaths decreased 3.1 percent nationwide from September 2017 to July 2018, which is the most recent month for which we have data. Even while our efforts are starting to take hold, the scourge of synthetic opioids confronts us with a daunting challenge. These drugs alone in 2017 cost 28,000 American lives. And we know that China's a leading source of these powerful drugs, but, increasingly, we see traffickers in Mexico working to develop the ability to produce them. For the four years in a row, the DEA has stated publicly that the Mexican transnational criminal organizations are the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States. No other group is currently positioned to challenge them. The DEA tells us that the majority of the heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl in this country got here across our southern border. Having a porous southern border makes every state in the union more vulnerable to these drugs. And the problem of a porous border is not limited to drugs. It also creates opportunities for human trafficking, one of the most heinous criminal acts there is. The department is stepping up our action against human trafficking. I was just briefed yesterday about it, and helped set out a plan for stepping up our efforts in terms of the cross-border trafficking. And just last month, we secured a total of 108 years of prison for five members of the notorious Rendon-Reyes trafficking organization, which exploited underage Mexican girls for more than a decade. But while the porous border compounds the problem...",

I think what's really reflective too is not only was there that poll, but recently they did a state-by-state analysis of how President Trump stacks up in each state. And it's fascinating, because California, New York and some other Northeastern states, he doesn't poll that well, but pretty much the rest of the country, he polls wonderfully.

And, as you say, it all started so brightly at the opening bell, the Dow jumping higher by 130 points on optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal being completed soon. That was the hope. But optimism seemed to turn to skepticism, as investors questioned the substance of that deal and also whether it will actually eliminate all tariffs. In the end, the Dow putting in, well, one of its worst performance in a month. Same story for the S&P, seeing its worst day in a month. But it could have been a lot worse, the Dow off more than 400 points at one stage. Financial and health care stocks saw the biggest losses, but the sell-off pretty broad-based in the end. We also, by the way, saw a disappointing report on construction spending in December. It fell 0.6 percent, when a slight gain was expected. But, as the markets reversed course, the U.S. dollar gained strength. We also saw treasury yields slip a little bit, as investors looked for a safer haven. You know what, though, Charles? Investors will get a snapshot of consumer spending this week, as we will hear from a host of retailers reporting their latest earnings, including Costco, Kohl's, and early tomorrow morning Target. But perhaps the biggest piece of economic data comes at the end of the week, when the government releases its monthly jobs report for February.  That will be on Friday. It's expected 180,000 jobs were created. We shall find out -- Charles, back to you."

When I was in private practice, I represented over 20 different companies.  I represented an environmental -- air quality management district in California, the nuclear industry, a solar company. I have represented the gambit of energy and environment companies. But for some reason, my critics only focus on one client. And for that coal company, my number one issue for them was trying to shore up the miners' health care and pension benefits for the last -- for the last four years that I worked for them, trying to improve the United Mine Workers' retirees. So I'm very proud of what I did on behalf of that company. But it was only one of 20-some companies."

One of the reasons we sold off in December was after they took control of the House. And now they're going after Trump. I mean, you could have looked at it at a one-minute chart today when that news came out, and the market fell and broke the lows and sank and just sold off. You're going to see more of this, this year. Now, we have had a great run-up here ever since December 26. And even the first two months of the year were solid like a brick. But now you're going to see more volatility because the Democrats are going after Trump. And like it or not, whatever your political affiliation, the market likes Trump. And we don't want to see any of this craziness going after him. And I will say one more thing. The Democrats are doing this. They did the Mueller investigation and didn't come up with anything. Now they're going after him with these political things here. How stupid do they think the American people are? The American people are not stupid. They're going to see right through this."

If it comes out a lot better than we expected, we get even more out of this, then it can go higher. You can say it's a little volatile also like it was last year. The market is kind of high right now. It needs there not to be a global economic slowdown. It needs interest rates to not go higher.

That's another one of the unresolved issues for the market as well this year for 2019, if rates get raised too soon, too quick, too fast. But I think the Fed backed off, and the market liked that. That's one of the reasons we have had this beautiful rally. I mean, if you look at it, we're only 5 percent off the highs. That's fantastic when you look at where we were in the middle of December or even the end of the year, before we started rallying.

      "utterance": "Well, any time you have a fistfight going on, on the left over the Green New Deal, and it's sucking up headlines, it's a good day for President Trump and Republicans. President Trump, that's why he was so gleeful at CPAC talking to them on this subject. He is -- wants this fight, this 2020 reelection fight to be about capitalism vs. socialism. And that's what he sees in this Green New Deal highlighting, is this -- you see the polls out there. You have a Hill-Harris poll saying 67 percent of American public thinks that the Green New Deal is about socialism. And then you have another poll just out today, the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, saying that only 25 percent of the American public really thinks that socialism is a good trait for a presidential candidate."

      "utterance": "Right. In that same poll, it does rate this -- it rates higher amongst millennials. And I think this is the problem that the Democrats have. You have got establishment Democrats there who've been around the block a few times, understand how elections play out, and you have got some new -- new folks in the Democratic Party who are -- who have come in like gangbusters. I mean, they are making a lot of noise. They are not following any rules.  They can't be sort of -- it really is amazing, because now they actually seem to have forced their will upon the party itself."

      "speaker": "CRABTREE",
      "utterance": "That's right, though, as you know, millennial voters, they don't tend to vote in large numbers. We did see some large numbers in California last time around, so that could be changing, as you -- as they see people like AOC and others that are relatively in their same age group, and they're inspired by them. But, as you know, older voters do tend to vote. And they're not viewing this Green New Deal in a great, positive light. And we see that playing out on Capitol Hill, when even the sponsors of the Green New Deal, the original authors, Ed Markey from -- a Democrat from Massachusetts, along with AOC, he doesn't even really want to have a vote on this bill, as McConnell is pushing for a vote any day now. And so it's really interesting that you see that even Ed Markey and Dianne Feinstein, with their controversial video last week with the kids really pushing her to vote, she's saying, this isn't really realistic. And now they're all going to vote present, which is kind of an interesting strategy. That's the latest we heard. And now they're saying that they might have an alternative new deal. So this debate is shifting as we speak."

      "utterance": "Of course, under this Green New Deal, there's a lot of things that -- it's a massive umbrella of -- really, I think it's more of a social justice document than anything fiscal or environmental, to be quite frank with you. It covers a lot of things, including the original version of it that would that would have paid people who didn't want to work. Obviously, they have backpedaled on that. But, Susan, it does seem like this unstoppable juggernaut within the party.  And you do have to wonder, to your point, President Trump is gleeful about it, and so are a lot of other -- a lot of other Republicans. But what if this actually was the centerpiece of their platform in 2020?"

    {
      "speaker": "CRABTREE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they're going to have a big uphill battle. What I'm hearing, though, is they're trying to shift the rhetoric. They're saying that climate change doesn't really get a lot of votes out in Middle America, certainly not in the Rust Belt, and what we saw, the area that Trump captured last time around, because they care about jobs, Trump's everything. And the president was very good at really grabbing those votes, and unexpectedly, when you got into Michigan and Wisconsin. So it doesn't seem like the Democrats really learned from that experience. But you do have this push even among the millennials. And it's going to be -- it's going to be really interesting to see if they can really get millennials out to the polls. I think that's the key here. But you do see the rhetoric changing on this.  People are saying, well -- I think Celinda Lake, the pollster, Democratic poster, says, when you use words like transitioning to green alternatives, that plays better among the public. But when you say climate change and the Green New Deal, it doesn't."

And, certainly, if Mueller isn't going to be giving them what they want for impeachment, I'm not sure the American people are going to see their investigation as more legitimate than something -- somebody like a special prosecutor, who is supposed to be independent."

      "speaker": "WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "And in the three decades leading up to the early '90s, the crime rate had tripled. But, since 1992, thanks to critical legal reforms and improved policing tactics and better technology, we have made a great deal of progress. The national murder rate and violent crime grade have both been cut in half over the past three decades. The U.S. attorney from the Eastern District of New York was in my office the other day, and he threw out a figure that caught my attention. He said, you know, when you were attorney general last time, we had 2200 murders in New York City, and today we have 289 a year. It's 86 percent reduction. In 2015 and '16, there was a bit of an uptick -- uptick in violent crime, but I'm happy to say that crime is falling once again. And, according to the FBI's UCR report, both murder and violent crime went down in 2016. Just last week, the FBI released its preliminary crime statistics for the first six months of 2018. They are only preliminary numbers, but they show a 6.7 percent decline in murders, a 12.5 percent decline in robbery, and a 12.7 percent decline in burglary, compared to the first six months of 2017. While we can't rest on our laurels, we should acknowledge the massive progress that has been made. And that's why I'm committed to implementing the FIRST STEP Act. As you know, that act is going to help us use our prison space more efficiently, imprison only those who need to be there, and help those who have completed their sentences transition back to being productive members of society. As we go forward, we will be vigilant to ensure that the public safety is not adversely affected. Sadly, there's one area in which far more progress needs to be made, and that is with regard to drug abuse. We're facing a grave situation today. In 2017, as you know, 70,000 Americans lost their lives to drugs, more than ever before. And this was largely because that the drugs on the street are far more potent than they have ever been. As you know, fentanyl is so potent, that it only takes the equivalent of a pinch of salt to be fatal.  And carfentanil is even more deadly, with one grain sufficient to put someone into an overdose. Over the last two years, we have gained ground in reducing opioid prescriptions. Prescriptions for the seven most frequently abused prescription opioids are now down 21 percent, to the lowest level in at least a decade. The DEA has lowered the legal limits on the production of the active ingredients in these prescription opioids by 47 percent since 2016. And I'm sure, as you have discussed in the panel preceding this, we have been moving aggressively with our state partners to go after legal opioids and traffickers. The number of defendants charged with opioid-related crimes increased by 28 percent from fiscal year 2017 to 2018. Most importantly, thanks to these and other efforts, drug deaths have finally stopped arising, it appears. According to preliminary -- preliminary data from the CDC, overdose deaths decreased 3.1 percent nationwide from September 2017 to July 2018, which is the most recent month for which we have data. Even while our efforts are starting to take hold, the scourge of synthetic opioids confronts us with a daunting challenge. These drugs alone in 2017 cost 28,000 American lives. And we know that China's a leading source of these powerful drugs, but, increasingly, we see traffickers in Mexico working to develop the ability to produce them. For the four years in a row, the DEA has stated publicly that the Mexican transnational criminal organizations are the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States. No other group is currently positioned to challenge them. The DEA tells us that the majority of the heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl in this country got here across our southern border. Having a porous southern border makes every state in the union more vulnerable to these drugs. And the problem of a porous border is not limited to drugs. It also creates opportunities for human trafficking, one of the most heinous criminal acts there is. The department is stepping up our action against human trafficking. I was just briefed yesterday about it, and helped set out a plan for stepping up our efforts in terms of the cross-border trafficking. And just last month, we secured a total of 108 years of prison for five members of the notorious Rendon-Reyes trafficking organization, which exploited underage Mexican girls for more than a decade. But while the porous border compounds the problem..."
