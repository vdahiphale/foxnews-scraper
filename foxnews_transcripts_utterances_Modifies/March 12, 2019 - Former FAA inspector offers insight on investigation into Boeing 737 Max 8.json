Dozens of people, from college coaches, to, as you mentioned, Hollywood actresses, CEOs, parents, exam administrators, have been arrested facing various charges for their involvement in this widespread conspiracy. The scheme aimed to help students gain admission to these elite universities, Yale, Georgetown, Wake Forest, University of Southern California Stanford. The institutions, by the way, didn't know about this scam. And some have already taken action against indicted coaches. There are 50 defendants named, as I mentioned, CEO, a fashion designer, a wine maker. Perhaps most recognizable being those two actresses, Lori Loughlin, best known for role in the sitcom \"Full House,\" and Felicity Huffman of \"Desperate Housewives\" fame.  At the center of the scam, William Rick Singer, 58, of Newport, California, who pled guilty today in federal court, charged with racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, obstruction of justice. He ran a college counseling business, as well as a purported charity. Uber-wealthy parents gave him in total combined $25 million to either aid them in faking their child's athletic prowess in the bribery of coaches or to aid them in a fake test or a corrected test or to pay off test administrators. Now, this is far from over as well.

They say it's OK to go to this part of the island, but stay away from this part. Some of the parts they tell you -- tell people to stay away from are some of the neighborhoods where people live, some of the poorer sections of cities in the Caribbean.

The travel advisory for the State Department should be the starting point in your research before did you go somewhere. But you need to do other research. Look at the travel advisories for some of the other countries, like the U.K., like Australia, and do even deeper research into the particular place that you are going.

So I won't be counting voting -- votes. What I will do is count on the opportunity to bring it to the floor and let people vote their consciences. I think that's appropriate.

The president has separated people from their families down at the border. These happen to be people of color. The president wanted a Muslim ban.

In Federalist 65, Hamilton, Madison, Jay, they are the author ares of The Federalist Papers. They made it clear to us that impeachment is not going to be a pleasant thing. It can cause turmoil. It can cause people to vote along party lines. When Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868, he was impeached for speaking ill of Congress. If you cause harm to society, that's the test. Then you can be impeached."

That was the reason. So, Mr. Cavuto, you don't have to commit a crime to be impeached. Most of the constitutional authorities agree with me on this point. Misdeeds, high crimes and misdemeanors, misdeeds are misdemeanors. That's what the misdemeanors are all about, misdeeds. If a president commits misdeeds, it doesn't matter what party he is in.

Well, IRS officials, prosecutors, the FBI today announcing the culmination of Operation Varsity Blues, the bust-up of this international/national college admissions schemes bribery, faked tests, and faked athletic prowess as well. Dozens of people, from college coaches, to, as you mentioned, Hollywood actresses, CEOs, parents, exam administrators, have been arrested facing various charges for their involvement in this widespread conspiracy. The scheme aimed to help students gain admission to these elite universities, Yale, Georgetown, Wake Forest, University of Southern California Stanford. The institutions, by the way, didn't know about this scam. And some have already taken action against indicted coaches. There are 50 defendants named, as I mentioned, CEO, a fashion designer, a wine maker. Perhaps most recognizable being those two actresses, Lori Loughlin, best known for role in the sitcom \"Full House,\" and Felicity Huffman of \"Desperate Housewives\" fame. At the center of the scam, William Rick Singer, 58, of Newport, California, who pled guilty today in federal court, charged with racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, obstruction of justice. He ran a college counseling business, as well as a purported charity. Uber-wealthy parents gave him in total combined $25 million to either aid them in faking their child's athletic prowess in the bribery of coaches or to aid them in a fake test or a corrected test or to pay off test administrators. Now, this is far from over as well. It's worth noting that administrators say they are still -- investigators say they are still investigating, and there could potentially be more arrests, more indictments of parents and others -- Neil."

Meantime, individual airlines in Latin America, also in South Africa and in North America have also individually grounded the plane themselves. Now, the FAA continues to say that the 737 MAX is airworthy, in their view. And Boeing reiterated their full confidence in this type of plane. But we do have senators, for instance, like Mitt Romney, Elizabeth Warren, Blumenthal and also Feinstein, all lobbying the FAA to, hey, take some precautionary measures, maybe ground the plane until you know what's wrong with it and maybe there's some sort of software upgrade to make it safer to fly. Boeing, meantime, they have a really taken bad hits on the stock market, the worst two-day slide for the plane maker in close to three years, Neil.

We really are talking about something that happened recently. We don't know what the investigators have found.

But think about the parts of the country that you are going to. I think a lot of your audience is probably surprised to see all those countries in the Caribbean in level two. Those are places that many of us go for vacation or for work that we enjoy. They seem OK. The crime in the Caribbean gets less attention than the crime in places like Venezuela, you just showed, or places like Mexico. But you would be surprised to know that there is actually a higher incidence of violent crime in the Caribbean than the rest of Latin America. It's even higher than in Africa as well. So, there is a reason."

And there is a -- you know, a high level of availability of guns in the Caribbean. So that's part of the reason. If you look at the travel advisories that the State Department has for some of those Caribbean countries, they differentiate between different parts. They say it's OK to go to this part of the island, but stay away from this part. Some of the parts they tell you -- tell people to stay away from are some of the neighborhoods where people live, some of the poorer sections of cities in the Caribbean. So it gives travelers some indication of what parts they can go to and what not. Of course, travelers have to use, you know, good reason in terms of where they are going to go. The travel advisory for the State Department should be the starting point in your research before did you go somewhere. But you need to do other research. Look at the travel advisories for some of the other countries, like the U.K., like Australia, and do even deeper research into the particular place that you are going. I would hate for people not to go to places that are off the beaten path if they are safe. So, you just need to investigate and do your research."

When you have an air safety problem like we have with the airplanes that have crashed, that's a different thing. That's something government should be involved in for the safety of travelers. And even when you look at the universities, which was on there, these are all tax-exempt organizations and bribery and that type of stuff. Harvard University's endowment is $40 billion, I think. It's a hedge fund with a slight, small attachment of a university. And they get all these tax breaks and everything. They should be taxed ordinarily for their profits they make on those funds. And I don't think Maxine Waters should be looking at Wells Fargo and saying, are you too large to be managed, when she herself is in the federal government, which is clearly too large to be managed?

The question is, is a government-run corporate sector than a private-run corporate sector? And beyond what we have done so far, we are way over the pale, I think, in having the oversight on companies. Now, when it's safety and military and stuff like that, yes, I totally agree. But just having them in there to talk about this stuff is just not where we should be. And, again, I'm not exonerating the companies. I think shareholders have a perfect right to sell their shares and dump them and get out of them and all of that. But Maxine Waters doesn't -- has not earned the right to be the head of GM or GE or any other big company. Yet she is able to put herself into that position by way of politics.

Fox News first reported and it was later confirmed by Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis that the president's former personal attorney met with Cohen's staff are over 10 hours during four meetings in New York.

But the congressman wouldn't commit today to a timeline for releasing the Cohen testimony. In a separate development, Neil, a source familiar with the investigation confirms to FOX News that the New York state attorney general has sent subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank, seeking financial records for several Trump Organizations that were mentioned during Cohen's testimony. The subpoenas are the response to that testimony and the valuation for Trump properties. The Trump Organization had no on-the-record comment today. And FOX News also confirmed that the special counsel budget is in place through September, but this reflects the government rules, rather than inside information about the investigation's duration -- Neil."

So, to make of this wedge between Democrats? FOX News contributor Kat Timpf, Democratic strategist Robin Biro, and America Majority CEO Ned Ryun.

I was a huge critic of hers, but she's really been doing a fantastic job managing people's expectations within my party. And she needs to be doing that right now, because impeachment is a nonstarter.

Polling, most of it suggests that more than 60 percent of voters don't want to impeach the president. So, that's one thing. It would be unpopular. And even the people who it might be popular with, it's not going to get enough votes in Congress for it to go through. So, this could backfire, the same way it did with Republicans and Bill Clinton in actually making him more popular."

What are they going to do going home in 2020 say, oh, yes, we are a part of this impeachment off spurious charges? That's the whole reason that she is speaker. So she's looking at this for her political life and being speaker, saying, let's not go down this path. I would like to be speaker post-2020.

But leaving that aside, the passion of the party -- and I'm not saying Green is the passion of the party -- but he represents the view of a lot of folks who find that they can't drop the ball on this. They won't drop the ball on this. When I told him about whether he will get 66 votes, like he did the last time he did this in early '18, he said, all I need is one, my own vote.
