E-mail exchanges, we got our hands on, from State Department officials that could alter the course of President Trump's impeachment. We are going to expose what the Obama administration knew about Hunter Biden, Burisma, and reveal how it all ties back to the person some have floated as the whistleblower. Our exclusive investigation comes later in the hour.  But first, the Democrat impeachment managers just wrapped their case for the night. However, it was just a few moments earlier today that set the tone. The Democrats tried convincing an impeachment weary nation that the case against the President is open and shut. Because they lack essential facts to prove impeachable offenses, they had to resort to the usual - lies. That's something the President called out this morning.",

Schiff has taken what Mulvaney said out of context - this is what Schiff does, and he's doing it to smear the President and bolster the sham impeachment. It's shameless. So why isn't any other outlet calling these lies out? It was actually more than just a lies. And this was one moment that just - of all the moments today really, really got my goat. Schiff confirmed today what we have been telling you for the last three years. Democrats don't really like the idea that you - you the American people, get to pick our President.

Joining me now is Congressman Doug Collins, member of Trump's impeachment defense team and Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee.

Well, number one, they want to say that the - if they don't do something now, the election is rigged, everybody needs to be aware of that. And number two, they're saying if the senate doesn't do what they want them to do, then the Senate is corrupt. But let me just say something. For everybody who's watched the Democratic primary presidential field, that clown car can't win. They keep getting out and they just keep getting worse. Because when compared to the President, who is actually has something to run on - trade deals, economy that's booming, a foreign policy that works, they know that they can't win on the facts. So they're trying to do everything they can to undermine our President who has done everything he said he would do, which is unique in politics. But he's not only done what he said he would do, he's followed through and reached out to millions of Americans who've been cut out of the system, African-Americans, Hispanics, who are at the lowest unemployment rate in years, they've been put into the system.   Things like The First Step Act, like criminal justice reform. Where this President reaches out, where all the Democrats have done is use them as political pawns. This is why you're seeing what you're seeing on the floor, a rehash of tall tales, lies and dishonesty when they know they can't have candidates who can beat him at the ballot box. So what do you do?

Obstruction of Congress, is simply Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler pitching a temper tantrum, because they didn't get what they wanted. And now they're going to the Senate to say, Senate, we didn't want to do our job. We didn't want to do what we're supposed to do, so you do it for us.  I mean, yesterday, when Adam Schiff said, well, we didn't call John Bolton, because he said that he would take it to court, and then we just backed off. Well, that's just saying that you either give into my demands or I'm going to say that you're corrupt anyway. They can't prove there - in House. Now they're going to the Senate. And it's just - I guess, what it is, is they repeated enough times. They're hoping beyond hope, beyond hope that somebody will believe that it's actually true. The problem is, nobody's listening to them anymore. They're saying the same things that we've already disproved, because here's the interesting issue, Laura.

One thing that I noticed inside the Senate chamber today is that - you talked about the Cliporama. When they start to play those videos or put up those slides, everybody in the chamber turns. That is making a great impact. And if the White House legal team is going to parrot that, that's something that might dovetail and maybe help the President in the defense. But that's something that a lot of people were paying particular attention to. The other thing that sort of up was John Kennedy. Republican Senator from Louisiana indicated reporters earlier tonight, Laura, that he said he was learning things in this process. He said, as a Senator, it's hard to keep up with what the House have been doing. You have other responsibilities and sitting there listening hour after hour, even though sometimes it can be rather sonorous, he said, he was learning something.

      "sentences": "But tonight \"The Ingraham Angle\" obtained exclusive documents that show just how important he or she is. We got our hands on a batch of State Department emails from May of last year. The chain centers on a request from The New York Times reporter Ken Vogel. You might remember he is the former \"Politico\" reporter who wrote this story about Ukrainian efforts to hobble Trump's presidential run in 2016. But that's just a conspiracy theory, right? Fast-forward to May of 2019. Vogel sends an email to State Department official Kate Schilling about a story he was working on regarding an Obama era meeting with Ukrainian prosecutors. In his request, Vogel mentions a name who some have reported as the whistleblower. We have not yet confirmed this name, so we are just blacking it out for here. Vogel's email reads as follows. \"We are going to report that \"State Department official\" Elizabeth Zentos attended a meeting on the White House on January 19th, 2016, with Ukrainian prosecutors and embassy officials. The subjects discussed included efforts within the United States government to support prosecutions in the Ukraine and the United Kingdom of Burisma Holdings, and concerns that Hunter Biden's position with the company could complicate such efforts.\" On May 1st, State Department official Kate Schilling forwarded Vogel's email to her colleagues Elizabeth Zentos and George Kent. Remember him? He was one of the House Democrats all-star impeachment witnesses. According to Schilling's email, Kent has previously been a source for Vogel. I wonder how many times, I was thinking about that yesterday. But I digress. Follow- up emails reveal the conversation ending on May 3rd when the State Department eventually just declined to comment. We at The Ingraham Angle were, however, able to corroborate details about the January, 2016, meeting. However, we did this using archived Obama White House visitor logs. They're not going to tell us. We have to go to the logs. You can see them on the screen now. They show that the person who many believe to be the whistleblower checked in numerous Ukrainian officials into the White House on January 19th, 2016, the day Vogel claims there was a meeting on the Burisma and Biden. Also at the meeting were Ukraine's lead anticorruption prosecutor and the head of the country's anticorruption bureau, both of whom were there to discuss the complications of Hunter Biden's sweetheart gig. So what happened to that New York Times story about the 2016 meeting? Pretty hot, don't you think? It was never published. We asked Ken Vogel, the reporter, why nothing ever came of it, but he didn't respond. \"The New York Times\" director of communications did, however, also refusing to answer our questions about why the story never ran, instead noting that Vogel's request for comment was just consistent with their newsgathering process. Got it, nothing to see here. The timing of their request and the subsequent squashing of the story are very interesting. Let me explain why. Biden announced his candidacy on April 25th, 2019. The exchanges we laid out here in this segment occur the following week. So now we have some questions. Number one -- why wasn't the whistleblower concerned about Joe Biden overseeing Ukraine policy while his son was cashing in? Was it only troubling that Trump himself tried to get this thing investigated, this entire unsavory deal? Number two, why didn't this story ever run? Did Biden's team manage to put it down, fearing blowback from his son Hunter's dirty dealings, maybe? There's a reason Adam Schiff and now Chuck Schumer fume, as they did tonight, over the very idea of Hunter Biden testifying. They know in their heart of hearts that Ukrainian corruption reached back all the way to the Obama administration, and they did nothing. His testimony would also force the Democrats to admit that there are 2020 frontrunner oversaw U.S. policy in Ukraine while his own son was bilking their system for 50k a month. We need more documentation on this. We want all the emails, all the text messages, we want to see exactly what was happening inside that State Department last year and then in the White House in January, 2016, when these meetings were taking place and when the effort to respond to this \"New York Times\" reporter was playing out. There's a lot more to uncover, and we hope maybe some of our friends in the media will actually start thinking this is as big a story as it is. Joining me now is Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal, editorial board member, and Lee Smith, investigative journalist and author of \"The Plot Against The President.\" Kim, you say these revelations get to the heart of the Democrats impeachment argument.

And if we now have evidence of the Obama administration was holding meetings about this -- we already know, Burisma was not just mom and pop corner shop store. This was a company that was started by the former, a brainchild of the former Ukrainian president, run by a prominent former Ukrainian official, on the radar screen of international law enforcement, and solicited prominent American political figures to sit on its board. It was a big deal, and therefore it does raise the question of how legitimate the target it was to ask about.",

We are going to expose what the Obama administration knew about Hunter Biden, Burisma, and reveal how it all ties back to the person some have floated as the whistleblower. Our exclusive investigation comes later in the hour. But first, the Democrat impeachment managers just wrapped their case for the night. However, it was just a few moments earlier today that set the tone. The Democrats tried convincing an impeachment weary nation that the case against the President is open and shut. Because they lack essential facts to prove impeachable offenses, they had to resort to the usual - lies. That's something the President called out this morning."

He was talking about the President's right - yes, his right, to conduct foreign policy and negotiate with foreign leaders. When he said \"Get over it,\" he was mocking all the liberals left aghast by the very idea that Trump, as President of the United States, can differ on policy with career bureaucrats on the seventh floor of the State Department. Schiff has taken what Mulvaney said out of context - this is what Schiff does, and he's doing it to smear the President and bolster the sham impeachment. It's shameless. So why isn't any other outlet calling these lies out? It was actually more than just a lies. And this was one moment that just - of all the moments today really, really got my goat. Schiff confirmed today what we have been telling you for the last three years. Democrats don't really like the idea that you - you the American people, get to pick our President. This whole democracy thing - representative democracy, it's kind of had its day. They don't like it anymore. They don't trust you - the American voters."

Joining me now is Congressman Doug Collins, member of Trump's impeachment defense team and Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman, they tried, in my view, to disenfranchise American voters with the bogus Russia collusion case that he repeated today, by the way, and now they moved on to this. Because they can't stand the idea that Trump could beat any of their shining stars from Bernie to Biden in November, so they cannot - they can't take it. And I've really come to the conclusion that if their people don't win, they have to say it's rigged. End of story."

      "speaker": "REP. DOUG COLLINS, R-GA.",
      "utterance": "Well, they have to, Laura. I mean, think about this, Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler, in particular, who went on a giant tirade last night, you know, talking about the Senate, what they're trying to do is do two things. Well, number one, they want to say that the - if they don't do something now, the election is rigged, everybody needs to be aware of that. And number two, they're saying if the senate doesn't do what they want them to do, then the Senate is corrupt. But let me just say something. For everybody who's watched the Democratic primary presidential field, that clown car can't win. They keep getting out and they just keep getting worse. Because when compared to the President, who is actually has something to run on - trade deals, economy that's booming, a foreign policy that works, they know that they can't win on the facts. So they're trying to do everything they can to undermine our President who has done everything he said he would do, which is unique in politics. But he's not only done what he said he would do, he's followed through and reached out to millions of Americans who've been cut out of the system, African-Americans, Hispanics, who are at the lowest unemployment rate in years, they've been put into the system. Things like The First Step Act, like criminal justice reform. Where this President reaches out, where all the Democrats have done is use them as political pawns. This is why you're seeing what you're seeing on the floor, a rehash of tall tales, lies and dishonesty when they know they can't have candidates who can beat him at the ballot box. So what do you do? You disenfranchise people. You tell them that they can't do it."

And this moment, that we're going to play next, again, shows the American people that what they couldn't prove in the House with a quid pro quo, they'll just simply restate in the Senate trial as if they have proven it.

      "utterance": "They don't have it, Laura. I mean, this is honest. Let me - look at it here. They had nothing - no case in the House. They went to two of the weakest impeachment articles ever been written. Jonathan Turley stated that, many others stated that. This abuse of power nonsense is saying, we'll just say whatever we want to say and call it abuse of power. Obstruction of Congress, is simply Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler pitching a temper tantrum, because they didn't get what they wanted. And now they're going to the Senate to say, Senate, we didn't want to do our job. We didn't want to do what we're supposed to do, so you do it for us. I mean, yesterday, when Adam Schiff said, well, we didn't call John Bolton, because he said that he would take it to court, and then we just backed off. Well, that's just saying that you either give into my demands or I'm going to say that you're corrupt anyway. They can't prove there - in House. Now they're going to the Senate. And it's just - I guess, what it is, is they repeated enough times. They're hoping beyond hope, beyond hope that somebody will believe that it's actually true. The problem is, nobody's listening to them anymore. They're saying the same things that we've already disproved, because here's the interesting issue, Laura. They not only are they missing on the process, which I saw destroyed in the House, but they're losing on the facts, because this President did nothing wrong. End of story. Acquit. Move all."

Senator, I was watching you, I was sitting on the other side up in the gallery, and I was watching you and Holly and Romney on the back there. And I was thinking, if I'm this board, how can these people sit through this for this many hours? It was unbelievable. But this was - this seemed like an exercise largely, I don't know, rooted in the Democrats a built-up fury, and anger that Trump actually gets to choose the foreign policy and dictate foreign policy for the United States. They hate that. They want the seventh floor, the second floor or whatever floor the State Department to determine it."

If they had genuine evidence of wrongdoing by this President, you think that they would just stand on that evidence and then let it stand. But rather they kept repeating themselves time and time and time again, because they did not prove their case in the House of Representatives. And as you say, what this really gets back to is, one, anger that the President won in 2016, and two, frustration that President - as the elected President gets to direct the foreign policy of the United States."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, Laura. That's right. I mean, no building, no office, no floor, anyone else not elected by the American people make foreign policy, the President makes foreign policy. Advisors advise, Presidents decide. And he's free to listen to their advice, he's free to reject their advice as well. And if the Democrats don't like that, then they should run someone on the ballot who can beat him this fall rather than trying to impeach him for, basically, policy difference."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. This just reminds me of like the bureaucracy bites back or the swamp monsters come back, because they're thinking, you came in saying you're going to drain the swamp? Well, the State Department is filled with swamp monsters, and they want to determine a more globalist foreign policy. They want to go back to the good old days and Trump doesn't want to take us there. And that's the tension that has, frankly, existed in the State Department since I was working in the Reagan administration. It's always that tension with the State Department. And, Senator, there was another moment, which I know with your military experience you're going to love to tee off on. This was Adam Schiff actually saying that Ukrainians died because of President Trump's decisions. Watch."

I didn't hear many of them complaining when Barack Obama refused to provide that aid for over three years. As you saw with Qasem Soleimani, Barack Obama says sent him pallets of cash. Donald Trump sent him Hellfire missiles. In Ukraine, Barack Obama sent meals ready to eat and blankets. Donald Trump sent Javelin anti-tank missiles. Yet, the Democrats weren't complaining when Barack Obama was putting all those Ukrainian risk - lives at risk lives for three years."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "No, Laura, there's no proof that that. The funding that was ultimately released in early September was for the next year. There's no evidence that any soldiers in Ukraine on the front lines were running short of supplies. Maybe inconvenience, some bureaucrats in Kiev who were trying to plan for the next year's budget, but there's no evidence that any soldiers didn't get the supplies they need. And let's remember, it's because of Donald Trump that they have things like anti-tank missiles. Whereas, Barack Obama only sent the meals ready to eat and blankets."

So can we infer from that that President Obama was keeping key information from the American people, saying one thing during the 2012 election cycle and planning to do another, is that not fraud? Is that not abuse of power under their definition, you could drive a truck through what they're describing as abuse of power."

And it's also as the White House lawyer said yesterday, reasonable for a President to look at the gross, obvious conflict of interest that Joe Biden had to run Ukraine policy for the Obama administration at a time when his son was receiving 50 or $80,000 a month from one of the most corrupt companies in Ukraine as well. I mean, that is always a legitimate inquiry for the United States before we send money to a government in which corruption can be endemic."

Here with me is Sol Wisenberg, Former Deputy and Independent Counsel; Bob Barr, Former Clinton Impeachment Manager; and John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow and Constitutional Scholar. Sol, something we heard from the senators today, was that these arguments were duplicates of yesterday? So did Democrats end up hurting themselves by using that process last night with the rules to make their arguments, because it really did seem like a heck of a lot of repetition today?"

I will say that they did, I thought, particularly Schiff, a skillful job of integrating their arguments with audiovisual aids. And, you know, Schiff, from what I understand, was a pretty good Assistant U.S. Attorney for six years. So I'll give him credit for that just on scorekeeping. But I think it's a real danger that people are going to say we get it. We've really gotten it from the beginning. Let's make a decision."

      "speaker": "JOHN EASTMAN, CLAREMONT INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, it's what we call law office originalism. You've got a point to make. You find some snippet of a founder that said it. You take it completely out of context and then pretend that's originalism. The references to Hamilton was particularly interesting, because Hamilton actually worried about an impeachment process that starts ending up having nothing to do with impeachment proper, but is used for partisan ends, and would put us in a perpetual war one faction against another. So if they want to quote Hamilton, they ought to quote the full measure of that speech, rather than a little snippet that they think proves a point they're making. This - it's just - it's mind numbingly dull and dishonest. And it's - I don't even know how you got through an hour and a half, Laura."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK. We're implying a corrupt intent, because the President used the system of checks and balances and his own Article I powers to say, you know, we're not giving you those documents or these witnesses, make us do it in court. So now that's obstruction of Congress and abuse of power? Bob, you can impeach a lot of presidents then, I guess, if it's an inappropriate conduct standard, that's it."

      "speaker": "BOB BARR, FORMER CLINTON IMPEACHMENT MANAGER",

That's the standard he uses. And whether it's in a legal context as a U.S. attorney or a political context and a challenge between two branches asserting their legitimate authority, it's inappropriate. And, again, here in this context, it ought to be stricken. It ought to be laughed out of the Senate on a motion to dismiss or summary judgment."

I mean, by the way, the Trump's attorneys are going to do that this week. They're going to have their own Cliporama, if that's what people really want.

And I would go through everything that he said, for which there's no evidence to back it up, I would move objections for every bit of evidence that's now been introduced into the record that is based on hearsay. The ability to object to a hearsay evidence was protected in the resolution. And I would spend the first part of my time cleaning out the crap in the record, and then say, OK, then here's what we have left. And that that clearly doesn't arise to the standard.

There are 16 more hours, the prosecution, the House, Democratic Impeachment Managers have. We expect them to take the bulk of their time and wrap up their case on Friday. And then Saturday, that's when the White House Defense Counsel Pat Cipollone and the rest of his legal team, that's when they would start to present their case. One thing that I noticed inside the Senate chamber today is that - you talked about the Cliporama. When they start to play those videos or put up those slides, everybody in the chamber turns. That is making a great impact. And if the White House legal team is going to parrot that, that's something that might dovetail and maybe help the President in the defense. But that's something that a lot of people were paying particular attention to. The other thing that sort of up was John Kennedy. Republican Senator from Louisiana indicated reporters earlier tonight, Laura, that he said he was learning things in this process. He said, as a Senator, it's hard to keep up with what the House have been doing. You have other responsibilities and sitting there listening hour after hour, even though sometimes it can be rather sonorous, he said, he was learning something. He was asked if this could sway his opinion, and he could vote to convict the President? He said I'm not going to go there yet. I have to hear the entire body of evidence. Back to you, Laura."

I don't know what people are learning new, except when you heard Adam Schiff at about 1.25. I think it was hour 2.5.

We got our hands on a batch of State Department emails from May of last year. The chain centers on a request from The New York Times reporter Ken Vogel. You might remember he is the former \"Politico\" reporter who wrote this story about Ukrainian efforts to hobble Trump's presidential run in 2016. But that's just a conspiracy theory, right? Fast-forward to May of 2019. Vogel sends an email to State Department official Kate Schilling about a story he was working on regarding an Obama era meeting with Ukrainian prosecutors. In his request, Vogel mentions a name who some have reported as the whistleblower. We have not yet confirmed this name, so we are just blacking it out for here. Vogel's email reads as follows. \"We are going to report that \"State Department official\" Elizabeth Zentos attended a meeting on the White House on January 19th, 2016, with Ukrainian prosecutors and embassy officials. The subjects discussed included efforts within the United States government to support prosecutions in the Ukraine and the United Kingdom of Burisma Holdings, and concerns that Hunter Biden's position with the company could complicate such efforts.\" On May 1st, State Department official Kate Schilling forwarded Vogel's email to her colleagues Elizabeth Zentos and George Kent. Remember him? He was one of the House Democrats all-star impeachment witnesses. According to Schilling's email, Kent has previously been a source for Vogel. I wonder how many times, I was thinking about that yesterday. But I digress. Follow- up emails reveal the conversation ending on May 3rd when the State Department eventually just declined to comment. We at The Ingraham Angle were, however, able to corroborate details about the January, 2016, meeting. However, we did this using archived Obama White House visitor logs. They're not going to tell us. We have to go to the logs. You can see them on the screen now. They show that the person who many believe to be the whistleblower checked in numerous Ukrainian officials into the White House on January 19th, 2016, the day Vogel claims there was a meeting on the Burisma and Biden. Also at the meeting were Ukraine's lead anticorruption prosecutor and the head of the country's anticorruption bureau, both of whom were there to discuss the complications of Hunter Biden's sweetheart gig. So what happened to that New York Times story about the 2016 meeting? Pretty hot, don't you think? It was never published. We asked Ken Vogel, the reporter, why nothing ever came of it, but he didn't respond. \"The New York Times\" director of communications did, however, also refusing to answer our questions about why the story never ran, instead noting that Vogel's request for comment was just consistent with their newsgathering process. Got it, nothing to see here. The timing of their request and the subsequent squashing of the story are very interesting. Let me explain why. Biden announced his candidacy on April 25th, 2019. The exchanges we laid out here in this segment occur the following week. So now we have some questions. Number one -- why wasn't the whistleblower concerned about Joe Biden overseeing Ukraine policy while his son was cashing in? Was it only troubling that Trump himself tried to get this thing investigated, this entire unsavory deal? Number two, why didn't this story ever run? Did Biden's team manage to put it down, fearing blowback from his son Hunter's dirty dealings, maybe? There's a reason Adam Schiff and now Chuck Schumer fume, as they did tonight, over the very idea of Hunter Biden testifying. They know in their heart of hearts that Ukrainian corruption reached back all the way to the Obama administration, and they did nothing. His testimony would also force the Democrats to admit that there are 2020 frontrunner oversaw U.S. policy in Ukraine while his own son was bilking their system for 50k a month. We need more documentation on this. We want all the emails, all the text messages, we want to see exactly what was happening inside that State Department last year and then in the White House in January, 2016, when these meetings were taking place and when the effort to respond to this \"New York Times\" reporter was playing out. There's a lot more to uncover, and we hope maybe some of our friends in the media will actually start thinking this is as big a story as it is. Joining me now is Kim Strassel, The Wall Street Journal, editorial board member, and Lee Smith, investigative journalist and author of \"The Plot Against The President.\" Kim, you say these revelations get to the heart of the Democrats impeachment argument. Explain."

      "utterance": "They are immensely important, because the heart of that argument is that Donald Trump acted corruptly in asking about Biden and Burisma. And you heard Adam Schiff today say of 1,000 companies out there, he asked about this one. In fact, the White House has consistently made the claim that the question, the broad question of corruption, was a legitimate one. And if we now have evidence of the Obama administration was holding meetings about this -- we already know, Burisma was not just mom and pop corner shop store. This was a company that was started by the former, a brainchild of the former Ukrainian president, run by a prominent former Ukrainian official, on the radar screen of international law enforcement, and solicited prominent American political figures to sit on its board. It was a big deal, and therefore it does raise the question of how legitimate the target it was to ask about."

Thanks very much for the info. At this point I think it's best that I not respond, although let me know if EUR,\" the European Desk, \"thinks differently. Thanks very much.

It's a potential conflict of interest with the vice president overseeing this policy. There are the names right there. The head of the anticorruption unit in the Ukraine, in Kiev. This is a story that you would think a reporter like Ken Vogel who, he's a pretty serious reporter, he would've been on it like a dog on a bone.

You go back and you mentioned that Ken Vogel story where he talked about Ukrainians efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. We had endless numbers of stories from media reporters about Biden and his conflict and the problems that the Obama administration was facing with it, stories about Amos Hochstein, the former Obama energy czar who went to Biden aids and said this looks like a conflict, and went to Biden himself. These are people that within the administration, as you said, there seemed to be some real concern and some real scrambling. It's only now that it has gone down the memory hole because no one wants to talk about it. They just want to talk about Donald Trump."

I'll show you, Lee. See the name? You can see it right there. So Lee, when you think about this story and you hear Adam Schiff today, all day long talk about the Biden conspiracy theory, the Burisma conspiracy theory, it looks like the Obama administration was trying to deal with this issue, or sweep it under the rug. How much of a conspiracy theory was it?"

The impeachment is baseless, it does not have the gravitas in any way close to justifying on impeachment of the president of the United States. And it's always some other witness, some other person, some other evidence, somewhere. This has been going on three years. Mueller, the I.G., the committees in Congress have all investigated and investigated, promised disastrous testimony and evidence. Not produced. So I think this is a dangerous thing for the country."

The House did not take the case to the courts like they could have over these witnesses. So I think it's much ado about nothing, nothing that justifies - - let me tell you, the Democrats are afraid of Donald Trump. He has appealed to a broad base of people, people who don't feel either party represents them. People who feel like --"
