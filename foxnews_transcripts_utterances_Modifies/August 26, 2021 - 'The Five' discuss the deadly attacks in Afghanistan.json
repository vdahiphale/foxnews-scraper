This is \"The Five.\"  Fox News Alert, President Biden set to speak at any moment on a devastating  loss of life in Afghanistan. Multiple explosions rocking the area around Kabul airport. At least 12 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing  with that number likely to rise. Countless others wounded and killed as well. The Pentagon calling it a  complex terror attack and says the two ISIS suicide bombers were   responsible. It comes just five days before President Biden's deadline to exit Afghanistan. And we've got a team of reporters who will give us updates throughout the   hour. But first, chilling news from the CENTCO chief who says he expects these deadly ISIS attacks to continue. Hemmer, welcome to \"The Five\" --",

We're surrounded in an airport in a land-  locked terror state, totally unsecure. And we're relying on our enemy to protect us.  We've been shooting at the Taliban for 20 years and then we put the Taliban   in charge for making sure people don't shoot at us. It doesn't make any sense. And the Pentagon comes out and says we're sharing intelligence with the Taliban and we're not really sure if the Taliban let ISIS break through  the check point to launch this attack. We don't think that they would do  something like that? Come on. They don't know what is going on right now. We have no handle on   the situation. And right now, we're basically sitting ducks. I have never seen a tactical blunder like this before. You have to go way back. Right  now, it's like the deadliest incident in a decade in Afghanistan. And we  still don't know how bad it's going to get. It's going to get dark soon. And now, ISIS is taking pot shots into the airport at aircraft. So, Joe Biden has said all this stuff and none of it has come through. Remember,   there was going to be no Taliban take over fast. That wasn't true.  Americans can get to the airport. That wasn't true. Then he says go to the airport. No, wait, don't go to the airport. Wait, go to the airport. No,  don't go to the airport.  Now, do you think Americans will go to the airport? Of course not. Praising the Taliban for doing such a great job with security. Oh, they're  cooperating big time. It doesn't look like they're doing that great of a job as TSA agents, so to speak.   So, I don't know what the president is going to say. He has to come to  grips with reality and tell the American people how bad it is and what the plan is moving forward. Right now he's got two options, Dana. He   hell out. Or you say I'm going to take Bagram, I'm going to expand the perimeter, we're going to do search and rescue for our guys. Taliban broke the deal.   We got attacked. They broke the deal. Deal is off. We're staying as long as  it takes. But I don't expect that because when I heard the Pentagon guy come out  today, Lloyd, released a statement. He said he was really sad about the loss of life, but he never said that they were going to hunt down the bad  guy that did this and bring them to justice.",

So just watch out, kidnappings and murder. I go back to the eternal question. How can everybody but the people in charge get this so wrong? I'm an English grad from Berkeley. A magazine editor turned class clown, and I saw this coming. We all saw this coming.  How could they not see this coming? It makes you think that they saw this coming and they didn't do and say anything, and they underestimated the risk that involved in this.  They thought there might be some problems, but they could handle it. Boy, were they wrong. And, knock on wood that was their strategy. Knock on wood. Well, President Biden has a lot of wood to knock on now, 12 coffins so far. So -- we gave a list of American citizens to the Taliban to grant entry. We gave control of the perimeter, run the airport, to Taliban. This is a tell. When you ask -- when you ask somebody in charge, why would you do something so stupid, so moronic?  The answer is we have no choice. And that is the mark of a failed leader and a failed administration when you are led to a place when there is no plan B when your plan A is moronic. We can understand plan C or plan D being a bit iffy. But when your plan A is this idiotic, I have no idea what's deteriorating faster, Kabul or Joe Biden at this point. Strategic thinking gives you these options and the fact that we don't -- they shouldn't have left the room until they had this ironed out. And II  think that is what is so awful to everybody that spent so many years there, people who lost their lives, family members, right? People that have lost their limbs, people we know.

      "sentences": "Right. And I think in processing all of this, I think the conclusion I have come to is just trying to understand the position of weakness that the United States is in. In July, the president of the United States said it is unlikely that the Taliban would overtake the country. They are now providing security for our people trying to get to the airport. We now see that the Taliban is in charge of security for the outer perimeter at the airport. We're now sharing intelligence with the Taliban, giving them names and -- names of Americans who by the way, many of them will be left behind on August 31st from the Taliban. And maybe other terrorist groups will also have access to that list and to that information. We were told that every single contingency plan was available and they had hammered it out before that happen. Clearly that is also not true. And the question now, Dana, is the point you make of Islamic terrorism where we move forward. Okay, so, we are to believe that the Taliban had nothing to do with the suicide bombing today. That maybe one of their guy's checkpoint didn't waived this suicide bombers right through in order to blame the attack on ISIS so that they could continue to be recognized by the international community and the United States as some kind of legitimate partner at this point. I don't believe that. I don't believe the Taliban is able and capable to keep their savages in line and that they won't go around here and there and attack the United States in these positions because we are so weak right now, we are on our heels. The other thing is, there are Americans trapped in Afghanistan. There are school kids there who are trapped. And okay, so say it was ISIS. What do we do about it? If we look at how Vice President Joe Biden under President Barack Obama handled ISIS, they called it the JV team and they took over a rock and then President Trump had to come in and get rid of it. So you have the issue of the Taliban taking over the country, Americans trapped there with really no legitimate plan to get them out at this point with the language being that it's your fault if you didn't get to the airport. They're going to blame the people and say, well, they didn't want to get out if they don't get thousands of people out. And finally, what's going to happen when it comes here? We have a wide open border. How is the president of the United States going to protect American citizens from Islamic terrorists in coming back to the United States? And I think he has to answer those questions and I'm not sure that he is up to the task.",

      "sentences": "Well, there is still a major problem for the Biden administration, and it's that they're relying on the Taliban for not only information, but also security outside the gates of the airport this. This was clearly a coordinated attack. Two blasts. One outside of the Abbey Gate where there were thousands of civilians, U.S. Marines as well trying to help those civilians onto the airfield. And then another blast very close by at the Baron Hotel. ISIS-K is reportedly responsible for the explosions outside of the airport. But it really begs the question how did these suicide bombers get there? We've heard the past week and a half about the Taliban having check points not only outside the airport but throughout the city. And the United States has made very clear they're supposed to be responsible for the area outside of the airport. We spoke yesterday with a Taliban spokesperson here in Doha and that spokesman made very clear that they want to see the Americans leave, but they also want them to leave safely. That's the word of the Taliban. Now, if that word is accepted by the Biden administration, then it would be a situation in which we simply have to rely on what the Taliban says. So, moving forward, I think you're going to see more statements by the Taliban trying to distance themselves from what happened. And we already have heard from the group following these blasts saying they are not responsible and that they offer their condolences. That's what they have to say at face value. Dana?",

Widespread military combat operations throughout the country. Another cable goes out from the embassy in May. Get out. Strongly suggesting all Americans leave Afghanistan because armed conflict is everywhere. July 15th, another embassy cable goes out. Level 4 travel alert. Terrorism, armed conflict. During this three month period, Joe Biden is out there saying we got this. Saying the Taliban is not going to take over. It's highly unlikely and we got a great Afghan army. Yet his people on the ground are telling Americans get out as soon as you can. We're losing it. You can't square that.

And I can tell you, today aside, they were actually happy to be there. They weren't there for war. They were there for peace. They were there to provide humanitarian assistance. And you saw the smiles on the faces of these men and women as they gave MRE's and water and candy bars to little Afghan children. They were there to help with this evacuation mission. And now, the thousands of American troops who are left on that airfield are sitting ducks to ISIS-K and to any other extremist organization on the ground in Afghanistan. We saw in the immediate aftermath of these blasts a slowed version of the evacuation, but we still know there are thousands of people on the airfield waiting to evacuate. And it's unclear if the Department of Defense will be able to come up with a reasonable plan to get people vetted through and onto the airport area, and then ultimately to planes and to safety, because you still have this major, major problem. We heard General McKenzie talk about it earlier. These men and women, American troops have to actually pat down individuals before they make it onto the runway because they don't want anyone getting onto one of these C- 17 military planes with a bomb or with another weapon that could harm the service members onboard or the other civilians. So they have to interact with these individuals very closely. And you can vet anyone coming onto the airfield independently and look at their background and do all of the checks that you want. But at the end of the day when they get to that airport and the entrances that we saw when we there in Afghanistan over the weekend, they are at a new location. And those troops on the ground face new risks. And it's something that if the Biden administration plans to move forward with and continue evacuations up until the very last minute, that August 31st deadline, they will have to contend with.",

But in some cases, it's just a few hundred fighters in different areas who can launch these type of sleeper cell attacks against soft targets like the perimeter of an airport where you have thousands of civilians. So, even if President Biden wanted to respond, he would have to find the exact location to respond to an ISIS-K cell. And it wouldn't be like we've seen in other instances in the past when President Trump decided to strike Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq and Syria for example. There were specific bases and areas to hit. President Biden will have a very difficult time finding these terrorists in the location where they are in eastern Afghanistan. One important thing to note though, we heard this over and over again from the Biden administration that if there were any attacks against American forces that someone would be held responsible and it would be a very swift response. But we're looking at a situation now where so far, officials in D.C. are saying that the Taliban did not know about this and they didn't understand that it was going to happen. But yet, this massive, massive attack against U.S. forces outside of the Kabul airport taking place today and the people responsible for the security just outside that perimeter, the Taliban.",

I think one major question though that many people have on the ground in Afghanistan and around the world, why the United States didn't keep Bagram Air Base open because it could have avoided the situation that we are seeing today. Thousands of civilians from inside Kabul fleeing to the airport hoping with or without the proper documentation to get on a flight. You don't blame these civilians. They are afraid. I mean, we saw them. We spoke to them over the weekend. And they are terrified of the Taliban. They are doing anything they can to leave the country. We all saw those videos from the very runway in Kabul, of people clinging to the outside of a C-17 desperate to leave the country over fears they will be killed by the Taliban. But now we have this very, very large logistical problem of the United States trying to continue evacuations out of Kabul's airport and they don't have the security. The Bagram Air Base outside the city has, and they also have this arbitrary dead line of August 31st that was made up by the Biden administration. And they have to have a window to retro grade. They have to be able to drawdown troops. It's not like they can pack their bags one morning and leave. You have thousands of American lives, service members on the ground in Afghanistan right now. And the Biden administration says they will continue evacuations, but Tuesday is the date set out by the president.",

At least 12 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing with that number likely to rise. Countless others wounded and killed as well. The Pentagon calling it a complex terror attack and says the two ISIS suicide bombers were responsible. It comes just five days before President Biden's deadline to exit Afghanistan.

We're surrounded in an airport in a land- locked terror state, totally unsecure. And we're relying on our enemy to protect us. We've been shooting at the Taliban for 20 years and then we put the Taliban in charge for making sure people don't shoot at us. It doesn't make any sense. And the Pentagon comes out and says we're sharing intelligence with the Taliban and we're not really sure if the Taliban let ISIS break through the check point to launch this attack. We don't think that they would do something like that? Come on. They don't know what is going on right now. We have no handle on the situation. And right now, we're basically sitting ducks. I have never seen a tactical blunder like this before. You have to go way back. Right now, it's like the deadliest incident in a decade in Afghanistan. And we still don't know how bad it's going to get. It's going to get dark soon. And now, ISIS is taking pot shots into the airport at aircraft. So, Joe Biden has said all this stuff and none of it has come through. Remember, there was going to be no Taliban take over fast. That wasn't true. Americans can get to the airport. That wasn't true. Then he says go to the airport. No, wait, don't go to the airport. Wait, go to the airport. No, don't go to the airport. Now, do you think Americans will go to the airport? Of course not. Praising the Taliban for doing such a great job with security. Oh, they're cooperating big time. It doesn't look like they're doing that great of a job as TSA agents, so to speak. So, I don't know what the president is going to say. He has to come to grips with reality and tell the American people how bad it is and what the plan is moving forward. Right now he's got two options, Dana. He hell out. Or you say I'm going to take Bagram, I'm going to expand the perimeter, we're going to do search and rescue for our guys. Taliban broke the deal. We got attacked. They broke the deal. Deal is off. We're staying as long as it takes. But I don't expect that because when I heard the Pentagon guy come out today, Lloyd, released a statement. He said he was really sad about the loss of life, but he never said that they were going to hunt down the bad guy that did this and bring them to justice."

So just watch out, kidnappings and murder. I go back to the eternal question. How can everybody but the people in charge get this so wrong? I'm an English grad from Berkeley. A magazine editor turned class clown, and I saw this coming. We all saw this coming. How could they not see this coming? It makes you think that they saw this coming and they didn't do and say anything, and they underestimated the risk that involved in this. They thought there might be some problems, but they could handle it. Boy, were they wrong. And, knock on wood that was their strategy. Knock on wood. Well, President Biden has a lot of wood to knock on now, 12 coffins so far. So -- we gave a list of American citizens to the Taliban to grant entry. We gave control of the perimeter, run the airport, to Taliban. This is a tell. When you ask -- when you ask somebody in charge, why would you do something so stupid, so moronic? The answer is we have no choice. And that is the mark of a failed leader and a failed administration when you are led to a place when there is no plan B when your plan A is moronic. We can understand plan C or plan D being a bit iffy. But when your plan A is this idiotic, I have no idea what's deteriorating faster, Kabul or Joe Biden at this point. Strategic thinking gives you these options and the fact that we don't -- they shouldn't have left the room until they had this ironed out. And II think that is what is so awful to everybody that spent so many years there, people who lost their lives, family members, right? People that have lost their limbs, people we know.

      "utterance": "Right. And I think in processing all of this, I think the conclusion I have come to is just trying to understand the position of weakness that the United States is in. In July, the president of the United States said it is unlikely that the Taliban would overtake the country. They are now providing security for our people trying to get to the airport. We now see that the Taliban is in charge of security for the outer perimeter at the airport. We're now sharing intelligence with the Taliban, giving them names and -- names of Americans who by the way, many of them will be left behind on August 31st from the Taliban. And maybe other terrorist groups will also have access to that list and to that information. We were told that every single contingency plan was available and they had hammered it out before that happen. Clearly that is also not true. And the question now, Dana, is the point you make of Islamic terrorism where we move forward. Okay, so, we are to believe that the Taliban had nothing to do with the suicide bombing today. That maybe one of their guy's checkpoint didn't waived this suicide bombers right through in order to blame the attack on ISIS so that they could continue to be recognized by the international community and the United States as some kind of legitimate partner at this point. I don't believe that. I don't believe the Taliban is able and capable to keep their savages in line and that they won't go around here and there and attack the United States in these positions because we are so weak right now, we are on our heels. The other thing is, there are Americans trapped in Afghanistan. There are school kids there who are trapped. And okay, so say it was ISIS. What do we do about it? If we look at how Vice President Joe Biden under President Barack Obama handled ISIS, they called it the JV team and they took over a rock and then President Trump had to come in and get rid of it. So you have the issue of the Taliban taking over the country, Americans trapped there with really no legitimate plan to get them out at this point with the language being that it's your fault if you didn't get to the airport. They're going to blame the people and say, well, they didn't want to get out if they don't get thousands of people out. And finally, what's going to happen when it comes here? We have a wide open border. How is the president of the United States going to protect American citizens from Islamic terrorists in coming back to the United States? And I think he has to answer those questions and I'm not sure that he is up to the task."

      "utterance": "Well, there is still a major problem for the Biden administration, and it's that they're relying on the Taliban for not only information, but also security outside the gates of the airport this. This was clearly a coordinated attack. Two blasts. One outside of the Abbey Gate where there were thousands of civilians, U.S. Marines as well trying to help those civilians onto the airfield. And then another blast very close by at the Baron Hotel. ISIS-K is reportedly responsible for the explosions outside of the airport. But it really begs the question how did these suicide bombers get there? We've heard the past week and a half about the Taliban having check points not only outside the airport but throughout the city. And the United States has made very clear they're supposed to be responsible for the area outside of the airport. We spoke yesterday with a Taliban spokesperson here in Doha and that spokesman made very clear that they want to see the Americans leave, but they also want them to leave safely. That's the word of the Taliban. Now, if that word is accepted by the Biden administration, then it would be a situation in which we simply have to rely on what the Taliban says. So, moving forward, I think you're going to see more statements by the Taliban trying to distance themselves from what happened. And we already have heard from the group following these blasts saying they are not responsible and that they offer their condolences. That's what they have to say at face value. Dana?"

Widespread military combat operations throughout the country. Another cable goes out from the embassy in May. Get out. Strongly suggesting all Americans leave Afghanistan because armed conflict is everywhere. July 15th, another embassy cable goes out. Level 4 travel alert. Terrorism, armed conflict. During this three month period, Joe Biden is out there saying we got this. Saying the Taliban is not going to take over. It's highly unlikely and we got a great Afghan army. Yet his people on the ground are telling Americans get out as soon as you can. We're losing it. You can't square that.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "YINGST",
      "utterance": "Well, the blasts today totally changes the equation. We were on the ground in Kabul on Sunday speaking with these very service members there in Afghanistan. And I can tell you, today aside, they were actually happy to be there. They weren't there for war. They were there for peace. They were there to provide humanitarian assistance. And you saw the smiles on the faces of these men and women as they gave MRE's and water and candy bars to little Afghan children. They were there to help with this evacuation mission. And now, the thousands of American troops who are left on that airfield are sitting ducks to ISIS-K and to any other extremist organization on the ground in Afghanistan. We saw in the immediate aftermath of these blasts a slowed version of the evacuation, but we still know there are thousands of people on the airfield waiting to evacuate. And it's unclear if the Department of Defense will be able to come up with a reasonable plan to get people vetted through and onto the airport area, and then ultimately to planes and to safety, because you still have this major, major problem. We heard General McKenzie talk about it earlier. These men and women, American troops have to actually pat down individuals before they make it onto the runway because they don't want anyone getting onto one of these C- 17 military planes with a bomb or with another weapon that could harm the service members onboard or the other civilians. So they have to interact with these individuals very closely. And you can vet anyone coming onto the airfield independently and look at their background and do all of the checks that you want. But at the end of the day when they get to that airport and the entrances that we saw when we there in Afghanistan over the weekend, they are at a new location. And those troops on the ground face new risks. And it's something that if the Biden administration plans to move forward with and continue evacuations up until the very last minute, that August 31st deadline, they will have to contend with."

      "utterance": "Trey, Bill Hemmer. Great work over there. The president has talked about this over the horizon capability to go in and strike again in Afghanistan once the withdrawal is fully completed there. Well, as of today, we've got a new enemy, and that's ISIS-K. So, how far over the horizon will we be when it comes time to seek a strike against this group?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YINGST",
      "utterance": "Well, the difficult part about striking ISIS-K is that they are a splinter cell, an off shoot of the Islamic state. They started back in 2014 along with ISIS and a lot of them are former members of the Taliban. But in some cases, it's just a few hundred fighters in different areas who can launch these type of sleeper cell attacks against soft targets like the perimeter of an airport where you have thousands of civilians. So, even if President Biden wanted to respond, he would have to find the exact location to respond to an ISIS-K cell. And it wouldn't be like we've seen in other instances in the past when President Trump decided to strike Kataib Hezbollah in Iraq and Syria for example. There were specific bases and areas to hit. President Biden will have a very difficult time finding these terrorists in the location where they are in eastern Afghanistan. One important thing to note though, we heard this over and over again from the Biden administration that if there were any attacks against American forces that someone would be held responsible and it would be a very swift response. But we're looking at a situation now where so far, officials in D.C. are saying that the Taliban did not know about this and they didn't understand that it was going to happen. But yet, this massive, massive attack against U.S. forces outside of the Kabul airport taking place today and the people responsible for the security just outside that perimeter, the Taliban."

      "utterance": "Yes, Trey, I have a question. It's Greg. You know, the question is, who should be held responsible for this? This kind of attack isn't going to speed up our exit. It's going to invite us back in. So, doesn't that kind of tell us who might have done this? Someone who still wants us there to remain as targets."

      "speaker": "YINGST",
      "utterance": "Look, I think we could analyze what happened for hours and you're going to hear a lot of opinion hosts and commentators in Washington and New York talk about failures of the administration and things that could have gone differently. I think one major question though that many people have on the ground in Afghanistan and around the world, why the United States didn't keep Bagram Air Base open because it could have avoided the situation that we are seeing today. Thousands of civilians from inside Kabul fleeing to the airport hoping with or without the proper documentation to get on a flight. You don't blame these civilians. They are afraid. I mean, we saw them. We spoke to them over the weekend. And they are terrified of the Taliban. They are doing anything they can to leave the country. We all saw those videos from the very runway in Kabul, of people clinging to the outside of a C-17 desperate to leave the country over fears they will be killed by the Taliban. But now we have this very, very large logistical problem of the United States trying to continue evacuations out of Kabul's airport and they don't have the security. The Bagram Air Base outside the city has, and they also have this arbitrary dead line of August 31st that was made up by the Biden administration. And they have to have a window to retro grade. They have to be able to drawdown troops. It's not like they can pack their bags one morning and leave. You have thousands of American lives, service members on the ground in Afghanistan right now. And the Biden administration says they will continue evacuations, but Tuesday is the date set out by the president."

Who is going to be fired? Who is going to resign? I don't know if anybody is going to want to impeach Biden when you see who the VP choice might be. But no one so far has taken responsibility for this and that's why I'd like to see him do it. There is all this really bad decisions made apparently by good people, smart people. Why do smart, good people make bad decisions? It's usually cognitive bias, right, that distorts their filter. This could all be because of Trump derangement, right. They polluted their good decision making so that they made the wrong choices for the wrong reasons like the deadline. Did the deadline create this problem? Did you have to make -- did you have turn this into something symbolic because of the 20th anniversary?"

We have a lot of enemies and one of the things about Afghanistan, Jesse, is the fact that you have had the Taliban allowed Al Qaeda to flourish there. That's where they plotted and planned the attacks, but it didn't just start with 9/11. If you go back to 1996 or so when they first constituted themselves and there were all these attacks that kept coming like the Cole for example, the USS Cole and our embassies in eastern Africa, like it just kept coming."

It's really about priorities. You touched on it. Milley focused on white rage, while Muslim rage is the real threat. House Democrats supposed to have oversight over this administration over the military. There is no oversight. They're focused on oversight of the last administration. They're focused on January 6th. They're slapping subpoenas everywhere. They're not focused on the future or the present. Nancy Pelosi today is in San Francisco (inaudible) it up with some of her liberal buddies. She's not focused."

You know, is he going to lead with Build Back Better tonight? Is he going to congratulate Nancy for just shepherding all these pending bills through? In the beginning, he went back and forth from vacation. Imagine triggering a hostage crisis and then going back on vacation."

Spend it here at home and work on the $% trillion in spending that's now proposed. We put that to a Democratic congressman earlier today. He said he was offended by the suggestion. I think this polling that came out, I think it was 24 hours ago, about being around 41 percent. Dana, I know you think that might go a little lower, you're probably right about that. What I think the polls fail to sense is the feeling that America has suddenly and without warning over the past two weeks, the images on your screen that everything we did 20 years ago against the guys who helped perpetrate what happened here in lower Manhattan have all come back. And they are stronger and they're bigger sand they're more enforced and they've got modern technology. And that is something the American people just cannot understand."
