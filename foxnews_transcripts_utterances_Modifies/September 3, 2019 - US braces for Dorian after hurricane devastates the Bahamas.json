Already the Bahamian prime minister has praised the U.S. for the U.S. Coast Guard and for authorities helping with rescue efforts. We don't know how bad this is going to be before all is said and done. We'll start there with the panel, Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Amy Walter, national editor for the \"Cook Political Report,\" and Fox News contributor Steve Hayes.  Amy, how a government deals with a tragedy like this is really important.   AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": It is really important how the government deals, and then in this country how a governor deals. We have known many governors who have been made or broken by hurricanes, even ones that are not necessarily devastating, but where the evacuation plan became sort of stymied and you have traffic snarls. Even more so if the hurricane doesn't hit, you hear governors getting complaints from residents who say they told me to pack up and I did all of this and I spent all this money, and then nothing happened. I don't know whether to do this the next time around. It's a very fine line.",

I meant represent sort of those suburban areas where those kinds of things are very, very, very popular.  And so now what we have is a Democratic Party that is more aligned with suburban, urban issues, specifically on assault weapons ban, background checks, all of the whole host of those things, and a Republican Party that is much more aligned regionally with protecting gun rights.

So if they said let's ban -- if right now a Democratic president said let's ban all handguns, all firearms of all sorts, the Democratic mayor of Chicago would be like great, sign me up. I'm happy to do it. And you can't sell guns anywhere to in or around any state. They would be happy to do it."

They are working out of nine kitchens right now, five on the islands, four in Florida, to prepare thousands and thousands of meals, sandwiches and fruits, for those affected by the storm. The chef served millions of meals in Puerto Rico to those impacted by hurricanes Irma and Maria, an amazing operation active again. And a woman in the Bahamas has opened her home to 97 dogs displaced by hurricane Dorian. Chella Phillips also runs Voiceless Dogs of Nassau refuge for homeless and abandoned dogs. Ninety-seven, though? Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That is it for the “Special Report,” fair , balanced, and unafraid. \"The Story\" hosted by Martha MacCallum, starts right now.
