Everybody out in 48 hours. His team pushed back against that, gave the president other options, suggested that we would see chaos if that's what we tried to do, said that it was impossible but we'd see chaos with a precipitous withdrawal. And just a matter of days later the president is talking publicly about deepening U.S. involvement in Syria in a pretty serious way, and tweeting threats to Russia.  The problem here is there is no serious strategy. There is no serious strategy. So to the questions you posed, when and how big, I would add to what end? What's the objective?",

What he got elected, he got elected on a lot of promises to disengage from things like this. And I think it's a real problem for him in terms of the people that support him.  The other thing is we have heard about -- we've heard talk about the helicopter that apparently dropped the poison, the gas, was tracked and that's how we feel fairly certain that it was in fact the Assad regime.

The bigger question is, in part on the ISIS case that the administration is making. The administration is saying, and Trump set it just Monday at his briefing with military leaders, basically ISIS is wiped out. They don't have any territory, therefore they are not really a threat. That's been the consistent case from the administration. It is not true. That's not true. There are lots of ISIS fighters still in Syria, pockets of them numbering potentially as many as 10,000 to 15,000 jihadists in country still. We have not wiped out ISIS.
