It took some criticism that I thought was off base. Others are saying he should have stood up for CNN. In fact, later, he did say that he thinks there are some good journalists at CNN, which is true, and the president's criticism was unfair. But that wasn't the end of it because later, the president on Twitter boasted of a take down of Jim Acosta. Take down, he didn't recognize him. And he also said he was a nice guy. And then, the White House pulled John Bolton as a guest this morning on CNN's state of the union, saying they didn't want to reward Acosta's disrespectful behavior and bad behavior in the words of Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

But the police union has come out and said no. Wait a minute. That's not what happened at all. These were vice agents. They were at the strip club for a reason. They didn't only arrest Stormy Daniels. They also arrested two other strippers who were doing something similar. So whether there was anti-Trump bias or not or pro-Trump bias I should say, we should leave it up for the potential legal issues that's going to happen here as well.",

It amounts to about six percent of its total users. That's a good thing, because these may have been taken over by spammers and malicious actors who love (Inaudible) Russia investigation. The stock dropped 10 percent in one day after the Washington Post reported that Twitter was axing 70 million accounts. It's about time that Twitter cleaned up its act. And the fallout, well, Ashton Kutcher watched (Inaudible) Oprah Winfrey, a million and a half, Kim Kardashian a couple of million, President Trump well he only lost 340,000. While Barack Obama took a much bigger hit losing almost three million. It's all about ego. That's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I am Howard Kurtz.

President Trump's pick of Brett Kavanaugh infuriates liberal pundits, divides conservative pundits and sparks a fiercely partisan debate. Is the press being fair to the high court nominee? Plus, Sarah Palin says comedian Sacha Baron Cohen duped her by impersonating a disabled veteran in a wheelchair. Are CBS and Showtime really going to stand behind this? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" This is a Fox News alert. President Trump has just boarded Air Force One in Scotland. The plane will be taking off shortly for Helsinki, Finland for tomorrow's much anticipated sit down with Vladimir Putin. We will keep an eye on his progress for you. The media have been constantly challenging President Trump's disruptive approach during this week's European trip and some MSNBC anchors were especially accusatory when he said he convinced NATO allies to boost their spending on defense."

So, the president in that interview criticized Theresa May in her approach to Brexit, made headlines around the world. He was also quoted as saying some positive things about her. And then we just saw him trying to dismiss that story as fake news despite the audio. I would say nobody is buying it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think he's more effective at calling out particularly bad reporting than just generally issuing the slur. They also had audio of what he said that showed that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Not very convenient."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "But there is a point also that it is not just quoting people accurately but accurately summarizing the entire interview too and that someone has positive and negative things to say. There is some responsibility to get the whole picture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Sure, but that doesn't in my view amount to fake and Laura Ingraham called the whole Sun interview a ridiculous mistake. This caused an absolute uproar, particularly in the U.K., Gillian, so how unusual is it for a president or any president to give that kind of critical interview about an ally and be published hours after he lands when she is feeding him at a black tie dinner?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "I would call it highly unusual."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That's very understated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Look, certainly during my tenure in the Obama administration and the Bush administration, I didn't see either president do an interview where they were critical of a foreign leader they were about to meet in the hours before they met them. But what I will say here, I think what really caught fire with this Brexit bomb story was not so much the president's message as the way he said the things he said. The message that if the E.U., if Brexit goes forward, there would be negative implications for trade with the U.S. is actually an Obama administration throwback message. That's something then Prime Minister David Cameron asked President Obama to deliver while he was in the U.K., his last year in office."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And, Juan, the president did say he apologized to prime minister because he also said some good things about you. He said, well, it's only the press. So it's rare to have any admission of apology from this president. Was he reacting to the media firestorm in that sort of make-up press conference?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "You know, I think he created the media firestorm and then he tries to manage it to his advantage. For example, he also went after the mayor of London. He kind of said, hey, you know, I don't feel welcome here. Why did you let this balloon up, you know, the crying balloon for two hours?"

      "utterance": "The baby balloon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right. And so he made it very up very clear. And I think by taking on immigration, mentioning terrorism in London, that in fact he has problems, Brexit, terrorism, immigration. And I think these things, for the domestic audience, our American media resonate here at home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, in that same news conference, the president got into a dust-up with CNN's White House correspondent Jim Acosta. Let's take a look at that and have some comments on the other side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "John Roberts, go ahead."

      "speaker": "JIM ACOSTA, CNN",
      "utterance": "Can I speak?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "No, no. John Roberts, go ahead. CNN is fake news. I don't take questions from CNN. CNN is fake news. I don't take questions from CNN. John Roberts of Fox. Let's go to a real network."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ACOSTA",
      "utterance": "But we are real network too, sir."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, what is kind of a lot of the controversy here is that he called on John Roberts. Jim Acosta was interrupting, trying to hijack the question, which he has done before with President Trump. This is not some scrum where they are walking to the helicopter and everybody is shouting out. Rather than debate CNN, John Roberts asked this question about Russia and Crimea. It took some criticism that I thought was off base. Others are saying he should have stood up for CNN. In fact, later, he did say that he thinks there are some good journalists at CNN, which is true, and the president's criticism was unfair. But that wasn't the end of it because later, the president on Twitter boasted of a take down of Jim Acosta. Take down, he didn't recognize him. And he also said he was a nice guy. And then, the White House pulled John Bolton as a guest this morning on CNN's state of the union, saying they didn't want to reward Acosta's disrespectful behavior and bad behavior in the words of Sarah Huckabee Sanders. In that same press conference, Gillian, we just heard president dismissed NBC's Kristen Welker, who asked the question about his criticism of NATO and Britain, giving Putin the upper hand, as dishonest reporting. Did the questions strike you as dishonest?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "No, to be fair about it. I think that it was not necessarily a question that was delivered in -- it was delivered in a critical manner."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It was a provocative question."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "It was a provocative question."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "That is certainly fair. I can understand why maybe a president who had a really good relationship with mainstream media would feel taken aback by a hard question like that. But it does not make it dishonest reporting or fake news. It is also noteworthy that John Roberts here at Fox did issue a statement in Kristen Welker's defense, saying that he didn't find her question dishonest at all. It was fact-based and he has known her personally and professionally for a long time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "And she is honest."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I do think there has been a lot of problems with the general NATO coverage though. This idea, when President Trump says that the allied countries need to provide more for their common defense, that is something that has been said by the previous seven administrations. Yes, he said it more harshly, and partly he said that more harshly because they didn't get the result that they were hoping for. So it's like the underlying assumptions behind this are faulty. The idea that it helps Russian to have a strong NATO is completely wrong. It helps the entire alliance to have a strong NATO. It helps to have these countries not just spending more in defense but spending it properly. That makes us all strong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Since you bring up Russia, there has been an absolute media explosion obviously since Friday afternoon's indictment by Robert Mueller of 12 Russian military officers in campaign hacking. And you heard some pundits say Trump maybe should delay the summit or not meet with him at all. The White House has a very different view and the president has repeated his witch hunt rhetoric."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "There is a lot of conflation again in the media coverage. What happened on Friday with this indictment against Russians is very important. It goes right to the heart of Putin regime and you actually have hard evidence that they were involved. That's very important. The witch hunt refers to the collusion theory, the conspiracy theory that the Russians worked with Donald Trump to steal an election that was rightfully Hillary Clinton. There remains no evidence to support that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And Juan, the media insisting (ph) on the fact that Rod Rosenstein told the president, the deputy attorney general told the president before this European trip that these indictments were coming."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And he certainly is entitled to talk about witch hunt and so forth but a lot of journalists are saying why didn't he react substantively to the fact that these are members of the Russian government under Putin's control who now according to this indictment have this elaborate campaign to interfere with the election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, at some point, you have to start because we live in such politically polarized times, both for the public, the electorate, but also for the media, at some point you then start to look, what is conservative media saying about this? What are conservatives on Capitol Hill, the president's political allies think? And you hear people like Lindsey Graham, the senator from South Carolina, say the president needs to confront Vladimir Putin directly on this. You hear Senator Lankford from Oklahoma saying, you know what, we have seen these recent tweets released by the House Committee and they indicate that there is an ongoing effort by the Russians to interfere in our current 2018 midterm elections. And you hear the director of our National Intelligence say this. And yet because the president says, well, there is not going to be any Perry Mason moment here with Vladimir Putin. I don't think he is going to say anything."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The president said to reporters, well, I will ask about the meddling, that's your favorite subject. I mean, I think he has been --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "That's dismissive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But at the same time, is it the role of anchors and correspondents to say, we think the president should speak out about the cyber hacking, but anything more contentiously, we are not sure it is a good idea for him to meet with Vladimir Putin based on this indictment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "I mean, is that rhetorical question? I mean, asking someone who is formally working in the policy-making community, the idea of that news anchor should be providing policy recommendations to the president is ludicrous. I mean, it doesn't mean that they are not allowed to or that they are violating the journalistic code by doing it, but I don't think it actually amounts too much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "But it also reveals so much about their biases (ph) too. It is important to deal with election meddling. It's also important to have updates on our nuclear treaties. It is important to work on Syria and Ukraine and all these other issues. They are all important and the idea that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

      "utterance": "Every time the president -- OK, this is not the first time, you know, that he is coming face to face with him. They had at least three meetings that we know about. They had eight phone calls in 18 months. It' clearly whether the media wants to be or not, the Trump-Putin bilateral relationship is ongoing."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me close by certainly going back to something you said about the way the NATO -- the president's attitude towards NATO and NATO leaders have been covered. You heard him say at the top of this show, you heard this MSNBC anchor say, he is lying when he said, well, they all agreed to boost defense spending. Macron of France said the president is wrong. But, you know, is that lying, is it political exaggeration, is it trying to declare victory after making a demand, what do you make of interrupting the president saying he is lying?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, it is very hard to take MSNBC seriously when they behave that way. But again, what is interesting is if anything Trump didn't accomplish enough on getting NATO to increase spending from these countries that have Article III of the treaty, said that they will provide good defense spending for themselves, so if anything, he didn't do enough, but they claim he is lying by saying he got something, and the pressure should probably be the opposite way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Let me get a break here. Good discussion. When we come back, the battle over Brett Kavanaugh. Are some of the media attacks just out of bound? And later, a marathon grilling of rogue FBI agent Peter Strzok dissolves into partisan sniping and television can't get enough."

Literally had to bail our live show from SCOTUS.\" But ABC's Terry Moran, who is also broadcasting there, challenged her on Twitter, \"the protests were raucous: chants, posters and bullhorns on both sides. But I found it very democratic, all-American. I saw pro-choice and pro-life demonstrators arguing passionately but civilly, I felt no threat.\" I don't know why Moran felt the need to do that. Bream's experience was very different. One person who was there at The Heritage Foundation, Lindsey Feinfield (ph), said there were some men shouting that Bream was blond bimbo and she had to deal with the Fox haters as well. As Bream told The Wrap, \"people were jostling around, getting physical. People were standing behind me while I was trying to do live shots. It was pretty unnerving. I felt unsure at some point. There was one guy wearing a mask standing behind us. He wouldn't move. A small group of people who were yelling and getting in our faces, were saying things that were anti-Fox.\" Now, Shannon has dealt with court protesters many times. She believes that people have every right to protest, but police hadn't set up any barriers and let's face it, it is hard to do an hour-long show with angry people surrounding you and screaming at you.

We wouldn't even have been there if it wasn't for members of Congress like Jim Jordan, like Mark Meadows, like Ron Desantis, who have been pushing internally for this investigation to get to the bottom of the facts. And I have got to tell you I think that the mainstream media really missed out this week, because the conversation is all about the 12 indictments, all about Peter Strzok and what he did or didn't mean.

She continued to speak about her Brexit plan in terms that were false. She was the one actually doing fake news because she said things about her Brexit plans that were simply not true. What the President said about the plan is it stops Britain after leaving the E.U. from doing a trade deal with the U.S., that it stops Britain having control over its borders and laws, that it stops Britain having control over its laws.

They love someone like President Obama who speaks like they do in tones that are kind of as I said highfalutin and very kind of rare (Inaudible). But they ignore the substance. And that's because journalists, their trade is (Inaudible) their trade is words. So when someone is really fantastic with words, they think they have got to be a really smart person. But they don't look at the substance. And on policy grounds, if you actually look at what President Trump talked about in advance this week, despite the criticism from the media.

It's a noisy left using President Trump as their latest punch bag. And I don't think it really reflects anything substantively different in the U.S.-U.K. relationship or anything like that.

To put it quite simply, what Sacha Baron Cohen did to Sarah Palin was horrible, making her travel across the country for a fake interview, while dressed as a disabled veteran. It's terrible. And people have every right to feel outraged by this. The only problem with the outrage is that Sacha Baron Cohen loves it. He feeds off it. It's why he does what he does.

You can't blame them for complaining about this, but it ultimately benefited Sacha Baron Cohen in the end in terms of publicity for the show."

      "utterance": "Right. So we're playing into his hands because we're giving it some air time that he tricked other people, Dick Cheney and others. I mean Palin said she ripped off her mic when the questions got more and more disgusting. She says CBS (Inaudible) she is challenging them to donate the profits from this particular to a veteran's group. Does CBS owe the public some kind of response?"

      "utterance": "(Inaudible) CBS -- their reaction was giving no reaction whatsoever. I think that they wanted the show to be a little bit of a mystery which is why they didn't do much promotion for it. And they're kind of just going to let it linger and maybe see what the public things by the when the interview finally airs. Also, Sacha Baron Cohen was completely irrelevant 2 1/2 weeks ago. So I think that they might have wanted to -- they're kind of glad that these conservative politicians did a little bit of the heavy lifting for them. But it should be interesting to see what this interview really does pan out to be in terms of if it rose to the level of the criticism that it has been getting so far."

      "utterance": "I finally forgot he even existed. You know I'm not against satire. (Inaudible) There's a line here and he clearly (Inaudible) cross it. All right, let's put up the mug shots. Stormy Daniels arrested this week in a Columbus, Ohio strip club. Three undercover cops bust her fondling them allegedly and pushing their faces into her chest. Would this have happened to another stripper whose name was not Stormy Daniels and not have a case against the President of the United States, and should it have been big news?"

      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, this is certainly -- during a week of very hard, very serious hitting news, this is definitely the strangest alert I woke up to on my phone in the morning. But I think the reason it didn't really rise to the level of major news is because it didn't have anything to do with her ongoing legal issues with Michael Cohen or President Trump. Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti that was trying to make a political saying that these police officers are pro-Trump, and they arrested her as sort of a set up. But the police union has come out and said no. Wait a minute. That's not what happened at all. These were vice agents. They were at the strip club for a reason. They didn't only arrest Stormy Daniels. They also arrested two other strippers who were doing something similar. So whether there was anti-Trump bias or not or pro-Trump bias I should say, we should leave it up for the potential legal issues that's going to happen here as well."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Even Avenatti back in front of a camera. Even went to London to get more air time. By the way, the police she said the arrest was a mistake and is conducting an internal review. Carley Shimkus, great to see, thanks so much."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Twitter is making a big move that may make you feel less popular, whether you're a big celebrity or an ordinary Joe. Twitter is purging tens of millions of fake accounts. It amounts to about six percent of its total users. That's a good thing, because these may have been taken over by spammers and malicious actors who love (Inaudible) Russia investigation. The stock dropped 10 percent in one day after the Washington Post reported that Twitter was axing 70 million accounts. It's about time that Twitter cleaned up its act. And the fallout, well, Ashton Kutcher watched (Inaudible) Oprah Winfrey, a million and a half, Kim Kardashian a couple of million, President Trump well he only lost 340,000. While Barack Obama took a much bigger hit losing almost three million. It's all about ego. That's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I am Howard Kurtz.
