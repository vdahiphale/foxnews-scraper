Before he left, the president vowed not to cave on his desired border wall with Mexico and said he has the absolute right to declare emergency if he can't reach a deal with the Democrats.",

Unfortunately, when you inject politics into anything, the first thing that disappears is nuance and compromise.  Politics is the carbon monoxide of thinking. It's odorless, it's colorless and when it enters the room, all ideas die. And so what they do -- so nuance and compromise drives me crazy, is replaced with the prison of two ideas. So, even though Chuck agrees with Donald Trump and has agreed with him, he has to go to his respective prison. He has to go to that other prison cell, and he can't come out, even though he agrees with Donald Trump. So everybody has to choose their side and they have to live in their own prisons and every day this goes on it creates more and more libertarians or people who are so disgusted by politics, they are forced to talk to their family instead which is good.  But by the way, the real winner at this border visit, Ted Cruz's beard. He went from ted Cruz to cruise missile. I mean, I look at that and go, I'm not messing with that guy.

I honestly think this is the first time Trump has used the traditional presidential squeeze play on an issue.  You do the Oval Office address. You do the little photo op with the white hat.

Do you really want to be on record as not wanting to give $5.6 billion for the border when we are asking for a $27 billion in foreign aid? I mean, this is not a good position to be in. This is a fraction and these are the very Democrats who have been on record, as we said in the past, as coming forth in favor of border security. When you look at the polling around the country, people care about this issue. They want the border secure. They may not want the wall because that wall has been tied with President Trump and now they associate that with him, but they want border security.

They are trying to ameliorate the damage that comes from what is now I think 20-day shutdown, second longest in history. And the difficulty for Republicans especially Republicans in states like Colorado with Cory Gardner or even Lisa Murkowski up in Alaska states, either with Hispanic population, significant or a lot of federal workers, is that they feel that this is going to hurt them with voters. So they are starting to hear from their constituents, hey, this isn't such a great deal. And to go to what Jedediah was talking about, I think the news of today was that he didn't declare the national emergency. And I think that part of that is that Republicans, maybe I shouldn't say Republicans. I should say conservatives.  Remember how strongly conservatives criticized presidents in the past for acting in a tyrannical or despotic way and just saying I am going around Congress. Never once in American history has an emergency been declared when the president could not get funding for an issue through the Congress of the United States and went around the Congress.

Before he left, the president vowed not to cave on his desired border wall with Mexico and said he has the absolute right to declare emergency if he can't reach a deal with the Democrats."

That includes individuals from India, Pakistan, China, Romania, Ecuador, Nicaragua, on and on and on. And so, I know we keep talking about the family unit and unaccompanied children. And that makes up about typically about 60 to 70 percent. We've seen a change over the last couple of weeks where that number is less then 50 percent of the apprehensions we make here in South Texas. We have 55 miles of fence within the sector. We started the job in 2006. We need to finish that job. We've got the personnel. We need the technology and we need the resources.

Unfortunately, when you inject politics into anything, the first thing that disappears is nuance and compromise. Politics is the carbon monoxide of thinking. It's odorless, it's colorless and when it enters the room, all ideas die. And so what they do -- so nuance and compromise drives me crazy, is replaced with the prison of two ideas. So, even though Chuck agrees with Donald Trump and has agreed with him, he has to go to his respective prison. He has to go to that other prison cell, and he can't come out, even though he agrees with Donald Trump. So everybody has to choose their side and they have to live in their own prisons and every day this goes on it creates more and more libertarians or people who are so disgusted by politics, they are forced to talk to their family instead which is good. But by the way, the real winner at this border visit, Ted Cruz's beard. He went from ted Cruz to cruise missile. I mean, I look at that and go, I'm not messing with that guy.

Now, they are starting to say, we are actually for border security and this is not necessarily good that we are going to be in a position of not being able to build any coalitions or get anything done if this is our first attempt out of the gate. Do you think that there cracks in the Democratic opposition to getting President Trump this money for the wall?"

If you start calling and clogging up the phone lines, they think their constituents are angry and they want border security and they will respond. That's the best part of democracy. Just pick up the phone and tell these guys what to do. They work for the people, not the other way around. So, you could see the needle moving a little bit. I honestly think this is the first time Trump has used the traditional presidential squeeze play on an issue. You do the Oval Office address. You do the little photo op with the white hat. You do the social media. You ask people to call their congressman and maybe have a couple of rallies or something like that."

I have the authority to do this national emergency. There is controversy around that but that he will be able to say, I'm ending the shutdown. I obviously approved the need for this border fence."

      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely because he keeps saying now, oh yes, you know, I am within my right to do it and if Democrats don't help I'm going to have to do it. But to answer a question before too, I think that a lot of Democrats are coming forward and saying to people, other Democrats, this is one-tenth of one percent of the budget we are talking about here. Do you really want to be on record as not wanting to give $5.6 billion for the border when we are asking for a $27 billion in foreign aid? I mean, this is not a good position to be in. This is a fraction and these are the very Democrats who have been on record, as we said in the past, as coming forth in favor of border security. When you look at the polling around the country, people care about this issue. They want the border secure. They may not want the wall because that wall has been tied with President Trump and now they associate that with him, but they want border security. So I think Democrats have to be really careful about this. And frankly, if they are held responsible for the shutdown, I think that's going to be a big --"

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "No, the polls are pretty clear. But so, in fact, David Drucker in the \"Washington Examiner\" today said, it looks to him like the Republicans have taken themselves hostage and they are trying to do things like, you know what, you can get your tax refunds, food stamps won't be delayed for people. They are trying to ameliorate the damage that comes from what is now I think 20-day shutdown, second longest in history. And the difficulty for Republicans especially Republicans in states like Colorado with Cory Gardner or even Lisa Murkowski up in Alaska states, either with Hispanic population, significant or a lot of federal workers, is that they feel that this is going to hurt them with voters. So they are starting to hear from their constituents, hey, this isn't such a great deal. And to go to what Jedediah was talking about, I think the news of today was that he didn't declare the national emergency. And I think that part of that is that Republicans, maybe I shouldn't say Republicans. I should say conservatives. Remember how strongly conservatives criticized presidents in the past for acting in a tyrannical or despotic way and just saying I am going around Congress. Never once in American history has an emergency been declared when the president could not get funding for an issue through the Congress of the United States and went around the Congress. That is not in keeping with our constitution. I think a lot of conservatives have real problems with it."

The White House will say that's not true and then three months later you found that, oh, that is exactly what happened. On the fact that the media - - how did we find out today that the Democrats have cracks in their coalition? I read that in a \"Politico\" piece today because the reporters are out there doing their jobs. It's not all fake news. Some of the reporting has actually been pretty good. The other thing though that bothered me is that the other day on \"The Daily,\" \"The New York Times\" podcast, they turn this crisis thing into -- the headline was, \"It's a crisis of his own making.\" Right, because they said he changed the asylum rules and how you apply for asylum, so that's why all these people flooded the border. But that doesn't -- if you go back to, as Jedediah was saying in the Obama administration, remember when that was a humanitarian crisis. They didn't say that was Obama's own making.

I think what's happening is the Democratic Party is shifting left from the ground up. It starts in these little laboratories in the cities, on San Francisco and New York City. And you get these radical mayors that have no resistance. They are the resistance but there is no one resisting them in these locales. Ans they are just kind of pushing and pushing and pushing and no one is pushing back. You know, it used to have Rudy here or you'd still have some conservatives out west. It doesn't exist any longer. So, they are just going to go as far as they can possibly go and then the people that are running for president are then going to listen to them because that's where the base is.

So I think that they've got the right idea, but I do feel for some of the Democrats, like for example, Congressman Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, moderate kind of guy, problem solvers kind of guy. He actually has a bill to restore the SALT deductions, right, for all the people that live in the northeast in California so that they can actually have those tax deductions back.

You can have a conversation about climate change, but what's being proposed now is making Barack Obama now sound like a moderate. I mean, this is a crazy, crazy left-wing advocating for benefits for -- let's broaden benefits for illegal immigrants.

This is more identity politics that is basically creating a toxic environment for all of us."

And now they're having to be suppressed, because these qualities are being labeled as wrong or bad. So now you're having the APA come out and say, \"Yes, we were right.
