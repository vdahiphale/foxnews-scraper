I think a lot of Republican voters are wondering why Donald Trump is the only person actually making some of these claims about the unfairness of the investigation or this idea that Mueller is beyond reproach. People forget that he too has a history, including messing up that anthrax --"

We have some knowledge of that. We will get more. Some of the anti-Trump zealots are now claiming that the Russians actually swung the election. I think that's an extremely dubious theory, but the Mueller investigation's final outcome on what the Russians did may settle that."

I'm very curious why Mueller hasn't dug into that that more. Isn't that interesting that you can secretly hire a foreign spy who sources his information to Kremlin operatives. If people were really genuinely concerned about Russian meddling, and by the way the fact that the spy let it be known that he was looking for dirt, meant that he opened himself up to exploitation by Russian government operatives. If we genuinely, truly cared about these things I think you would see much more interest in the media and by Mueller into that."

John Roberts reports that it appears to be a reference to a purported 2011 dispute over fees at the Trump golf course when Mueller had a dispute over fees for the golf course outside Washington."

And it became apparent, to Brit's point, that as Giuliani was listening, he said egad, I made a mess. I better clear it. So line one, go. Longtime viewer, first-time caller, Rudy from New York, what do you have to say? No dittos today. And I also tend to agree with Mr. Hume on this, which is I do not think this is strategic chaos.

And I don't do that from strength or from weakness. I think it's an appropriate thing to do. If we could work something out that is meaningful, not the waste of paper that the other deal was, I would certainly be willing to meet, anytime they want. It's good for the country, good for them, good for us and good for the world. No preconditions. If they want to meet, I'll meet."
