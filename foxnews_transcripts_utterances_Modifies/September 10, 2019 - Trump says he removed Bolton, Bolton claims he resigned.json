It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Breaking news out of the White House, John Bolton is out as national security advisor. We'll have a lot more on that coming up. But first, a new embarrassment for CNN after yet another Russia bombshell completely implodes. The CIA hammering the network's latest story as misguided and simply false, and the White House says that CNN could be putting lives in danger. Here's what happened. CNN claiming the CIA was forced to extract a high level spy inside Russia in 2017 because President Trump mishandled classified intelligence and risk exposing the person's identity. The network pumped it up like crazy.",

What do you think about? Now, one of the things the CIA communications person might say is, I am telling you off the record, you are wrong. You will be embarrassed if you print that. Don't go with it. I'm waving you off the story. Or you might say, I have no comment for you on that and I will let you know if I ever do. Those two things can give you some clarification. Sounds to me like the CIA and the State Department are both very much on the same page saying this did not happened. We also know that Putin has not been shy about punishing his enemies or former spies. Let's go to Britain and we'll roll the tape and you've got problems there. It not only hurts the people that are targeted, but those around them because of the poison that they have used. So this is extremely dangerous.

They basically tell you if you're right or wrong. So CNN breaks the story. The story is then followed up by the New York Times and the Washington Post. Russia's state-sponsored media also at that point says they have the name of this spy.   The New York Times in their reporting, which comes after, separate from the CNN story. And the New York Times, by the way, said the CNN story was wrong. But the New York Times said, we've checked with someone like a Dana Perino, and they didn't wave us off this story. They said, go ahead. So that tells you that there is basis to the reality of this person, this spy, former -- apparently someone who was high up in the Russian government, close enough to Putin to have access to documents that he could then -- not only see, but in some cases photograph and sent to the U.S. And then you get the general anxiety that comes after Trump's meeting in 2017 with the Russian ambassador and the Russian foreign minister. That's a separate issue. Initially, this guy was tried -- they tried to, what they call, expatriate this man in 2016 after Washington Post, New York Times story said the U.S. government has a source inside the Kremlin.",

And perhaps, that's the thing that takes time and clarification, because right now, for places like CNN, it's really, choose your own adventure. And if you get some facts that are not correlated or really directly tied to the ultimate conclusion, you just go ahead and make it up. You just go ahead and craft a bridge out of your own intentions, regardless of their truth or falsehood. And that's what's most dangerous.  And I think part of it is this desire to bring the president down and really pin something on him. Because, you know, your intuition is telling you that something is not right.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Breaking news out of the White House, John Bolton is out as national security advisor. We'll have a lot more on that coming up. But first, a new embarrassment for CNN after yet another Russia bombshell completely implodes. The CIA hammering the network's latest story as misguided and simply false, and the White House says that CNN could be putting lives in danger. Here's what happened. CNN claiming the CIA was forced to extract a high level spy inside Russia in 2017 because President Trump mishandled classified intelligence and risk exposing the person's identity. The network pumped it up like crazy."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "But it turns out, that's not exactly true. Multiple outlets, including Fox News, reporting that President Trump had nothing to do with it. Instead, the spy was pulled out because of concerns about media reporting around Russia election interference. The decision was also made before Trump even took office. Former CIA director turn secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, slamming CNN over the report earlier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE",
      "utterance": "The reporting is materially inaccurate and you should know. As the former CIA director, I don't talk about things like this very often. It is only the occasions where there's something that I think puts people at risk or the reporting is so egregious as to create enormous risk at the United States of America that I even comment in a way that I just did. The reporting there is factually wrong."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, Dana, it's not just that they got this wrong, it potentially put lives in danger. Again, yet another false story by CNN about Trump and Russia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, HOST",
      "utterance": "Let's be clear, lives could still be in danger, maybe even more so now. This is supposed to be a news story, not an episode of the Americans. And I understand the frustration of the Central Intelligence Agency. CIA hardly ever comments on anything. Now, if you call a reporter on background and you say, hey, I've got this tip. What do you think about? Now, one of the things the CIA communications person might say is, I am telling you off the record, you are wrong. You will be embarrassed if you print that. Don't go with it. I'm waving you off the story. Or you might say, I have no comment for you on that and I will let you know if I ever do. Those two things can give you some clarification. Sounds to me like the CIA and the State Department are both very much on the same page saying this did not happened. We also know that Putin has not been shy about punishing his enemies or former spies. Let's go to Britain and we'll roll the tape and you've got problems there. It not only hurts the people that are targeted, but those around them because of the poison that they have used. So this is extremely dangerous. Disappointed -- I don't know what happened there with all of the reporting, but obviously, it was not good enough."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, Juan, what do you think happened? And do you think the leaks are real but the news is wrong?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST",
      "utterance": "No. I think -- this is really interesting. I really appreciate what Dana had to say, because I think what Dana just told you is an insight into how public, you know, press secretary handle reporters when we're asking these kinds of questions on sensitive stories. They basically tell you if you're right or wrong. So CNN breaks the story. The story is then followed up by the New York Times and the Washington Post. Russia's state-sponsored media also at that point says they have the name of this spy. The New York Times in their reporting, which comes after, separate from the CNN story. And the New York Times, by the way, said the CNN story was wrong. But the New York Times said, we've checked with someone like a Dana Perino, and they didn't wave us off this story. They said, go ahead. So that tells you that there is basis to the reality of this person, this spy, former -- apparently someone who was high up in the Russian government, close enough to Putin to have access to documents that he could then -- not only see, but in some cases photograph and sent to the U.S. And then you get the general anxiety that comes after Trump's meeting in 2017 with the Russian ambassador and the Russian foreign minister. That's a separate issue. Initially, this guy was tried -- they tried to, what they call, expatriate this man in 2016 after Washington Post, New York Times story said the U.S. government has a source inside the Kremlin."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "They -- he refused to leave. But then, there's this increased anxiety after the Trump oval office meeting with the Russians, and then the guy agrees to leave and he's pulled. But it's not because of Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, again, it's not Trump putting national security at risk, Kennedy. It's the media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, and we're also taking a leap there. And, you know, there may have been something untoward and not right about that meeting. There may have been something very un-presidential about the president's comportment in that meeting. That doesn't mean that the president somehow reveal the identity of this asset in Russia to the ambassador when he was in the White House. And that is -- that is the unfortunate leap. And perhaps, that's the thing that takes time and clarification, because right now, for places like CNN, it's really, choose your own adventure. And if you get some facts that are not correlated or really directly tied to the ultimate conclusion, you just go ahead and make it up. You just go ahead and craft a bridge out of your own intentions, regardless of their truth or falsehood. And that's what's most dangerous. And I think part of it is this desire to bring the president down and really pin something on him. Because, you know, your intuition is telling you that something is not right. It could be your hurt feelings. However, you know, going ahead and just throwing anything at him, regardless of facts, it's dangerous."

And, you know, they don't seem to think there's a price for it, because they keep doing these stories. They keep wanting to reopen these Russia things. So -- and you know what, the rest of the mainstream media lets them get away with it. They always say, well, that ship has sailed. The Russia story is over. I mean, it's a massive scandal and I think President Trump, he's going to try to make hay out of this and we're going to be talking about it later on the show. And his rally last night, he was talking about the Democrats and the media together. There a twosome. And that's what he's talking about that the Democrats and the media are -- have been acting as one, and he's going to use that when he runs against them in 2020."

I don't know. Well, I would -- I would want to track that down and just see. And maybe they thought that they couldn't comment on it or they're trying to protect the identity. There's so many things that you don't know. But the dangers of it hurting other national security efforts I think to me are so great. I would air on the side of caution."

And it doesn't matter who the administration is or who the president is, those things take time and we do need to cultivate those assets more and more around the world. And also, every time we focus on Russia, we really take our eyes off of other countries who might be trying to infiltrate our elections and our voting systems based on the road map that Russia laid out."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "A major shake-up at the White House today. John Bolton is out as national security advisor. And now, he's in a back-and-forth with the president about how it happened. Trump tweeted earlier that he fired Bolton. But Bolton, he quickly responded that he wasn't fired, instead he said he resigned. Who's telling the truth here, Jesse?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know what's happened. But, I mean, the guy has had a very good career, very well respected, professional guy, but it just didn't work out. It had been shimmering for a long time. It was probably personality and a little ideology. He didn't play well with a lot of people in the sandbox. Academics sometimes don't. He didn't have a lot of allies. He clashed with Pompeo. He clashed with Mike Pence. So, sorry, that role as national security advisor too, you're in close contact with the President of the United States often in the oval office. And you have to be able to mesh. I don't think he meshed. And what the president wanted was someone to implement his policies, execute his strategies and his directives. And it seemed like a lot of the times, Bolton was saying, oh, well, you know what, this is why my ideas better, and that's just not going to work. There's three huge things that are on the horizon, the president needs to turn the page on in foreign policy, the China trade deal, Afghanistan, and Iran. And all those three things he's gonna need seasoned pro that can navigate those three things without a lot of turbulence and land that plane, because next year, year and a half, two years is going to be big."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "You know, Dana, I think lots of people saw John Bolton as a strong conservative voice in the administration. I think the president hired him for just that reason. And now, it turns out, he's on the wrong side of the way the president sees events in Afghanistan, what happened over the weekend. The wrong side in where the president wants to deal with Iran."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, let's just go back. So I was spokesperson at the White House when John Bolton was trying to get confirmed to be U.S. ambassador. The U.S. Senate was like, heck no, that's not going to happen. Did anyone actually think he would last 17 months at the White House? It's a pretty good run, actually, if you think about it. He himself, when he took the job said, I'll give it my best shot, but if it ever comes to be that the president doesn't think I have -- if I don't have his confidence, then I'll be gone. That's why I think -- was he fired or did he resigned? It's a distinction without a difference. He is no longer there. One of the other things about this job is that you have to be an honest broker and beloved and trusted by everybody at the policy council. So, that's all sorts of people. That's the intelligence committee, state department, it's the Pentagon, it's DIA, it's all these different people. And you then have to take all their points and all of their advice and funnel it up to the president, and then make your best advice. And if that doesn't work anymore, then you can move on. So, I think whoever the president decides to get in there I think -- having somebody that knows how to run that process, just from a good governance standpoint will probably help him land some of those planes that are in the air."

      "utterance": "No, we already have too much government as it is. The president has plenty of advisors. I don't worry about that. And, you know, to Jesse's point, I'm not surprised that John Bolton clashed with everyone. I think he sees himself as oil and everyone else is water. He's very confident in his philosophical and academic perspective. And he's willing to go out on a limb and convince whoever his audience is whether it's the president or the secretary of state, whoever that is, that his worldview is the correct one. And you definitely want that kind of confidence. But mostly, people want that in a president. So I actually wouldn't be surprised to see John Bolton launch his candidacy for the presidency --"

What do you expect could happen there? We know that North Carolina is going to be a place that all of the candidates are gonna go.

But some students at the school made fun of him for not having a real Tennessee T-shirt. Teacher Laura Snyder said the young man was devastated. So, she shared the story on Facebook. The post went viral. Now, the University of Tennessee has decided to put the boy's homemade design on a real T-shirt."

There is a new documentary, it's called Runway of Hope, a 9/11 story. And you remember after 9/11, our airspace was closed for the first time in U.S. history, 38 commercial aircraft were forced to land in one small Canadian town and all the passengers - there were more passengers grounded than there were residents of this Newfoundland town. And this documentary follows all these people, it has interviews with the past, we have home video and photographs from the people. It's a fascinating documentary. And did you know the Broadway show, the Tony Award winning musical Come from Away is based on that story."

But when he visited his grandmother in South Carolina and saw the devastation in the Bahamas and the hurricane that was descending he used all that money to buy hotdogs and chips for evacuees and helped them out. Word got out and he got a very special visit. Watch this."
