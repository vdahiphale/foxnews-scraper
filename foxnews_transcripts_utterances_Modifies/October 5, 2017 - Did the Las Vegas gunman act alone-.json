Sometimes 7, 8 hours at a time. And there are now numerous reports saying that while he was gambling he was with a female companion who was not his girlfriend. The police are now trying to track down that female companion. We have also confirmed that Stephen Paddock did in fact rent a room in Chicago in August, the same time as the lollapalooza concert. The hotel, the Blackstone, is a 21-story hotel that overlooks Grande Park where the concert was being held. The hotel confirmed that he did make a reservation though he did not show up for the reservation. We have also confirmed that in fact Stephen Paddock booked a hotel room in downtown Las Vegas the week before this shooting at another event, a hotel that overlooked the Life is Beautiful concert down there. And we should note that police think the shooter was in all of this trying to get out of it alive. Listen to this:",

I think perhaps the fuel tanks would have allowed him away to escape if there was an explosion. But the one thing in common with all of these places whether it's Fenway Park, Lollapalooza, or the Vegas target, was open-air targets. So you've got to move away from the question of how do you stop a high I.Q. individual with no kids, a lot of money, the means and the fantasies to exact terror. Chances are you're not going to be able to stop his intent. You could slow him down in certain ways. But the solution is going to be enhanced security, 7.5 billion people on the planet, 99.9 percent of them are good. One person can actually create a larger carnage footprint, affecting thousands of lives by targeting an open-air arena.  So the function is to protect citizens by identifying ways to do that, using, I think, high-tech protection. I've been talking to John about this. You know, drones, highly specific drones. Robotics, things we need to start talking about protection, security. Stop thinking about the weapon as much as you can to prevent -- protect an area. The idea of specific SPI, you know, the defense of targets. It's really going to be the future. And it will be the industry that people should really think about. We should be rejecting fear, embracing security, and reducing the media footprint of fiends so we spend less time talking about them and more time about enhancing the security. I think that's the way to go because I don't think you can stop a high I.Q. individual with the means from exacting terror because he planned this. He thought of everything. And when somebody thinks of everything, even if you took away the bump stocks, which we're going to talk about later, even if you took that away and that might have slowed down one aspect, one aspect, he would have found a way to make them himself.",

I think that's a good thing. It wouldn't prevent mass shootings, but it would maybe decrease the casualty count. It's a symbolic measure. It's not a fix all, but the NRA supports it. I've seen a lot of Republican senators and congressmen, NRA type people, they're very supportive of it. Ironically, it was President Obama's ATF that deregulated the bump stocks in 2010 and 2012. And the justification for that was people that lack hand mobility would use the bump stock. That could just be a ruse. That's one of those things is like smoking weed is illegal but the bong that you sell is legal if it's for tobacco. One of those kinds of things. So, we'll see what happens. It's also reminds me of -- so something gets done under a Democratic administration, it blows up under a Republican administration, and then the Democrats blame the Republicans. That happens all the time. But, I think what I heard from people is when you go down the slippery slope. This is not a slippery slope because machine guns are already banned. When you add taxes and regulations and background checks and classes that you have to take, it makes gun ownership more expensive. To the point where poor people can't afford all this stuff. Guns are expensive as it is. It gets to the point where only wealthy people can afford firearms with all of the onerous things that you lay on the purchase. And the poor people who want to defend their families in their homes can afford it. And people are worried that the more you lay on the gun purchase, the harder it is for them to be able to obtain it.",

An example of why this is flawed is that if you look at gun ownership among woman -- women, you see very little increase in suicides by gun among women. So it's a weird flaw. Then after he does that -- this is the brilliant part of the column -- he sucks in all the liberal readers, saying this flawed study. Then he goes on and debunks every single flimsy argument the left has, revealing their shallow suggestions about -- could not stop any fiend if possible. So then he does the genius move. He suggests political suicide at the end, because he's really smart, this Bret Stevens. He says -- he's challenging Kimmel, he's challenging the Schumers to say what they really want to say. Ban guns. He went to the place that they are too chicken to go to, because they prefer to hide behind the rhetoric of demonization that, if you don't just go for a little bit of gun control, you must be evil.

Sometimes 7, 8 hours at a time. And there are now numerous reports saying that while he was gambling he was with a female companion who was not his girlfriend. The police are now trying to track down that female companion. We have also confirmed that Stephen Paddock did in fact rent a room in Chicago in August, the same time as the lollapalooza concert. The hotel, the Blackstone, is a 21-story hotel that overlooks Grande Park where the concert was being held. The hotel confirmed that he did make a reservation though he did not show up for the reservation. We have also confirmed that in fact Stephen Paddock booked a hotel room in downtown Las Vegas the week before this shooting at another event, a hotel that overlooked the Life is Beautiful concert down there. And we should note that police think the shooter was in all of this trying to get out of it alive. Listen to this:"

I think the investigators are doing an amazing job. I also think they're completely overwhelmed. And the public is wanting answers and they can't necessarily provide them right away. They're getting closer. The fact that we know now that he was at least seen with another woman at the time. Hopefully they can track her down and find out some more information.

I think perhaps the fuel tanks would have allowed him away to escape if there was an explosion. But the one thing in common with all of these places whether it's Fenway Park, Lollapalooza, or the Vegas target, was open-air targets. So you've got to move away from the question of how do you stop a high I.Q. individual with no kids, a lot of money, the means and the fantasies to exact terror. Chances are you're not going to be able to stop his intent. You could slow him down in certain ways. But the solution is going to be enhanced security, 7.5 billion people on the planet, 99.9 percent of them are good. One person can actually create a larger carnage footprint, affecting thousands of lives by targeting an open-air arena. So the function is to protect citizens by identifying ways to do that, using, I think, high-tech protection. I've been talking to John about this. You know, drones, highly specific drones. Robotics, things we need to start talking about protection, security. Stop thinking about the weapon as much as you can to prevent -- protect an area. The idea of specific SPI, you know, the defense of targets. It's really going to be the future. And it will be the industry that people should really think about. We should be rejecting fear, embracing security, and reducing the media footprint of fiends so we spend less time talking about them and more time about enhancing the security. I think that's the way to go because I don't think you can stop a high I.Q. individual with the means from exacting terror because he planned this. He thought of everything. And when somebody thinks of everything, even if you took away the bump stocks, which we're going to talk about later, even if you took that away and that might have slowed down one aspect, one aspect, he would have found a way to make them himself."

I think that's a good thing. It wouldn't prevent mass shootings, but it would maybe decrease the casualty count. It's a symbolic measure. It's not a fix all, but the NRA supports it. I've seen a lot of Republican senators and congressmen, NRA type people, they're very supportive of it. Ironically, it was President Obama's ATF that deregulated the bump stocks in 2010 and 2012. And the justification for that was people that lack hand mobility would use the bump stock. That could just be a ruse. That's one of those things is like smoking weed is illegal but the bong that you sell is legal if it's for tobacco. One of those kinds of things. So, we'll see what happens. It's also reminds me of -- so something gets done under a Democratic administration, it blows up under a Republican administration, and then the Democrats blame the Republicans. That happens all the time. But, I think what I heard from people is when you go down the slippery slope. This is not a slippery slope because machine guns are already banned. When you add taxes and regulations and background checks and classes that you have to take, it makes gun ownership more expensive. To the point where poor people can't afford all this stuff. Guns are expensive as it is. It gets to the point where only wealthy people can afford firearms with all of the onerous things that you lay on the purchase. And the poor people who want to defend their families in their homes can afford it. And people are worried that the more you lay on the gun purchase, the harder it is for them to be able to obtain it."

So, now we're sitting here talking about something about a bump stock, no one's heard of it until now, except, however, it's been around for a long time. Act on bump stock. Fine, it's a no lose situation. If the device was able to broaden the carnage, then ban it. However, wiser folks will tell you they're notoriously unreliable and they can be made, they can be homemade. So what you're going to have is symbolic gesture that may not do any good, but if it does a little good, I agree with you. Let's do bump stocks. But you said something interesting, it's time to have a real conversation. So what you've did is you shifted from bump stocks to basically what the road you're going down to which is let's ban guns."

So our handguns next? So I think that's what Republicans are thinking about. And the problem is -- you remark about seeing, you know, an increase, or at least what appears to be an increase in some of these mass shootings. Don't you think that means there may be a bigger underlying problem with society as a whole that people are evil and feeling compelled to do things like that?

An example of why this is flawed is that if you look at gun ownership among woman -- women, you see very little increase in suicides by gun among women. So it's a weird flaw. Then after he does that -- this is the brilliant part of the column -- he sucks in all the liberal readers, saying this flawed study. Then he goes on and debunks every single flimsy argument the left has, revealing their shallow suggestions about -- could not stop any fiend if possible. So then he does the genius move. He suggests political suicide at the end, because he's really smart, this Bret Stevens. He says -- he's challenging Kimmel, he's challenging the Schumers to say what they really want to say. Ban guns. He went to the place that they are too chicken to go to, because they prefer to hide behind the rhetoric of demonization that, if you don't just go for a little bit of gun control, you must be evil.

You think about the fact that \"Wall Street Journal\" has a poll, back to stats, 48 percent of households have a gun in them. Right? So I mean, that's a significant -- we're talking about almost half this country. And basically, his argument -- or article points out the fact that you look at some of the six senators that are running in states for reelection, Democrats in these red states, have been especially silent on this issue, even in Nevada. The congresswoman, the Democrat congressman who is challenging Dean Heller has also been silent on the issue, as well.
