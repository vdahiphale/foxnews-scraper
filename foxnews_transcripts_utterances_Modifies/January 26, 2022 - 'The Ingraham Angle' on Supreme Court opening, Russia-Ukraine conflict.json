He's going to tell us about Biden's big day out on the town. Plus, we'll attempt to cancel Snow White. What? That can't be happening. Seen and Unseen has answers. But first, rubber stamp justice.

It really doesn't matter whom he chooses to replace Justice Stephen Breyer, because we already know how he'll vote in any important case. Oh, wait, did I say he? Oops.",

I know that when lawyers and petitioners go before the highest court of the land, they don't bother using their time, not now, trying to sway justices Breyer, Kagan or Sotomayor. Everyone already knows how they're going to vote. Attorneys are trying to sway the other six justices, especially Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Gorsuch. All nominated by Republicans, but all with slightly different judicial outlooks. It's anyone's guess how Roberts is going to vote in the Roe challenge, or how Kavanaugh is going to vote on some of these other challenges to the COVID mandates coming up. Liberals will often say that they believe in something called the living constitution. Well, that's not a philosophy. That just means that they treat the constitution like silly putty, so they can stretch its words to mean anything, or nothing at all. The interpretation isn't dependent on what the founders intended, what the language says. But what the progressives of the day demand, then it becomes that. On our side, we actually have arguments about what the constitution means, how its words should be applied to the case at hand. But their side believes the constitution is meaningless at best, and racist at worst. Our side respects the judiciary and the constitutional role it has. The left just sees it as a tool to give them more power. And when the court doesn't give them what they want, they threaten to destroy it.",

      "sentences": "Wow! Now, the dark money bullies who pushed Breyer to retire this year did so, because they know that they're going to lose the Senate. Let's face it. This may be their last chance in many years to get the most radical nominee possible confirmed. For them, it's go time. The only real interesting question on the table right now is how the so- called moderate senators in the Democrat Party will vote on whichever radical nominee Biden puts forward. Think of all the Dems elected in red states, states that voted for Trump, at least once or where Biden is cratering in popularity now. I mean, does anyone in his or her right mind believe that the voters in any of these states, who supported Trump, recently elected a GOP governor want the Supreme Court to be dominated by hard left partisans? People will care more about the views of the New York Times and the views of the framers, of course, not. In West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, they just voted in 2020 to have Donald Trump pick the justices. Obviously, if you're a senator from one of those states, and you rubber stamp a justice, who will simply be a rubber stamp for the hard left, you're working against the interests and the beliefs, the core beliefs of your own voters. Now, as a man who has some semblance of common sense, Joe Manchin should never go along with Biden's court charade. Now, what are the odds that the state of West Virginia would ever win a case in front of a hard left court voting for one of these picks would end Manchin's political career in West Virginia. It should, a state that is in an open rebellion now against Biden's policies. If any of these so-called moderate Dems were living up to their campaign pledges to work with Republicans, they'd demand that Biden's nominee be someone who could actually win real support, not just a couple of votes from the Republicans, so both sides. Someone who could be trusted to look at the cases through an unbiased lens. With a 50-50 Senate, the only way Biden's nominee gets through is if every single one of these senators votes for her confirmation; every senator named above has enormous leverage. They weren't elected to represent MSNBC. They were elected to represent their constituents and their constituents do not want a hard left judiciary. So if you're represented in the Senate by one of those so-called moderates, let your voice be heard now. Call their offices, always be respectful, demand, urge them, tell them you want them to oppose any hard left nominee. Remember, the left, they started this fight. A court opening shouldn't mean open ideological warfare. Look back on Justice Scalia's confirmation. I think it was, what was it unanimous, or near unanimous? In a democracy, unelected official should not have this much power. We're in this mess, because thanks to judicial activist, the court has become a far too powerful tool to invalidate the will of the people. Decisions that should have been left to the people and their elected representatives are instead heavy footed by nine unelected justices. As we saw with Roe, that didn't settle anything for the country. Instead, it just spread rancor and bitterness. So today, the court has lost much of its legitimacy, much of its respect because of its overtly political nature. At least that's the perception. So chalk this up as another example of the collateral damage the left leaves in its wake, whenever they attack our history, denigrate our founders, and ignore the plain language of the constitution. So let's hold Senate Democrats to account. If they do the right thing, they'll prevent Biden from putting a rubber stamp for the New York Times editorial page on the court. If they don't do the right thing, then they'll come up for reelection and we'll have the chance to teach them the folly of putting the interests of MSNBC ahead of their own voters. In fact, tonight, Axios is reporting that the GOP is already planning smartly to target vulnerable Democrats who vote for a far left nominee. Those Democratic senators work for the people. And it's time to remind them of that fact. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Robert Dunn, former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; and Carrie Severino, another former clerk to Justice Thomas and president of the Judicial Crisis Network. Carrie, we got three former law clerks at Justice Thomas in this discussion right now. But let's start fist with the odd - yes, I know, a good company - with the odd timing of this retirement. What do you make of the forces behind this?",

And then later today, we saw Shannon Bream reporting and it seems like from qualified sources that this is not actually the day that Justice Breyer intended to retire. He may have given the White House heads up, but somehow that was leaked. I think most justices want to do that on their own terms, make their own announcement, tell their colleagues first. And so, he was as surprised as we were today. I think that might have been forces in the White House may be corroborating with some of those dark money forces, who have been trying to kick him off the court already. Maybe trying to make sure he went through with it and did retire, or to bring it on their own terms. This has been an awful few weeks for the President. Maybe he wants a change in the storyline.",

Maybe in the framework or the tone of the opinion, but on really every single issue down the line, abortion, affirmative action, free exercise of religion, the power of the administrative state. Breyer has been on the other side from Scalia, Thomas, Alito, in every single one of those down the line. And it's interesting that he's going out right now, when the court just granted the Harvard affirmative action case, because that's been one of the sort of biggest sources of difference between him and Thomas in their outlook. I was looking back at the parents involved case, and he is still of the view. He's like an old style liberal in this view, that the state can do good racial discrimination, that there is such a thing as good race balancing by the state, and presumably by universities as well. And Thomas has long taken the view that there is no such thing as good racial discrimination by the state. So it's fascinating that that - right as he's leaving that issue is sort of coming right back to the front. So I think the tone will likely be more strikingly progressive, whoever Biden nominates. The end result, I don't think the court is going to change much in terms of how it rolls.",

It's really ironic to have the President saying, he's going to condition his appointment of someone on their race or on their gender. I mean, I thought that went out with the Civil War. It's amazing. It's coming back. And it's ironic, it's coming back justice Supreme Court agrees to hear a case about racial discrimination. I think it might be interesting, if some of his - Jennifer Sung, one of his Asian nominees in the court, won't be able to sit in the case that says, Asians are being discriminated against by Harvard, because the President has said that he is going to pick someone based on her race as well.

So look, there are companies out there, we are going to trade with China, but we should not be giving up leverage where we can avoid it.

The military balance, which is severe and deteriorating dramatically, even as we are dithering in Europe and not getting the Europeans to stand up, which is what they should be doing, and they should be taking the front lines on the Ukraine situation.

Look at what they said about the race that elected Virginia's new Lieutenant Governor Winsome Sears, or its first Hispanic Attorney General, Jason Miyares. The left didn't celebrate those firsts. Instead, they were outraged and they claimed their entire election was racist. For them, selecting this court pick, it's really no different than, let's say, hiring a new DNC chief. The only measure that matters for them is a political measure. In other words, will this person stick with the left's ever-evolving political priorities?

I know that when lawyers and petitioners go before the highest court of the land, they don't bother using their time, not now, trying to sway justices Breyer, Kagan or Sotomayor. Everyone already knows how they're going to vote. Attorneys are trying to sway the other six justices, especially Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Gorsuch. All nominated by Republicans, but all with slightly different judicial outlooks. It's anyone's guess how Roberts is going to vote in the Roe challenge, or how Kavanaugh is going to vote on some of these other challenges to the COVID mandates coming up. Liberals will often say that they believe in something called the living constitution. Well, that's not a philosophy. That just means that they treat the constitution like silly putty, so they can stretch its words to mean anything, or nothing at all. The interpretation isn't dependent on what the founders intended, what the language says. But what the progressives of the day demand, then it becomes that. On our side, we actually have arguments about what the constitution means, how its words should be applied to the case at hand. But their side believes the constitution is meaningless at best, and racist at worst. Our side respects the judiciary and the constitutional role it has. The left just sees it as a tool to give them more power. And when the court doesn't give them what they want, they threaten to destroy it."

      "utterance": "Wow! Now, the dark money bullies who pushed Breyer to retire this year did so, because they know that they're going to lose the Senate. Let's face it. This may be their last chance in many years to get the most radical nominee possible confirmed. For them, it's go time. The only real interesting question on the table right now is how the so- called moderate senators in the Democrat Party will vote on whichever radical nominee Biden puts forward. Think of all the Dems elected in red states, states that voted for Trump, at least once or where Biden is cratering in popularity now. I mean, does anyone in his or her right mind believe that the voters in any of these states, who supported Trump, recently elected a GOP governor want the Supreme Court to be dominated by hard left partisans? People will care more about the views of the New York Times and the views of the framers, of course, not. In West Virginia, Ohio and Montana, they just voted in 2020 to have Donald Trump pick the justices. Obviously, if you're a senator from one of those states, and you rubber stamp a justice, who will simply be a rubber stamp for the hard left, you're working against the interests and the beliefs, the core beliefs of your own voters. Now, as a man who has some semblance of common sense, Joe Manchin should never go along with Biden's court charade. Now, what are the odds that the state of West Virginia would ever win a case in front of a hard left court voting for one of these picks would end Manchin's political career in West Virginia. It should, a state that is in an open rebellion now against Biden's policies. If any of these so-called moderate Dems were living up to their campaign pledges to work with Republicans, they'd demand that Biden's nominee be someone who could actually win real support, not just a couple of votes from the Republicans, so both sides. Someone who could be trusted to look at the cases through an unbiased lens. With a 50-50 Senate, the only way Biden's nominee gets through is if every single one of these senators votes for her confirmation; every senator named above has enormous leverage. They weren't elected to represent MSNBC. They were elected to represent their constituents and their constituents do not want a hard left judiciary. So if you're represented in the Senate by one of those so-called moderates, let your voice be heard now. Call their offices, always be respectful, demand, urge them, tell them you want them to oppose any hard left nominee. Remember, the left, they started this fight. A court opening shouldn't mean open ideological warfare. Look back on Justice Scalia's confirmation. I think it was, what was it unanimous, or near unanimous? In a democracy, unelected official should not have this much power. We're in this mess, because thanks to judicial activist, the court has become a far too powerful tool to invalidate the will of the people. Decisions that should have been left to the people and their elected representatives are instead heavy footed by nine unelected justices. As we saw with Roe, that didn't settle anything for the country. Instead, it just spread rancor and bitterness. So today, the court has lost much of its legitimacy, much of its respect because of its overtly political nature. At least that's the perception. So chalk this up as another example of the collateral damage the left leaves in its wake, whenever they attack our history, denigrate our founders, and ignore the plain language of the constitution. So let's hold Senate Democrats to account. If they do the right thing, they'll prevent Biden from putting a rubber stamp for the New York Times editorial page on the court. If they don't do the right thing, then they'll come up for reelection and we'll have the chance to teach them the folly of putting the interests of MSNBC ahead of their own voters. In fact, tonight, Axios is reporting that the GOP is already planning smartly to target vulnerable Democrats who vote for a far left nominee. Those Democratic senators work for the people. And it's time to remind them of that fact. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Robert Dunn, former law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; and Carrie Severino, another former clerk to Justice Thomas and president of the Judicial Crisis Network. Carrie, we got three former law clerks at Justice Thomas in this discussion right now. But let's start fist with the odd - yes, I know, a good company - with the odd timing of this retirement. What do you make of the forces behind this?"

      "speaker": "CARRIE SEVERINO, FORMER JUSTICE THOMAS CLERK",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, I was even saying earlier in the day, this is a really strange time of the year to announce it. Normally we get these announcements at or near the end of the term. And then later today, we saw Shannon Bream reporting and it seems like from qualified sources that this is not actually the day that Justice Breyer intended to retire. He may have given the White House heads up, but somehow that was leaked. I think most justices want to do that on their own terms, make their own announcement, tell their colleagues first. And so, he was as surprised as we were today. I think that might have been forces in the White House may be corroborating with some of those dark money forces, who have been trying to kick him off the court already. Maybe trying to make sure he went through with it and did retire, or to bring it on their own terms. This has been an awful few weeks for the President. Maybe he wants a change in the storyline."

But is there any doubt in your mind that whomever Biden selects, if that's the group he's selecting from? I mean, they might be perfectly great people personally, but as talking about a judicial outlook that they will be a rubber stamp for whatever the hard left wants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT DUNN, FORMER JUSTICE THOMAS CLERK",
      "utterance": "I think that's highly likely. I was looking back through Breyer's opinions, and the interesting thing to me is, I'm not sure it's actually going to make that much difference in the voting patterns. Maybe in the framework or the tone of the opinion, but on really every single issue down the line, abortion, affirmative action, free exercise of religion, the power of the administrative state. Breyer has been on the other side from Scalia, Thomas, Alito, in every single one of those down the line. And it's interesting that he's going out right now, when the court just granted the Harvard affirmative action case, because that's been one of the sort of biggest sources of difference between him and Thomas in their outlook. I was looking back at the parents involved case, and he is still of the view. He's like an old style liberal in this view, that the state can do good racial discrimination, that there is such a thing as good race balancing by the state, and presumably by universities as well. And Thomas has long taken the view that there is no such thing as good racial discrimination by the state. So it's fascinating that that - right as he's leaving that issue is sort of coming right back to the front. So I think the tone will likely be more strikingly progressive, whoever Biden nominates. The end result, I don't think the court is going to change much in terms of how it rolls."

      "utterance": "Carrie, I'm thinking back on the nomination of what would have been another first, which is the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown. And she was filibustered by none other than Joe Biden. So this idea of appointing a black woman to the judiciary, he voted three times against confirming her just to be a U.S. Circuit Judge. I mean, this wasn't even to the Supreme Court. So race and gender, they only count if you're thought to be a committed judicial activist, judicial leftist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEVERINO",
      "utterance": "Yes. That was the case I was actually thinking about during your 'Angle' earlier talking about how it - it only cuts one way. Because if he really just cared about trying to get more black women on the federal courts, he wouldn't have been holding Janice Rogers Brown's nomination up for so long and at such length. It's really ironic to have the President saying, he's going to condition his appointment of someone on their race or on their gender. I mean, I thought that went out with the Civil War. It's amazing. It's coming back. And it's ironic, it's coming back justice Supreme Court agrees to hear a case about racial discrimination. I think it might be interesting, if some of his - Jennifer Sung, one of his Asian nominees in the court, won't be able to sit in the case that says, Asians are being discriminated against by Harvard, because the President has said that he is going to pick someone based on her race as well. It's a little ironic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I don't think the first Asian conservative nominee to the court would count as a first. I think that would be out the window. That wouldn't matter at all. Robert, on this idea of the so-called moderate Democrats, and how they'll vote on this, how do you see that playing out? Is it just going to be lockstep for Biden? Or would someone like a Manchin, or a Sinema, or even a Tester in Montana, where - Montana has no desire to have a far left person on the court. That's for sure. Would there be any possibility of leverage being exerted against the Biden pick?"

    {
      "speaker": "DUNN",
      "utterance": "Well, that's far outside my wheelhouse. But my prediction on that is that I think those senators have tended to be fairly loyal when it comes to nominations both in the executive branch and in the judiciary. And they've taken issue mostly with legislation, unless a nominee was on the record with espousing policies that were really harmful to that state. I have a hard time seeing either Manchin or Tester blocking someone. I could be wrong about that. But my prediction is that they will take the view that the elections have consequences, the President has the right to nominate. So we will see (inaudible)"

I think the only reason Biden wants to maybe tack to the center here is because he knows it's another election year and he stands to lose big time right now, because he has been so radical compared to the person he campaigned as. But what do we know about Democratic court nominees? It doesn't matter if they have a long record, a short record, no record at all. They vote reliably straight down the line. And I might take issue with Robert, I think there are issues at least that in some point, Justice Breyer, if there's one or two liberal justices that that compromise on an issue, it would be him. I guarantee you. The person that Joe Biden nominates will not compromise on anything. This is going to be the most strident person he can find and the most guaranteed vote he can find. And it's going to be someone picked, it seems to appease the dark money groups in the left that paid hundreds of millions of dollars to get him and the other Democrats elected last time. That has been his MO for all of his appellate nominees. And we're going to see that MO again. He'll tell you - he'll tell you to moderate. It's going to be a lie."

Joining me now is Elbridge Colby, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development under President Trump. He's also the author of \"The Strategy of Denial.\" Elbridge, this doesn't seem like the right time to be taking economic pressure off China now that we just learned we had a $1 trillion overall trade deficit last year. Your thoughts?"

      "speaker": "ELBRIDGE COLBY, THE MARATHON INITIATIVE CO-FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "Great to be with you, Laura. I think in general you're absolutely right, we should not be removing any leverage. I think what President Trump and the administration that he led really shifted correctly on was understanding that this is not purely a commercial situation with China, that it is intimately connected to our national security and it's been associated with the deindustrialization and tremendous number of problems that our country faces. So look, there are companies out there, we are going to trade with China, but we should not be giving up leverage where we can avoid it. I haven't looked deeply into the tariff letter, but I think the attitude of saying look, this is not a fair dealing counterparty, this is somebody that we are going to have to build and sustain leverage in the economic space is the way to go about it."

Every Republican voting to lift the trade sanctions on China now, given China's sustained cheating and everything else they're doing, I don't -- why do you need -- why do you need Republicans at all if that's how they are voting? It's just outrageous. Elbridge, there are serious security concerns for anyone going to the Olympics. We find out the communication services are going to be provided by China Unicom Beijing, and that's going to be relying on Huawei technology for the games. Both Huawei and China Unicom, the parent company, have been blacklisted by our government. And the IOC chose Alibaba as its exclusive provider of cloud services for the entire games. That's another company we consider a national security risk. Elbridge, how can any of this be good?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLBY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's not, and it's sort of a vision of our future where China gets to set the terms. It has the money, it has the power, it has the technology, and everyone has got to play along. And I think the reality is, yes, the IOC is weak but it's not alone. Yes, the Women's Tennis Association stood up, but that's pretty unusual. Australia is standing up. But if we allow China to gain the kind of economic leverage that we were talking about over us, that will be our future, because everybody works for somebody, and we've already seen with John Cena and the NBA and you name it, people will kowtow. And I think, Laura, the critical issue here is that that's also going to be determined by the military balance. The military balance, which is severe and deteriorating dramatically, even as we are dithering in Europe and not getting the Europeans to stand up, which is what they should be doing, and they should be taking the front lines on the Ukraine situation. If the Chinese move on Taiwan, which I differ with Colonel MacGregor, I do think that's a very real possibility, that's going to determine the geo-economic map. And if we don't get that right, we won't be able to preserve our prosperity and ultimately our freedoms at home."

The idea that if we don't take on Russia, they are definitely going into Taiwan, I agree with you. I think they are going to try to move against Taiwan either way. Elbridge, thank you.

That's truly frightening and made even more so by the fact that the Biden administration right now is trying to expedite the resettlement of more Afghan refugees into the United States, already about 120,000. That means more unvented and potentially dangerous people being brought into this country that's already been ripped apart at the seams. This is a nightmare scenario, it should have every lawmaker, Republican, Democrat, demanding answers. Joining me now is Dr. Qanta Ahmed, senior fellow at the Independent Women's Forum.

But this is sadly the story of many vulnerable children that may find themselves in this situation. We know that even here after the Afghani refugees have been brought to the United States, crimes have been reported at American bases, including spousal abuse, sexual assault, and child molestation. So this is very concerning. His remark that it was part of his culture is sickening, but very sorry to say, Afghanistan has struggled for generations with a particular kind of child abuse targeting little boys that has been very overlooked, called \"bacha bazi.\" And I think what this means is that children are vulnerable to predators and have been in Afghanistan that's been almost impossible to govern for decades, and maybe here as well. In this case, this little girl's life has been altered permanently by this assault. We must do everything to protect her."

And the ones who started to report this, they were told to kind of keep it quiet. That is a huge controversy. And Americans, we hear this and it just makes our skin crawl.

That's very important that we knew that. I myself with Lieutenant Colonel Paul Lashenko (ph) and other very concerned Americans have attempted to bring legitimate Afghani national security allies that helped the United States and the U.K. back into the United States, and there was not a mechanism. So there's problems in both ways. We're an enormously welcoming nation. We do want to bring talented people here to the United States that can assist, but there's a method.
