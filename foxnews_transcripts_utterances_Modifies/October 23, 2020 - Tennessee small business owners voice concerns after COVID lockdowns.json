      "sentences": "Hello there, Bret. Good to see you tonight. Happy Friday to you my friend. Good evening everybody. Good evening to you and happy Friday. I'm Martha McCallum and this is THE STORY on this Friday night. We've got 11 days to go and we're seeing an unprecedented level of early voting like we've never seen before process country. You've got 50 million Americans who already voted. So, in the 2016 in the entire election 136 million Americans by the end of all the voting on Election Day. We also know that one in five of those early voters are new voters who didn't vote in that state at least in 2016 or they're new to voting all together so we're looking at election perhaps that could have an enormous turnout or is it just that the virus has changed voting patterns in a very big way.  So we also know that by and large in some of these crucial swing states, Biden voters are the ones who are mailing it in predominantly and Trump voters for the most part according to our polls are saying they want to put that ballot in by hand, in person on election day or at least when early voting opens up in their states, in those big swing states.  So today President Trump and Joe Biden moved into the home stretch of this whole thing and that is for sure. 11 more days so President Trump in Florida, two big rallies today. There he is earlier at the villages. This weekend he's going to Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin and New Hampshire.  Then he's going to be in Pennsylvania come Monday. Joe Biden has one on his schedule and that is Pennsylvania tomorrow. He did something close to home in Delaware today after the big debate last night so with all that early voting is it too late even for this debate to change the outcome or to impact voters opinions and their abilities to change their mind at this point.  In a moment, I will speak with Cody Campbell who is a former NFL players, who now is a Texas oil CEO and he had a pretty strong reaction to what was perhaps Joe Biden's most perilous moment last night in that debate.",

I'm like Scrooge McDuck diving into and I'm crazy for it.  But let's remember something, early voters are not persuadable voters. No one says I don't know who I'm going to vote for, I think I better go down and cast an early ballot. No, if you're an undecided or persuadable voter, you're not going to be in that first wave of votes.   Now look, there's a lot the Democrats can brag about here and they've done a really good job with their get out to vote efforts and they have really pushed people and all those new voters are a reflection of that and all that stuff but there is a lot of football left to play here to mix my metaphors. There's a lot yet to do and as you pointed out, since President Trump really denounced the mail-in voting, we would expect to see maybe even Republicans vote in-person at a higher rate than they did even in 2016 or in 2012 like maybe he's really suppressed that mail-in vote and they're really going to focus on day of voting.

He is in a more difficult spot now. He's in a tighter crack than he was two weeks.   Now four years ago, he closed the gap five points in the last two weeks. He closed really strong but even if he could somehow do it again, he still would be too far back and there aren't enough persuadable voters. So my thought was he should have doubled on Godzilla Trump for the second debate because the only thing that he can really do now.  He's got a hard ceiling. He's got to bring Joe Biden ceiling down. You can't - for Trump, he had to do something to blow Biden up. For Biden, he knew he just had to get out, he just had to get out of Nashville. All he had to do was get out of Nashville, if the worst thing that happened to him was he slipped up on oil, then he calls it a win so I think Trump should've gone harder after him.",

No Hunter isn't really an expert on Chinese - or Ukrainian energy or Romanian real estate or Moscow real estate.

The dark winter projections are coming out of University of Washington model and the University of Washington model has been wrong essentially since this whole thing started back in March and it was wrong last month in September. They got a lot of attention. They said, there'll be 400,000 deaths by the end of the year, there'd be 230,000 deaths in the fall and they've already cut that projection by almost 50 percent in six weeks and they're going to have to continue to cut it because there's just no evidence that deaths are spiking the way they are. So what have they done in now instead of saying end of the year, they're saying February 1 or in some cases March 1 and they're pushing the numbers back up so now they're saying 0.5 million deaths by sort of you know the spring. The problem is you know they just keep sort of when they're wrong, they don't ever acknowledge they're wrong, they just push the projection forward and here's what I think people need to realize. You know the left and the media love to criticize Donald Trump for our response to coronavirus and there's certainly things we could have done differently but when you look at the U.S. versus the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, the four countries in Europe that really got hit the most in the spring, there is a huge second wave going on there right now. And you know through the summer, the U.S. had a wave in the Sun Belt that you know in retrospect actually, it wasn't that bad and people you know all these journalists said, look at Europe, they managed it, they dealt with it, they're done. They did so much better than we did you know.  The U.K.'s having six deaths today and the U.S. is having 1000. Well guess what, those four countries now today are even though their population is a 100 million people smaller than the U.S. if you combine it are going to have more deaths today than the U.S. There's just not that much evidence that advance societies, advance liberal economies and societies are able to you know to destroy this virus and make it go away. We all have to manage. If the last seven months have taught us anything, it should be that. There's been no health system overrun. Four percent of the beds in the U.S. are occupied by people with corona - hospital beds are occupied by people with coronavirus. We're dealing with this and our economy has not blown up, it's done much better than Europe and that's what people should remember.",

You know, this is a sprint to the finish for the president as of course we have less than two weeks to go between now and the election. And I mentioned the stop here. Keep in mind, earlier, I showed you a stop back in Virginia where we were right along the North Carolina border against sort of a two for one, and that's a key strategy down the stretch. They want to energize the base but they also want to make sure that people who might still be on the fence have a chance to hear the president personally. Now, you also know this, many in the crowd here were up here very early, 8 o'clock in the morning, many of them in the front. That may not sound terribly impressive until you consider it was mildly hot and humid all day long. The governor, Ron DeSantis speaking now. The president coming up. We'll have live coverage. But for now, Martha, back to you.",

      "utterance": "Hello there, Bret. Good to see you tonight. Happy Friday to you my friend. Good evening everybody. Good evening to you and happy Friday. I'm Martha McCallum and this is THE STORY on this Friday night. We've got 11 days to go and we're seeing an unprecedented level of early voting like we've never seen before process country. You've got 50 million Americans who already voted. So, in the 2016 in the entire election 136 million Americans by the end of all the voting on Election Day. We also know that one in five of those early voters are new voters who didn't vote in that state at least in 2016 or they're new to voting all together so we're looking at election perhaps that could have an enormous turnout or is it just that the virus has changed voting patterns in a very big way. So we also know that by and large in some of these crucial swing states, Biden voters are the ones who are mailing it in predominantly and Trump voters for the most part according to our polls are saying they want to put that ballot in by hand, in person on election day or at least when early voting opens up in their states, in those big swing states. So today President Trump and Joe Biden moved into the home stretch of this whole thing and that is for sure. 11 more days so President Trump in Florida, two big rallies today. There he is earlier at the villages. This weekend he's going to Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin and New Hampshire. Then he's going to be in Pennsylvania come Monday. Joe Biden has one on his schedule and that is Pennsylvania tomorrow. He did something close to home in Delaware today after the big debate last night so with all that early voting is it too late even for this debate to change the outcome or to impact voters opinions and their abilities to change their mind at this point. In a moment, I will speak with Cody Campbell who is a former NFL players, who now is a Texas oil CEO and he had a pretty strong reaction to what was perhaps Joe Biden's most perilous moment last night in that debate."

I'm like Scrooge McDuck diving into and I'm crazy for it. But let's remember something, early voters are not persuadable voters. No one says I don't know who I'm going to vote for, I think I better go down and cast an early ballot. No, if you're an undecided or persuadable voter, you're not going to be in that first wave of votes. Now look, there's a lot the Democrats can brag about here and they've done a really good job with their get out to vote efforts and they have really pushed people and all those new voters are a reflection of that and all that stuff but there is a lot of football left to play here to mix my metaphors. There's a lot yet to do and as you pointed out, since President Trump really denounced the mail-in voting, we would expect to see maybe even Republicans vote in-person at a higher rate than they did even in 2016 or in 2012 like maybe he's really suppressed that mail-in vote and they're really going to focus on day of voting.

I'm skeptical that 20 percent of the electorate is going to be new voters this time, given the fact that it's usually 7 or 8 percent and I think we're going to see that number level out but who knows, as you pointed out, it's a weird year."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "Well, I differed with a lot of those sort of mainstream analysis going into the debate. Trump is further back now than he was in 2016 and there are a fewer undecided voters. He is in a more difficult spot now. He's in a tighter crack than he was two weeks. Now four years ago, he closed the gap five points in the last two weeks. He closed really strong but even if he could somehow do it again, he still would be too far back and there aren't enough persuadable voters. So my thought was he should have doubled on Godzilla Trump for the second debate because the only thing that he can really do now. He's got a hard ceiling. He's got to bring Joe Biden ceiling down. You can't - for Trump, he had to do something to blow Biden up. For Biden, he knew he just had to get out, he just had to get out of Nashville. All he had to do was get out of Nashville, if the worst thing that happened to him was he slipped up on oil, then he calls it a win so I think Trump should've gone harder after him."

I mean especially when you look at - we're going to talk about this suburban women voters and I just thought that there had to be some of those out there who voted for Trump last time around who looked at what they saw last night. Let me quote John Podhoretz here. He said, \"Fifty million votes have already been cast and they were cast with the memory of that disaster fresh in the minds of the early voters. The voters up for grabs might have acted differently if they had seen this guy.\" How's that Chris?"

What he said last night was consistent with the platform that he's carried from the beginning. You know he's flipped and flopped a lot. I think out of an effort to sort of trick some voters in certain states to vote for him but really, he is after the end of our industry. He wants to put an end to our industry and what he said last night made that very clear."

You know we support tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of jobs in this state but our industry also supports jobs all across the country. Steel workers, auto workers, petrochemical workers and so the impact if you end, put an end to the American oil and gas industry would be millions of jobs across the country and it would really hurt the competitiveness of every industry because they wouldn't increase all the costs that we bear. So, it would be a devastating thing for the American economy if you were to put an end to oil and gas."

He wasn't involved. You now have Mr. Bobulinski putting him at the same $10 million in one email for introductions alone. This is a part of the email communication between Hunter Biden and the head of CEFC, the Chinese company. I think people naturally asked who pays $10 million just for introductions and who is it that you pay $10 million to meet?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, it may be that nobody did pay that. You know one of the things that strikes me is that there was a lot of effort put out here and the way that Joe Biden phrased it was I don't have any stock in any of those companies and I never took a penny. It doesn't mean that these - that Hunter Biden wasn't trying to put together these deals, trying to do these transactions. It looks like a number of them fell through. Were any of them successful? Did they get paid on any of these deals according to your coverage of this or the Wall Street Journal's reporting on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREEMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, we see in the - report in August of 2017, the Chinese company sent $5 million to an entity called Hudson West 3, which was affiliated with Hunter Biden. Immediately then money began flowing to another Biden entity - firm of Hunter Biden's in the amount of $4.7 million over a series of payments. These are described vaguely as some kind of consulting fees. Once again just like a lot of these Hunter Biden adventures all over the world, very big money in industries for which he seems massively unqualified and each time these issues have come up, the Bidens have not even tried to argue. No Hunter isn't really an expert on Chinese - or Ukrainian energy or Romanian real estate or Moscow real estate. Multimillion dollar payments and I think this is wrong even if there's not the proof that it ended up going to Joe, why he tolerated this including when he was Vice President is something I think he has to reckon with."

    {
      "speaker": "BERENSON",
      "utterance": "Well Martha, to be honest, they're really both a little bit wrong but President Trump is probably closer to being right. Now there's a couple of important things to remember. The dark winter projections are coming out of University of Washington model and the University of Washington model has been wrong essentially since this whole thing started back in March and it was wrong last month in September. They got a lot of attention. They said, there'll be 400,000 deaths by the end of the year, there'd be 230,000 deaths in the fall and they've already cut that projection by almost 50 percent in six weeks and they're going to have to continue to cut it because there's just no evidence that deaths are spiking the way they are. So what have they done in now instead of saying end of the year, they're saying February 1 or in some cases March 1 and they're pushing the numbers back up so now they're saying 0.5 million deaths by sort of you know the spring. The problem is you know they just keep sort of when they're wrong, they don't ever acknowledge they're wrong, they just push the projection forward and here's what I think people need to realize. You know the left and the media love to criticize Donald Trump for our response to coronavirus and there's certainly things we could have done differently but when you look at the U.S. versus the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, the four countries in Europe that really got hit the most in the spring, there is a huge second wave going on there right now. And you know through the summer, the U.S. had a wave in the Sun Belt that you know in retrospect actually, it wasn't that bad and people you know all these journalists said, look at Europe, they managed it, they dealt with it, they're done. They did so much better than we did you know. The U.K.'s having six deaths today and the U.S. is having 1000. Well guess what, those four countries now today are even though their population is a 100 million people smaller than the U.S. if you combine it are going to have more deaths today than the U.S. There's just not that much evidence that advance societies, advance liberal economies and societies are able to you know to destroy this virus and make it go away. We all have to manage. If the last seven months have taught us anything, it should be that. There's been no health system overrun. Four percent of the beds in the U.S. are occupied by people with corona - hospital beds are occupied by people with coronavirus. We're dealing with this and our economy has not blown up, it's done much better than Europe and that's what people should remember."

Fifteen, in this climate in Nashville, $15 an hour is like, it's an astronomical amount of money for small business owner to be paying. Of course, you know, as a small business owner you're going to have different workers making different amounts of money. You may have your supervisor making 15. You may have someone under him making 13, or 12. But to be able to have to pay everyone $15 an hour, that wouldn't be sustainable for me and my company."

Senator, good to have you with us today. Thank you for being here this evening. I understand that there was a closed session for the first time in a decade in the Senate today.

And the Democratic Leader, Chuck Schumer, he stated that he wanted to have this closed session so he could have a candid discussion on the floor of the Senate about this process. I'm sorry. What candid discussion? What happened? We heard from the Democratic leader that would have been new behind closed doors, so just another tactic by the Democrats to slow down the process."

      "speaker": "ERNST",

However, there is the wherewithal and the Republican majority to get this nomination over the finish line. That should happen Monday. It will be the final vote on Judge Barrett to become the new associate justice on the Supreme Court. So, I do see this going through."

All of that needs to be answered. We've experienced this in Iowa certainly during this political season. So, we just need these answers for all Iowans and for all Americans. And I'm very anxious to have them in front of the committee. I know they will be speaking to the commerce committee as well. There's a lot of interest in this right now. But they shouldn't be suppressing our first amendment rights."

The president and Joe Biden are in a tight race in Iowa as well. And it's interesting to note where the polls are with regard to women, particularly white women. President Trump beat Hillary Clinton with that demographic last time around. And now he trails significantly in that demographic. So, what do you think is going on in Iowa and what do you expect to happen?"
    },

      "speaker": "ERNST",
      "utterance": "Honestly, I try not to pay much attention to the polls. I do believe that they are off. What I feel on the ground is a lot of energy and enthusiasm for the president. I feel that in my own Senate race. I travel all of Iowa's counties, all 99 counties every single year. I'm visiting with farmers, small business owners, healthcare systems. And I feel that before the pandemic, of course the economy was booming. People care about that. They want to see us get through the pandemic safely, responsibly. But they want to see the economy open. And we saw that President Trump really led the way to a strong economy, low unemployment. We wish to get back there. And so, I'm -- I'm excited. I know my constituents are excited. And I do think that the president will carry the state of Iowa and I feel that I'll be able to hold this senate seat. But it is going to be a fight to the finish."

As you mentioned, he actually did very well in this part of the state, this key swing state back in 2016. But this is also, as you know, right along the Alabama- border. So, for him, it's a chance to say hello and to make that final push. You know, this is a sprint to the finish for the president as of course we have less than two weeks to go between now and the election. And I mentioned the stop here. Keep in mind, earlier, I showed you a stop back in Virginia where we were right along the North Carolina border against sort of a two for one, and that's a key strategy down the stretch. They want to energize the base but they also want to make sure that people who might still be on the fence have a chance to hear the president personally.
