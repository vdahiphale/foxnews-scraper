Now, I follow this stuff fairly closely, being one of the nerds here at Fox. That has much more to do with our veering into cleaner, cheaper natural gas, what have you. And that could continue, deal or no deal with our foreign counterparts. What are your thoughts?"

Moreover, we're a nation that abides by the rule of law, much more so than many of the counterpart countries involved in this agreement."

I commend him also for moving in the direction of transferring people back to the American people. It's one of the things he said in his inaugural address that gave me great comfort and something that's been borne out by his actions since then. He said this is about a transfer of power, not from one president to another or one party to power. It's about a transfer of power from Washington, D.C., back to the American people. I'm excited about that. And I appreciate his leadership."

And the feeling seems to be, whether it's coming from Germany, who indicated Angela Merkel on the wires right now, I will still do what I can, Germany will still do what it can, the mayor of Paris, the French president, so many more saying this was regrettable, but they're shaking their heads. We will move on without America. Now, I know your view is this is in the interest of America. But do you worry that we're now an island and that we could, for maybe perfectly fine reasons, be alienating our friends?"

We're going to start letting foreign leaders in Europe and other parts of the world dictate our domestic policy? I don't think that is a good idea, especially when we have been a world leader in cleaning up the environment."

But that decisions such as these, that haven't been polled obviously, but that you need the economy really picking up steam, you need these tax cuts to go through, the health care rework to go through, and yet Republicans can't seem to get that to go through. Are you guys just not able to lead?"

The American people can always be counted on to do the right thing, after they have exhausted every other alternative. We have given the Affordable Care Act a nice long seven-year try. It hasn't worked. We have exhausted every other alternative. We have to repeal it."
