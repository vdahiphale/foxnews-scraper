Even the Democrats, if you look at that Bloomberg poll just a couple of days ago, the sentiment for the economy is the strongest with Democrats since 2001. That's stronger than any time when President Obama was in office. And a lot of that credit, a majority of all that credit goes to this President. Remember what President Obama said, the idea of getting 3 percent growth, you need a magic wand. All we really needed was somebody in office who understood how to make jobs, how to make America stronger and really put America first. Through regulation, through tax reform, and all the other things this President has been able to accomplish, not even taking into account what he accomplished last week at G-20 and over in North Korea.

The Berlin Wall collapsed and so did the Soviet Union. Now compare that to today's challenge where you had North Korea testing long-range nuclear missiles. That's no longer the case that they're testing those.  You had President Trump step away from the table in Vietnam because it wasn't at the right setting. But what happened with President Trump, he reset the terms to have a negotiation. Now in two to three weeks we will be talking about denuclearizing North Korea.   We are safer today based on what President Trump has been able to do and build. And when you look at Kim Jong-un's face, you saw a smile there. You've got to build trust before you could ever get to an agreement. That's exactly what President Reagan did with the Soviet Union and Gorbachev and you saw the results.

China has to have the Communist Party in every company. Their government part-owned Huawei. This is a real concern from a security issue long term.

Even the Democrat Senators on the senate side understand it, but not the House. You know, a bill came out of the Senate 84-8. Every Democrat in the leadership on the Senate side voted for it, but Nancy Pelosi did not want to bring that up. You know why? Because she believes in open borders. She wanted to deny anybody working along the border that they could not have overtime.  In a time where you just had 144,000 apprehensions of people illegally crossing just last month, something we have not seen in a decade, this is when I talk about this is not the same Democratic Party of the past.  This is a new socialist Democratic Party and many of the members there call themselves that, and they are the new leaders of this socialist Democratic Party. And that's a real concern.
