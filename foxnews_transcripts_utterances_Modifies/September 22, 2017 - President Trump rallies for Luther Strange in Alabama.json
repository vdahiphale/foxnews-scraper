And I'm surprised that that PAC spent that money directly in the race. I think it's one of the impacts. I think Luther Strange is having trouble making the case that he is his own man, something that Judge Moore has demonstrated throughout his career. I tell you, the one thing I'd give to the president here, Judge, is he's rewarding his friend. And Luther Strange has been a reliable vote for him. But he is right to take on this Congress.

Some think perhaps his fourth test was also thermonuclear, and he's shown he's got the range for his ballistic missiles. Now, the president is correct when he says that one of the dangers from a thermonuclear blast over the Pacific is the radiation that would come from it. A lot of the experts are now also worrying about whether there's a potential EMP effect from it, electromagnetic pulse. Depends on where the device is detonated. Would it take out satellites in orbit if it were lower? Could it take out electrical grids and communications systems in land areas near where the detonation takes place? So this is more serious than just setting off a big firecracker. And I think it shows fundamentally why the president is properly concerned about how irrational this regime is. You know, wars can start not simply because people intend they start but through miscalculation. And you see a dictatorship like this, miscalculation should be much on our mind.",

But what's troubled me is that in these two launches you mentioned that have overflown Japanese territory, there was no effort by them or by us to engage with missile defense systems. Now, our response to that is, Well, we didn't think it threatened Japanese territory. But as you rightly point out, these weapons can fail. Their trajectory can go off. Or the North Koreans might actually be more sophisticated and have maneuverable capabilities for their missiles. So I think this is very dangerous, and I think the president's trying to alert us.

Trying to get them to work on anything together is like trying to herd cats. So what he's trying to do really is mobilize and energize the people, the public all across America to start to put the pressure on the GOP to get his agenda passed and to get it under way. And right now, you know, it seems to be stuck in neutral because of this dysfunctional Congress. And basically, the GOP's in charge, so it falls in their lap."

But I was surprised he got involved in this race. If he doesn't win, he loses prestige. People are going to think that it's OK to defy Trump. On the other hand, if he pulls this out -- and Luther Strange is the underdog -- it suggests that the president has a lot more clout than people think. Look, his poll numbers are up. He comes off this his boffo United Nations speech. He still hasn't backed down from all of his promises, including the wall. So this gave him an extraordinary opportunity to restate his presidency and to talk about what he wants to do in the future. This is not a guy who's afraid of getting impeached, I'll tell you that."

You know, Judge, it's going to come as no surprise to you that if you're a candidate running out there in America and you are tied to the GOP Washington establishment, it is not a positive. And I'm surprised that that PAC spent that money directly in the race. I think it's one of the impacts. I think Luther Strange is having trouble making the case that he is his own man, something that Judge Moore has demonstrated throughout his career. I tell you, the one thing I'd give to the president here, Judge, is he's rewarding his friend. And Luther Strange has been a reliable vote for him. But he is right to take on this Congress. Seven-and-a-half years of talking about \"Obama care\" and watching these senators weasel out of it? I think there -- I think people across this country, it's pitchfork time!"

There was a cover story in The Economist, which is a British newspaper, 2006 with Kim Jong-un on it, calling him rocket man. Nobody said anything. Donald Trump says it, now, all of a sudden, he's irresponsible and he's a warmonger. Double standard.

What was great about it for Donald Trump, he's so good I communicating in quick little bursts, but he actually gave us a philosophical understanding of what it means to stand up for a sovereign country, what sovereignty means. And he also talked about why communism and socialism continues to fail around the globe. And let me tell you, Judge, when he takes on Cuba and North Korea and Iran, I'm going to stand up and cheer every time."

And every time he gets on the word stage like that -- he did it when he was over in Warsaw -- I hear people even who might not care about him say it's one of the best speeches they ever heard because he's a great communicator. But I was real pleased to see him stand up in that well at the U.N. and proudly talk about what America has accomplished, what America is about, that we're here to work with people that want to work with us. And it's a two-way street. But I'll tell you what. Every time he gets on that world stage, the leadership that this guy exhibits, and I say that affectionately, the president of the United States -- it's astounding. But now we have America that's going to be front and center in terms of working with the world. But again, America comes first. I like that."

Earlier today, the President tweeted, quote, \"Kim Jong-un of North Korea who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving to killing his people will be tested like never before.\" This comes after the rogue dictator called President Trump deranged and threatened to test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific. Joining us with reaction is former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, FOX News contributor John Bolton. Good evening, Ambassador."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Thank you. The threat of a hydrogen bomb, I mean, which apparently is far more sophisticated than the atomic bombs of past, is pretty serious. I mean, does Kim Jong-un have the capacity, the capability to do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, we don't know, but he certainly by most expert opinions in his sixth nuclear test did detonate a thermonuclear weapon. Some think perhaps his fourth test was also thermonuclear, and he's shown he's got the range for his ballistic missiles. Now, the president is correct when he says that one of the dangers from a thermonuclear blast over the Pacific is the radiation that would come from it. A lot of the experts are now also worrying about whether there's a potential EMP effect from it, electromagnetic pulse. Depends on where the device is detonated. Would it take out satellites in orbit if it were lower? Could it take out electrical grids and communications systems in land areas near where the detonation takes place? So this is more serious than just setting off a big firecracker. And I think it shows fundamentally why the president is properly concerned about how irrational this regime is. You know, wars can start not simply because people intend they start but through miscalculation. And you see a dictatorship like this, miscalculation should be much on our mind."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, earlier, I read that what Kim Jong-un did with regard to that ICBM that was headed toward Japan, because, you know, his alignments are not that specific -- it could just as easily have hit Japan. And the concern is if it's not that sophisticated, the targeting. Then everyone is in trouble."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, we don't really have that good an idea how sophisticated the capabilities are. Everybody I think has been surprised in the past three, four months at the range of some of the missiles launched. And frankly, at the thermonuclear detonation in the sixth test. But what's troubled me is that in these two launches you mentioned that have overflown Japanese territory, there was no effort by them or by us to engage with missile defense systems. Now, our response to that is, Well, we didn't think it threatened Japanese territory. But as you rightly point out, these weapons can fail. Their trajectory can go off. Or the North Koreans might actually be more sophisticated and have maneuverable capabilities for their missiles. So I think this is very dangerous, and I think the president's trying to alert us. He certainly tried to alert the rest of the world on Tuesday that he's not going to allow this kind of dictatorship, or I would say Iran, to extort the American people through the threat of the use of nuclear weapons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "You know, the president yesterday signed -- I believe it was yesterday signed the executive order where he would increase the Treasury Department's ability to sanction those who are doing business with North Korea. And the curious thing is that China came along. What do you think brought China along, where they're saying their central bank cannot deal with anyone who's working with North Korea?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's potentially quite a significant step. I think the president's sanctions -- although they don't use the words China and Russia, everybody should understand that's who they're aimed at. So we'll see if China follows through. Part of our problem for 25 years -- and I think the president again was right to say this is a 25-year-long failure that he's now inherited. China will say one thing and do another. If, in fact, China has made a significant move here, it will have a tremendous impact on North Korea. China really supplies 90 percent of North Korea's energy. It is its financial lifeline to the outside world. And they haven't applied pressure in the past because they're worried the regime will collapse. Maybe their attitude is changing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, and if, indeed, you know, Kim Jong-un does make a decision to try to do something -- I mean, I believe the president when he says, you know, you're covered. We've got -- we've got your back. The president will be able, with our military and the sophisticated technology we have, to prevent that kind of thing from happening if he were to try to attack with an ICBM, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, our -- look, let's be honest, though. Our missile defenses are not what they ought to be after eight years of Barack Obama slashing the Bush administration's missile defense plan. We don't have what are called layered missile defenses. We don't have the sort of capabilities that were envisioned, where we could try and take out missiles in the boost phase, or the mid-course or in the terminal phase. So I think, really, there's no doubt that if a North Korean missile landed on Guam or God forbid on the continental United States, that we would do what the president said and destroy North Korea. Colin Powell used to call that turning North Korea into a charcoal briquette."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, clearly it's preemptive, but then the question is, is it preemptive based on the fact that we were about to be hit? And that clearly is the issue. But one more question. You mentioned the electric grid. If they were to put an EMP or some kind of nuclear device on a flight in the southern hemisphere, we are vulnerable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Yes. And look, let's be clear. This is an act of war. The fact that it takes out let's just say electrical grids or communication systems-- it may not kill people immediately, but it's still an act of war because the knock-on effect could well be disruption of air traffic control systems, tragedies that happen when electricity goes out. We just simply, in my view, cannot tolerate leaving North Korea with a nuclear weapons capability. And by the way, that's exactly what the president said to the U.N. on Tuesday."

American people are very happy with that, and Trump's numbers are going up. This is where it is heading. This isn't going to work, and I think Tammy is right. It will impact Alabama but help Judge Roy Moore and hurt Luther Strange."

Joining me now with reaction is founder and executive director of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. All right, guys, just a quick question about the president at the rally tonight. He seems to have had a very successful week, Gregg, with the U.N. and done tonight in Alabama. How do you think that's going to impact the election of Luther Strange and his legislative agenda?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR AND ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Look, this is a deeply conservative state, Alabama, and the president is incredibly popular there-- 83 percent approval rating among Republicans. So he may be able to give the momentum for Luther Strange to overcome the diminishing lead by Judge Roy Moore. My problem with Moore is he wasn't fit to sit on the Alabama Supreme Court which makes him not fit to sit in the U.S. Senate. He was twice removed from office, once for defying a federal court order, which you cannot do. No judge can do that. And then he defied the United Supreme Court to U.S. Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage. He seems to think he is above the Supreme Court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "I think that judges are constantly going against precedent or mandates. But I think what's interesting with Roy Moore is he refused to take down the statue of the Ten Commandments. And it seems to me that that would align him with a lot of the Trump followers who are not so much by the letter of the law, although they are law and order, and I understand that, but more on religion and God and country. Charlie, what do you think of this?"

      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "Yes, I agree with what Sheriff David Clarke said earlier in the show. No matter who wins on Tuesday, President Trump is going to win here. Alabama is a deep conservative state. His base remains incredibly strong. But look, the president has had an incredible week. I tweeted out earlier and the president actually responded today to my tweet where I said the speech that the president gave at the U.N. General Assembly was the greatest speech by a modern president on the world stage in my lifetime in the last 30-40 years. If you look at the significance of it, not only did he call out the crazy dictatorships in the Asian perimeter, but he also called out Marxism in Venezuela. He talked about the need to defend your own country's interests on the international stage. He's had a wonderful week and I think things are really starting to look up now that we've entered the fall legislative calendar."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, let's talk about what's going on with free speech week at Berkeley. I'm just fascinated by this.

Jim Comey stepped back, apparently held his hands in front of him and said I hope you'll stay to listen to what I have to say. I just listened to you for five minutes. It turns out they didn't care, and there was no effort made to remove the demonstrators. They invited him to speak and they don't remove the demonstrators."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Howard University should be deeply embarrassed about this. The faculty and the administration just sat there on the stage doing absolutely nothing about the chaos that ensued. Look, college campuses are supposed to be venues for the free exchange of ideas and information. There is a place to when you are a college student listen and learn. But increasingly college students today have nothing but contempt for education."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And Charlie, not just contempt for education but contempt for anyone that they don't agree with to the point where they will disrupt -- there is no respect for authority, for discipline. And what do the colleges do about this? If they won't even have the demonstrators removed, what can be done about these colleges?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "The problem is they glorify these demonstrators. In fact you see administrators all across the country almost lift these demonstrators up and say look at the wonderful courage that it takes. And a lot of the time these are rioters. In this instance they weren't, but you look at Berkeley, they had to bring in the police force this last week when a conservative, Ben Shapiro, came on campus. The bill was $600,000 just to have one conservative speaker come for an hour. And free speech isn't really so free anymore. It's actually quite expensive. But this is exactly what the left wants to do. They want to make it nearly impossible for anyone with an idea from the center-right to come on campus."
