Breaking tonight, a stark warning from Dr. Anthony Fauci to Senators that the United States is going the wrong direction. As coronavirus cases top 2.6 million, Fauci, says he believes new cases could hit 100,000 a day if we don't turn things around in certain states.  Some states are taking action, reclosing bars and beaches ahead of the July 4th holiday weekend. Late this afternoon, the White House coronavirus task force met and offered a more optimistic view. Vice President Mike Pence, saying the country is in a much better place than it was four months ago.  We have \"FOX TEAM COVERAGE\" tonight. Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram looks at the economic recovery from coronavirus.

The statistics coming out of CDC on that are really quite shocking.  Four percent -- less than four percent of the deaths are under the age of 44. Over the age of 65, to give you an idea, 85,000 out of 107,000 deaths. So, as the virus is spreading among our young people, we're seeing milder cases.

Through it -- when it hangs in the air for hours.  Outdoor activities, I can see.

And that one of the ways we can do that is to switch over from this antiquated test we are doing, called a PCR test from the 1990s over to antigen or protein testing which is much more rapid. Bret, when you get a flu test, if you go to your doctor and get a flu test, you're getting a protein antigen test. That's where we need to go.

Meaning, U.S. telecom companies cannot use money from the Universal Service Fund to pay the two Chinese firms for equipment or services. The FCC Chairman cited close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China's military apparatus as reasons for that decision. Secretary of State Pompeo had some harsh words about Iran while speaking to the United Nations Security Council as he encouraged the international body to extend the arms embargo ahead of the October expiration date.  State Department correspondent Rich Edson, looks at the tense global debate.",

First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 45 in Baltimore, where the NAACP announced the plan to move its headquarters south to Washington. The group's president called the change an exceptional opportunity to amplify the voices of black people in the fight for policy and economic changes. FOX 25 in Oklahoma City, where residents are voting on a constitutional amendment to ensure the expansion of Medicaid by passing the Republican- controlled legislature and the governor's office. Idaho, Maine, Nebraska, and Utah have all expanded Medicaid through valid questions. Increasing number of Oklahoma voters took advantage of mail-in voting, and polls are open until 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. So, on the races tonight as well. And this is a live look at Orlando from FOX 35, our affiliate down there. One of the big stories there tonight, a Florida based company wants to fly customers to the edge of space using a hydrogen balloon, the size of a football stadium. Startup firm, Space Perspective, plans to launch from an Alaska location. A ticket will cost about $125,000 for a six-hour journey. I might pass on that one.

Hundreds of Spanish taxi drivers protested today in Madrid against City Hall decisions impacting their business. The honking cars caused traffic issues around the city's most central landmarks for hours. The drivers are calling for limits on the number of pay for ride vehicles amid a slump and demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Germany's defense minister plans to restructure the country's Special Forces unit after numerous allegations of far-right extremism from within the ranks. German media reports one of four combat companies is expected to be disbanded. Legislation has been proposed to allow the military to more swiftly expel soldiers if their presence would seriously threaten the military order. The European Union will reopen its borders to travelers from 14 countries, but most Americans will be refused entry due to soaring coronavirus infections inside the U.S. Travelers from other big countries like Russia, Brazil, and India will also miss out. They're on that list. The list will be updated every 14 days with new countries being added or removed depending on whether they are keeping the pandemic under control in their countries.

In a five- four decision the court ruled in favor love several mothers in Montana who were suing for the right to use scholarship money attached to a tax credit to pay tuition at a Christian school. Now, under the plan, donors to the scholarship program get a tax credit. Those scholarships can then be accessed by low-income parents seeking to put their kids in private schools. But the Montana Department of Revenue issued a regulation banning the scholarships from being used at religious schools. Roberts writing for the majority said this, quote, \"A state need not subsidize private education, but once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private school solely because they are religious.\" The White House praising the result as well, saying this, \"Laws that condition public benefits like need-based academic scholarships on religious status demonstrate state sanctioned hostility to religion.\" Several dissenters, Justice Sotomayor among them, she disagreed, writing in her dissent \"A state's decision not to fund religious activity does not disfavor religion. Rather it represents a valid choice to remain secular in the face of serious establishment and free exercise concerns.\" The National Education Association, the country's largest labor union, blasted today's decision is well, quote, \"An extreme Supreme Court just joined the far right effort to undermine one of our country's most cherished democratic institutions -- public education.\" Supporters of today's decision say the implications could extend far beyond schools to all kinds of partnerships that religious groups have with government entities, and that's exactly what worries the other side.

That's the umbrella organization for pediatricians across the country. I think a lot of people have been focusing on the virus, which is very bad, but not focusing enough on the downside of some of the reactions to the virus. We know so much more now than we knew when this started, and what we are seeing in the cases that come through now is that even the hospitalizations, the hospital directors say the cases are much less acute, requiring much less intervention, much shorter hospital stays than what they saw back in April, and so on. And so as we learn more and as the case fatality rate drops, that should be incorporated into how we talk about this. And we should also be thinking much more about the downsides of some of what has happened. I think it's been a really massive psychological experiment on a large population of people, and quite clearly it has not gone very well. We should particularly care about young people and what has happened to them and what would happen to them if we were to keep them out of schools, particularly when studies show that they are not big transmitters to the virus.",

And I understand that there's gray areas in whatever prescription or recommendations are going to come out, but they want some clarity and some consistency, and it starts at the top.

The other issue is it's become clearer and clearer, Bret that the elderly people are at much more at risk than the young people are. The statistics coming out of CDC on that are really quite shocking. Four percent -- less than four percent of the deaths are under the age of 44. Over the age of 65, to give you an idea, 85,000 out of 107,000 deaths. So, as the virus is spreading among our young people, we're seeing milder cases. But the danger will be that it could spread to the higher risk groups again into the elderly, and we would see then the deaths catch up with it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think we have a graphic that shows the age of deaths as it -- as it stands now as of June 20th. And if you take a look at this, obviously, the numbers overall are disconcerting, but some of these numbers, Doc, are deaths tied to COVID, but there -- the end result according to the CDC, it doesn't -- it's not blaming solely COVID. They didn't had -- they had other underlying conditions, and it's tough to parse out some of those numbers as we look at the breakdown here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "Well, but Bret, here is the thing, as you get older, you have more pre-existing conditions. You're more prone to the inflammation that COVID is now becoming famous for. As you're younger, you're much less likely to have those inflammatory chemicals in your body. Also, young people have less of those receptors. We call ACE2 receptors in their noses. So, when they get the virus, they get much lower loads -- viral loads. Older people get a lot more of the virus in their systems, they have much more proclivity to secondary effects. And therefore, the risk of death is a lot higher."

    {
      "speaker": "SIEGEL",

So, even if the young people at schools are not at risk, those that support them are. So, he's worried about more and more virus in the community we put in at risk whether the schools can reopen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So, you read my mind. That was my question is that that's what struck me today is the concern about schools. Doc, if we can't open schools, you tie that directly to the economy, to the ability of parents who have kids who need to be at school. When are we going to know, do you think, if we can do that in the fall or not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "Right now, we have to do a laser surgical approach to the problem. When Dr. Fauci says we reopen too soon, I would put it a little bit differently, Bret. I think we reopen certain things too soon. Bars should never have been open, indoor restaurants to 50 to 75 percent capacity when the virus spreads through poor ventilation. Through it -- when it hangs in the air for hours. Outdoor activities, I can see. But we needed to -- we need to going forward, emphasized mask-wearing, social distancing, outdoor activities, and across the country, close the bars and anywhere where people are congregating indoors. That will decrease the amount of circulating virus, we still have time. With Secretary Azar, says we're running out of time, we are running out of time. But we still have time. If we can decrease the number of cases, then we can consider reopening schools."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Last thing, quickly, one of the traditional ways that the CDC and health experts go after this is through contact tracing. It doesn't seem like states have enough contact tracers to be able to handle the numbers that we're looking at now inside the U.S."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's a great point, Bret. And not only that. I think we have to go towards what Dr. Fauci was calling pool testing. What does that mean? It's not just contact tracing, because you may not be able to figure out all of the people that somebody came in contact with in the past 24 hours. We need a huge ramp-up of testing right now. And that one of the ways we can do that is to switch over from this antiquated test we are doing, called a PCR test from the 1990s over to antigen or protein testing which is much more rapid. Bret, when you get a flu test, if you go to your doctor and get a flu test, you're getting a protein antigen test. That's where we need to go. If we get antigen testing going, then we can test millions of people at a time rather than hundreds of thousands of people. We need to test everybody in the area of positive cases to really get control over this."

Aimed at some of the actions of anti-government protesters last year, residents can be given life in prison for subversion, terrorism, or collusion with foreign forces. A law -- the law could be tested soon. Pro-democracy politicians say they will defy police bans and demonstrate on July first, the anniversary of the handover from Britain to China. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, announced the end of exports of U.S.-made defense equipment to Hong Kong and says the administration is reviewing additional actions now. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for more sanctions on China. The Federal Communications Commission has named Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE as national security threats. Meaning, U.S. telecom companies cannot use money from the Universal Service Fund to pay the two Chinese firms for equipment or services. The FCC Chairman cited close ties to the Chinese Communist Party and China's military apparatus as reasons for that decision. Secretary of State Pompeo had some harsh words about Iran while speaking to the United Nations Security Council as he encouraged the international body to extend the arms embargo ahead of the October expiration date.

Tomorrow, I will have an exclusive interview with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo right here on SPECIAL REPORT, 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. A lot to talk about with the secretary. Up next, for the first time in nearly three months, Joe Biden answers questions from the media. We'll bring you out on the campaign trail. First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. FOX 45 in Baltimore, where the NAACP announced the plan to move its headquarters south to Washington. The group's president called the change an exceptional opportunity to amplify the voices of black people in the fight for policy and economic changes. FOX 25 in Oklahoma City, where residents are voting on a constitutional amendment to ensure the expansion of Medicaid by passing the Republican- controlled legislature and the governor's office. Idaho, Maine, Nebraska, and Utah have all expanded Medicaid through valid questions. Increasing number of Oklahoma voters took advantage of mail-in voting, and polls are open until 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. So, on the races tonight as well. And this is a live look at Orlando from FOX 35, our affiliate down there. One of the big stories there tonight, a Florida based company wants to fly customers to the edge of space using a hydrogen balloon, the size of a football stadium. Startup firm, Space Perspective, plans to launch from an Alaska location. A ticket will cost about $125,000 for a six-hour journey. I might pass on that one.

Hundreds of Spanish taxi drivers protested today in Madrid against City Hall decisions impacting their business. The honking cars caused traffic issues around the city's most central landmarks for hours. The drivers are calling for limits on the number of pay for ride vehicles amid a slump and demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Germany's defense minister plans to restructure the country's Special Forces unit after numerous allegations of far-right extremism from within the ranks. German media reports one of four combat companies is expected to be disbanded. Legislation has been proposed to allow the military to more swiftly expel soldiers if their presence would seriously threaten the military order. The European Union will reopen its borders to travelers from 14 countries, but most Americans will be refused entry due to soaring coronavirus infections inside the U.S. Travelers from other big countries like Russia, Brazil, and India will also miss out. They're on that list. The list will be updated every 14 days with new countries being added or removed depending on whether they are keeping the pandemic under control in their countries.

In a five- four decision the court ruled in favor love several mothers in Montana who were suing for the right to use scholarship money attached to a tax credit to pay tuition at a Christian school. Now, under the plan, donors to the scholarship program get a tax credit. Those scholarships can then be accessed by low-income parents seeking to put their kids in private schools. But the Montana Department of Revenue issued a regulation banning the scholarships from being used at religious schools. Roberts writing for the majority said this, quote, \"A state need not subsidize private education, but once a state decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private school solely because they are religious.\" The White House praising the result as well, saying this, \"Laws that condition public benefits like need-based academic scholarships on religious status demonstrate state sanctioned hostility to religion.\" Several dissenters, Justice Sotomayor among them, she disagreed, writing in her dissent \"A state's decision not to fund religious activity does not disfavor religion. Rather it represents a valid choice to remain secular in the face of serious establishment and free exercise concerns.\" The National Education Association, the country's largest labor union, blasted today's decision is well, quote, \"An extreme Supreme Court just joined the far right effort to undermine one of our country's most cherished democratic institutions -- public education.\" Supporters of today's decision say the implications could extend far beyond schools to all kinds of partnerships that religious groups have with government entities, and that's exactly what worries the other side. We are still awaiting several critical decisions, and we are in uncharted territory here.

That's the umbrella organization for pediatricians across the country. I think a lot of people have been focusing on the virus, which is very bad, but not focusing enough on the downside of some of the reactions to the virus. We know so much more now than we knew when this started, and what we are seeing in the cases that come through now is that even the hospitalizations, the hospital directors say the cases are much less acute, requiring much less intervention, much shorter hospital stays than what they saw back in April, and so on. And so as we learn more and as the case fatality rate drops, that should be incorporated into how we talk about this. And we should also be thinking much more about the downsides of some of what has happened. I think it's been a really massive psychological experiment on a large population of people, and quite clearly it has not gone very well. We should particularly care about young people and what has happened to them and what would happen to them if we were to keep them out of schools, particularly when studies show that they are not big transmitters to the virus."

CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": I think people are crying out for certainty and consistency and leadership. And I understand that there's gray areas in whatever prescription or recommendations are going to come out, but they want some clarity and some consistency, and it starts at the top. And president Trump really kind of took his eye off the ball a few weeks back, made fun of, or disparaged the idea of wearing masks, didn't wear a mask himself, and lent his support to a kind of more cavalier mood that's out there among some people.

A year ago, about this time last year they were touting how the U.S. has common interests with Russia in Afghanistan. And now we know that neither one of those things are likely to pass."

      "utterance": "This story is coming from the same exact people who are using the exact same tactics that were used to spread the false and damaging Russia collusion hoax. That's where you have intelligence officials illegally leaked to co-conspirators in the media to set a false and damaging political narrative. It's not surprising that Democrats are falling for it or that media people are hyping it, but I think Republican voters are frustrated that Republican leaders are falling for it yet again."

      "utterance": "Finally tonight, a pair of milestones. Mother of three Ruby Scott turned 100 years old over the weekend. Her family wanted to make sure the party was safe as possible so they had a surprise drive-by party at Ruby's home in Oklahoma. She celebrated her special day with a lot of kids and grandkids and great-grandkids. United States Coast Guard veteran Andy Washington celebrated his 100th birthday with friends and family in New Orleans. Washington is a World War II veteran, served in the Coast Guard from 42 to 46. A parade of well- wishers drove by his neighborhood as well. Happy birthday. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the SPECIAL REPORT. Fair, balanced and unafraid.
