      "sentences": "Hi, everybody. Good evening from Washington. I am Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" What a fantastic show we have for you tonight. If I said a really lame show but you have to watch. It will be a great show. Ann Coulter and the 'Angle' on the watershed moment in Hollywood, the worst rated Oscars in history. Do you think the political talk from celebrities had anything to do with that? Plus, the reporter joins us with an exclusive new report on the Russian investigation and what the FBI has been hiding. Plus, we will examine the rush to take guns from people seems a threat or unfit. Dan Bongino debates a Democrat on whether this is the first step on a very slippery slope. Also, nervous Republicans warn President Trump not to start a trade war with tariffs, but he has a bigger warning if other countries don't stop cheating. And Dolly Parton, you don't want to miss this, with some advice for stars, celebrities, and athletes who insist on getting political. Speaking that, the humorless out of touch American left. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Over the weekend, CNN obtained, released and then went apoplectic over comments President Trump made to a group of donors on a Saturday event at Maralago. Now Trump noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping was now going to essentially be president for life and Trump added, I think it's great. Maybe we'll want to give that a shot someday.",

      "sentences": "Totally. No morning jokesters there. CNN's Chris Cilizza saw something even more sinister. Under the headline, this may be the scariest thing Donald Trump has said as president. He wrote, 'Trump has demonstrated his governing theory is largely centered on taking as much as you can until someone stops you. That worldview is what makes Trump's thought on Xi all the more chilling.' Well, it was no more chilling than what he said on Saturday night at the Gridiron dinner. It was a fun, comedic event for the D.C. and business power players. Again, this is humor. The president jokingly referenced possible talks with North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un saying, 'As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine.'  In other words, Trump is a madman. Trying to make fun of himself. So, you know why the left is so agitated by these jokes? Because the president is vexing them at their own game. In the process, he is endearing himself to the public.   I have a question, why should the left be the only group allowed to engage in a little sarcasm, a little comedy and self-deprecating humor? The left doesn't mind at all dishing it out, but the moment the president or any conservative ribs them or themselves, there is immediate blowback. Movie stars, sports celebrities, television actors, they shoot their mouths off on politics and public affairs all the time. It's like reflective. They can't help themselves and we are supposed to react as if Plato had come back to opine on contemporary issues.  Thank you for your commentary. It's so well informed. Look, everybody has the right to speak his or her mind. They are welcome to come on this show any time. But just because you are a celebrity or getting paid million dollars to play a game doesn't mean you get a free pass to offer illogical arguments, avoiding substance and engaging in drive by media attacks. If you do that, you should not be taken seriously. In case you have not heard, I wrote a best-selling book 15 years ago called 'Shut Up and Sing.' I went after leftists such as Barbara Streisand, the Dixie Chicks and a bunch of other celebrities.I routinely call out these elites who feel like they are celebrity in one arena gives them political authority and heightened credibility to speak on all these complex issues of the day.  Last week, we at \"The Ingraham Angle\" caught Barbara Streisand in a little bitty lie. She claimed that the presidential election was rigged and she spoke to, quote, 'senators from Wisconsin and Michigan,' close quote. Well, no one bothered to call up the four senators from those two states, but our producers did. We called both the Wisconsin senators who told us they did not speak to Streisand and said nothing about election fraud. Oops.  Now even former NBA star, Kobe Bryant, a phenomenal basketball player for the Lakers, somehow won an Academy Award at the 'Me Too' Oscars for a small animated film about basketball. That's kind of fun. There is now an online petition with over 16,000 signatures and counting to rescind Bryant's Oscar owing to a rape accusation in 2003. They did not bring chargers. They settled the civil case with her. Kobe was just one of the many awkward Oscar moments that were kind of far from funny. Even repellant to the American public. Host Jimmy Kimmel in his opening monologue referenced this film, 'Call Me By Your Name,' a best picture nominee. The film was about a 24-year-old man who has intimate relations with a 17-year-old boy.",

But instead as we saw last night, they give us like a bizarre political story lines or characters that most Americans can't relate to. Then meanwhile Hollywood ends up attacking a lot of values and ideas that millions upon millions of Americans hold dear.  And then when they are criticized, they cry like infants being weaned, which makes sense, since many of the celebrities are used to feeding off their staff and media enablers. They are not used to criticism. All of this is a big turn off to the audience. They have a lot of options to choose from, don't they? If you want to know why these celebrities are so nasty to the president and so upset when he or any conservative dares to crack a joke, well, I have an answer.  For all of their vitriol, (inaudible) conservatives and the president, you know what he keeps doing? Putting it in a language that everybody understands, he keeps putting points on the board for America, the American worker. Our audience is growing while the Oscar's audience is tanking. Now, that's what I call funny.

If I said a really lame show but you have to watch. It will be a great show. Ann Coulter and the 'Angle' on the watershed moment in Hollywood, the worst rated Oscars in history. Do you think the political talk from celebrities had anything to do with that? Plus, the reporter joins us with an exclusive new report on the Russian investigation and what the FBI has been hiding. Plus, we will examine the rush to take guns from people seems a threat or unfit. Dan Bongino debates a Democrat on whether this is the first step on a very slippery slope. Also, nervous Republicans warn President Trump not to start a trade war with tariffs, but he has a bigger warning if other countries don't stop cheating. And Dolly Parton, you don't want to miss this, with some advice for stars, celebrities, and athletes who insist on getting political. Speaking that, the humorless out of touch American left. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Over the weekend, CNN obtained, released and then went apoplectic over comments President Trump made to a group of donors on a Saturday event at Maralago. Now Trump noted that Chinese President Xi Jinping was now going to essentially be president for life and Trump added, I think it's great. Maybe we'll want to give that a shot someday."

      "utterance": "Totally. No morning jokesters there. CNN's Chris Cilizza saw something even more sinister. Under the headline, this may be the scariest thing Donald Trump has said as president. He wrote, 'Trump has demonstrated his governing theory is largely centered on taking as much as you can until someone stops you. That worldview is what makes Trump's thought on Xi all the more chilling.' Well, it was no more chilling than what he said on Saturday night at the Gridiron dinner. It was a fun, comedic event for the D.C. and business power players. Again, this is humor. The president jokingly referenced possible talks with North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un saying, 'As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine.' In other words, Trump is a madman. Trying to make fun of himself. So, you know why the left is so agitated by these jokes? Because the president is vexing them at their own game. In the process, he is endearing himself to the public. I have a question, why should the left be the only group allowed to engage in a little sarcasm, a little comedy and self-deprecating humor? The left doesn't mind at all dishing it out, but the moment the president or any conservative ribs them or themselves, there is immediate blowback. Movie stars, sports celebrities, television actors, they shoot their mouths off on politics and public affairs all the time. It's like reflective. They can't help themselves and we are supposed to react as if Plato had come back to opine on contemporary issues. Thank you for your commentary. It's so well informed. Look, everybody has the right to speak his or her mind. They are welcome to come on this show any time. But just because you are a celebrity or getting paid million dollars to play a game doesn't mean you get a free pass to offer illogical arguments, avoiding substance and engaging in drive by media attacks. If you do that, you should not be taken seriously. In case you have not heard, I wrote a best-selling book 15 years ago called 'Shut Up and Sing.' I went after leftists such as Barbara Streisand, the Dixie Chicks and a bunch of other celebrities.I routinely call out these elites who feel like they are celebrity in one arena gives them political authority and heightened credibility to speak on all these complex issues of the day. Last week, we at \"The Ingraham Angle\" caught Barbara Streisand in a little bitty lie. She claimed that the presidential election was rigged and she spoke to, quote, 'senators from Wisconsin and Michigan,' close quote. Well, no one bothered to call up the four senators from those two states, but our producers did. We called both the Wisconsin senators who told us they did not speak to Streisand and said nothing about election fraud. Oops. Now even former NBA star, Kobe Bryant, a phenomenal basketball player for the Lakers, somehow won an Academy Award at the 'Me Too' Oscars for a small animated film about basketball. That's kind of fun. There is now an online petition with over 16,000 signatures and counting to rescind Bryant's Oscar owing to a rape accusation in 2003. They did not bring chargers. They settled the civil case with her. Kobe was just one of the many awkward Oscar moments that were kind of far from funny. Even repellant to the American public. Host Jimmy Kimmel in his opening monologue referenced this film, 'Call Me By Your Name,' a best picture nominee. The film was about a 24-year-old man who has intimate relations with a 17-year-old boy."

That's why they get paid a lot of money and good on them if they do get paid a lot of money, they are good at it. They entertain us. But instead as we saw last night, they give us like a bizarre political story lines or characters that most Americans can't relate to. Then meanwhile Hollywood ends up attacking a lot of values and ideas that millions upon millions of Americans hold dear. And then when they are criticized, they cry like infants being weaned, which makes sense, since many of the celebrities are used to feeding off their staff and media enablers. They are not used to criticism. All of this is a big turn off to the audience. They have a lot of options to choose from, don't they? If you want to know why these celebrities are so nasty to the president and so upset when he or any conservative dares to crack a joke, well, I have an answer. For all of their vitriol, (inaudible) conservatives and the president, you know what he keeps doing? Putting it in a language that everybody understands, he keeps putting points on the board for America, the American worker. Our audience is growing while the Oscar's audience is tanking. Now, that's what I call funny. That's the \"Angle.\" Joining us for reaction in West Palm Beach, Florida is best-selling author, Ann Coulter, and in New York, Cathy Areu, a publisher of Catalina magazine.

I think when these actors and celebrities just marinate themselves in politics, you can watch us or other networks for that. Ann, I know you were glued to your television set last night.

One thing that was funny, this was supposed to be the big 'Me Too' Oscars, but it very quickly went off the rails. All of these women who were raped and pawed and had their careers destroyed like (inaudible). She's a real hero. That was pushed aside so we can talk about transgenders and illegals and immigrants. We got inter-sexuality in there. You are giving most celebrities fantastic advice. They can take it from people like us. I had a famous actor made fun at me. Sneering at me because people come up to me on the street, and you know, saying mean things to me and I said everybody says nice things to you. They are talking about your character. At least when people love me, it's really me they love. All three of us -- I don't know you, Cathy but you are in politics. If you are in politics, half of the country will hate you. There's nothing you can do about it. But if you are a skater like someone I used to love Lindsey Vonn, I was so happy when she lost.

We can be cinematographers, directors. Look at all these roles, look at what we can do, and they have the women stand up and they explained each role that women played behind the cameras.

I am really confused because I thought we were supposed to get away from gender and race and sexual -- Everyone is the same and now everybody is not the same. We have to bean count in every profession. Heaven forbid if you are a white male and you are a cinematographer because you must have screwed someone over to get your job. I'm sorry to be harsh. I think if you're a white male in Hollywood, you probably have a target on your back. Given the atmosphere out there which I think sometimes doesn't give due process to people. Poor Ryan Seacrest. He was the persona non-grata last night after he was cleared, as far as I can tell, of any wrongdoing in any case, but now nobody will go up to him like he's a leopard? What is that all about?"

I like to contrast it with Del Toro's talking about having a borderless world.

Let's debate some of the questionable aspects of red-flag laws with Democratic strategist and radio host, Chris Hahn, and former Secret Service agent and NRA television contributor, Dan Bongino. All right, Gentlemen, let's look at this constitutionality of all of this. It sounds good to have these red flags. When you hear red flag, Nikolas Cruz. He was an individual who should have never been allowed to buy a gun. He came to school with bullets in his backpack and making threats against individuals, but nevertheless he slipped through the cracks to buy these guns. Dan, what is wrong with a so-called red flag law or initiative?"

Also, if you are already a prohibited possessed or if you've been mentally adjudicated to be unfit or if you've been committed involuntarily. The problem here is what do you do with a guy who has, you know, say maybe obsessive-compulsive disorder, maybe he has some kind of an irrational phobia or maybe he has a mood disorder and he is a little depressed. But an otherwise law-abiding citizen who's done nothing wrong, what do you do with that person? Are his constitutional rights now open for debate? One last thing on this, Laura. You know, I get it. There is a lot of emotion as there should be wrapped up in this horrific tragedy in Parkland. But let's be clear on this, a very small portion of people who are mentally ill become violent later on. I think it's very unfair to a very sick portion of the population who has done nothing wrong to have their constitutional rights thrown out the window."

In some ways that's very -- that sounds really good, but you can see depending on where the authorities are politically, it could be -- Janet Napolitano said in 2009 returning veterans could be a problem. Single issue voters could be a problem. I know it sounds like a slippery slope argument, but you could see why the ACLU even has a problem with expanding the definition of red flag."

You have a judicial oversight of the order. The person can come back and challenge it within a certain period of time. I think that might go a long way to solving the problem with people like the shooter in Parkland. There were warning signs. People were complaining and if they had a process by which they could participate and take that gun away from him, that probably would have saved lives. If he was not deemed by a court to warrant the guns being taken away, he could petition and get those guns back."

Why didn't the bureau tell them that the guy who triggered the Russian investigation actually had a multi-million dollars connection to the Clinton Foundation? Reporter Alison Spann has been investigating Australian diplomat Alexander Downer. She now joins us to discuss her article just published in The Hill tonight. Alison, great to see you."

    {
      "speaker": "SPANN",
      "utterance": "So if you remember, in the summer of 2016 Alexander Downer was the one who came out with his evidence about George Papadopoulos. He said he had a drink with him in a London bar and Papadopoulos revealed to him that he knew that Russia had some dirt on Hillary or might have some damaging emails to her. So he's the one who actually gave that information to his government, gave it to the U.S. government and that launched the whole Russian probe into Trump's Russian collusion. Now we found out that Alexander Downer has a tie to the Clinton Foundation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "A tie? He is in a bar in London. He runs into Papadopoulos. The circumstances around how he ran into him are interesting. You address that slightly in your piece. Fast forward two months after he sees him in that bar, Australia brings this to the FBI. It took two months. That's kind of interesting. But then you find out that Downer's connection to the Clinton Foundation is?"

      "speaker": "SPANN",

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's great. AIDS prevention, what could be wrong with that. So $25 million foreign money from Australia goes to the Clinton Foundation. Now, is there any question about how that money was used or whether it was fraudulently attained?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPANN",
      "utterance": "So there was an audit that was conducted three years later and it just wanted to basically go through and see what that project had achieved. They did achieve some great things as far as getting those children the anti-retroviral drugs they needed and might not otherwise have been given a chance to get. But there were some questions about the money in that case and whether it was handled properly. And in fact the report goes on to say that it was so mishandled it was actually detrimental to the project, and they were given a score of two out of six for handling the money."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Two out of six, great. That's typical Clintons, two out of six. That's actually a high mark for them in handling finances or ethics. I just want to read this. This is from the Clinton Foundation audit. Some management weaknesses were noted with human resource management, the absence of readily available and useful budget information showing exactly how funds were spent and project monitoring. So that's not a resounding plus. But the more important this is why was wasn't this revealed? That's a big grant that's a connection to the opposition candidate to Donald Trump. He happens to be in this bar. He happens to meet this Papadopoulos guy, he happens to funnel the information. And he is not a minor figure. He is a well-known liberal politician in Australia who is buddies with the Clintons."

      "speaker": "SPANN",
      "utterance": "And there are actually four pieces of information that it revealed. The dossier was funded by the DNC and Clinton. Sydney Blumenthal who was a close Clinton supporter was funneling information to Christopher Steele through the State Department. And then you had the 'Yahoo!' article that was quoted and the FISA application was written by Michael Isikoff who got his information from Christopher Steele. And then now we have this connection between Alexander Downer and the Clintons."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "President Trump is not backing down. He's defending his plan to raise tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, even as he takes heavy flak from his own party. A spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement we are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and we're urging the White House to not advance with this plan. He didn't say it in that tone, but I did. Trump responded by telling reporters, not backing down. Joining us now with reaction is Bryan Riley. He's the director of the Free Trade Initiative at the National Taxpayers Union, and Gordon Chang who has written extensively on foreign affairs including trade. It's great to see both of you. I want to play just to reset things for a moment. I want to play a flashback from just a few years ago from some of the so-called experts on what trade would do to free up and maybe improve things in China. Let's watch."

And this is about whether Americans should have the freedom to decide how to spend their own money. Should the government decide well, no, you have to pay a 25 percent tax, that's all a tariff is is a tax. So if you are making aluminum boats, if you're making air- conditioners, if you're making cars, if you're making aircraft, this is a tax on you. It's going to get passed along to the American consumers and it will cost us billions."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "The Defense Department said we have plenty of steel, we have plenty of aluminum. We have suppliers among our allies including Canada. I think the real national security question is if we drive up the price of steel and drive up the price of aluminum, we are hurting ourselves. We are creating tension with our allies unnecessarily. That puts us in a worst situation with respect to China, not a better situation."

      "speaker": "GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR OF 'NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN'",
      "utterance": "First of all, these tariffs are imposed under the section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962. This is a national security provision. And the reason why the tariffs are set at the levels that President Trump announced is so that these industries can become self-sustaining. So if we are in a war of any duration, we will be able to make steel, we will be able to make aluminum. And by the way, this is not just some theoretical concern because that this point the United States doesn't make certain types of steel and aluminum that go into our weapons. So although there are a lot of trade concerns that Bryan is talking about, I can understand that, but this is a national security issue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Guys, I think it was 15 years ago we had 18 of the top 25 steel makers in the world. Today I looked at the list compiled in 2016, mind you, two years old now, but I believe we have two of the top 25. China has 10. China in 2000 produced about 11 percent to 15 percent of steel. Now they produce 46.8 percent of steel in the world. It's a communist country. They repress people. They suppress human rights. They cheat, they steal, they take our intellectual property. They really try and will effort domination not only of their hemisphere but of our hemisphere. And I think back on the experts, Bryan, and what they've said about China in the years past, the same people we are supposed to listen to today. Here are some of the headlines in the last month. 'Foreign Affairs,' 'The China Reckoning, How Beijing Defied American Expectations. 'Washington Post,' We Got China Wrong. Now what?' 'The Economist,' 'How the West Got China Wrong.' All the experts."

This is a backtrack on what President Trump has done to make us more competitive."
