      "sentences": "Let's bring in our panel, FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com and host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio. You heard it there, the national gas price average now as of today is $4.07. And you can is see that how that has gone up from one month, one year ago. Quinnipiac had a poll out tonight, Brit, that says support a ban on Russian oil if it meant higher gas prices in the U.S., look at this, 71 percent from this new poll out today. And steps the Biden administration has taken to punish Russia for invasion, too tough, three percent, not tough enough 56 percent, about right 30 percent. What about that and where the administration is on this issue?",

We'll have to do it. But let's make no mistake about it, we import on a grand scale, on the bigger scheme of things, very little Russian oil, and it's not going to change anything very much. They could sell it elsewhere and somebody would sell the same amount of oil to us. So it might create some short-term supply disruptions or shipment disruptions, but it's not going to make any real difference.  What would make a real difference in the midterm and long term would be more energy of all kinds produced in the United States. And Jen Psaki, who is clever, has lot of glib answers about why that is not happening and how we are doing as much or how it wouldn't make any difference if we did a little more, or whatever. But the one thing you will not hear her say is that this administration is doing everything it can to increase America's energy production. And until you hear her say that, we'll know they are not doing it. And if we did, it could make a difference not only to us, but to our allies who could use energy exporting from here.",
