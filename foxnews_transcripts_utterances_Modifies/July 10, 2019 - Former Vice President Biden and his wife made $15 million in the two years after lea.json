Try this one, the chairman of the Federal Reserve had a busy news day, because, while the labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, was defending the handling of the Epstein case, Fed Chief Jerome Powell was moving markets, arguing maybe a rate-cutting case. And that won out for the guys who trade stocks.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  Well, stocks moving up, as the Fed chief signals rates could be coming down, and maybe soon. The S&P 500 crossing 3000 for the first time ever, as the Dow and Nasdaq were also hitting records. They ended up coming back a little bit, but impressive nevertheless.  We're all over the implications of all the above with FOX Business' Susan Li on what got the Street cheering, and Kevin Corke at the White House on a Fed chief who, well, just might be blinking -- Kevin.",

But if this is actually the beginning of a cutting cycle, that means the Fed is seeing an economy that is slowing down enough that we should be concerned about markets.

If, in fact, the trade tensions slow the economy down enough into the second half of this year, and the Fed has to cut more than once, we're at a different place.

I said look out in the Gulf this week because of this feature. It did not originate in the Tropics. It came down across the Ohio Valley. But this is a way Alicia developed, for instance, back in 1983, and that developed to a Category 3 hurricane. I don't think this will get that strong. But I think there's a real big problem here indirectly caused by the very cold winter in the Northern Plains and the late spring and all the snowmelt and heavy precipitation, because the Mississippi River is higher at New Orleans, much higher, than it usually is. You start piling a lot of rain in there, and it's not so much the river floods because of what's going on around New Orleans. It's all the stuff coming down streams.

So I would say that, going back to Lyndon Johnson, who wasn't crazy about how things went, or George Bush I, who thought he lost the election because of the Fed, there's been plenty of antagonism between presidents and the head of the Fed. It's just usually more behind closed doors. And now that we all know about this, it becomes more of a story. So, in a real sense, this is just more drama, necessarily, because we know about it than historically has been out there."

That seems to be the consensus. Do you agree with that?"

    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly, I agree that that is the consensus. I just don't agree that that necessarily should be the given. I think the Fed is ready to cut rates, if that's the appropriate thing to do. They pointed towards the things that would cause that, right, so a global economic slowdown, trade tensions, certainly part of that, a natural slowdown in the U.S. economy in the second quarter vs. the first quarter."

We get three jobless claims numbers, housing starts, industrial production, capacity, utilization. So there could be enough data that says, you know what, we haven't slowed down enough. We're ready to cut, but we're going to put it off for another meeting. And I think the market is going to be offsides on that. I'm not saying that's happening, but instead of saying there's 100 percent chance that the Fed is going to cut on July 31, I would rather think of this as being more 50/50 or maybe 75/25. There's never a 100 percent chance the Fed is going to do anything. And I certainly think the market is a little offsides on that."

You know, Art, one other thing I wanted to get your sense of is this idea that normally when you cut rates, well, people welcome it, it's tonics to the markets, I get that, normally, normally, it can lead to a sell-off in the markets because they're -- OK, here comes the slowdown, we got things to worry about. So not all the time is it just a big victory for the markets. Do you worry that if rates were cut, the very thing the president wants to see doesn't happen, the opposite?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Right. And that is such a good point, Neil. When you think about the Fed having to go into a cutting cycle or an easing cycle, or even cutting rates one time, it's OK to call this insurance and say, hey, listen, we're a little on the top of normal and we need to pull back, December was probably a bridge too far. But if this is actually the beginning of a cutting cycle, that means the Fed is seeing an economy that is slowing down enough that we should be concerned about markets. And I think careful what you wish for here. If, in fact, the trade tensions slow the economy down enough into the second half of this year, and the Fed has to cut more than once, we're at a different place. And that's not a good place for the market. It's certainly not where the president wants to be heading into an election cycle."

      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, the supply of housing for millennials that are just entering in the market is too small or too expensive, regardless of the affordability of rates. That's been the problem. The lower rates have helped the re-fi markets. And the re-fi markets are probably at saturation now. There's not that many more people that can re- fi, but it's just that supply. And, unfortunately, we have to get the homebuilders to a place where they're actually building things for the new growth in the market, which is the younger entrants into the housing market. So household formation has been picking up, but right now they're renters. And we would love to see that supply come online, where it's you and I leaving our houses because we're deciding to downsize and having that starter home for that population that's starting to come into the market. I think it's going to adjust itself. It's just going to take a while."

Ann, I don't think it's a mystery that he was -- got rich over the last couple of years. A lot of politicians do when they leave.

I mean, are you going to just protest and after your family, your friends, 50 million people that voted for Trump, and just not even talk to them anymore?

He's going to give away 80 percent of the rest of his $5 billion net worth, or so he says. So he departed from the company 15 years ago. So all this boycott is really doing is punishing the workers and the stakeholders of Home Depot. And Home Depot has made more than 3,000 employees and shareholders multimillionaires. This isn't touching markets. It's just touching hardworking Americans across the country. And if we're going to talk about boycotts' efficacy, then let's just look at Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A used to be the seventh largest food chain in the country. Now it's third. So, I mean, I'm sure this is a great own to Trump, obviously."

Keep in mind that the target of her wrath, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has more or less acknowledged, yes, it's kind of complicated, but we're dealing with it. RealClearPolitics' Phil Wegmann. Nothing complicated about Phil. There's clearly something that's amiss here. And the fact that Nancy Pelosi is trying to gloss it over, saying there's no big deal here, and now you have Cortez saying there is a something here, but it is what it is. What do you make it?"

That was essentially Speaker Pelosi's argument when she made those remarks earlier on. And it comes at a moment when Democratic leadership, they don't want to be mediating these disputes between progressives and then some of the more moderate members of their caucus. Instead, they really want to be focusing their fire on Donald Trump ahead of 2020. They see this sort of thing, all of the tweets, as a distraction."

There's definitely bad blood there. And there's definitely friction on the part of the Democratic leadership in the House, why weren't you with us on this legislation, this $4.6 billion border funding measure, that would have addressed the very things that you wanted addressed, these kids who are suffering there?"

She's pushing the party to the left at a moment when we see that the Democratic electorate, they don't want to go in that direction. This is most obvious by the fact that Joe Biden, a moderate, for the moment, he's the front-runner, and he is very much different.

      "utterance": "Well, I think this thing is a candidate for what we call rapid feedback, where the system starts organizing, and like a skater pulling in its arms, gets -- accelerates quicker and quicker and quicker. The conditions have been ripe in the Gulf of Mexico. In fact, I was on the business side with you last week, Neil, when we were talking about earthquakes. I said look out in the Gulf this week because of this feature. It did not originate in the Tropics. It came down across the Ohio Valley. But this is a way Alicia developed, for instance, back in 1983, and that developed to a Category 3 hurricane. I don't think this will get that strong. But I think there's a real big problem here indirectly caused by the very cold winter in the Northern Plains and the late spring and all the snowmelt and heavy precipitation, because the Mississippi River is higher at New Orleans, much higher, than it usually is. You start piling a lot of rain in there, and it's not so much the river floods because of what's going on around New Orleans. It's all the stuff coming down streams. But if you get a lot of rain there, Neil, and strong south-to-southeast winds because the hurricane passes close enough to them on Saturday, it's going to be a real problem. They're already having some problems there now."

      "speaker": "BASTARDI",
      "utterance": "Well, actually, Neil, again, our WeatherBELL forecast said to look for less than normal activity in the deep Tropics. We put this out in April, but in close development, scattershot and close development. It's a real pain-in-the-neck year, because the Gulf of Mexico is warm, the Western Atlantic's warm, and even though the deep Tropics are less than -- less than ideal, near the U.S. coast again, these rapid feedback features are a big worry. And you may be seeing a precursor to the season."

      "speaker": "BASTARDI",
      "utterance": "Well I think that this will get to a hurricane. It could get to a Category 2 hurricane. An extreme example, genre of this storm was Alicia, Category 3. But I think this will go to 1 or 2, probably make landfall Saturday near Vermilion Bay, Louisiana, and then come northward, and rather slowly, so that Baton Rouge, New Orleans, area, Lafayette, and those places in there are much more prone to having a bad storm than let's say Beaumont, Port Arthur and Houston. I think Houston is in pretty good shape with this one."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BASTARDI",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, we think further north, relative to averages, further north and in close, there's more activity. You take -- look at Bob in 1991, developed in the Bahamas and came up and hit New England as a Category 2 storm, or Belle in 76. And the thing is that, a lot of these years, the waves are relatively weak in the Atlantic, but, as they can get further north, they can develop."
