Fox News is reporting that the Durham probe into the origins of the Russia witch hunt is a criminal investigation. That means U.S. Attorney General John Durham now has the power to subpoena, convene a grand jury, and file criminal charges.  Keep in mind, according to a report from \"The Washington Examiner,\" four notorious deep state figures are wrapped up in the investigation, including Obama's CIA chief John Brennan, Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, fired FBI special agent Peter Strzok, and the author of Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier, Christopher Steele.  Last night, one of the potential subjects of the investigation who now works at CNN seems awfully nervous. Watch this.",

This is very important. It didn't just shift from an administrative review for no reason. I think this is important for our viewers to understand. It shifted to a criminal probe because John Durham, a very well-respected prosecutor actually on both sides of the aisle, has actually come across evidence that he believes is criminal. And this is the reason why it shifted. We know that William Barr, we know that John Durham have traveled overseas, there have been reports about his interactions with Italian intelligence. And, remember, the Italian intelligence is important because that deals with Joseph Mifsud, the professor that attempted to basically lure George Papadopoulos with this idea that the Russians had these emails on Hillary Clinton.  And now he has given testimony, basically they were able to hear a recording in Italy in a very close room, nobody allowed in there, where Joseph Mifsud apparently explained why his life is in danger and why he needs constant security. There is also information that he was working for Western intelligence and this is what wraps up John Brennan, as well as others like James Clapper into this mess.   That is why they have been really running scared for months now, because they know it's -- the heat is not on impeachment. The heat is actually on them.",

Hypocrisy is endemic in Washington.  But I guarantee you this. It's full employment in Washington right now for criminal defense attorneys, the swamp creatures scrambled to retain lawyers.

So absolutely 100 percent of the Inspector General Atkinson needs to investigate it.

And so, she is trying to shield her vulnerable members because they can't go back home right now, and talk about what they've done. They are the party of impeachment and that's all they have to show. In fact, they have more subpoenas that this House has issued under Pelosi then bills that have gotten signed into law under Pelosi's. I mean, you think about that. More subpoenas than bill signed into law by Pelosi's House -- such a failure of leadership. And so, all they want to do is badger the president. They've investigated him for over two years with the Mueller investigation. They thought that was going to be their ticket. And I turned out there was nothing that was charged. Mueller had full authority whether it was for collusion, for obstruction, none of that happen. And, in fact, it was Schiff leading the charge saying that he had more than substantial evidence of collusion, or, you know, of any kind of collusion with Russia and it never existed. And so, instead of moving on, they're going behind closed doors trying to fabricate a story when, in fact, you look at what Durham and Horowitz are doing, they've actually found some real alarming things that broke the law, and so, it rose to the level of actually convening a grand jury.

But I've got to tell you, what you've heard from others, Nancy Pelosi changed the rules in January of 2019 on how this actually works.

We're still investigating how this is related to all the other breaking deep state news this week. And a new you bombshell court-filing in the Michael Flynn case lays out an even more evidence of the deep state's abuse of power against the former national security advisor. As Flynn attorney Sidney Powell alleges, the FBI's Lisa Page and Peter Strzok actually manipulated the original Flynn 302 to make it appear more damning as it related to Flynn's answers about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Now, Powell also references a purported conversation between former DNI Director James Clapper and a \"Washington Post\" reporter where Clapper allegedly instructs him to take the kill shot on Flynn, a claim that Clapper denies. Joining me now with reaction to these big developments is the attorney for Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell. Sidney, thank you so much. I want to go back to that point which is made here, because in your filing, to say that somebody is taking a \"kill shot\" is dramatic. In the filing, it says the defense has requested the phone records of James Clapper to confirm his contact with \"Washington Post\" reporter Ignatius, especially on January 10th, 2017, when Clapper told Ignatius, in words to the effect of \"take the kill shot on Flynn\".

They exonerated him completely of being an agent of Russia by the end of January.  And yet, Mr. Comey still runs to the White House on February 14th and conjures up the entire obstruction of justice narrative against the president when Flynn has been cleared of everything long before that. We also have information that these agents did manipulate the 302. You know, it was long and in a, quote, deliberate state, as they called it, which is highly unusual in and of itself. We attached as exhibit 11 to our document, a comparison of the February 10th and February 11th 302 that show the addition of substantial additional claims that were not in there before and not supported by the notes which we also attached as exhibits to the document. So people can go to the actual document and read it and see a lot for themselves. It's extremely concerning. It's outrageous government misconduct. The agents deliberately calculated and met to plan and strategize how to ambush interview General Flynn without letting him know he was officially under any kind of criminal investigation, to keep him relaxed, and they wanted to be seen as allies when in fact they knew exactly what he had said in these conversations, and they intended to create a situation in which anything he said could be used against him later as a false statement without any warnings to that effect whatsoever.",

That was helpful. And Weissmann asked them, hey, go back to Cyprus and ask them to make sure that they've given us all the information we need. So, you have the \"A.P.\" going in, giving the Justice Department information to target Manafort -- mainly to get Trump, obviously. The \"A.P.\" reporters, according to this FBI memo of the meeting with Weissmann, are pushing, hey, can there be a FARA, a Foreign Agents Registration Act prosecution? Can there be a false statement prosecution? Can you tell me whether it can be enforced? They are pushing charges on this American citizen. On what planet do -- is it ethical for journalists to do this? And then Weissmann sending the journalists assigning them to contact a foreign government to get up dirt on the President's former campaign manager. That was just a few days before Mueller was appointed. And of course, Weissmann was in charge of the Manafort prosecution after that.  After listening to Sidney, after seeing what I've seen happened with the Manafort abuses, the President should look at seriously pardoning all of these folks caught up in Mueller's web and the deep state web and the Obama web, you name it. Because the abuses of power, the prosecutorial abuses are legion, and if I were Attorney General Barr in the least, he should be freezing the Flynn prosecution and investigating what went on there.",

The problem with the swamp is something that's incredibly serious, which is even when Republicans win the Presidency, the left controls the city. They control all the white buildings, they control all the agencies because the places where the government - the federal government recruits from are very blue areas, Northern Virginia, Washington, and Washington, D.C. And I think about Paul Manafort. I met today with somebody who's known that family a long time. And when you think about the people like Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort who dare to associate themselves with Donald Trump, who considered way over the line because he was actually going to come in here like Wreck-It Ralph and really take it to the swamp and take it to the way things are done in Washington. And you know the - that's why they paid this price. They paid this price. If Mike Flynn had just gone on to retirement and Paul Manafort had never come back into politics, both of them would be having a wonderful retirement. But they had the audacity to help Donald Trump. And that was unforgivable to the deep state, to the swamp, and to these disgusting actors in the Obama administration. And finally, I'd just like - we have to keep saying it, Jason, which is - this all happened under Barack Obama. I believe Barack Obama knew exactly the wrongdoing or at least new - in a broad sense, the wrongdoing that took place to try to stop Trump as a candidate and then as a new President.

The 56-year-old actress paid $15,000 to rig her daughter's SAT score, and now she will go on to serve one year probation and perform 250 hours of community service. Before being sentenced, Huffman apologized saying she was deeply ashamed of her behavior and had betrayed her daughters and husband. As for the other actress caught up in the cheating scandal, Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, they've decided to fight the charges that they cheated both of their daughters into the University of Southern California. That included getting their daughters admitted as athletes for a sport they never played. Now, based on other sentences being handed down, it appears that if Loughlin and her husband decide to plead guilty, they'd be looking at roughly two to three months in prison, a lot less time than they probably thought they might get.

Fox News is reporting that the Durham probe into the origins of the Russia witch hunt is a criminal investigation. That means U.S. Attorney General John Durham now has the power to subpoena, convene a grand jury, and file criminal charges. Keep in mind, according to a report from \"The Washington Examiner,\" four notorious deep state figures are wrapped up in the investigation, including Obama's CIA chief John Brennan, Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, fired FBI special agent Peter Strzok, and the author of Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier, Christopher Steele. Last night, one of the potential subjects of the investigation who now works at CNN seems awfully nervous. Watch this."

And James Clapper is not the only deep state official who should be anxious this evening. Several top lawmakers in the Senate are now calling on the intel inspector general to investigate leaks described in a 2016 text from Peter Strzok. Joining us with more is the author of the definitive book, you really need to take a look at this one, a new book \"Witch Hunt,\" FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, along with FOX News contributor Sara Carter, who is joining us in Washington, D.C. Sara, let's start with you. This is another step, Durham is a serious investigator. He's been making in-roads. We know he's upped the number of people on his staff, but to have it be a criminal probe gives him additional powers."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It does give him additional powers, Jason. Think about this. Now that it's a criminal probe, he can impanel a grand jury. He can subpoena witnesses, he can subpoena documents. This is very important. It didn't just shift from an administrative review for no reason. I think this is important for our viewers to understand. It shifted to a criminal probe because John Durham, a very well-respected prosecutor actually on both sides of the aisle, has actually come across evidence that he believes is criminal. And this is the reason why it shifted. We know that William Barr, we know that John Durham have traveled overseas, there have been reports about his interactions with Italian intelligence. And, remember, the Italian intelligence is important because that deals with Joseph Mifsud, the professor that attempted to basically lure George Papadopoulos with this idea that the Russians had these emails on Hillary Clinton. And now he has given testimony, basically they were able to hear a recording in Italy in a very close room, nobody allowed in there, where Joseph Mifsud apparently explained why his life is in danger and why he needs constant security. There is also information that he was working for Western intelligence and this is what wraps up John Brennan, as well as others like James Clapper into this mess. That is why they have been really running scared for months now, because they know it's -- the heat is not on impeachment. The heat is actually on them."

And on top of Clapper trying to deflect blame, you've got all of these other anti-Trump lawyers, legal analysts who say that this is shocking that the Trump administration's Department of Justice would investigate political opponents from the other administration, the Obama administration -- completely ignoring hypocritically that it was the Obama administration's Department of Justice that launched the investigation of an opposing party candidate Donald Trump. Hypocrisy is endemic in Washington. But I guarantee you this. It's full employment in Washington right now for criminal defense attorneys, the swamp creatures scrambled to retain lawyers. These guys, and you put their pictures up there, there were other ones, these are people who, you know, didn't get a wink of sleep last night. They are probably popping a valium like candy. They are in deep trouble."

I think we have the quote here, but there was this text message from Peter Strzok, this is to Lisa Page. Think our sisters have been leaking like mad. Scorned and worried, and political, they are kicking into overdrive. This is a very ominous text message captured I believe originally by the inspector general, but it is out there now. The senators have asked for the inspector general to look into this. They haven't had any response from them. But the renewing this call now, where do you think this is leading, Sarah?"

      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "They absolutely need to, Jason, because when you think about this, this is dealing with the actually the I.C. inspector general, Michael Atkinson, and they want him to investigate these leaks. Now, Peter Strzok is in this text message, it refers to sisters. More than likely what he's referring to is the CIA. That's how the FBI sees the CIA, as their sister agency. So, if it is the CIA, then what Peter Strzok is saying and Lisa Page is that they are kicking and screaming and leaking information. So absolutely 100 percent of the Inspector General Atkinson needs to investigate it. And I think that's why Senator Grassley and the other senators are so upset, because there were a number of leaks of highly classified information that have never actually been investigated, one of them being Michael Flynn and his actual transcript, the conversation with former Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. This is something they need to look into. This is criminal in nature. And Michael Atkinson so far has not made any statement, has not given any information, exactly the opposite of Inspector General Michael Horowitz."

And this is one of the most sinister and scary things about this, is that our own government officials are using the power of leaking to the media to drive a political narrative against a newly elected -- at this point a newly elected president. But I'm glad Senators Johnson and Grassley are on this. But this really is one of the scariest parts of what this deep state has been doing, Gregg."

And, you know, of course, McCabe was fired for lying about leaks. Here you've got Peter Strzok. That's -- you know, that's actually in my book and the other leaks. And, of course, the most prolific leaker and damaging leaguer of all was James Comey, who stole all government documents and leaked them to the media in order to damage Trump and trigger the appointment of his longtime friend, ally, and mentor Bob Mueller who was actually appointed not based on facts, evidence in law, but in an act of vengeance, as I recount in my book, by Rod Rosenstein. And when Rosenstein did it that very day, he was confronted about his abuse of power in violation regulations. He cowers behind his desk and blabbers, am I going to get fired? Which is consciousness of guilt. He knew what he had done was a violation of regulation."

Now, let's keep in mind, the inspector general has a ready-made referrals to the Department of Justice on the director, the deputy director, and the deputy assistant director. In the deputy assistant director's case, it was about leaking and here we go again, those senators need to get the answers of those questions again. I think you both for joining us. Breaking news tonight, Andrew McCabe tonight has dropped his wrongful employment termination lawsuit against the Department of Justice. We'll have more on that in our next block. But tonight, the Durham probe is not the only investigation we're tracking. The Horowitz report into FISA abuse is finished. And according to the inspector general, it'll be released to the public with only minor redactions. Folks, that is brand-new news. We had not heard that before. We thought exactly the opposite was going to happen. We thought there would be two different reports. Now, Congressman John Ratcliffe is saying publicly that the Horowitz report and the Durham probe are connected. Watch this."

The referrals could already have been made. But regardless, John Durham had to let Michael Horowitz finish this work. And I think when people read the impending report, it'll be very clear why the Durham investigation has now moved to a criminal probe, which would allow him to impanel a grand jury and bring in witnesses and ultimately perhaps bring criminal charges."

If the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution or to help the president with the political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage. Joining us now is Freedom Caucus chairman, Congressman Andy Biggs, and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us. I had a pleasure of serving with both of you previously in Congress. I want to go to Whip Scalise here first, because I got to tell you, to hear Schiff and Nadler already pooh-poohing a criminal investigation without any facts, without any knowledge, just saying, oh, well, that must be political, jumping to conclusions, when you hear and see that, Steve Scalise, how do you react?"

This is a really bad sign for all the people who are politicizing and trying to interfere with the 2016 election, including people at the Department of Justice and the FBI who were trying to undermine the Trump campaign. And, of course, we've already seen a lot of information about that. But today, you saw both Schiff and Nadler hit the panic button. They really understand that this is bad for them and their case. They are trying to impeach a president based on false information and innuendo in secret behind closed doors. And in fact, what you look at, both what Horowitz is doing and what Durham is doing, they've actually been looking at facts, talking to real people, giving things that they've risen to the level of criminal probe. It's a really big deal, bad news for those people who try to undermine the Trump campaign illegally using their positions in the FBI and other agencies."

But my first thought is, you know what, that's consistent with everything that they are doing in the impeachment probe, that's consistent with the way they approach the Mueller report and it's consistent with their partisan -- I mean, I mean, we are all partisan there, as you know, as both of you know really well. But this is just beyond normal partisanship. They don't care about what justice is, they don't care about what the facts are. And when I see those statements that those guys both signed on to today, I thought, you know what? How interesting that they are more concerned with saying this is a political witch hunt and immediately going to spin when that's exactly what they've been doing for two and a half years. It's just remarkable to me."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",

It runs in parallel because you've heard earlier, Mr. Clapper trying to say, oh, well, there's all this heat on these people in the Trump administration because of impeachment. Now, what I don't understand, I wrote an op-ed for FOX News, what I don't understand is three times, the Democrats tried to bring up impeachment to the floor in the House and three times it was defeated including July of 2019. So, how is it that anybody can actually call it an impeachment proceeding when the last floor action that happened was a defeat -- over 137 Democrats that voted against proceeding with impeachment. That's the last action on the floor the House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "It is, Jason. And, in fact, if you look at Nancy Pelosi's actions, she is scared to death having a full book on the House floor or even starting an impeachment inquiry, which, by the way, is how every other impeachment inquiry, the other three intent previous presidents have been done in the history of our country. And so, she is trying to shield her vulnerable members because they can't go back home right now, and talk about what they've done. They are the party of impeachment and that's all they have to show. In fact, they have more subpoenas that this House has issued under Pelosi then bills that have gotten signed into law under Pelosi's. I mean, you think about that. More subpoenas than bill signed into law by Pelosi's House -- such a failure of leadership. And so, all they want to do is badger the president. They've investigated him for over two years with the Mueller investigation. They thought that was going to be their ticket. And I turned out there was nothing that was charged. Mueller had full authority whether it was for collusion, for obstruction, none of that happen. And, in fact, it was Schiff leading the charge saying that he had more than substantial evidence of collusion, or, you know, of any kind of collusion with Russia and it never existed. And so, instead of moving on, they're going behind closed doors trying to fabricate a story when, in fact, you look at what Durham and Horowitz are doing, they've actually found some real alarming things that broke the law, and so, it rose to the level of actually convening a grand jury. That's why you are seeing them panic right now because they know there's real stuff behind what happened in the 2016 election and they are afraid it's going to get uncovered. And President Trump has been seeking the truth, by the way."

But I've got to tell you, what you've heard from others, Nancy Pelosi changed the rules in January of 2019 on how this actually works. She changed several of the rules, the rules package voted on January of 2019, one of them had to do with the rights of the minority and the ability to actually be present and have members present when somebody is going to the transcribed interview. So, how does this get resolved because they've got a lot of attention to it, but I don't see any movement by Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff in opening this up to the public and to even members of Congress?"

But the rules are normally put in place to protect the minority, because the majority doesn't need the rules, they can change the rules anytime they want to do whatever they want. Nancy Pelosi is not going to budge here because they don't want the truth to come out. This is absolutely a coup d'etat and it's being done as Steve says behind closed doors with selective leaks coming out. And also, this is really interesting to me too. Mr. Schiff has actually threatened Republicans that if they leak, he's going to bring an ethics complaint against them. He threatened an ethics complaint against us the other day. He does not want openness and transparency. And he's got to be just really queasy when he sees this Durham thing going over to the criminal side now."

The lawsuit was over the Freedom of Information Act request for documents in the FBI's investigation of McCabe. We're still investigating how this is related to all the other breaking deep state news this week. And a new you bombshell court-filing in the Michael Flynn case lays out an even more evidence of the deep state's abuse of power against the former national security advisor. As Flynn attorney Sidney Powell alleges, the FBI's Lisa Page and Peter Strzok actually manipulated the original Flynn 302 to make it appear more damning as it related to Flynn's answers about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. Now, Powell also references a purported conversation between former DNI Director James Clapper and a \"Washington Post\" reporter where Clapper allegedly instructs him to take the kill shot on Flynn, a claim that Clapper denies. Joining me now with reaction to these big developments is the attorney for Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell. Sidney, thank you so much. I want to go back to that point which is made here, because in your filing, to say that somebody is taking a \"kill shot\" is dramatic. In the filing, it says the defense has requested the phone records of James Clapper to confirm his contact with \"Washington Post\" reporter Ignatius, especially on January 10th, 2017, when Clapper told Ignatius, in words to the effect of \"take the kill shot on Flynn\". Did he actually say take the kill shot on Flynn? What do you mean when you say to the \"words to the effect of\"?"

      "utterance": "I believe the Department of Justice is withholding a lot of information, as it is with Mr. Clapper, Mr. Brennan and on the people who participated in the complete setup of General Michael Flynn. You know, we have found additional text messages that the government suppressed including one where Agent Strzok indicates he knows the pretext to go interview General Flynn, they knew there was no Logan Act violation. They exonerated him completely of being an agent of Russia by the end of January. And yet, Mr. Comey still runs to the White House on February 14th and conjures up the entire obstruction of justice narrative against the president when Flynn has been cleared of everything long before that. We also have information that these agents did manipulate the 302. You know, it was long and in a, quote, deliberate state, as they called it, which is highly unusual in and of itself. We attached as exhibit 11 to our document, a comparison of the February 10th and February 11th 302 that show the addition of substantial additional claims that were not in there before and not supported by the notes which we also attached as exhibits to the document. So people can go to the actual document and read it and see a lot for themselves. It's extremely concerning. It's outrageous government misconduct. The agents deliberately calculated and met to plan and strategize how to ambush interview General Flynn without letting him know he was officially under any kind of criminal investigation, to keep him relaxed, and they wanted to be seen as allies when in fact they knew exactly what he had said in these conversations, and they intended to create a situation in which anything he said could be used against him later as a false statement without any warnings to that effect whatsoever."

Also developing tonight, new documents obtained by Judicial Watch review how it reporters for \"The Associated Press\" appear to have pushed the FBI to prosecute Paul Manafort. Joining me now with more reaction of this and much, much more is Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, and American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us. Tom, I've got to go to you first. You just put this information out. What did the \"A.P.\" do according to what you been able to see in trying to manipulate an investigation into Paul Manafort?"

That was helpful. And Weissmann asked them, hey, go back to Cyprus and ask them to make sure that they've given us all the information we need. So, you have the \"A.P.\" going in, giving the Justice Department information to target Manafort -- mainly to get Trump, obviously. The \"A.P.\" reporters, according to this FBI memo of the meeting with Weissmann, are pushing, hey, can there be a FARA, a Foreign Agents Registration Act prosecution? Can there be a false statement prosecution? Can you tell me whether it can be enforced? They are pushing charges on this American citizen. On what planet do -- is it ethical for journalists to do this? And then Weissmann sending the journalists assigning them to contact a foreign government to get up dirt on the President's former campaign manager. That was just a few days before Mueller was appointed. And of course, Weissmann was in charge of the Manafort prosecution after that. After listening to Sidney, after seeing what I've seen happened with the Manafort abuses, the President should look at seriously pardoning all of these folks caught up in Mueller's web and the deep state web and the Obama web, you name it. Because the abuses of power, the prosecutorial abuses are legion, and if I were Attorney General Barr in the least, he should be freezing the Flynn prosecution and investigating what went on there."

All this evidence, mountains of evidence, and you have people like Nadler and Schiff just scuffing off, saying all of this is political on Trump's part. How do you react when you see all of this?"

      "utterance": "Well, like you, I've resisted some of this deep state lingo. I think on the swamp, people had it all wrong. They thought it was kind of like people pay to play in Washington. The problem with the swamp is something that's incredibly serious, which is even when Republicans win the Presidency, the left controls the city. They control all the white buildings, they control all the agencies because the places where the government - the federal government recruits from are very blue areas, Northern Virginia, Washington, and Washington, D.C. And I think about Paul Manafort. I met today with somebody who's known that family a long time. And when you think about the people like Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort who dare to associate themselves with Donald Trump, who considered way over the line because he was actually going to come in here like Wreck-It Ralph and really take it to the swamp and take it to the way things are done in Washington. And you know the - that's why they paid this price. They paid this price. If Mike Flynn had just gone on to retirement and Paul Manafort had never come back into politics, both of them would be having a wonderful retirement. But they had the audacity to help Donald Trump. And that was unforgivable to the deep state, to the swamp, and to these disgusting actors in the Obama administration. And finally, I'd just like - we have to keep saying it, Jason, which is - this all happened under Barack Obama. I believe Barack Obama knew exactly the wrongdoing or at least new - in a broad sense, the wrongdoing that took place to try to stop Trump as a candidate and then as a new President. And - and this is disgusting. And somebody has to pay or it will happen again to a future Republican President."

Gentlemen, thank you for joining us. I want to go to you first, Jeffrey. What's your take when you see these talking heads and these other networks talking about the legitimacy of this investigation? JEFFREY LORD, POLITICAL COLUMNIST & AUTHOR, SWAMP WARS: Jason, for two years plus, these people have engaged in what I've become to call Grassy Knoll TV. There wasn't a conspiracy that they couldn't find that they didn't believe in. I mean, these were all fairy tales. And all they had to do, which is something that Sean has done every single day of his television and radio shows, is get the facts. And he brings on hardworking journalists like John Solomon and Sara Carter and Gregg Jarrett and a whole host of others. And they dig and they dig and they dig, and they get the facts. These other folks, on the other hand, they don't want to take the time to do that. They just want to sit there and spin Grassy Knoll style conspiracies and try and sell that. And no wonder their ratings tanked because of it because nobody believes them."

Assume that President Trump, candidate Trump was guilty and then work backwards from there. And look, we always heard for two years, right? Let's wait for the Mueller report. Let's see what's in the Mueller report before we draw our conclusions. Now, we have John Durham. And already a conclusion has been made that this investigation is corrupt, Bill Barr is running this for partisan reasons, and we shouldn't believe any outcome because this is being dictated by the President and he's running the DOJ. It is a complete and total 180 from what we saw from May of 2017 to April 2019, Jason."

I mean, they name the networks that they are not going to watch anymore because they believe these people are truly obsessed with the President. They can't get over the fact that he won the election. And they bottom line as see that the President is more or less a stand-in for them, that they have such that - they and the leftist state media have such contempt for these people who are out here in the middle of Pennsylvania and elsewhere. And they are furious about it. And I guarantee you, this is proving to be and will prove to be a real asset for President Trump in his reelection campaign."

Now, Joe, I tell you, I have a really queasy feeling when I see some people that were in the intelligence community, Brennan, Clapper, the FBI Director, but specifically Brennan and Clapper, because these people have security clearances. Schiff does. And they tend to use that to be able to say to everybody, look, I get to see stuff that you don't get to see and so you really should believe me. But they have spewed lies for the last three years.

Talk about quid pro quo. Well, you gave us some information for all those years even if a lot of it was wrong. Okay, now, you could be one of our intelligence analysts. And look, all of them are proving one thing, Jason, right? Whether we're talking Clapper, whether we're talking Comey, whether we're talking Brennan, they're all partisan, Jason, in one direction vigorously against the President in the most provocative of terms. And they were supposed to be apolitical in all of their positions. So - what? Did they suddenly become partisan or were they like that when they held these jobs all those years and therefore conducted business in a way they probably shouldn't have and now John Brennan - I'm sorry, John Durham is going to get to the bottom of that."

See the people that are actually trying to take down the Horowitz report now before it's even come out because when it does come out, I do believe it will be the most definitive word.

Disagreed with him on everything politically, but I was a good friend of his and I wish him and his family nothing but the best. And may he rest in peace. But Hillary Clinton, I just - what is she thinking? I want to start with Gina. I mean, it's not just us at Fox News that are talking about her running.

It may be a desperate attempt to escape whatever it is she knows, that Barr knows and his reason for reopening this investigation. She can't possibly think she could win. When she ran before, she ran on a smear campaign of Donald Trump saying all of the horrible things he do to women and yet we know that Donald Trump has been the quintessential President for women. He has lowered unemployment to record lows for women. He has doubled the child tax credit. He has created 3 million jobs just for women in this country. He's been the women's president.

And so the notion that she would have the crown knocked from her head, not once, but twice. Because of course, the same thing happened in Iowa back in 2008 when - with the rise of Barack Obama. But to go back to the funeral, and I agree with you. I don't want to dwell on it either. But there really is something beyond despicable when somebody takes an important, a beautiful service like that and stinks it up with their stupid, gross, selfish, idiotic, political - I don't even know what you call it. But it is so - I can't think of anything more despicable. And you have to be so imbued with the swamp, with politics to think that something like that is acceptable at a reverential, important, beautiful service like the one that we saw today."

This remaining obsession, it is what she's always done. It's what politicians who've been running the establishment do. They've been the only ones that have mattered. The American people have not, the nature of their impact on others has not mattered. And she has been genuinely shocked because all of her life she has seen the system work for the next in line, that there is no reason to think that this would be different. And it was. But the reason they couldn't think that it was different is because they've been out of touch with Americans as a whole. So this needs to be and I believe it to be President Trump's election one signal of a long-term reformation. And it is really this - this really pathological refusal to accept that. Now, the American people have accepted it. We are going to have another election, which is where we're going to be able to make our choices. But whether it's the impeachment or Hillary's behavior, you're seeing a level of confusion and collapse throughout the system that is clearly disturbing."

And the prison confirmed that Huffman had been released a few days early. The 56-year-old actress paid $15,000 to rig her daughter's SAT score, and now she will go on to serve one year probation and perform 250 hours of community service. Before being sentenced, Huffman apologized saying she was deeply ashamed of her behavior and had betrayed her daughters and husband. As for the other actress caught up in the cheating scandal, Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, they've decided to fight the charges that they cheated both of their daughters into the University of Southern California. That included getting their daughters admitted as athletes for a sport they never played. Now, based on other sentences being handed down, it appears that if Loughlin and her husband decide to plead guilty, they'd be looking at roughly two to three months in prison, a lot less time than they probably thought they might get.
