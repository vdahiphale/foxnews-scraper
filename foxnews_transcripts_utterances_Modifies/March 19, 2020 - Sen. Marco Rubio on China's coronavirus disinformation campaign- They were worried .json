The red tape has been cut, the FDA is acting, the president is acting, all at unprecedented speed.  And America's top scientists, medical researchers, doctors are now working around the clock on new, major, breakthrough ways to treat the coronavirus, actually using medicines that are FDA-approved and already in use. We have these incredible details coming up tonight. Three, separate areas we're working on right now.  And we're also in the midst of the major worldwide pandemic. Sadly, this full-blown global crisis might have been prevented or at least mitigated if not for the corrupt actions of the communist Chinese government. According to this top study from a British university, 95 percent of all coronavirus cases may have, in fact, been prevented if China didn't try to hide and cover up this deadly disease at every important moment.  And as the president indicated earlier today, he had been saying it really more loudly than anyone else I can think of -- China cannot be trusted. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Sadly, we can't trust anything coming from China's government.   So, here are the facts. As early as December, high-ranking Chinese officials, they actually silenced the doctors on the front line in the journalists -- if you can even say they have journalist, they don't have freedom of the press -- who bravely tried to tell the truth to the entire world, give the important information, vital information to the world about the coronavirus. Now, many of those doctors who put their lives at risk, they are dead. They died trying to save others in their country and worldwide. And on January 18th, when the disease was rapidly spreading in the Wuhan province of China, well, the city hosted a massive potluck dinner with tens of thousands of attendees, beyond -- it's incomprehensible how dumb that is. It wasn't until January 20th, after the virus already spread all over the world that China actually admitted the disease was contagious person to person.  Now, the 21st of January, we had our first known case here, the 31st, 10 days later, that was the travel ban. We'll get to that in a second.   This is the kind of botched Chernobyl-like cover up sadly predictable for communist governments. It doesn't mean we shouldn't get along with them, but we need to know that they are hostile actors. They did not act alone. The World Health Organization -- everybody needs to know this -- they are a corrupt and frankly useless organization, not unlike the United Nations from my perspective. They were supposed to be an organization the world could trust. Instead, they have been doing and all they have been doing is spreading Chinese communist party propaganda from day one.  They haven't done any independent fact-checking. And they deserve blame for this as does China. Look at this, January 14th, that's late in the game by this point, World Health Organization tweets, quote: Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the virus.  If they had any sense, they would have known that's not true. They've done their own research, they would have known in five minutes that's not true. Now, WHO's director and general in chief is a pretty sketchy individual, no medical training. He's been caring China's water for months on this.  According to a brand-new report in \"The Hill\" tonight, he turned a blind eye to what has happened in Wuhan and rest of China after meeting with President Xi in January. And, quote: From the outset, he defended China despite his gross mismanagement of the highly contagious disease. Even suggesting the president's travel ban to and from China was a racist. That one decision, history will bear this out, ten days after the first identified case in this country, January 21st, first case, January 31st, travel ban. That one decision did more to protect the health and lives of American citizens than any one thing that has happened. Thousands and thousands of more Americans would have contracted this virus, and it is incalculable how many more Americans would have died, exponentially. We would have been in a far worse position than we are in now.  And how sad is your mob and the media? Do they ever give the president credit? In retrospect, the president was right with that. Don't hold your breath.   Same with the Democrats. Dr. Joe Biden, that very day that the president implemented that travel ban, oh, this is what he had to say. Take a look.",

And now, that brand of identity politics is like the new favorite tactic of China's propaganda department which is now working overtime to deflect blame. And other frequently used disinformation campaigns include a conspiracy theory that U.S. troops are responsible for the Chinese coronavirus. That is a lie. That is an outright lie. China's oppressive regime caused hundreds of thousands worldwide to get sick. It has caused sickness, deafness and destruction for thousands and thousands more. They must be held accountable. And, by the way, another is laughable to claim that more propaganda, they are now claiming that they are leading the way worldwide in the fight against the virus even though they are the ones that covered it up all these months.  Unfortunately, some Democrats and of course the gullible media mob that just hates President Trump so much, they are echoing these ridiculous Chinese lies and propaganda, including, yes, former Obama national security advisor, the genius that she is, Susan Rice. Take a look.  SUSAN RICE, OBAMA NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER (via telephone): China is not behaving well and trying to blame this on the United States. But the flip side of it is, we are not behaving well when we talk about as the president does every day, the Chinese virus, the Wuhan flu and all of these racist descriptions.",

China went around and told countries, do not cut off lights or we're going to stop doing trade with you.  And there are a lot of countries in the world that have huge infection rates because they continue those direct flights from China. There were plenty of countries around the world instead of asking questions about what China was doing, those countries went along with it and even covered for them. China was on a P.R. campaign. This disease crossed over from animal to human sometime in early December. The first case popped up in the middle of December. It wasn't until late December that they acknowledged this. And they, as you already pointed out in your monologue that, again, they threatened people. They fired people because they accused them of spreading socially divisive information. What the people are spreading was, I have people in my house that will die of pneumonia from a virus that we've never seen before. The last one point I'll make -- the virus, the actual virus, they put the genetics on the system, but the actual virus sample, they refused to share that with the world for a long time. If they had shared that from the very beginning the way you do in an open, transparent society, people would have been working on antivirals and they would have been working on the vaccine a month ago. We wouldn't have had one today, but we would have been further along.  China absolutely turned this into a P.R. campaign instead of a public health one.

The United States has more than 13,000 cases, and the death toll late today hit 200. Washington state has the most death with 47, followed by New York with 34.

MELISSA FRANCIS, \"OUTNUMBERED\" CO-HOST: Sean, there are two big questions tonight that people have out there, how much money and when am I going to get it? How much first. This is what they are talking about, $1,200 per person. Double that if you are married. If you have children, $500 per child. That's up to $75,000 in income. If you make $75,000, you'll get that. They are basing that on your tax returns for 2019. This is the proposal. Nothing is final, but this is the latest thinking. Up to $95,000, income for 2019, you will get a smaller portion of those numbers. Now, for small businesses, they are saying that they're going to be doing loans, but they may be grants if you use the money to pay your mortgage, to pay the rent, or to make your payroll, to pay your workers. In that case, if you prove afterwards with the line of credit that you took was for that purpose, you may not have to pay it back. When you talk about big companies like the airlines, they're going to have to pay a back. That is not going to be a bailout. That is going to be definitely a loan. Now, how soon? That's the question. They are talking they don't know how to get the money out. A couple of different proposals.  I got one for you, how about FEMA? When FEMA puts out disaster relief checks, they do it within seven to 10 days. That is for housing. Well, this is for food. I don't know, it seems like a disaster, it seems like a disaster to me. Maybe they should consider distributing it through FEMA. I know they are looking to do it to the IRS and different things. I don't know, that will take a little bit longer, but we are getting clarity on the numbers, $1,200, double if you're married, $500 per kid, if you make under $75,000 last year.

I had two calls from my radio show today. They talked about chloroquine. Now, it's been in the United States and used to treat and prevent malaria since 1945. In fact, already approved by the FDA as an anti-malarial medication. According to some doctors, U.K., China, South Korea, elsewhere, study done in consultation with Stanford University School of Medicine, UAB School of Medicine, this drug has been successful in mitigating the symptoms of the coronavirus. And look at this map, look at this. Places like Africa where chloroquine has been frequently used to prevent and treat malaria, very few cases are coronavirus. The early data beyond promising. And, of course, correlation does not always equal causation but the scientists are now looking to connect those dots. We may have had a breakthrough today.  And meanwhile, the second experimental treatment is something called remdesivir is what it's called. You know, this is a drug which was first use as a test treatment for Ebola and now showing positive effects in patients with coronavirus. Both of them are prophylactic. It works in terms of prevention but more importantly, in showing that, oh, it's clearing up CT lung scans faster, getting people out of hospitals faster and literally changing it dramatically. The other experimental treatment involves plasma taken from patients who already recovered from the virus, in other words injected into other patients in an attempt to jump-start their own immuno response and early indications are, it's working and working quickly within 24 hours. We have to watch this play out. In the meantime, good news to report. According to the Vice President Mike Pence, thousands of it additional ventilators located and converted to treat the coronavirus patients. And get this, our friends in the auto industry, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, all gearing up to manufacture massive quantities of ventilators if needed. Thank you all.

By the way, thank you for what you're doing. I know you probably are not getting a lot of sleep. Let's go to these three possible treatments, the two drugs and plasma treatments, chloroquine particularly helpful. I had two calls from the radio show said that young kids used it and effectiveness was dramatic. Not for this but for what underlying other issues.  SEEMA VERMA, MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR: Well, the president received high praise from the nation's governors today because of his strong leadership across the federal government and the FDA was no different. You know, we got a great commissioner there, Steve Hahn. And he is working with the president around getting out red tapes so that these types of therapeutics can become more readily available. And we're looking at medications that already out there to see, could they have a potential impact, looking at new therapeutics. And then the vaccines are in development.

And we beat back every evil, faced depressions, world wars. We will beat this -- Lara. LARA LOGAN, FOXNATION.COM HOST, \"NO AGENDA\": Thank you, Sean. Yes, here are some of the facts about the coronavirus today. You were right. Italy has taken over from China as the epicenter of the virus. And at this point, it announced the death toll there has reached 3,405, which is a number that far surpasses China. It's been almost of those deaths were in the highest risk category. And who is in the highest risk category? It's the elderly, Sean. Most of the people who died were 80 years old and above and according to Italian health officials, they also had existing, pre-existing medical conditions which made them vulnerable to the virus. Although the news from Italy is bad, there is still more than 90 percent chance of surviving the coronavirus in the Italy at present. You have 91 percent chance of surviving it if infected there. In the U.S., the survivality rate stands at 98.5 percent based on the latest numbers from Johns Hopkins. While Italy has taken over at the epicenter of the virus, the situation in China appears to have improved drastically. Last week, China's state media reported that all temporary coronavirus hospitals, Sean, were closed because of lack of patients. And today, China reported zero, new local coronavirus infections. And a new study out of Wuhan, China, also puts the death rate at 1.4 percent, which is far below the figure out for the World Health Organization earlier this month which was 3.4 percent. And back here in the United States medical sources tell me that the anti-malaria drugs, chloroquine, which you mentioned, and President Trump discussed today, they favor this drug as a solution because it is cheaper and easier to produce. And the doctor said it can be most effective in treating patients before they get so sick that they end up in the emergency room or on a ventilator, which is really what they are trying to prevent. Because at that point, once you are on a ventilator, death rates go up significantly. A vaccine, they say is, while it's much discussed, especially in the media, it's 12 to 18 months to wait typically. So, health professionals and doctors see a vaccine more as a future solution rather than answer to the crisis, Sean.",

So, you know, globalization, which always seems to be good, has brought problems. And let's just remind ourselves -- this is the third viral crisis we've had this century. SARS, swine flu, now coronavirus, all of these things have come from China. So, you know, let's be clear -- this is the fault of China. They're not the good guys. They're not the heroes. And it is an oppressive, horrible, communist dictatorship that imprisons and executes large numbers of its own peoples, it steals our intellectual property, it threatens our security, and I think we need to think, have we become too reliant on Chinese made goods?

The red tape has been cut, the FDA is acting, the president is acting, all at unprecedented speed. And America's top scientists, medical researchers, doctors are now working around the clock on new, major, breakthrough ways to treat the coronavirus, actually using medicines that are FDA-approved and already in use. We have these incredible details coming up tonight. Three, separate areas we're working on right now. And we're also in the midst of the major worldwide pandemic. Sadly, this full-blown global crisis might have been prevented or at least mitigated if not for the corrupt actions of the communist Chinese government. According to this top study from a British university, 95 percent of all coronavirus cases may have, in fact, been prevented if China didn't try to hide and cover up this deadly disease at every important moment. And as the president indicated earlier today, he had been saying it really more loudly than anyone else I can think of -- China cannot be trusted. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Sadly, we can't trust anything coming from China's government. So, here are the facts. As early as December, high-ranking Chinese officials, they actually silenced the doctors on the front line in the journalists -- if you can even say they have journalist, they don't have freedom of the press -- who bravely tried to tell the truth to the entire world, give the important information, vital information to the world about the coronavirus. Now, many of those doctors who put their lives at risk, they are dead. They died trying to save others in their country and worldwide. And on January 18th, when the disease was rapidly spreading in the Wuhan province of China, well, the city hosted a massive potluck dinner with tens of thousands of attendees, beyond -- it's incomprehensible how dumb that is. It wasn't until January 20th, after the virus already spread all over the world that China actually admitted the disease was contagious person to person. Now, the 21st of January, we had our first known case here, the 31st, 10 days later, that was the travel ban. We'll get to that in a second. This is the kind of botched Chernobyl-like cover up sadly predictable for communist governments. It doesn't mean we shouldn't get along with them, but we need to know that they are hostile actors. They did not act alone. The World Health Organization -- everybody needs to know this -- they are a corrupt and frankly useless organization, not unlike the United Nations from my perspective. They were supposed to be an organization the world could trust. Instead, they have been doing and all they have been doing is spreading Chinese communist party propaganda from day one. They haven't done any independent fact-checking. And they deserve blame for this as does China. Look at this, January 14th, that's late in the game by this point, World Health Organization tweets, quote: Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the virus. If they had any sense, they would have known that's not true. They've done their own research, they would have known in five minutes that's not true. Now, WHO's director and general in chief is a pretty sketchy individual, no medical training. He's been caring China's water for months on this. According to a brand-new report in \"The Hill\" tonight, he turned a blind eye to what has happened in Wuhan and rest of China after meeting with President Xi in January. And, quote: From the outset, he defended China despite his gross mismanagement of the highly contagious disease. Even suggesting the president's travel ban to and from China was a racist. That one decision, history will bear this out, ten days after the first identified case in this country, January 21st, first case, January 31st, travel ban. That one decision did more to protect the health and lives of American citizens than any one thing that has happened. Thousands and thousands of more Americans would have contracted this virus, and it is incalculable how many more Americans would have died, exponentially. We would have been in a far worse position than we are in now. And how sad is your mob and the media? Do they ever give the president credit? In retrospect, the president was right with that. Don't hold your breath. Same with the Democrats. Dr. Joe Biden, that very day that the president implemented that travel ban, oh, this is what he had to say. Take a look."

You know, Dr. Quid pro quo says he would not have implemented the ban. Like everything else this man does, he is clueless with zero awareness stuck in that swamp style thinking and stupidity. And now, that brand of identity politics is like the new favorite tactic of China's propaganda department which is now working overtime to deflect blame. And other frequently used disinformation campaigns include a conspiracy theory that U.S. troops are responsible for the Chinese coronavirus. That is a lie. That is an outright lie. China's oppressive regime caused hundreds of thousands worldwide to get sick. It has caused sickness, deafness and destruction for thousands and thousands more. They must be held accountable. And, by the way, another is laughable to claim that more propaganda, they are now claiming that they are leading the way worldwide in the fight against the virus even though they are the ones that covered it up all these months. Unfortunately, some Democrats and of course the gullible media mob that just hates President Trump so much, they are echoing these ridiculous Chinese lies and propaganda, including, yes, former Obama national security advisor, the genius that she is, Susan Rice.

Now, the media mob they are new favorite hysteria around a picture for a \"Washington Post\" photographer showing an up close shot of the president's notes where corona is crossed out and replaced with Chinese. This is inside an article suggesting he was using racism against China to try to distract the president's disastrous coronavirus response. Fake news, CNN called inaccurate, stigmatizing, thousands of Americans will be sick and died. This is what they are focused on? Really? Because we have all sorts of diseases, we laid them out last night. Name after the location where they are discovered.

It was many of the people in the room, they called me racist in other words because I did that, because I went so early.

That is called edited fake news. Now, thanks to the president's decisive action, the new precedent has been set. I call this a paradigm shift. Going forward, future pandemics, and unfortunately, they pop up, I wish they didn't. Travel bans will now be used quickly to slow the spread of the disease, because it saves lives of Americans. The success of the president's public-private partnership surrounding testing, another new massive paradigm shift. They're doing all of this on the fly in record time.

China went around and told countries, do not cut off lights or we're going to stop doing trade with you. And there are a lot of countries in the world that have huge infection rates because they continue those direct flights from China. There were plenty of countries around the world instead of asking questions about what China was doing, those countries went along with it and even covered for them. China was on a P.R. campaign. This disease crossed over from animal to human sometime in early December. The first case popped up in the middle of December. It wasn't until late December that they acknowledged this. And they, as you already pointed out in your monologue that, again, they threatened people. They fired people because they accused them of spreading socially divisive information. What the people are spreading was, I have people in my house that will die of pneumonia from a virus that we've never seen before. The last one point I'll make -- the virus, the actual virus, they put the genetics on the system, but the actual virus sample, they refused to share that with the world for a long time. If they had shared that from the very beginning the way you do in an open, transparent society, people would have been working on antivirals and they would have been working on the vaccine a month ago. We wouldn't have had one today, but we would have been further along. China absolutely turned this into a P.R. campaign instead of a public health one. And the world knows it and the world should know it."

And so what happened is China in the early days after they reported the first case, a bunch of countries, including the U.S., offered to send up epidemiologists over there to help and to learn about it. And China said, no, we have it under control, it's not a big deal, because they're worried about their image. They were worried about their image. I wrote about that consistently two months ago. A lot of that was ignored at the time. We were in the middle of impeachment and all of that sort of stuff, but that's what they were writing and people ignoring that. This is what China did.

In the meantime, the latest numbers coming from Johns Hopkins now puts the number of cases globally at more than 242,000 with worldwide death toll at just under 10,000. It's notable that just under 85,000 people have fully recovered. In this country, the experts have been saying for weeks when the testing goes up, so will the numbers. And that is proving true. The United States has more than 13,000 cases, and the death toll late today hit 200. Washington state has the most death with 47, followed by New York with 34.

And with the latest on that front, Melissa Francis -- Melissa. MELISSA FRANCIS, \"OUTNUMBERED\" CO-HOST: Sean, there are two big questions tonight that people have out there, how much money and when am I going to get it? How much first. This is what they are talking about, $1,200 per person. Double that if you are married. If you have children, $500 per child. That's up to $75,000 in income. If you make $75,000, you'll get that. They are basing that on your tax returns for 2019. This is the proposal. Nothing is final, but this is the latest thinking. Up to $95,000, income for 2019, you will get a smaller portion of those numbers. Now, for small businesses, they are saying that they're going to be doing loans, but they may be grants if you use the money to pay your mortgage, to pay the rent, or to make your payroll, to pay your workers. In that case, if you prove afterwards with the line of credit that you took was for that purpose, you may not have to pay it back. When you talk about big companies like the airlines, they're going to have to pay a back. That is not going to be a bailout. That is going to be definitely a loan. Now, how soon? That's the question. They are talking they don't know how to get the money out. A couple of different proposals. I got one for you, how about FEMA? When FEMA puts out disaster relief checks, they do it within seven to 10 days. That is for housing. Well, this is for food. I don't know, it seems like a disaster, it seems like a disaster to me. Maybe they should consider distributing it through FEMA. I know they are looking to do it to the IRS and different things. I don't know, that will take a little bit longer, but we are getting clarity on the numbers, $1,200, double if you're married, $500 per kid, if you make under $75,000 last year. Sean, what do you think? Back to you."

We now need to help our fellow Americans and do it quickly, very quickly. We have major new developments tonight in the fight against the Chinese coronavirus. This is important. Another huge paradigm shift today unfolding before our very own eyes tonight. At the direction earlier today of the president, the FDA is fast tracking multiple new treatments for COVID-19. This could be the breakthrough we need right now. Take a look."

I had two calls from my radio show today. They talked about chloroquine. Now, it's been in the United States and used to treat and prevent malaria since 1945. In fact, already approved by the FDA as an anti-malarial medication. According to some doctors, U.K., China, South Korea, elsewhere, study done in consultation with Stanford University School of Medicine, UAB School of Medicine, this drug has been successful in mitigating the symptoms of the coronavirus. And look at this map, look at this. Places like Africa where chloroquine has been frequently used to prevent and treat malaria, very few cases are coronavirus. The early data beyond promising. And, of course, correlation does not always equal causation but the scientists are now looking to connect those dots. We may have had a breakthrough today. And meanwhile, the second experimental treatment is something called remdesivir is what it's called. You know, this is a drug which was first use as a test treatment for Ebola and now showing positive effects in patients with coronavirus. Both of them are prophylactic. It works in terms of prevention but more importantly, in showing that, oh, it's clearing up CT lung scans faster, getting people out of hospitals faster and literally changing it dramatically. The other experimental treatment involves plasma taken from patients who already recovered from the virus, in other words injected into other patients in an attempt to jump-start their own immuno response and early indications are, it's working and working quickly within 24 hours. We have to watch this play out. In the meantime, good news to report. According to the Vice President Mike Pence, thousands of it additional ventilators located and converted to treat the coronavirus patients. And get this, our friends in the auto industry, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, all gearing up to manufacture massive quantities of ventilators if needed. Thank you all. Joining us now with the very latest is the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administration, also a member of the Coronavirus Task Force, we've been seeing her every day -- Seema Verma is with us. By the way, thank you for what you're doing. I know you probably are not getting a lot of sleep. Let's go to these three possible treatments, the two drugs and plasma treatments, chloroquine particularly helpful. I had two calls from the radio show said that young kids used it and effectiveness was dramatic. Not for this but for what underlying other issues. SEEMA VERMA, MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES ADMINISTRATOR: Well, the president received high praise from the nation's governors today because of his strong leadership across the federal government and the FDA was no different. You know, we got a great commissioner there, Steve Hahn. And he is working with the president around getting out red tapes so that these types of therapeutics can become more readily available. And we're looking at medications that already out there to see, could they have a potential impact, looking at new therapeutics. And then the vaccines are in development. And those are progressing in record time."

It is showing -- it works two ways, prophylactic use that actually helps prevention, of contracting the disease, and secondly, quickly, altering the trajectory of getting to better health dramatically, people are getting out of hospitals faster, et cetera."

We're going to bomb the hell out of it. We're going to take it from a 10 to hopefully to a one or two, and then we're going to kill it with a vaccine. Until then, we're going to stabilize the economy to make sure you get income coming from the fact you've lost your job to no fault of your own, but the containment policies that will pay dividends, we're paying for them now."

So, we're going to keep the income coming to you. It's going to take a while to get there, but you're going to have an income stream you can rely upon as we work together to defeat the virus.

Now, here to explain that much, much more, she's the host of \"No Agenda\", foxnation.com, we call it \"facts without fear\". We are Americans, land of the free, home of the brave. And we beat back every evil, faced depressions, world wars. We will beat this -- Lara. LARA LOGAN, FOXNATION.COM HOST, \"NO AGENDA\": Thank you, Sean. Yes, here are some of the facts about the coronavirus today. You were right. Italy has taken over from China as the epicenter of the virus. And at this point, it announced the death toll there has reached 3,405, which is a number that far surpasses China. It's been almost of those deaths were in the highest risk category. And who is in the highest risk category? It's the elderly, Sean. Most of the people who died were 80 years old and above and according to Italian health officials, they also had existing, pre-existing medical conditions which made them vulnerable to the virus. Although the news from Italy is bad, there is still more than 90 percent chance of surviving the coronavirus in the Italy at present. You have 91 percent chance of surviving it if infected there. In the U.S., the survivality rate stands at 98.5 percent based on the latest numbers from Johns Hopkins. While Italy has taken over at the epicenter of the virus, the situation in China appears to have improved drastically. Last week, China's state media reported that all temporary coronavirus hospitals, Sean, were closed because of lack of patients. And today, China reported zero, new local coronavirus infections. And a new study out of Wuhan, China, also puts the death rate at 1.4 percent, which is far below the figure out for the World Health Organization earlier this month which was 3.4 percent. And back here in the United States medical sources tell me that the anti-malaria drugs, chloroquine, which you mentioned, and President Trump discussed today, they favor this drug as a solution because it is cheaper and easier to produce. And the doctor said it can be most effective in treating patients before they get so sick that they end up in the emergency room or on a ventilator, which is really what they are trying to prevent. Because at that point, once you are on a ventilator, death rates go up significantly. A vaccine, they say is, while it's much discussed, especially in the media, it's 12 to 18 months to wait typically. So, health professionals and doctors see a vaccine more as a future solution rather than answer to the crisis, Sean."

One other thing, as we now also discovered that from Wuhan province in China, hundred thousand people back and forth, even direct flights to Italy, big factor in what Italy is going through. And, unfortunately, during this difficult -- extremely difficult time for our country, there is a report tonight, Democrats are going to spend millions politicizing this serious public health threat and the mob and the media, of course, they're going after the first family. Like deranged CNN commentator Rick Wilson suggesting that First Lady Melania Trump should, quote, be infected? Rick, what a jackass you are. And one of my next guests, Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage says coronavirus is yet another reason we now need to rethink the West relationship with China. Nigel joins us, along with former White House deputy chief of staff, FOX News contributor, Karl Rove. Let me begin with you, Nigel Farage. Look, I understand, our close friends are Israel, our friends in Great Britain. We know we can count on you. You're an ally. We know that Russia, China, Iran -- well, we shouldn't have anything to do with them for the most part, North Korea, the hostile regimes. But we can still do $220 billion trade deal that helps American manufacturers, farmers, the auto industry, et cetera. Here is my question. Now after this, how big a game changer?"

      "speaker": "NIGEL FARAGE, BREXIT PARTY LEADER",
      "utterance": "It's a huge game changer. I mean, you talked about Italy a moment ago. You know, why is Italy got this problem? Well, the reason is, of course, there have been huge Chinese investments in northern Italy and many, many people going back and forth between China and Italy. So, you know, globalization, which always seems to be good, has brought problems. And let's just remind ourselves -- this is the third viral crisis we've had this century. SARS, swine flu, now coronavirus, all of these things have come from China. So, you know, let's be clear -- this is the fault of China. They're not the good guys. They're not the heroes. And it is an oppressive, horrible, communist dictatorship that imprisons and executes large numbers of its own peoples, it steals our intellectual property, it threatens our security, and I think we need to think, have we become too reliant on Chinese made goods? Is our supply chain too dependent now on China? And certainly, in this country, the U.K., we need now to say that China will have no part in our 5G network. So, a total rethink in my view of our relationship."

And I'm thinking, are you people kidding me? Really? I know we have an election 229 days, there'll be plenty of time to have elections.

I would have thought the governor would have called a number of us to consult and talk to us why he would make this decision. I know I never did get a call from him.
