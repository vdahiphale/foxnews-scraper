Hi, everyone. I'm Trish Regan in for Maria Bartiromo and this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Happy New Year's Eve! House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes hammering the Justice Department and the FBI, are they stonewalling on the anti-Trump dossier? Congressman Ron DeSantis, he joins me live. The big four lawmakers meet this week with top White House officials for talk on spending and immigration. Is the deal on DACA in the cards? Former Congressman Jason Chaffetz is here and he'll join me. And after passing tax reform, is reforming Medicaid the next target for Republicans? Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn joins me live on that as we look ahead today on New Year's Eve on \"Sunday Morning Futures\".  The Head of the House Intelligence Committee is blasting the Department of Justice and the FBI for failing to turn over documents tied to the largely discredited anti-Trump dossier. Fox News obtaining a letter Congressman Devin Nunes sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein suggesting the FBI and Justice Department should be investigating themselves and demanding all records by this Wednesday. Joining me right now is Florida Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis, a Member of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees. Happy New Year's Eve! It's so good to see you, Congressman. Let me ask you about this letter here from representative Nunes. Putting that deadline on things, how does that change the equation right now? Will they meet it?",

Trish, we've been doing this for months and months asking very simple questions about the genesis of this investigation about how the dossier came into the FBI's possession. Whether the FBI paid for the dossier whether, they used it to get surveillance on any Trump associate, and those are all very easy questions to actually answer and yet we've been met with resistance after resistance after resistance. So I think they have until next week to do it and then if not, you know, I think the House is going to have to move on to different measures in order to force compliance.",

People like Peter Strzok so we need answers to those questions and I think what they're doing by resisting but then actually leaking certain fact to the media, there was just an article in the New York Times yesterday where they're leaking about this Papadopoulos which actually conflicts with previous stories and is not anything that anyone has been able to say under oath on the record to us.

I mean, it's shocking to me because it tells you perhaps Congressman a little bit about the culture there. And I guess one of the things I'm amazed by is if they're so into leaking, how come we haven't heard more about this so-called collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians?

We're not sure that we can do it in this setting but then they leak classified information to the media, so it's just very, very frustrating process, but you're exactly right.

So let's go back to the Trump dossier for a moment because this was put together as everyone knows by now by a firm, hired sort of hit job kind of firm to dig up dirt on someone who's Fusion GPS and they were brought in and eventually down the road, employed in part by folks close to Clinton, Hillary Clinton and bankrolled by the Democrats. I guess the big question that we have to ask is was Russia deliberately trying to mess with us, with the United States of America and our whole election process and did they deliberately feed false information to Christopher Steel, the British spy that was hired to compile this dossier? I think that's, there's a lot of answers and the scary thought is that possibly the FBI used this thing to then get FISA warrants.",

We're trying to figure out whether he actually paid for that information that it's possible that he did do that. And so you're right, you have the Democrats paying. Now they funneled the money through a Perkins Coie Law Firm who then paid Fusion to try to camouflage this with the lids that's been blown off on that. We now know this was the Democrats money. Steel is actively working with Russians, and yes, I think it's without question that he was fed a lot of disinformation. I don't even know that any of these Russian sources could have dreamed that this thing would have been used the way it has been potentially. And so, if that was their aim, I think it was successful but they bring this dossier back and this thing is basically just a bunch of garbage. And so, if that was relied upon, that is something that's very, very important. And there's a very easy answer to that question, Trish. We just need to get it.",

And of course, this is imploding Congressman, around many journalist organizations and no one touched it, no one published it because no one saw it as authentic and no one could verify a darn thing in there. And yet, our own FBI, somehow is possibly taking this as some kind of gospel that they then think that they need to you know, issue warrants on people and eavesdrop, et cetera?",

So that was the way that got into the bloodstream and there was only a handful of people who knew about that meeting including James Clapper who was the Head of National Intelligence under Barack Obama.

I think the problem has been with a relatively small number of people who've very been high up in the agency both in Justice Department and in the FBI and these happen to be the people who were the driving forces behind both the Hillary e-mail investigation and then the Trump collusion Russia investigation.

Maybe because they thought it would benefit Hillary Clinton. That aside, people want answers. Nobody wants the Russians interfering with anything and we deserve these answers on both sides but it has become so politicized. How do you get away from that Congressman?

I have problems with Mueller being appointed simply because I thought it was a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. I think Rod Rosenstein made a mistake by imposing a criminal prosecutor on this because we didn't really have evidence of a crime. And so what a prosecutor's going to do, they're going to find evidence of a crime but that's not really the way you want criminal investigations to go. You want there to be an identified crime and then you try to build the case and that basic central crime was never there in this case.  But in terms of the partisanship, I got to tell you, Trish, I'm dizzy with how Russia is handled by the -- by the Democrats. A couple years ago, Obama was refusing to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, they were trying to do a reset. The Democrats lauded that. They viewed guys like me who are -- who are more of the Reagan school that's tough on Russia as kind of throwbacks to the Cold War. They criticized Mitt Romney in2012. Now all of a sudden because they're using it against Trump, they're so concerned about Russia.

What I would say is that we knew all along when you go back to the Bush era, we knew that Russia was a threat. This was out there. Condoleezza Rice was a Russian scholar they knew and for whatever reasons during the Obama administration, they decided to ignore that. The Mitt Romney point is a very good one.

So what's different now is you can transmit information very quickly. We have 16 galleries literally all over the world and for instance, somebody who works in our gallery in Hong Kong may have access to a particular painting and the liaison with our gallery in Geneva.  And this goes on -- we're not the only gallery that does that by the way. Other galleries in this kind of a footprint maybe not quite as many galleries but they have access to the same electronic communication. This is really fueled the market.

You have the New York Times story that's out over the weekend that is putting a more emphasis on Trump aide, George Papadopoulos playing a major role here in learning about these damaging e-mails that were allegedly hacked by the Russians, and we don't know what he did with that information. All of this again is unnamed sources per usual and in the New York Times. So clearly it seems as though there's someone trying to put out a real counter-narrative here against the idea that the dossier played any role. So you have these two competing narratives. You have Devin Nunes trying to track down what role the dossier played, not able to get that information. On the other hand we have anonymous sources per usual leaking information that seemed to put the emphasis on the FBI beginning the investigation based on what they learned about George Papadopoulos who did work for the Trump campaign in some capacity and they're trying to build him up as a much more serious player within the Trump campaign. They're trying to put more emphasis on Trump's campaign collusion with the Russian government. As this campaign -- the investigation evolves over the coming months, you've got the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee as well as the Senate Judiciary Committee looking at all of this. It's going to be months -- it's going to be -- you know, they've interviewed at least a hundred people over in the Senate. There's going to be more and more interviews, more documents. The big question is what will Devin Nunes get out of this? So far, he hasn't got what he's wanted and they're supposedly drafting this contempt of Congress charges against the FBI.

      "utterance": "Good morning, 2018 is just around the corner and as the year winds down, the Chairman of the House Intel Committee is demanding answers on the anti-Trump dossier and Congressional leaders gear up for a Wednesday meeting at the White House to talk immigration and spending. Hi, everyone. I'm Trish Regan in for Maria Bartiromo and this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Happy New Year's Eve! House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes hammering the Justice Department and the FBI, are they stonewalling on the anti-Trump dossier? Congressman Ron DeSantis, he joins me live. The big four lawmakers meet this week with top White House officials for talk on spending and immigration. Is the deal on DACA in the cards? Former Congressman Jason Chaffetz is here and he'll join me. And after passing tax reform, is reforming Medicaid the next target for Republicans? Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn joins me live on that as we look ahead today on New Year's Eve on \"Sunday Morning Futures\". The Head of the House Intelligence Committee is blasting the Department of Justice and the FBI for failing to turn over documents tied to the largely discredited anti-Trump dossier. Fox News obtaining a letter Congressman Devin Nunes sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein suggesting the FBI and Justice Department should be investigating themselves and demanding all records by this Wednesday. Joining me right now is Florida Republican Congressman Ron DeSantis, a Member of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees. Happy New Year's Eve! It's so good to see you, Congressman. Let me ask you about this letter here from representative Nunes. Putting that deadline on things, how does that change the equation right now? Will they meet it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLA.",
      "utterance": "Well I think the letter was great and I applaud Chairman Nunes for doing that. I think that deadline needs to be enforceable. Trish, we've been doing this for months and months asking very simple questions about the genesis of this investigation about how the dossier came into the FBI's possession. Whether the FBI paid for the dossier whether, they used it to get surveillance on any Trump associate, and those are all very easy questions to actually answer and yet we've been met with resistance after resistance after resistance. So I think they have until next week to do it and then if not, you know, I think the House is going to have to move on to different measures in order to force compliance."

      "speaker": "REGAN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "You know, it's hard to tell. I mean, you have a lot of people in there who have been a part of the bureaucracy for a long time. I mean, to me the questions are very easy to answer. If you said, of course, we didn't use the dossier, then you'd just say that and I think the reason is probably that some of the answers to these questions are going to call further into question the behavior some of the people involved at the very highest levels of both the Clinton and Russia investigations. People like Peter Strzok so we need answers to those questions and I think what they're doing by resisting but then actually leaking certain fact to the media, there was just an article in the New York Times yesterday where they're leaking about this Papadopoulos which actually conflicts with previous stories and is not anything that anyone has been able to say under oath on the record to us. You know, you look at that and say OK, you're not willing to answer Congress' questions under oath but you leak things to the media? That is not the way this is supposed to work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, you think about frankly who's running the FBI, and James Comey sort of leaker-in-chief if you would himself. I still remember being absolutely stunned during his testimony when he admitted that he was the one who actually leaked things to his friend at Columbia who could then in turn leak it to the New York Times. I mean, it's shocking to me because it tells you perhaps Congressman a little bit about the culture there. And I guess one of the things I'm amazed by is if they're so into leaking, how come we haven't heard more about this so-called collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians? Why haven't they been able to find anything to pinpoint anything to leak the media?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Oh, yes, I mean, that -- if there was any evidence of collusion, that would have been leaked months and months ago. You can bet your bottom dollar on that but it's very, very frustrating to see a lot of times they will refuse to answer Congress' questions because they say well, you know, it's classified. We're not sure that we can do it in this setting but then they leak classified information to the media, so it's just very, very frustrating process, but you're exactly right. I think there has not been evidence of collusion and one of the kind of data points that supports that is I think if there was evidence of that, I think the press would have gotten it by way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "All right. So let's go back to the Trump dossier for a moment because this was put together as everyone knows by now by a firm, hired sort of hit job kind of firm to dig up dirt on someone who's Fusion GPS and they were brought in and eventually down the road, employed in part by folks close to Clinton, Hillary Clinton and bankrolled by the Democrats. I guess the big question that we have to ask is was Russia deliberately trying to mess with us, with the United States of America and our whole election process and did they deliberately feed false information to Christopher Steel, the British spy that was hired to compile this dossier? I think that's, there's a lot of answers and the scary thought is that possibly the FBI used this thing to then get FISA warrants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well we know for sure that Steel was getting information from foreign service bureau sources in Russia. I mean, there's just no doubt about it. We're trying to figure out whether he actually paid for that information that it's possible that he did do that. And so you're right, you have the Democrats paying. Now they funneled the money through a Perkins Coie Law Firm who then paid Fusion to try to camouflage this with the lids that's been blown off on that. We now know this was the Democrats money. Steel is actively working with Russians, and yes, I think it's without question that he was fed a lot of disinformation. I don't even know that any of these Russian sources could have dreamed that this thing would have been used the way it has been potentially. And so, if that was their aim, I think it was successful but they bring this dossier back and this thing is basically just a bunch of garbage. And so, if that was relied upon, that is something that's very, very important. And there's a very easy answer to that question, Trish. We just need to get it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "You know, you say it's a bunch of garbage and I'd encourage people to actually check it out because I can tell you just reading through this thing, it actually reads like some kind of tabloid piece of fiction from an opposition party. I mean, even the way it's written is to me, quite odd. If a spy is gathering intelligence, you wouldn't think they would compile it and put it into a dossier that looked anything like that one. And of course, this is imploding Congressman, around many journalist organizations and no one touched it, no one published it because no one saw it as authentic and no one could verify a darn thing in there. And yet, our own FBI, somehow is possibly taking this as some kind of gospel that they then think that they need to you know, issue warrants on people and eavesdrop, et cetera?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well yes, and then -- and remember how the dossier eventually became public. Comey briefed President-Elect Trump January 6th of 2017 and then low and behold a couple hours later, CNN -- they didn't want to print the dossier because they knew it was false but what they did was they leaked the existence of the meeting about the dossier. So that was the way that got into the bloodstream and there was only a handful of people who knew about that meeting including James Clapper who was the Head of National Intelligence under Barack Obama. So this whole thing with this dossier and how government either did use it or may have used it, it really does stink to high heaven."

      "utterance": "You know, I draw a distinction between the rank in file, the FBI, who I think if you look across our government, some of these FBI agents are as good as anybody and any agency of government. When I served in Iraq back in '07, you had FBI agents out in places like Fallujah, Ramadi risking their lives. I think the problem has been with a relatively small number of people who've very been high up in the agency both in Justice Department and in the FBI and these happen to be the people who were the driving forces behind both the Hillary e-mail investigation and then the Trump collusion Russia investigation. And I think anybody who misbehaved needs to be held accountable but at a minimum, we need to know what all these people did and how all this information was handled."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "You know, I think that's probably perhaps for Americans the most frustrating thing of all. In other words, everybody has questions. It's been proven that the Russians interfered in the election. And by the way, there was information this week going back to 2016 of course when the Obama administration knew that they were trying to interfere in the election and for whatever reason, the Obama administration wasn't so concerned then. Maybe because they thought it would benefit Hillary Clinton. That aside, people want answers. Nobody wants the Russians interfering with anything and we deserve these answers on both sides but it has become so politicized. How do you get away from that Congressman? Does Robert Mueller need to step down?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well look, I think a lot of the questions that I have pre-date Mueller's appointment. I have problems with Mueller being appointed simply because I thought it was a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. I think Rod Rosenstein made a mistake by imposing a criminal prosecutor on this because we didn't really have evidence of a crime. And so what a prosecutor's going to do, they're going to find evidence of a crime but that's not really the way you want criminal investigations to go. You want there to be an identified crime and then you try to build the case and that basic central crime was never there in this case. But in terms of the partisanship, I got to tell you, Trish, I'm dizzy with how Russia is handled by the -- by the Democrats. A couple years ago, Obama was refusing to provide lethal aid to Ukraine, they were trying to do a reset. The Democrats lauded that. They viewed guys like me who are -- who are more of the Reagan school that's tough on Russia as kind of throwbacks to the Cold War. They criticized Mitt Romney in2012. Now all of a sudden because they're using it against Trump, they're so concerned about Russia. I think we should be concerned about them but I think a lot of this stuff has reaped the politics from the day that election happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm glad you said that Representative DeSantis because I have really questioned why it is that we suddenly wanted to be friends with Russia while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, but now Russia is the sworn enemy. What I would say is that we knew all along when you go back to the Bush era, we knew that Russia was a threat. This was out there. Condoleezza Rice was a Russian scholar they knew and for whatever reasons during the Obama administration, they decided to ignore that. The Mitt Romney point is a very good one. Congressman DeSantis, happy New Year to you. Thank you."

Representative, you know it's never easy when you cut entitlements right?

The goal is to make certain that those who deserve and need those benefits get everything that they're entitled to. The answer is how do you do that or that's the question and the answer is you do it by making the system more efficient, by innovating, utilizing healthcare technology. And then another thing I think is exciting to have a discussion on is looking at Graham-Cassidy. The legislation the Senators have that they want to send Medicaid back to the state. And here in Tennessee, when I talked to our terrific state legislators that we have, they say please, send it to us. We can deliver these benefits more effectively and that will give us the opportunity to innovate and they're excited about doing that."

If you're going to preserve all of our rural hospitals that need that preservation, if you're going to increase the opportunities for home health and delivery of home health, what you're going to need is consistent, reliable, high-speed internet. So there is going to be an intersection of these two.

Democrats have made no bones about it. They want DACA reform. I think the President has signaled that he's open to that but at the same time, this President was elected on tough border security and he's going to get funding for that wall and he's going to have to deal with chain migration and a host of other immigration issues."

The Democrats -- I mean, sure they want DACA reform but the wall symbolizes -- actually physically symbolizes everything that they dislike about this President, which is a little bit exaggerated if you ask me only because you know, it's symbolic for controlling our borders which is as a country, you kind of need to do. But they hate the idea, they hate him, and if they actually vote for money for the wall, they're never able to live that down with some of their constituents."

They actually voted for funding of the wall and with the President has previously asked for $1.8 billion does not put a wall on the entire border but it does fund a big portion of it. And right now, I've been down to the border, I've seen it. You'll have a wall and all of a sudden it stops and then you've got a barbed wire fence and you can see the path between Mexico and the United States where people just walk across. It's really ridiculous and we're asking these border patrol agents to try to protect the border against drugs and incursions without the necessary support. And I would think that they would want to be able to do that. Now, I do think we could deal with DACA but we also have to deal with chain migration, we're going to have to deal with an asylum reform and then we've got to deal with sanctuary cities where it wasn't too long ago that this administration lost a court case on sanctuary cities, some simple language in the next appropriations bill and you could actually solve that problem."

So that of course was reversed. But you know chain migration is a big one. A lot of Democrats I've spoken to say, well, the President's family came here on chain migration.

We aren't even deporting the criminal element under Barack Obama, there were no more than 80,000 people that were here illegally got caught committing a crime and instead of deporting him, he just released them back out into the United States of America.

I think that's a dangerous way to look at it in some respects but it's certainly a factor. Some people buy art because they're confident that it will be a good store value and this is -- this is a kind of a recent phenomenon. The art market has become -- it's kind of global phenomenon. I mean people collected art in all cultures for thousands of years literally. But the market, what we're talking about right now is in some ways a new phenomenon. The type of market that we're talking about is a relatively new animal and you know, it's great for artists because if you're a talented artist and you're entering the market now as a young artist who really has talent, I think you're going to find that there are people out there who are going to be collecting your work. So it's great for young artists to -- of course, you've got to be good and not everything -- not everything, not all art is created equally."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAGOSIAN",
      "utterance": "What's different about it is -- it's not really different, it's more of what we've -- what we've experienced before. Twenty years ago there were really no significant collectors of contemporary art in China or the Middle East, Latin America, so when the word globalization is you know, people get tired of hearing it but the art market is certainly benefited from globalization. So what's different now is you can transmit information very quickly. We have 16 galleries literally all over the world and for instance, somebody who works in our gallery in Hong Kong may have access to a particular painting and the liaison with our gallery in Geneva. And this goes on -- we're not the only gallery that does that by the way. Other galleries in this kind of a footprint maybe not quite as many galleries but they have access to the same electronic communication. This is really fueled the market. This also allowed collectors to have more transparency, to have more access to more transparency about prices which gives the market more confidence. So I think it's a convergence of these things that we're seeing now and it's resulted in a very healthy art market."

And you can't simply call a factory and say give me a thousand more bags or -- I mean they're great bags don't get me wrong but it's a controlled, there's controlled supply by the very nature of how it's created. So there's scarcity and there's rarity and there's always the hand of the artist involved. And that makes it different than -- sometimes people try to categorize it as a luxury. It's a disservice to art in my opinion and it really -- and it really distorts the true nature of the market. This is one of (INAUDIBLE) early girl paintings from his pop art period 1962. There may be -- I don't know, 30-35 paintings from this period depicting women in this kind of idealized comic strip fashion. And this one is -- I'm (INAUDIBLE) Janet Leigh, the actress Janet Leigh for some reason. I don't think that would -- it might have been inspired by Janet Leigh."

I mean, the painting is how many hundred years old, you know, and it didn't live in a museum its whole life. It had been passed through other hands so it had -- it had restoration. And some collectors were put off by it. But it was a Da Vinci and there are only 16 and this is arguably the last one that will ever come on the market unless another one is discovered in the future. And again, the rarity and the brand Da Vinci is a pretty good brand. So I mean the price was flabbergasting but if you look back at why it happened, maybe it's plausible in a certain way."

I think it's a growing -- I think it's growing market. I think the economy there is just going to get stronger and stronger. They're building museums you know, like McDonald's. I mean, there's museums all over China, big ones, private ones, there's a museum that (INAUDIBLE) is just about -- they're just about to start construction I think 1.5 million square feet in Beijing. The (INAUDIBLE) Abu Dhabi just opened so these museums have to put something on the wall, you know, and they've got to buy art -- they've got -- to attract people they can't just borrow paintings from other museums. They need to have -- it's a destination. And particularly when you're in a place like you know, Doha or Beijing, you want to -- you want to bring traffic to your museum. You've got -- you've got to make exciting acquisitions to bring the public in. This is a beautiful painting from the neoclassical period of Picasso. This was painted in 1925. It's a very large canvas for that period. Typically they're much smaller -- much smaller paintings. This is big canvas and it depicts one of Picasso's children who actually sadly died very young. And Picasso quite often would dress him up in a bullfighter outfit and Picasso was a big, big bullfight fan. He wants too many, many bullfights. There are credible photographs Picasso you know, with (INAUDIBLE) and other artists of his generation in the bullring. And he liked to dress his Pablito, that was the boy's name, dress him up in these bullfighter costumes and make paintings of him. He did maybe 10 paintings, I don't know how many but a hand full of paintings with his son dressed as a bullfighter."

Dot-com bubble, Lehman Brothers crash, the first bad, bad art market that I had to kind of soldier through was in the early 90s and it was just at a point where the Japanese, their stock market collapsed, they were huge collectors of art. They all wanted to sell. There were -- there were these funds -- I'm not a big fan of art funds by the way. There were these funds that were buying art, they all wanted to get out. Everybody wanted to sell and there was -- there were very few buyers."

You didn't have Latin American buyers. You had zero China, and you had -- you know, basically a recession in the United States, it was terrible. Since then, what I've noticed, because of the broadening of the Market that we've been talking about, because of the buyers in the Middle East, because of the great new collectors in China, because of the broadening of the market in this country and elsewhere, yes it goes in cycles. Anybody who thinks that it's not going to go in another cycle is being (INAUDIBLE) because all markets go in cycles."

What do you think will come of that?"

It's ironic that it takes a charity judicial watch in order to get a lot of the information that we should be entitled to that's in the possession of the government. I hope that the FBI did not contribute U.S.-funded dollars to this effort in getting information from the dossier but certainly they relied on it. And we want to know to what effect did they rely on it in order to get warrants to wiretap Americans. This is very serious business, not only in the conduct of the FBI but also the supervision of the FBI. So Nunes is making some headway, but I think the American people are fatigued by this Russian collusion. There's nothing seems to be there, there with regard to Trump but there seems to be something there regarding the FBI."

I guess the bottom line is we all want answers on both sides. Are we going to get them this year? SUSAN FERRECHIO, CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT, THE WASHINGTON"

They really don't like the co-mingling of Congressional investigations with the federal government's investigation. That doesn't surprise me. But the problem is it really shields the information that Brad was just talking about. What role did the dossier play in instigating this whole investigation? You have the New York Times story that's out over the weekend that is putting a more emphasis on Trump aide, George Papadopoulos playing a major role here in learning about these damaging e-mails that were allegedly hacked by the Russians, and we don't know what he did with that information. All of this again is unnamed sources per usual and in the New York Times. So clearly it seems as though there's someone trying to put out a real counter-narrative here against the idea that the dossier played any role. So you have these two competing narratives. You have Devin Nunes trying to track down what role the dossier played, not able to get that information. On the other hand we have anonymous sources per usual leaking information that seemed to put the emphasis on the FBI beginning the investigation based on what they learned about George Papadopoulos who did work for the Trump campaign in some capacity and they're trying to build him up as a much more serious player within the Trump campaign. They're trying to put more emphasis on Trump's campaign collusion with the Russian government. As this campaign -- the investigation evolves over the coming months, you've got the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee as well as the Senate Judiciary Committee looking at all of this. It's going to be months -- it's going to be -- you know, they've interviewed at least a hundred people over in the Senate. There's going to be more and more interviews, more documents. The big question is what will Devin Nunes get out of this? So far, he hasn't got what he's wanted and they're supposedly drafting this contempt of Congress charges against the FBI. We'll see how far that goes and whether they can use that to actually get the information they're seeking."

But do you know, if I'm Robert Mueller, Brad, I would be very interested in just exactly what was done with the Trump dossier, its origin, who wanted it, who supplied information to Mr. Steel because I look at this and I'm just wondering if the Russians deliberately interfered with our electoral process by feeding false information to this British spy who was then funneling it back to our own FBI."

Papadopoulos was a wannabe. I've been involved in presidential campaigns, I've seen these guys. He was a free agent. He was not acting with the direction of the campaign. He was trying to be somebody. And in trying to be somebody what did it get him, a perjury conviction."

First I'm told that they may come up with, you know, how close was the collusion between Trump-Russia but first, they may get into how much influence did the Russians have on this election?

I think the President needs to reach out his hand across the aisle because now, we need Democrats. The numbers are against us in the Senate and we have to tackle infrastructure, immigration, DACA, sunsets in March and if we're really in a bipartisan spirit, we'll be able to knockout healthcare.

We'll see whether wages go up which is a promise that Republicans made and whether the public really comes to understand the implications of the tax law. The polling shows that people think they're going to have a tax increase when the vast majority will not. I think it's also going to be a year about the President's messaging skills. He will be out on the campaign trail I think delivering his message and promoting the accomplishments so far in his administration which have been mostly overshadowed by negative media.
