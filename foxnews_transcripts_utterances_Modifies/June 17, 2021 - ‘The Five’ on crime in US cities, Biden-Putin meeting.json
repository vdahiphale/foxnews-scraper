So, the people that know Biden best know he can`t hack it with the press and the media knows that too. Even though the media is there to help Joe. They want the Democratic Party to do well. So, it`s an arrangement, a pathetic arrangement between the media and the White House to protect Joe from himself. And that doesn`t serve the American people well. Now to shower praise on this summit is ridiculous. There was no doctrine, there was no memorable line. There were gaffes glory handed our enemy a list of targets that we don`t want to be hit. And then to hear someone like Meacham say there was poetry and prose. Meacham is a speechwriter. MSNBC doesn`t reveal that, but Meacham is the speechwriter for Joe Biden.

So, I can understand the governor`s frustration. On the political side of things, because of the lack of action by the Biden administration, you are allowing these governors a chance to shine. Abbott is certainly one of them but I would put Doug Ducey in that category, certainly Ron DeSantis on many issues, some COVID related, but also, you know, you get to be the first to send help. And Kristi Noem of South Dakota said I`ll be in -- I`ll be there. Now all of these people probably do have a good political future. Governors usually do very well if they want to step up, it`s usually a better path to the presidency than a Senate seat. But you also have two other governments that could be doing something, that could be making the name for themselves on this issue, but they`re not.

But like Dana said, it`s hard for a governor to build a border wall because most of that is federal land and the land that`s not federal land is privately owned. So, then you`d have to get all the landowners that are adjacent to each other to agree to have a wall build. So, you can get 11 land owners to say yes, build a wall and you get one that doesn`t, that leaves a hole in the wall. But I want to talk about this little lady`s dinner that Kamala threw for the senators. You know how I like perks and if someone says free dinner, I`m there early. And I`ll break bread with my enemies, you know. The mob did it, certainly the Senate can do it. But it doesn`t leave a good taste in my mouth when she`s out there triggering a crisis, ignoring it, cackling about it, unleashing chaos in the state of Texas and then invites people over for cocktails and cheese puffs, I wouldn`t have gone. I would have said RSVP, no thanks. Maybe later in the year, I`m just not ready for it right now.",

You can`t get to the comprehensive aspects of what I`d like to see is get to around immigration including making targeted investments on some of the countries that the vice president visited until you deal with the border because the country, you are not going to find members of Congress, Democrats, mostly Republicans who are going to be willing to negotiate and work with you unless you handle that first.

Also, they need to create a finite number of people to call on because you have to shorten this thing because the longer Joe talks, the worse it gets. And creating a list is like creating a VIP list. You want to be on the list, it`s human nature, so the reporters during the week, they jockey and see if they can shade their coverage to be so flattering that they get to be on the list, and then the Biden communication shop can say you were a good girl this week, you were a good boy this week, you get to be on the list. So, the people that know Biden best know he can`t hack it with the press and the media knows that too. Even though the media is there to help Joe. They want the Democratic Party to do well. So, it`s an arrangement, a pathetic arrangement between the media and the White House to protect Joe from himself. And that doesn`t serve the American people well. Now to shower praise on this summit is ridiculous. There was no doctrine, there was no memorable line. There were gaffes glory handed our enemy a list of targets that we don`t want to be hit. And then to hear someone like Meacham say there was poetry and prose. Meacham is a speechwriter. MSNBC doesn`t reveal that, but Meacham is the speechwriter for Joe Biden. So that`s just an inside job they are doing. And then Chuck Todd, who I feel sorry for, I don`t want to knock him too hard but he doesn`t believe that stuff what he said, he is angling for a sit down with the president."

He would not be able to handle it. Just a couple of -- couple things, it`s the job of the press corps to report on whether Joe Biden is in decline or not. These chattering ciphers will never ever investigate that and it`s kind of important given he`s the leader of the free world but I will give him this, he still knows how to manipulate. These members of the press. That line, you are the brightest people in the country, he has been on the -- he`s been on the grip, he`s been in this racket for so long, he knows that it only takes one complement to have these like thin-skinned, insecure reporters back right in his little coin purse."

I think the proof will be in the pudding 30, 60 days from today. If we -- if you invite me back in 60 days and we see that there has been nothing -- nothing that`s happened after this meeting with Putin, that we`ve had more attacks that we have not responded, and I think one would have to say that everything that`s being said that`s being talked about around the table is largely right. But the data, the polling data says that people thought he did a good job and he got a little testy with of all reporters, a reporter from CNN. So it wasn`t Fox. It was young Mr. Doocy who asked I thought one of the most pointed questions and to your point, Dana, he asked it not as a chosen person, he yelled it out at the president. The president reacted."

And one big frustration has to be for the governor that they have this problem, the federal government is not willing to come and help but immigration and border security is a federal government responsibility. So that`s why it`s pretty amazing that they would say, OK, we are going to take a billion dollars of state taxpayer money to try to deal with this problem. So, I can understand the governor`s frustration. On the political side of things, because of the lack of action by the Biden administration, you are allowing these governors a chance to shine. Abbott is certainly one of them but I would put Doug Ducey in that category, certainly Ron DeSantis on many issues, some COVID related, but also, you know, you get to be the first to send help. And Kristi Noem of South Dakota said I`ll be in -- I`ll be there. Now all of these people probably do have a good political future. Governors usually do very well if they want to step up, it`s usually a better path to the presidency than a Senate seat. But you also have two other governments that could be doing something, that could be making the name for themselves on this issue, but they`re not. One would be Gavin Newsom in California who is facing a big recall effort and the other is Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. Those state are also dealing with this problem but their governors are not actually participating in helping solve it."

And now Biden is hanging Texas out to dry, so Abbott has to step up, and I like the two things that he is doing where he is deputizing the state police to go and then arrest illegals for trespassing, that`s creative. And also building up jail capacity along the border to deal with the numbers. But like Dana said, it`s hard for a governor to build a border wall because most of that is federal land and the land that`s not federal land is privately owned. So, then you`d have to get all the landowners that are adjacent to each other to agree to have a wall build. So, you can get 11 land owners to say yes, build a wall and you get one that doesn`t, that leaves a hole in the wall. But I want to talk about this little lady`s dinner that Kamala threw for the senators. You know how I like perks and if someone says free dinner, I`m there early. And I`ll break bread with my enemies, you know. The mob did it, certainly the Senate can do it. But it doesn`t leave a good taste in my mouth when she`s out there triggering a crisis, ignoring it, cackling about it, unleashing chaos in the state of Texas and then invites people over for cocktails and cheese puffs, I wouldn`t have gone.

You can`t get to the comprehensive aspects of what I`d like to see is get to around immigration including making targeted investments on some of the countries that the vice president visited until you deal with the border because the country, you are not going to find members of Congress, Democrats, mostly Republicans who are going to be willing to negotiate and work with you unless you handle that first. So my message to the White House is let`s deal with this border issue in a way that allows for the messaging to change first and then get to the root cause issues which I believe are serious, I hope those around the table do as well, but you can`t get to that without border first."

The woke dial -- this is what depresses me, that makes me sad, is that these woke dials can turn everyone into a coward including her, and she is a feisty person. So, what this is going to do in the long term is it`s going to widen that gulf between your thoughts and what you can say. And this is actually the new censorship. It isn`t coming from 1984 ideas or the government. A few losers on Twitter are censoring our thoughts because we`re mistaking their outrage as an outcry, and it`s just a stupid phantom.

Lowe`s Hardware, he -- all this was made possible by help with the lawn mower from Lowe`s who donated a brand new lawnmower after his mower broke down. But he is going to charge after the first mow."
