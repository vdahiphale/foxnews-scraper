      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight. We have momentous news this evening from the world of Democratic politics. Senator Kamala Harris of California has ended her presidential campaign. \"What does this mean for America?\" you ask. \"Where do we go from here? Who will lead this nation forward through darkness into light?\" All good and fair questions. In time, once passions have cooled and despair is congealed into a kind of sorrowful wisdom, we will know the answers. But for now, it's enough to pause and celebrate what was, for a brief but electric moment, the single most profound and transformative -- if entirely scripted and corporate -- political moment in the history of this country. Here -- so you can relive the blessed moment -- is how the wise men of our press corps heralded the arrival of our new messiah, Kamala D. Harris.",

Voters realized that making Joe Biden look bad isn't actually much of an accomplishment. It's not that hard. And then, Harris had to admit that, actually, she didn't really herself support mandatory school busing because voters of all colors hate it because it's actually insane. Pretty soon Tulsi Gabbard was attacking Harris too for her past as a prosecutor, and then it was all over. Harris was mired in the single digits. She never got out of them. Her fundraising was shot. The campaign was doomed. Obvious to everyone. By October, Harris knew that she was done. So, she started making preemptive excuses for failing to preserve her chances of getting picked as someone else's vice president. The problem, she explained, was how racist and sexist America is.",

Well it's a limited world view to put it mildly. In fact, there could be other reasons that Kamala Harris failed. Just the other day, for example, The New York Times profiled her campaign as it went through its death rattles. The piece had some revealing details like this one and we're quoting. \"Extensive polling led Harris to believe there was great value in the word,\" excuse me, ii the word truth. So, she titled her 2019 memoir, 'The Truths We Hold.'\" No word on whether she actually read the memoir. Continuing the quote, \"and made a similar phrase the centerpiece of her early stump speech.

Former President Bill Clinton has said repeatedly the only Epstein property he ever stayed in was his New York City townhome, but a security expert brought in to set up surveillance systems at the ranch tells The Daily Mail that Bill Clinton frequently visited there and that Hillary and Chelsea Clinton also visited on a number of occasions, but the security guy says the former first family stayed at a guest house in the cowboy village, not the main house. The security expert also reportedly says the former president was Epstein's closest \"celebrity mate.\" And Virginia Roberts, the woman who claims Prince Andrew had sex with her multiple times while she was 17, also says she saw Bill Clinton on Jeffrey Epstein's private island for a dinner held in Clinton's honor. Clinton and his spokesperson denied that though Bill Clinton says he only flew on Epstein's private plane four times even though flight logs show that he took 26 flights on the so-called Lolita Express. Bill Clinton's office maintains he did not know anything about Epstein's crimes. The security expert, by the way, also said that on some parts of the ranch surveillance cameras were not allowed.

Ronan Farrow just with this week came out with an admission that not only, of course, we know through his book that she tried to have an associate push him off of the Weinstein story. But now he's saying that their relationship changed after he investigated Weinstein.  So, this is not a woman who's caught up in some kind of a circle and is shocked by what's going on. She tried to punish Ronan Farrow for doing his investigation. And now, while she's never talked about Epstein, she's been there as well, to say nothing of her husband's history. So, all three men clearly credibly accused of rape, for the other two, also sex trafficking. How does that work that Hillary Clinton is in the link with all of those men, while Ghislaine Maxwell, the associate of Epstein, is effectively a fugitive? Her life is over. Prince Andrew's life is over and ruined, his daughter's lives. They'll [sic] probably won't be royals, and they won't have the same future they expected.

But it was still a recognizably American class. Tycoons accumulated fortunes, but they also felt some obligation to the country around them. Steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie famously built stone libraries around the country for the edification of people beneath him. John D. Rockefeller and many other so-called robber barons set aside huge portions of their wealth, and in some cases their property, to make this country better. Yellowstone, Acadia National Park, et cetera. Maybe most significantly, in January of 1914, Henry Ford more than doubled the prevailing factory to a then remarkable $5 for an eight-hour day. Ford didn't have to do that. But his company was succeeding, and he thought he should. Some historians trace the creation of the American middle class to that decision. Either way, it is nearly impossible to imagine a big company doing anything like that today. Attitudes are just too different. Your average finance mogul looks at workers merely as costs to be reduced or eliminated entirely. Private equity isn't building a lot of public libraries these days. Instead, the model is ruthless economic efficiency. Buy a distressed company, outsource the jobs, liquidate the valuable assets, fire middle management, and once the smoke is cleared dump what remains to the highest bidder, often in Asia. It's happened around the country. It has made a small number of people phenomenally rich. One of them is a New-York-based hedge fund manager called Paul Singer who according to Forbes has amassed a personal fortune of more than $3 billion. How has Singer made that money? Well, he made a lot of it by purchasing sovereign debt from financially distressed countries, countries that were in trouble, usually at a massive discount. Once a country's economy regains some stability Singer would bombard its government with lawsuits of a massive public relations campaign originating here in Washington sometimes until he made his money back with interest. The practice is called vulture capitalism feeding off the carcass of a dying nation. In some ways it's not so different from what Singer and his firm, Elliott Management, have done in this country and to this country. Over the past couple of decades Elliott Management has made billions by buying large stakes in American companies then firing workers driving up short-term share prices and, in some cases, taking government bailouts, insult to injury. Bloomberg News once described Singer as \"the world's most feared investor.\" And that tells you a lot. No one's even pretending Paul Singer's tactics are good for anyone but Paul Singer and his fund. Consider the case of Delphi, the automotive parts supplier. During the last financial crisis, a consortium of hedge funds, including Singer's Elliott Management, purchased Delphi. With Singer and the other funds at the helm, the company took billions of dollars in government bailouts paid for by you. Obama's auto czar compared those tactics to extortion, but they continued anyway. Once they had the bailout money the funds moved most of Delphi's jobs overseas and then either cut retiree pensions entirely or shifted the cost to taxpayers with later financial commitments at home and cheap factories abroad Delphi's stock soared. According to investigative reporter Greg Palast, of the 29 Delphi plants in operation when the hedge fund started buying Delphi's debt, only four were still operating in the United States by 2012. That means tens of thousands of unionized and white-collar workers lost their jobs. Paul Singer's hedge fund cashed out for more than a billion dollars. See how that works? Well, some countries, including the United Kingdom, have banned this kind of behavior. It bears no resemblance whatsoever to the capitalism we were promised in school. It creates nothing. It destroys entire cities. It couldn't be uglier or more destructive. So, why is it still allowed in the United States? The short answer: because people like Paul Singer have tremendous influence over our political process. Singer himself was the second largest donor to the Republican Party in 2016. He's given millions to a SuperPAC that supports Republican senators. You may never have heard of Paul Singer, which tells you a lot in itself, but in Washington he is rockstar famous and that may be why he's almost certainly paying a lower effective tax rate than your average fireman, just in case you're still wondering if our system is rigged. Oh, yeah, it is.",

Huh. That's odd. But then here's one possible explanation for that. During his Senate run, Ben Sasse received the largest possible donation from Paul Singer.

They're ideologues. They're not city managers. They care about climate change and social justice and their ambitions are global. They're not even national or local. They're not the 21st Century CEOs that our dying cities desperately need. They are -- they behave more like smarmy televangelists and aloof 17th Century monarchs. And look what's happening.

Senator Kamala Harris of California has ended her presidential campaign. \"What does this mean for America?\" you ask. \"Where do we go from here? Who will lead this nation forward through darkness into light?\" All good and fair questions. In time, once passions have cooled and despair is congealed into a kind of sorrowful wisdom, we will know the answers. But for now, it's enough to pause and celebrate what was, for a brief but electric moment, the single most profound and transformative -- if entirely scripted and corporate -- political moment in the history of this country. Here -- so you can relive the blessed moment -- is how the wise men of our press corps heralded the arrival of our new messiah, Kamala D. Harris."

Voters realized that making Joe Biden look bad isn't actually much of an accomplishment. It's not that hard. And then, Harris had to admit that, actually, she didn't really herself support mandatory school busing because voters of all colors hate it because it's actually insane. Pretty soon Tulsi Gabbard was attacking Harris too for her past as a prosecutor, and then it was all over. Harris was mired in the single digits. She never got out of them. Her fundraising was shot. The campaign was doomed. Obvious to everyone. By October, Harris knew that she was done. So, she started making preemptive excuses for failing to preserve her chances of getting picked as someone else's vice president. The problem, she explained, was how racist and sexist America is."

Well it's a limited world view to put it mildly. In fact, there could be other reasons that Kamala Harris failed. Just the other day, for example, The New York Times profiled her campaign as it went through its death rattles. The piece had some revealing details like this one and we're quoting. \"Extensive polling led Harris to believe there was great value in the word,\" excuse me, ii the word truth. So, she titled her 2019 memoir, 'The Truths We Hold.'\" No word on whether she actually read the memoir. Continuing the quote, \"and made a similar phrase the centerpiece of her early stump speech.

It's also been dubbed baby making ranch because The New York Times reported that Epstein once said he wanted to simultaneously impregnate 20 girls at the ranch to improve the human race. Former President Bill Clinton has said repeatedly the only Epstein property he ever stayed in was his New York City townhome, but a security expert brought in to set up surveillance systems at the ranch tells The Daily Mail that Bill Clinton frequently visited there and that Hillary and Chelsea Clinton also visited on a number of occasions, but the security guy says the former first family stayed at a guest house in the cowboy village, not the main house. The security expert also reportedly says the former president was Epstein's closest \"celebrity mate.\" And Virginia Roberts, the woman who claims Prince Andrew had sex with her multiple times while she was 17, also says she saw Bill Clinton on Jeffrey Epstein's private island for a dinner held in Clinton's honor. Clinton and his spokesperson denied that though Bill Clinton says he only flew on Epstein's private plane four times even though flight logs show that he took 26 flights on the so-called Lolita Express. Bill Clinton's office maintains he did not know anything about Epstein's crimes. The security expert, by the way, also said that on some parts of the ranch surveillance cameras were not allowed.

But here's what is fascinating to me -- and understandably, you know, the focus has been on Bill Clinton and the flights that he's taking -- this story clearly places Hillary Clinton in that same realm. But it's not just that dynamic here. Now, we've got Hillary Clinton with a link to Jeffrey Epstein. We clearly know of a strong link with her and Harvey Weinstein. Ronan Farrow just with this week came out with an admission that not only, of course, we know through his book that she tried to have an associate push him off of the Weinstein story. But now he's saying that their relationship changed after he investigated Weinstein. So, this is not a woman who's caught up in some kind of a circle and is shocked by what's going on. She tried to punish Ronan Farrow for doing his investigation. And now, while she's never talked about Epstein, she's been there as well, to say nothing of her husband's history. So, all three men clearly credibly accused of rape, for the other two, also sex trafficking. How does that work that Hillary Clinton is in the link with all of those men, while Ghislaine Maxwell, the associate of Epstein, is effectively a fugitive? Her life is over. Prince Andrew's life is over and ruined, his daughter's lives. They'll [sic] probably won't be royals, and they won't have the same future they expected. But Hillary Clinton is still being encouraged to run for president. And she's the only one with links to all three of those men."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "If you spend any time driving around America recently, you may have noticed that an awful lot of the country seems to have shriveled up and died. Take a trip en route to in Maine some time and count the boarded-up paper mills in abandoned houses you see, or head down route 23 in Michigan or Ohio and consider the empty factories ringed with barbed wire. You'll see a lot of them. Outside the coastal cities, scenes like this are everywhere. This is your country now: shuttered car dealerships next to defunct restaurants across street from thrift stores and methadone clinics. That's America. Community after community, desiccated, empty husks with nothing left. Huge swaths of the United States look like that now. So, what happened? Well, a lot of things happened. Some of them are complicated and hard to change. But one of the big factors in the slow-moving disaster is the utter transformation of the way our leaders think about the American economy. During the last Gilded Age, 125 years ago, America's ruling class may have been ostentatiously rich, and they were. Go to Newport, Rhode Island, for proof, if you like. But it was still a recognizably American class. Tycoons accumulated fortunes, but they also felt some obligation to the country around them. Steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie famously built stone libraries around the country for the edification of people beneath him. John D. Rockefeller and many other so-called robber barons set aside huge portions of their wealth, and in some cases their property, to make this country better. Yellowstone, Acadia National Park, et cetera. Maybe most significantly, in January of 1914, Henry Ford more than doubled the prevailing factory to a then remarkable $5 for an eight-hour day. Ford didn't have to do that. But his company was succeeding, and he thought he should. Some historians trace the creation of the American middle class to that decision. Either way, it is nearly impossible to imagine a big company doing anything like that today. Attitudes are just too different. Your average finance mogul looks at workers merely as costs to be reduced or eliminated entirely. Private equity isn't building a lot of public libraries these days. Instead, the model is ruthless economic efficiency. Buy a distressed company, outsource the jobs, liquidate the valuable assets, fire middle management, and once the smoke is cleared dump what remains to the highest bidder, often in Asia. It's happened around the country. It has made a small number of people phenomenally rich. One of them is a New-York-based hedge fund manager called Paul Singer who according to Forbes has amassed a personal fortune of more than $3 billion. How has Singer made that money? Well, he made a lot of it by purchasing sovereign debt from financially distressed countries, countries that were in trouble, usually at a massive discount. Once a country's economy regains some stability Singer would bombard its government with lawsuits of a massive public relations campaign originating here in Washington sometimes until he made his money back with interest. The practice is called vulture capitalism feeding off the carcass of a dying nation. In some ways it's not so different from what Singer and his firm, Elliott Management, have done in this country and to this country. Over the past couple of decades Elliott Management has made billions by buying large stakes in American companies then firing workers driving up short-term share prices and, in some cases, taking government bailouts, insult to injury. Bloomberg News once described Singer as \"the world's most feared investor.\" And that tells you a lot. No one's even pretending Paul Singer's tactics are good for anyone but Paul Singer and his fund. Consider the case of Delphi, the automotive parts supplier. During the last financial crisis, a consortium of hedge funds, including Singer's Elliott Management, purchased Delphi. With Singer and the other funds at the helm, the company took billions of dollars in government bailouts paid for by you. Obama's auto czar compared those tactics to extortion, but they continued anyway. Once they had the bailout money the funds moved most of Delphi's jobs overseas and then either cut retiree pensions entirely or shifted the cost to taxpayers with later financial commitments at home and cheap factories abroad Delphi's stock soared. According to investigative reporter Greg Palast, of the 29 Delphi plants in operation when the hedge fund started buying Delphi's debt, only four were still operating in the United States by 2012. That means tens of thousands of unionized and white-collar workers lost their jobs. Paul Singer's hedge fund cashed out for more than a billion dollars. See how that works? Well, some countries, including the United Kingdom, have banned this kind of behavior. It bears no resemblance whatsoever to the capitalism we were promised in school. It creates nothing. It destroys entire cities. It couldn't be uglier or more destructive. So, why is it still allowed in the United States? The short answer: because people like Paul Singer have tremendous influence over our political process. Singer himself was the second largest donor to the Republican Party in 2016. He's given millions to a SuperPAC that supports Republican senators. You may never have heard of Paul Singer, which tells you a lot in itself, but in Washington he is rockstar famous and that may be why he's almost certainly paying a lower effective tax rate than your average fireman, just in case you're still wondering if our system is rigged. Oh, yeah, it is. Tonight, we want to tell you a little more about how Paul Singer does business. The story begins in a small town called Sidney, Nebraska, population 6,282. Two hours outside Denver, Sidney is the long-time home of a sporting goods retailer Cabela's, which sells fishing and hunting gear. In October of 2015 Singer's hedge fund disclosed an 11 percent stake in Cabela's and set about pushing the board to sell the company. Cabela's management apparently fearing a long and costly fight with Singer announced it would look for a buyer. Now at the time Cabela's was a relatively healthy company. It was posting nearly $2 billion a year in gross profits off $4 billion in revenue. There didn't seem to be any immediate need to sell but Cabela's sold anyway after being pushed. So, one year after Singer entered the equation Bass Pro Shops announced the purchase of Cabela's. The company's stock price surged. Within a week literally a week Paul Singer cashed out. He bought the stock for $38 a share. He sold it for $63 a share. His hedge fund made at least $90 million up front and likely more over time. But in Sidney, Nebraska, it was a very different story. The residents of Sidney did not get rich. Oh no. Just the opposite. Their community was devastated, destroyed. The town lost nearly 2,000 jobs; a heartbreakingly familiar cascade began. People left. Property values collapsed and then people couldn't leave. They were trapped there. One of the last thriving small towns in this country went under. We recently sent two producers to Sidney, Nebraska to survey the wreckage there and to consider what happened. Our producers talked to more than a dozen former Cabela's employees. Almost all of them refused to speak to us on camera fearful of legal retribution from the famously vicious Paul Singer, but off camera they told us their story. Here it is."

Then we called Sasse' office to see if they could point to a time where he commented on the destruction of Sidney or simply supply a statement to us about what happened there, but Ben Sasse' office didn't even respond to our producers. Huh. That's odd. But then here's one possible explanation for that. During his Senate run, Ben Sasse received the largest possible donation from Paul Singer.

Ukrainian officials, they leaked information that exposed some apparent corruption by Paul Manafort, and it was consequential. It led to Paul Manafort's resignation from the Trump campaign. And the stated intent of Ukrainian officials was to weaken the Trump campaign because they wanted to help elect Hillary Clinton. And, you know, it's strange to see pundits pretending that that didn't happen. And what they're trying to do is conflate that with a different theory by Ukrainian meddling, which is not proven. It's true. And that is the one that Trump tried to put forward in this phone call with Zelensky, where he appears to be saying that it wasn't Russia that was behind the hacking of the DNC and that it might have been Ukraine. It's true there's no evidence for that theory. And though it's fair enough to point out that. But what's also ironic here is that the people who are indignant about that claim by Trump are accepting the claim that Russia hacked the DNC, even though there's been no evidence yet. There have been claims by intelligence officials, but those same intelligence officials gave us the whole scam that was the Trump Russia collusion [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."

But you've really followed this carefully. At this moment., December 3, 2013, we still don't have actual evidence that the Russian government hacked the DNC?"

And we have an indictment from Robert Mueller, but that indictment, as I've written about real clear investigations, has serious holes. So, you know, Trump raises this theory in this phone call with Zelensky that it might have been Ukraine. What I think Trump should do and what I think all journalists should be calling for is let the public see for ourselves what the underlying evidence is. We've been told by discredited intelligence officials that it was Russia. That intelligence should be released so everybody can judge for themselves."

They can shield themselves with taxpayer-funded bodyguards, but normal people aren't so lucky. U.S. cities are being plagued by a surge, for example, of mob-based crime, big crowds of people who work together to loot stores or target vulnerable individuals. Here in Washington attacks like this are up 50 percent over the past year. A local television station recently chronicled the problem. Watch this."

You know, we see in the same problem spreading from our once great cities which are increasingly becoming more third world and dystopian flowing from one city to the next. So you see the same problems, the same violence, the same crime, the same homelessness, addiction, spreading from New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and it -- we -- you can trace it back to essentially what's being established as this sort of progressive collection of city states that instead of their leaders, their mayors, their municipal leaders caring about the places they've been elected to manage, they are looking outward. They're ideologues. They're not city managers. They care about climate change and social justice and their ambitions are global. They're not even national or local. They're not the 21st Century CEOs that our dying cities desperately need. They are -- they behave more like smarmy televangelists and aloof 17th Century monarchs. And look what's happening. Our cities are falling into chaos because they don't know how to manage these places and criminal justice is only one area and you were right to bring up police -- law enforcement being castrated effectively."
