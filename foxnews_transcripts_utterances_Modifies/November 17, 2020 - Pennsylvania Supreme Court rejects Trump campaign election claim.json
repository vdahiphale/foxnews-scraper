Then, Senator Rand Paul and his wife, Kelley, are here to talk about those violent clashes that we saw in D.C. If it was a case of deja vu, don't blame them for having it.  And then the Georgia secretary of state presser. Of course, they have to have all those hand-counted ballots in late tomorrow night. Will they be able to achieve that, amid some of the criticism the secretary of state is getting increasingly from Republicans? The guy can't win.

And for days now, Georgia's secretary of state has been defending the election process here against all types of allegations online and even coming from the president.   Of course, one of the big topics is signatures. Georgia's secretary of state says it has a multistep-process to verify someone's signature before they vote here in this state. And also, for days now, Georgia's secretary of state has been emphasizing here that the elections are safe and secure. He says that is a part of the ongoing audit here. All of the election machines were checked in this state, and no fraud was found. Now, in Floyd County, Georgia, there were about 2,500 ballots that were not initially tallied. The president gained about 800 votes from that new tally, reducing Joe Biden's statewide lead from the initial count of about   15,000 votes. Georgia's secretary of state offices those 2,500 uncounted ballots were an amazing blunder, and the Floyd County elections director did not upload the votes from a memory card.",

      "sentences": "Neil, good afternoon to you.  The White House was really sort of buoyed by the news yesterday that they found 2,600 votes that hadn't been counted, thinking that, well, if it's a problem with Floyd County, which leans heavily toward President Trump, maybe it's a problem in other counties as well. But they have not found anything else since, though the Trump campaign in a statement did say -- quote -- \"The Trump campaign will continue to fight in the state of Georgia until every instance of voter fraud is rooted out and all previously uncounted ballots are tallied.\" What's interesting about the findings in Georgia, historically speaking, Neil, is that if you remember back to the year 2000 election, Bush v. Gore, it was 537 votes that separated the two candidates in the state of Florida.   If they had found what they found in Georgia, 800 votes going to President Trump, that would have been enough to turn the 2000 election. However, the vote margin for Joe Biden was about 14,000 there in Georgia.  So, the 800 votes reduces it somewhat, but only to about 13,000 and a little bit. So that means that President Trump would still have to find a whole lot of votes that aren't necessarily out there anyway, as this vote canvass continues.  It was significant to find 2,600 votes, but, unfortunately for the Trump campaign, that's all they have been able to find so far. Trey Gowdy, though, the former congressman from South Carolina, saying this morning that this vote count does need to go. Here's the reason why. Listen here.",

There was a recess called in the Florida district -- in the Florida -- in the federal district court hearing in Pennsylvania where Rudy Giuliani was arguing on behalf of the Trump campaign against a motion to dismiss a Trump campaign lawsuit. The recess was caused because of a technical error. We don't know when that's going to restart or how long it's going to take before that hearing is over. If the judge grants the state's motion to dismiss, that will be a big blow for the Trump campaign.  But if it goes to trial, that could put some wind in the president sails. And then there is the Clark County, Nevada, case where a county commissioner's race is going to have to be run again because of discrepancies in ballots.   The Trump campaign arguing, the Clark County officials don't have confidence in their own ballots, maybe they should rerun the presidential election in that district, which is District C of Clark County. So, still a lot of arguments left to be made, Neil.  I'm being told that there's no rush to get this over with on the part of the Trump campaign, that they think that the hard deadline is December the 14th. They want to wait and see when a lot of these state certifications come in. California is doesn't come into December the 11th. So we could be here for a while yet -- Neil.",

And, as a matter of fact, as your reporter talked about there, the early audit of those machines found that everything, the machines themselves worked.

The situation is, because of the audit, we found this. We saw some potentials on this. And, again, this is where the county had a couple places where they should have been able to see it, one, the absentee voter file reconciliation. They obviously didn't do that. Two, the check-ins. They didn't check that. And then, three, the tabulator screen on the election management system has a box that's checked or unchecked, depending on whether the card has been uploaded or accounted for. So, there were several spots where the human beings who were running just didn't follow the procedure. And that's why this happens. But this is why you have the audit, to discover these things. Now, let me frame this up with a couple of other items. The -- we have 57 counties that are flat out at zero deviations from the ballot counts that they started with. That's 57. We have 21 other counties that are either plus one or minus one off of the original count that they had. So, that's 78 that are basically spot on. We have another 32 counties that are in single digits that they're off. So, they're finalizing that, looking, did they miscalculate something? Did they switch data entry, things along those lines?  But single digits is not that much to be concerned about on these things, but we're trying to get it as right as we can, but to prove the outcomes are proper and correct.  Now, again, I want to frame up how the audit works. We saw that Fulton was done with the audit and DeKalb was done with the audit. They were done with the first phase of the audit, which is the hand counting. Then you have to go to the data entry side, where we have a lot of quality control measures. Did you put the numbers in properly? Did you get every batch? Did you transpose any numbers? Did you forget to put a number from the tally sheet into the data entry? Now, for larger counties, there's more pieces of paper. It's going to take more time. And, again, as we have been saying repeatedly, the human beings that are part of this are the weakest link in the whole system. But that's why there's these checks and double-checks and triple-checks that we do before we finalize the audit phase of this.  And that's why this...",

I believe this is Bill (sic) Sterling, the implementation manager, going through the mechanics of how this count has produced some variation from the machine count here, but not by enough to close the gap. In other words, there was about a 14,000 gap in total votes there that has narrowed, according to him, to about 12,929. I think I got that correct here that. Whether that is going to change as the count goes on is anyone's guess here. He didn't seem to intimate that was a possibility.   But back to Reid Wilson, The Hill correspondent. Reid, I'm sorry for interrupting you for that. But it doesn't look, to your earlier point, like this is changing the overall math. Now, it could, and they're counting this fairly rapidly. But if it turns out that Georgia has indeed gone to Joe Biden, how does this set up other actions being taken in other states, because this was supposed to be a leaping board to other potential counts, legal arguments, et cetera?",

And, in fact, in Pennsylvania, they have had to go through a couple of different legal teams. Now, as I think John Roberts said, we have got Rudy Giuliani, who's stepped in to take over for other legal teams that have quit the case.

On the Democratic side, I mean, Democrats don't do typically as well in run-off elections as they do in general elections. Back in 2008, there was a run-off after President Obama won, a Republican and a Democrat pretty closely matched together in November, and the Republican went on to win by 17 points. So, Democrats have their own challenge in getting their own voters back to the polls even after they have won the presidency, which will take a little that sort of immediacy away from the urge to vote.",

But, as soon as they become not peaceful, arrest the people and put them in jail. One of the people that assaulted my wife and I bloodied a police officer. He required stitches. But you know what the D.C. judicial system did? They released him on his own recognizance. The thing is, there are violent people in these mobs. And they have to be arrested every time, and they have to be punished. And it's not very hard to separate out violent from nonviolent. And peaceful protests can go on. But when they're not peaceful, you have got to arrest people. But, like in Portland, they just weren't arresting anybody. So it gets worse.

But now you have about a third of the vote in Georgia came in by mail. And we should verify it. So, what I have advocated for is do a random sampling of about 2,000 people from Fulton County, and actually ask them, did you vote? Check on the signature. Check each ballot in a way in which you were contesting whether they're valid or not. And, if out of 2,000, you get two or three, that's not enough to overturn the election. But if you do a random sample of 2,000, and you find 100 bad ballots, you multiply that out, that is plenty to change the election. But I think the best way to figure this out and the best way to give Republicans assurance that it was legitimate is, let's do some real random sampling, not just counting the votes, but actually seeing if these people actually voted and if it was them.",

As Rand said, after we were assaulted in the most horrific and terrifying night of my life, the AP claimed, again, that our claim was without evidence, and said that the police officer who was literally having to hold a bike out as a barricade was only jostled, as if he were inadvertently bumped on a subway car or something, instead of a violent mob that he was desperately trying to hold back and help us get into our hotel, because we could not move at all as they were screaming things.

The Trump campaign has lost yet another legal challenge here in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in a 5-2 opinion that the Philadelphia Board of Elections did not break the law in keeping poll watchers from both parties a certain distance away from the mail-in ballot counting because the election code does not actually specify a minimum distance that these poll watchers need to be at. This is a blow to the Trump campaign, which has been arguing that Republican poll watchers were illegally not given meaningful access to the mail-in ballot counting, and so, therefore, more than 700,000 ballots in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh should be tossed out. In fact, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani is currently inside a federal courtroom in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, arguing that the commonwealth's mail-in voting system is unconstitutional, in large part because they claim that poll watchers were kept from meaningful access to watch the mail-in ballot counting. He claimed in court today that up to 1.5 million ballots could be invalidated because observers didn't get access statewide. He said, in court, he has 300 affidavits and photos of observers being kept too far away from the counting. The secretary of state is arguing in that case that this is all speculative and that this case should be dismissed. We're expecting a federal judge to make a decision on whether or not he will dismiss that case. There's been a technical difficulty issue in court. So that has been delayed right now. But the bottom line is, is that the Trump campaign in this federal lawsuit is trying to block the certification of the final results here in Pennsylvania. That deadline is November 23. And here in Philadelphia, Neil, the final results of the mail-in ballot count will be announced tonight at 10:00 p.m., which will officially start the clock for certification -- Neil.",

Biden's team had to bring in outside experts to discuss the country's readiness to respond to threats without access to real-time information. It highlights vulnerabilities as a result of the White House refusal to coordinate. Democrats and Republicans have said Biden should be getting access to the briefings, with lawmakers on both sides citing the 9/11 Commission report, which stated that the delayed transition between Presidents Bush -- or Clinton and Bush left officials less prepared than they could have been for the September 11 terror attacks. And, yesterday, Biden said he's been managing without the briefings because vice president-elect Kamala Harris is still receiving intelligence briefings as a member of the Senate Intel Committee.

So, to go from 25 percent capacity to less than that, or just complete the bans or early shutdowns, these small businesses have suffered so much this year.

And for days now, Georgia's secretary of state has been defending the election process here against all types of allegations online and even coming from the president. Of course, one of the big topics is signatures. Georgia's secretary of state says it has a multistep-process to verify someone's signature before they vote here in this state. And also, for days now, Georgia's secretary of state has been emphasizing here that the elections are safe and secure. He says that is a part of the ongoing audit here. All of the election machines were checked in this state, and no fraud was found. Now, in Floyd County, Georgia, there were about 2,500 ballots that were not initially tallied. The president gained about 800 votes from that new tally, reducing Joe Biden's statewide lead from the initial count of about 15,000 votes. Georgia's secretary of state offices those 2,500 uncounted ballots were an amazing blunder, and the Floyd County elections director did not upload the votes from a memory card."

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon to you. The White House was really sort of buoyed by the news yesterday that they found 2,600 votes that hadn't been counted, thinking that, well, if it's a problem with Floyd County, which leans heavily toward President Trump, maybe it's a problem in other counties as well. But they have not found anything else since, though the Trump campaign in a statement did say -- quote -- \"The Trump campaign will continue to fight in the state of Georgia until every instance of voter fraud is rooted out and all previously uncounted ballots are tallied.\" What's interesting about the findings in Georgia, historically speaking, Neil, is that if you remember back to the year 2000 election, Bush v. Gore, it was 537 votes that separated the two candidates in the state of Florida. If they had found what they found in Georgia, 800 votes going to President Trump, that would have been enough to turn the 2000 election. However, the vote margin for Joe Biden was about 14,000 there in Georgia. So, the 800 votes reduces it somewhat, but only to about 13,000 and a little bit. So that means that President Trump would still have to find a whole lot of votes that aren't necessarily out there anyway, as this vote canvass continues. It was significant to find 2,600 votes, but, unfortunately for the Trump campaign, that's all they have been able to find so far. Trey Gowdy, though, the former congressman from South Carolina, saying this morning that this vote count does need to go. Here's the reason why. Listen here."

      "utterance": "I mean, we should have zero margin for error in something as important as our presidential election.

It is making sure the next election, this one and the next one, we can all have confidence in it."

There was a recess called in the Florida district -- in the Florida -- in the federal district court hearing in Pennsylvania where Rudy Giuliani was arguing on behalf of the Trump campaign against a motion to dismiss a Trump campaign lawsuit. The recess was caused because of a technical error. We don't know when that's going to restart or how long it's going to take before that hearing is over. If the judge grants the state's motion to dismiss, that will be a big blow for the Trump campaign. But if it goes to trial, that could put some wind in the president sails. And then there is the Clark County, Nevada, case where a county commissioner's race is going to have to be run again because of discrepancies in ballots. The Trump campaign arguing, the Clark County officials don't have confidence in their own ballots, maybe they should rerun the presidential election in that district, which is District C of Clark County. So, still a lot of arguments left to be made, Neil. I'm being told that there's no rush to get this over with on the part of the Trump campaign, that they think that the hard deadline is December the 14th. They want to wait and see when a lot of these state certifications come in. California is doesn't come into December the 11th. So we could be here for a while yet -- Neil."

I believe right now, Bill (sic) Sterling, the implementation manager in Atlanta, is going through sort of the administrative process here and how this is done, ahead of the secretary of state. But, Reid, we have ever had five million votes are being hand-counted. They do, by and large, jibe with the machine count that we had earlier in the state that led us to this. I'm just wondering, tomorrow night at midnight, when all the votes are in, is it your understanding that there won't be a dramatic shift here?"

    {
      "speaker": "REID WILSON, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's very unlikely. When we're talking about recounts, even of so many ballots, recounts change a few dozen votes, maybe 100 votes. They don't change thousands of votes. It's not as if these machines were counting so many votes inaccurately. And, as a matter of fact, as your reporter talked about there, the early audit of those machines found that everything, the machines themselves worked. So it doesn't appear that there's some big well of votes that's suddenly going to come to President Trump's aid. They just don't exist."

    {
      "speaker": "GABRIEL STERLING, GEORGIA VOTING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION MANAGER",
      "utterance": "We were looking at a margin of 13,378. The net gain for the president on this memory card is 449 for a new total of 12,929. So, that is where we stand right now. The situation is, because of the audit, we found this. We saw some potentials on this. And, again, this is where the county had a couple places where they should have been able to see it, one, the absentee voter file reconciliation. They obviously didn't do that. Two, the check-ins. They didn't check that. And then, three, the tabulator screen on the election management system has a box that's checked or unchecked, depending on whether the card has been uploaded or accounted for. So, there were several spots where the human beings who were running just didn't follow the procedure. And that's why this happens. But this is why you have the audit, to discover these things. Now, let me frame this up with a couple of other items. The -- we have 57 counties that are flat out at zero deviations from the ballot counts that they started with. That's 57. We have 21 other counties that are either plus one or minus one off of the original count that they had. So, that's 78 that are basically spot on. We have another 32 counties that are in single digits that they're off. So, they're finalizing that, looking, did they miscalculate something? Did they switch data entry, things along those lines? But single digits is not that much to be concerned about on these things, but we're trying to get it as right as we can, but to prove the outcomes are proper and correct. Now, again, I want to frame up how the audit works. We saw that Fulton was done with the audit and DeKalb was done with the audit. They were done with the first phase of the audit, which is the hand counting. Then you have to go to the data entry side, where we have a lot of quality control measures. Did you put the numbers in properly? Did you get every batch? Did you transpose any numbers? Did you forget to put a number from the tally sheet into the data entry? Now, for larger counties, there's more pieces of paper. It's going to take more time. And, again, as we have been saying repeatedly, the human beings that are part of this are the weakest link in the whole system. But that's why there's these checks and double-checks and triple-checks that we do before we finalize the audit phase of this. And that's why this..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we're going to continue monitoring this. I believe this is Bill (sic) Sterling, the implementation manager, going through the mechanics of how this count has produced some variation from the machine count here, but not by enough to close the gap. In other words, there was about a 14,000 gap in total votes there that has narrowed, according to him, to about 12,929. I think I got that correct here that. Whether that is going to change as the count goes on is anyone's guess here. He didn't seem to intimate that was a possibility. But back to Reid Wilson, The Hill correspondent. Reid, I'm sorry for interrupting you for that. But it doesn't look, to your earlier point, like this is changing the overall math. Now, it could, and they're counting this fairly rapidly. But if it turns out that Georgia has indeed gone to Joe Biden, how does this set up other actions being taken in other states, because this was supposed to be a leaping board to other potential counts, legal arguments, et cetera?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, President Trump's legal team is rapidly running out of options. In the main states where they are challenging election results or alleging that something is wrong, they have yet to prove anything in a court of law. And, in fact, several of the Trump campaign's lawyers have said to the effect, we are not alleging fraud in some of these cases that are -- that are being argued. And, in fact, in Pennsylvania, they have had to go through a couple of different legal teams. Now, as I think John Roberts said, we have got Rudy Giuliani, who's stepped in to take over for other legal teams that have quit the case. So, President Trump's legal options here were always going to be narrow. They are closing off very rapidly as we get towards those certifications that, as you say, are coming in the next days and weeks."

What's your sense of how things are going there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it certainly could. And one thing that the secretary of state in Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, said earlier today was that there were about 24,000 Republican voters who voted by absentee in the primary, and then did not vote in the general election, when absentee rules were tighter in November. And those 24,000 voters, that is the difference between Joe Biden carrying the state by, what did you say, 12,900 and President Trump carrying the state."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILSON",
      "utterance": "So, if Republican voters are going to sit on the sidelines, either because they're depressed that President Trump has lost or they didn't show -- they don't vote by absentee, and then something comes up on Election Day itself, well, then those two Republican senators are going to have a problem in Georgia. On the Democratic side, I mean, Democrats don't do typically as well in run-off elections as they do in general elections. Back in 2008, there was a run-off after President Obama won, a Republican and a Democrat pretty closely matched together in November, and the Republican went on to win by 17 points. So, Democrats have their own challenge in getting their own voters back to the polls even after they have won the presidency, which will take a little that sort of immediacy away from the urge to vote."

They know a thing or two about some of the violence that we have seen at some rallies, particularly this latest rally on behalf of the president on let the count go on in Washington that, by nighttime, it turned into something that probably looked eerily familiar to them. Senator and Mrs. Paul, thank you for joining us. I hope you're doing OK. When you saw what was going on in Washington over the weekend, it did look eerily familiar to what you encountered leaving the White House after the big event and the president's speech there, where you just were knee-deep in protesters.

I have no idea who's attacking who and for what reason. They wouldn't describe that these were people attacking Trump people there supporting the president. They just made it sound like, oh, it was just random violence caused by the Trump protests -- by the Trump rally. This is the same thing that happened to us when we were there.

After -- after the rally, they were in restaurants. They were walking back to their hotels, and they were being mobbed and assaulted by crowds of Antifa and Black Lives Matter shouting horrible things at them, the same thing that they were doing to us. And, again, these aren't folks that were trying to agitate or do anything. They were trying to get back to their hotels. What caused me to tweet out at the AP was the scene of that young girl and her parents. Her big brother had his arm around her. She's like 10 or 11 years old. She's in tears. And she's being screamed at, horrible stuff, by grown men with megaphones. And the whole family looked absolutely terrorized. And I know exactly what that felt like. And it just -- it broke my heart looking at that. And then I saw people sitting in restaurants, and a Black Lives Matter supporter threw a commercial-grade firecracker at them. I mean, what's it going to take for the mainstream media to really report on this? Is somebody going to have to get horribly burned or assaulted? It's just outrageous. These thugs are just roaming the streets and just accosting people who are doing nothing more than trying to get back to their hotels."

But that's not so. It's not just white supremacists. I mean, there -- there are these Antifa and other groups that have anarchy on mind.

Everybody arrested were the people attacking the Trump supporters. There was a mother with her child in a stroller being attacked. These were the anti-Trump people creating the violence entirely. And yet you read AP, and it doesn't even describe who these people are. They say the Trump demonstrations lead to violence. Do you know, when the mob attacked us, and they nearly toppled a policeman, and I helped to stabilize him, the AP reported that, oh, the policeman was jostled? That's not the truth. Whatever happened to the Associated Press, which was supposed to be an objective beacon of truth? So, we complain that there's right and left in our country.

There's got to be a way to avoid that. Passions run deep. They turn violent. There's got to be a way of separating crowds when this sort of happens, because it's happened enough here. And I think it's fair to say, in looking at this, that those who were marching on behalf of Donald Trump and letting the count go on were being very, very well-behaved, and then those, of course, when it turned nightfall, much as we have seen in other incidents, erupted into violence, but that they were seen together. Much as when you guys came out of the White House at the time of the RNC Convention, when the president wrapped up his remarks, they had sort of intermingled and were on top of each other. Unfortunately for you, the guys who didn't share your views were the overwhelming majority. There's got to be a better way to handle this. What do you think?"

And what happened to us and what is happening to that city is that they are actually blocking off streets. And these folks that were attacked, Neil, going to their hotels, were just like us. They weren't actively demonstrating or doing anything. They were just trying to get home, to get to their cars, to sit in restaurants. And these groups are now coming after anybody that they perceive is a Trump -- Trump supporter. And it bothers me so much that Antifa, which is a group that professes to be anti-fascism, but, basically, they want to terrorize, bully, intimidate, and shout down anyone who disagrees with them. And that is the definition and the essence of fascism itself. And they don't care if, as I said, you're a young family with kids. I saw an elderly lady trying to get to her hotel, and she had an American flag. And they're ripping it out of her hands and getting up in her face and flipping her off. These people are thugs. And they need to be denounced. And there need to be more police out in D.C. protecting people who want to eat in restaurants and stay in hotels and come and enjoy D.C., whether they're for a protest or not. I have to say, the last time I was in D.C., I was getting ready to go for a run. And I was afraid. I grabbed a T-shirt out of my drawer, and I was afraid to put it on because it had an American flag on it, just a simple American flag, but I was afraid to wear it in D.C. today."

There have been many peaceful Trump demonstrations, and there have been some peaceful demonstrations for racial justice. There have been. I won't say there haven't been. But, as soon as they become not peaceful, arrest the people and put them in jail. One of the people that assaulted my wife and I bloodied a police officer. He required stitches. But you know what the D.C. judicial system did? They released him on his own recognizance. The thing is, there are violent people in these mobs. And they have to be arrested every time, and they have to be punished. And it's not very hard to separate out violent from nonviolent. And peaceful protests can go on. But when they're not peaceful, you have got to arrest people. But, like in Portland, they just weren't arresting anybody. So it gets worse. Arrest them and put them in jail if they're committing a crime."

So, for example, usually less than 1 percent of people vote absentee. And so it's never been much to change anything except for a very close election. But now you have about a third of the vote in Georgia came in by mail. And we should verify it. So, what I have advocated for is do a random sampling of about 2,000 people from Fulton County, and actually ask them, did you vote? Check on the signature. Check each ballot in a way in which you were contesting whether they're valid or not. And, if out of 2,000, you get two or three, that's not enough to overturn the election. But if you do a random sample of 2,000, and you find 100 bad ballots, you multiply that out, that is plenty to change the election. But I think the best way to figure this out and the best way to give Republicans assurance that it was legitimate is, let's do some real random sampling, not just counting the votes, but actually seeing if these people actually voted and if it was them."

We found 13 people voting from the same household. We found people voting from vacant lots, post office boxes. We found one entire precinct of 2,000 people all the same signature to be signing in. And every vote was for the Democrat. So, this happens in our country. But what we have to do is, you have to either prove it or not prove it. And it is difficult to overturn elections. That's why the best chance of stopping fraud is stopping it before it happens. And I don't know that it did or didn't happen. But I think the best way to know if it happened in Philadelphia and in Atlanta is to do a random sampling large enough that you can apply that conclusion to the whole to see if the election could have been changed."

Are you confident, should Joe Biden take office on January 20, that he can calm things down, that he can kind of detach this polarization going on, or is this just a sign of our times, and, sadly, we're going to see more of it, and, sadly, we're going to see opportunities where you want to go out in the streets of Washington, and you're anxious to?"

He's continuing to kind of buy into this whole polarization thing. And I blame the media as well. As Rand said, after we were assaulted in the most horrific and terrifying night of my life, the AP claimed, again, that our claim was without evidence, and said that the police officer who was literally having to hold a bike out as a barricade was only jostled, as if he were inadvertently bumped on a subway car or something, instead of a violent mob that he was desperately trying to hold back and help us get into our hotel, because we could not move at all as they were screaming things. Everyone needs to really report fairly on what is going on. And I think that Joe Biden needs to also call out these groups by name."

He was referring to the people debating over whether statues should come down, that there was a reasonable argument on both sides. And that has been so misreported. And, see, even AP and, see, so-called objective sources of news misreported that. So, yes, we do need to be honest. And I don't know if things will calm down or not. I want them to. I think, to my colleagues in the Senate, I say, yes, let's calm down, and let's actually talk. When President Obama was president, I was civil. I went to the White House. When President Trump became president, most of the Democrats would not go to the White House. They hated him so much that I think many of them incited the violence. And if you look at the preponderance of violence, it's been anti-Trump. It hasn't been Trump protesters. You have got grandma out there waving a flag, and you have got thugs hitting grandma in the face with a two-by-four. This is not the right committing violence. This is the left committing violence to peaceful people in the streets. And they need to be arrested. If there's anybody on the right that's doing it, arrest them too.

The Trump campaign has lost yet another legal challenge here in Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in a 5-2 opinion that the Philadelphia Board of Elections did not break the law in keeping poll watchers from both parties a certain distance away from the mail-in ballot counting because the election code does not actually specify a minimum distance that these poll watchers need to be at. This is a blow to the Trump campaign, which has been arguing that Republican poll watchers were illegally not given meaningful access to the mail-in ballot counting, and so, therefore, more than 700,000 ballots in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh should be tossed out. In fact, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani is currently inside a federal courtroom in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, arguing that the commonwealth's mail-in voting system is unconstitutional, in large part because they claim that poll watchers were kept from meaningful access to watch the mail-in ballot counting. He claimed in court today that up to 1.5 million ballots could be invalidated because observers didn't get access statewide. He said, in court, he has 300 affidavits and photos of observers being kept too far away from the counting. The secretary of state is arguing in that case that this is all speculative and that this case should be dismissed. We're expecting a federal judge to make a decision on whether or not he will dismiss that case. There's been a technical difficulty issue in court. So that has been delayed right now. But the bottom line is, is that the Trump campaign in this federal lawsuit is trying to block the certification of the final results here in Pennsylvania. That deadline is November 23. And here in Philadelphia, Neil, the final results of the mail-in ballot count will be announced tonight at 10:00 p.m., which will officially start the clock for certification -- Neil."

If there are in the Senate, where it is even tighter, if people go over, and the -- it is a Democratic governor, and they can replace someone right away, I think there's a little bit more leniency there. But, absolutely, these margins are very tight. And if Biden is to get anything done, if Democrats are going to get anything done, those first 100 days are sort of the sweet spot to do it.

I mean, you want enough people to pass your agenda. And as they don't even know if they will have the majority, they're waiting on these Georgia recounts, but even if they win both of those seats, we're talking a 50/50 split, and they would need the vice president to vote with Democrats to approve their agenda. So it is really tight. I mean, it is possible, with some Democrats, if there was -- they were able to nominate someone to replace a Democratic senator very quickly, and it was a Democrat, it might be worth it for Biden, if it was someone he could really put in his Cabinet. But Biden is someone who's been in the government for a very long time. He's got lots of people who want jobs, lots of qualified people, so he doesn't necessarily have to pick a senator."

Mark Zuckerberg was 12 years old when it was created -- obviously, social media and the world has changed since then -- that provides this unique lane of liability protection, with the presumption that they are not publishers, but rather just public billboards.

But, at the end of the day, I think that you're still going to end up with a big push to try to change this odd law, Section 230, that provides this immunity.

And, in California, 75 percent of its counties, representing some 37 million people, are looking at the most stringent lockdown measures they have experienced again since the height of the pandemic. And businesses aren't too happy about this. Protests were happening sporadically and nationwide in places as diverse as Providence, Rhode Island, and all the way to San Diego, California.
