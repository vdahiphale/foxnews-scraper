But it's who's not attending this summit that's raising some eyebrows and what the president's going to do afterward that's got Washington buzzing.  Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  The president is expected to take executive action in about an hour aimed at determining how many people are in the United States as citizens. Already, some Democrats are taking aim at him. Kevin Corke is at the White House with more on this high-stakes battle -- Kevin.",

And I can tell you, they have done a tremendous amount for the veteran community, not just in things like remodeling homes or building homes, but, more importantly, in mental health and traumatic brain injury. Bernie Marcus himself has funded $135 million for the Marcus Institute, for the Shepherd Center here in Atlanta, for the Warrior PATHH program at Boulder Crest Retreat.

And during the middle of the session, we actually began to sag, but buying started to trigger, buying, and then here we are. Interesting enough, Powell also spent a lot of the last two days talking about Libra. That's a proposed cryptocurrency from Facebook. Nobody likes it. Everyone hates it. Consequently, Facebook was lower. So where a lot of technology companies. Nasdaq actually was lower on the day. Nevertheless, it's historic. It's monumental, the Dow Jones industrial average over 27000 for the very first time in history. We will be right back. I'm sorry. We won't be right back. We're going to talk more about this busy day at the White House. President Trump, of course, expected soon to address the process for determining how many people in the U.S. are actually citizens. Earlier, the president took aim at perceived bias on social media. But will this summit that he's holding actually change anything? I want to go to \"Media Buzz\"'s host, Howard Kurtz, who joins us now. President Trump has talked about this a lot. I got to tell you something, Howard. A lot of conservatives, I know, have said they have been targeted.

But, sadly, what we're having to see is, the president's having taken executive action on something that's widely supported by your viewers, but not just your viewers.

So if we're talking about political, maybe perhaps when it was removed in 2010 under the Obama administration, that was the political reason that was actually attached to the census. Here's what I do know. On the debate stage during the second debate, every single Democrat contender for the presidency raised their hand and said, what they believed is that illegal immigrants should get health care. Well, if nothing more, we should have an accurate count so that we can consider the cost as appropriators on addressing that question. I'm not in favor of that. I think that's a terrible idea.

And it probably wouldn't have to be done in 2020, meaning they wouldn't have the time issue of, there's a need to begin printing these forms right now."

And the government dropped the ball by not giving a credible motivation. They said, we need these numbers to enforce the Voting Rights Act. Well, nobody believes that, because the Voting Rights Act, A, is not enforced by them, and, B, it only applies in one quarter of the states. It doesn't apply in the other 75 percent. That wouldn't be a motivation."

That is obviously not what he said verbatim. But that is what we are seeing in the markets. And if you take a look, that certainly pushed the Dow, so never-before-seen 27000. I'm sure if you go down to the New York Stock Exchange, you can get a hat or a T-shirt with that printed on it, Charles. Take a look at some of these stocks that really outperformed on the day. You can see Visa, Cisco, Microsoft. These obviously helped the average make that all-time high. If you look at the ones that held the average back, we're going to put those on your screens. You're going to see 3M, Walgreens and Caterpillar. Those are the ones that held back the average. But when you make a new high, obviously, we're focused more on the green on the screens. Clearly, though, Charles -- and you know this just as well as I do -- this is risk on, right? We saw stocks move higher. We saw gold move higher, even saw Treasury, the prices move higher.

But the American Survey, I'm not sure how much teeth it'll have. I don't know how accurate it will be, because people will have an incentive to either lie or not to respond."

I mean, legally, apparently, you're supposed to answer the American Survey, just as we are the census, but you know how truthful we are. But, again, I think from a commonsense point of view, and all the polls show that most Americans would like to see where just U.S. citizens or counted, and something else that would -- at least we can differentiate who's here, who's not, because isn't that what the census is, after all, trying to get an accurate picture or portrait of America?"

It is a glorious day for democracy when politicians start talking like regular people. And that's what AOC is doing. Nancy Pelosi is saying this message of unity today, but the speaker has also been very critical of some of the freshman congresswomen and congresspeople, period, who have come to the -- to the fray now. So, what I think needs to happen is, she should respect them publicly and probably chastise them privately, so that things like this don't play out on Twitter. This is a new generation, Charles, and they're not hearing the you been here longer than me, so you need to shut up and listen. That's not happening anymore."

And I think you have to tread very lightly when you start to suggest that everyone around you is racist because they're not giving in to your demands. I understand that there's a generational divide here in Congress, and you're starting to see it play out. But you know what? At the end of the day, I think Nancy Pelosi and a lot of these Democrats have coddled, coddled AOC and her sisters in arms, surrounding them when they say inflammatory, incendiary comments, and as though it's OK for them to do that. Now they feel emboldened, and they want to wrest power away from leaders. And I think, Charles, you said the chickens are coming home to roost. I think that's absolutely right here."

Did she miss an opportunity to tamp down on this?"

People like AOC, the congresswoman, is coming strong. She feels as if there is a referendum on party leadership. And, to be quite honest, Charles, that is reflected in the polling data. Individuals who are voting in this Democratic primary have progressed a more progressive standard than that of the gatekeepers, like Speaker Pelosi. So she has a point about where the support should be. I don't agree with AOC on the racism part. I don't think the speaker was singling her out or the group out because they happen to be minority women. I think they happen to be vocal and minority women."

And maybe does AOC represent any of that?"

And so I think carrying on that, well, let's shake things up, let's get some new fresh blood coming in, that could work. The problem is her leadership style, if this is -- if this is what she's signaling her leadership style is going to be. It's not going to be consensual. It's going to be very dictatorial. And when you have a leadership style like that, where you're -- you're saying, oh, we don't want to work with anybody who we don't agree with, and calling out Joe Biden because he says good things about Republicans, then I think you're going to be in some serious leadership trouble."

So, as a wounded veteran -- I lost both my legs in Afghanistan -- the Home Depot foundation has stepped in and helped to make my house in Texas back in 2014 accessible while I waited for two years for the VA to reimburse us for that. So they stepped in and provided that gap opportunity, so I would have accessible home. And then, on top of that, I have ran a military nonprofit and worked at a military nonprofit. And I have been directly involved with both the Marcus Foundation and the Home Depot Foundation. And I can tell you, they have done a tremendous amount for the veteran community, not just in things like remodeling homes or building homes, but, more importantly, in mental health and traumatic brain injury. Bernie Marcus himself has funded $135 million for the Marcus Institute, for the Shepherd Center here in Atlanta, for the Warrior PATHH program at Boulder Crest Retreat. And it's about to come to other places like Camp Southern Ground. The list goes on and on, and the direct impact that Bernie Marcus himself has had. But if you take all that away, a company he's no longer involved in has given away a half-a-billion dollars to help fund veteran home remodels and accessible homes. And one thing that Home Depot does people don't know about, they do a pay gap for any of their employees that deploy overseas. And so there's a lot there. And a lot of it doesn't get bragged about, honestly."

I am going to go buy Under Armour shoes. So, at the end of the day, go buy from brands and businesses that do good things and you support. So if you want to boycott Home Depot because you don't like what one of their former owners is doing with his personal money, that's fine. But for the rest of the Americans in this country, if you would like to support brands and foundations that go out and do good things, Home Depot and the Marcus Foundation or two great places to start. And so I -- if boycotting is your method of civil discourse, then have at it. But for the rest of the country, go out and support something. Go be active, instead of reactive, and go do something good. And that's exactly what Bernie Marcus has done. It's really unfortunate that people are taking one line from an the Atlanta-Journal Constitution article where Bernie Marcus said two things.

And during the middle of the session, we actually began to sag, but buying started to trigger, buying, and then here we are. Interesting enough, Powell also spent a lot of the last two days talking about Libra. That's a proposed cryptocurrency from Facebook. Nobody likes it. Everyone hates it. Consequently, Facebook was lower. So where a lot of technology companies. Nasdaq actually was lower on the day. Nevertheless, it's historic. It's monumental, the Dow Jones industrial average over 27000 for the very first time in history. We will be right back. I'm sorry. We won't be right back. We're going to talk more about this busy day at the White House. President Trump, of course, expected soon to address the process for determining how many people in the U.S. are actually citizens. Earlier, the president took aim at perceived bias on social media. But will this summit that he's holding actually change anything? I want to go to \"Media Buzz\"'s host, Howard Kurtz, who joins us now. President Trump has talked about this a lot. I got to tell you something, Howard. A lot of conservatives, I know, have said they have been targeted.

I just heard a CNN reporter say, oh, critics say this is just a hit job. I'm going to reserve judgment, but I don't know that one single summit, particularly with no TV cameras rolling, can change the culture of these tech giants, none of whom, as you know, have been invited to this summit."

      "utterance": "No, they weren't invited to the summit. I will say I also saw a headline on CNN that the extremists, right-wing extremists are being invited. I had the pleasure of interviewing Deneen Borelli on my show today. And she had a program on YouTube, easily will get over a million hits views every single time. Something went wrong. She pegs it to a speech that she gave at CPAC, and she lost her job doing this. I mean, it's hurt her financially. This is not just political rhetoric or about ideologies. This actually has a real series impact on a lot of people."

      "utterance": "Yes, there are a couple of controversial characters who've been invited to this summit. But I don't want to obscure the larger point here, which is, these Silicon Valley companies were so admired a few years ago. And they have done such a lousy job, say, oh, we're not really media companies, we -- everyone can post what they want. And they have these standards that they don't enforce very consistently. Louis Farrakhan, they just -- Twitter just deleted a tweet that he put up last October in which he called Jews termites. How long does it take to decide that's against the rules, if there are any rules? So the president is right to focus the spotlight on these companies. But if it's a one-sided summit, it's going to draw a lot of criticism."

If ICE agents don't have a warrant -- warrant signed by a judge, a person may refuse to open the door and let them in."

      "utterance": "\"Due to law enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.\" So, just how much risk does tipping off possible raids put our law enforcement in? Former D.C. homicide Detective Ted Williams joins us now. Ted, it's dangerous stuff, I mean, Nancy Pelosi going out on a limb, telling people who may be here illegally when to open the doors, when not to open the doors, to defy the law enforcement officials, and even act as lawyers themselves. Are you concerned?"

      "speaker": "TED WILLIAMS, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I'm very concerned, Charles. What ICE is doing in conducting these operations are crucial. But it is very dangerous. And I got to tell you, President Trump didn't help this when he tweeted about three weeks ago that they were going to conduct these raids. I think this administration needs to let ICE agents be ICE agents, and they need to be protected. And the way you protect them is not by tweeting what they are going to do and when they're going to do it. And, also, someone has possibly leaked to The New York Times that these raids are coming this weekend. That is not the way you protect these ICE agents. You let these ICE agents go on and do their work."

Are you concerned, though, that illegals may be at home saying, I'm not going to open a door, and playing -- acting as their own attorneys, or just taking Nancy Pelosi's word that they don't have to adhere to what these law enforcement agents are asking them to do?"

But what's going to happen here is, now that they know ICE is coming, you're going to have a lot of these people going underground. And they're not going to be successful in getting as many as they would have gotten if they would have done a covert operation."
