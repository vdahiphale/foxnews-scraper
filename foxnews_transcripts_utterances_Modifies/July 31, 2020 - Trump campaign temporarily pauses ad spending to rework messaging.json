Indeed, crime is up in cities like New York where one week in July saw a 277 percent rise in shootings compared to the same time last year. \"The Chicago Sun Times\" reporting that yesterday alone saw 13 people wounded in shootings across Chicago. And in Minneapolis homicides up 94 percent from this time in 2019. This comes as America's prisons are releasing more and more inmates, some convicted of violent crimes, over COVID-19 concerns. For example, in California to Terebea Williams, who was sentenced to 84 years to life in prison for first degree murder in 2001, is now out of prison.  The California Department of Corrections releasing a statement that reads in part, \"Terebea Williams was released under a government code which allows prisoners to be released in the case of an emergency that endangers their life.\" Her release, clearly, devastating the family of Kevin John Ruska, whom Williams murdered back in 1998.   Tonight, the California District Attorney who is sounding the alarm, saying, \"violent people are being released without any input on behalf of the victims.\" But let's begin tonight with John Ruska's his sister, Dena love. And Dena, thank you so much for joining us. We know this has got to be heartrending for you. We just want to let people know that back in 1998 your brother John was carjacked. He was placed into a trunk. He was shot in the abdomen. That wound initially was not fatal. He was driven 700 miles to a hotel were Terebea Williams put him in a chair in a hotel tied him up and he was found dead 10 hours later and now she's been released because of health concerns. It is unbelievable.   DENA LOVE, SISTER OF KEVIN \"JOHN\" RUSKA JR: It's absolutely devastating, and mindboggling that this has happened. And here we are 22 years after his horrific murder and we're it we're right back to it. We're right back in that same place that we were 22 years ago.",

Isaias is forecast to skim the entire Florida Peninsula and mostly remain out in the Atlantic. Many state coronavirus testing sites packed up due to the storm threat. Today, a fourth straight record-breaking day for COVID-19 fatalities. Today's new case numbers show 257 deaths and about 9,000 new cases. For the sixth day in a row under 10,000, suggesting the state may be plateauing. Puerto Rico's governor visited some of the damage the tropical storm caused there and the Dominican Republic as well.

A lot of times the last few years we've seen a lot of hurricanes strengthening. This one - the waters plenty warm, but there's a lot of upper level winds that kind of rip apart a storm. It's at least one of the things that will inhibit it, we think, from growing significantly over the next, say, 24 to 48 hours.  Center of this storm right there to the North of Cuba, just to the west of Turks and Caicos and then towards the Bahamas. All of our model are in really good agreement of this kind of curve that you see. It's just that curve hugs the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. and a very slowly deviation one way or the other will have really big impacts.  The hurricane force winds, you stand out 35 miles from the center of the storm. So if the storm gets really close to the coast, you can have hurricane force winds. If you get just a little farther off the coast, you might just see tropical storm force winds.  This is the latest official track as a 5:00 o'clock it did nudge a little bit farther back towards West, getting very, very close to the coast. So this is a Saturday night into Sunday morning, probably at its closest path here in the coast of Florida, possibly could make a little bit of a landfall there. The worst of the energy is going to be to the East side of this, so that's where the worst of energy, storm surge would be. The coast is probably spared from that. But certainly a battering across Florida Coastline tomorrow evening into Sunday morning.  Notice this, by Monday afternoon, we've got some interaction here with the Carolinas. Likely seeing some sort of landfall in the Carolinas. Hurricane, tropical storm, we'll see some impacts there. Definitely a lot of rain. And then notice this, Trace, also moving in across parts of the Northeast and New York, not necessarily as a hurricane and tropical storm, but Tuesday and Wednesday could have very strong winds across parts of the Northeast and a significant amount of rain as well.

Joe Biden over the past couple of days spent about $4 million. The Trump campaign spent very little.

But listen, we have 95 days until this election. 36 days before a lot of people start seeing ballots come in the mail.  So it makes sense that a newly minted campaign manager stepping up from the deputy role and want to look at things and take inventory and figure out where you want to move with some targeting strategic messaging.

Indeed, crime is up in cities like New York where one week in July saw a 277 percent rise in shootings compared to the same time last year. \"The Chicago Sun Times\" reporting that yesterday alone saw 13 people wounded in shootings across Chicago. And in Minneapolis homicides up 94 percent from this time in 2019. This comes as America's prisons are releasing more and more inmates, some convicted of violent crimes, over COVID-19 concerns. For example, in California to Terebea Williams, who was sentenced to 84 years to life in prison for first degree murder in 2001, is now out of prison. The California Department of Corrections releasing a statement that reads in part, \"Terebea Williams was released under a government code which allows prisoners to be released in the case of an emergency that endangers their life.\" Her release, clearly, devastating the family of Kevin John Ruska, whom Williams murdered back in 1998. Tonight, the California District Attorney who is sounding the alarm, saying, \"violent people are being released without any input on behalf of the victims.\" But let's begin tonight with John Ruska's his sister, Dena love. And Dena, thank you so much for joining us. We know this has got to be heartrending for you. We just want to let people know that back in 1998 your brother John was carjacked. He was placed into a trunk. He was shot in the abdomen. That wound initially was not fatal. He was driven 700 miles to a hotel were Terebea Williams put him in a chair in a hotel tied him up and he was found dead 10 hours later and now she's been released because of health concerns. It is unbelievable. DENA LOVE, SISTER OF KEVIN \"JOHN\" RUSKA JR: It's absolutely devastating, and mindboggling that this has happened. And here we are 22 years after his horrific murder and we're it we're right back to it. We're right back in that same place that we were 22 years ago."

Is it a double murderer or is it a triple murderer? I don't know where we go.

I'm quoting here, \"As a society we can never lose sight of the fact that nearly every crime, even those dubbed 'low level', has a victim. Simply dismissing a crime as low levels diminishes the very real and life altering impact that these crimes have on victims lives.\" There should be a conversation about letting, maybe, low level - I don't know, people who are in jail and they've got two weeks to go, three weeks to go, you let them out. Maybe there's a maybe there's a consensus there. But what we're talking about is the fact that you're forgetting about these families who have victims who have been killed and injured by these people who are being set free."

      "speaker": "AIELLO",

And I think one of the other things that is just truly shocking about the process is, unless victims are registered with the California Department of Corrections, they are not going to get notice from the Department of Corrections. So my office receives an e-mail that says, this inmate is going to be released immediately. We are having to track down victims who were told decades ago that their perpetrator would spend the rest of his or her life in prison, and that perpetrator is now being released. And the cruelty and the callousness is just - it's forgivable. And I appreciate the fact that you have allowed Dena to speak up on behalf of her brother and for victims everywhere."

Isaias is forecast to skim the entire Florida Peninsula and mostly remain out in the Atlantic. Many state coronavirus testing sites packed up due to the storm threat. Today, a fourth straight record-breaking day for COVID-19 fatalities. Today's new case numbers show 257 deaths and about 9,000 new cases. For the sixth day in a row under 10,000, suggesting the state may be plateauing. Puerto Rico's governor visited some of the damage the tropical storm caused there and the Dominican Republic as well.

      "utterance": "They'll probably get that sunset back by about Sunday night, so couple of days where we're not going to have it. Here is Isaias. It's still a 75 mile an hour hurricane. A lot of times the last few years we've seen a lot of hurricanes strengthening. This one - the waters plenty warm, but there's a lot of upper level winds that kind of rip apart a storm. It's at least one of the things that will inhibit it, we think, from growing significantly over the next, say, 24 to 48 hours. Center of this storm right there to the North of Cuba, just to the west of Turks and Caicos and then towards the Bahamas. All of our model are in really good agreement of this kind of curve that you see. It's just that curve hugs the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. and a very slowly deviation one way or the other will have really big impacts. The hurricane force winds, you stand out 35 miles from the center of the storm. So if the storm gets really close to the coast, you can have hurricane force winds. If you get just a little farther off the coast, you might just see tropical storm force winds. This is the latest official track as a 5:00 o'clock it did nudge a little bit farther back towards West, getting very, very close to the coast. So this is a Saturday night into Sunday morning, probably at its closest path here in the coast of Florida, possibly could make a little bit of a landfall there. The worst of the energy is going to be to the East side of this, so that's where the worst of energy, storm surge would be. The coast is probably spared from that. But certainly a battering across Florida Coastline tomorrow evening into Sunday morning. Notice this, by Monday afternoon, we've got some interaction here with the Carolinas. Likely seeing some sort of landfall in the Carolinas. Hurricane, tropical storm, we'll see some impacts there. Definitely a lot of rain. And then notice this, Trace, also moving in across parts of the Northeast and New York, not necessarily as a hurricane and tropical storm, but Tuesday and Wednesday could have very strong winds across parts of the Northeast and a significant amount of rain as well.

      "utterance": "With just under 100 days until the election, the Trump campaign is temporarily pausing their ad spending to review and \"fine-tune its messaging.\" The decision comes amid a shakeup of leaders in the campaign. And a recent Fox News poll shows Joe Biden leading the president in three key battleground states. We're talking about Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Minnesota. With us now Hogan Gidley, Trump 2020 Campaign National Press Secretary. Just for context, Hogan - and thank you for joining us. We very much appreciate it. Joe Biden over the past couple of days spent about $4 million. The Trump campaign spent very little. And now we're being told by our Chief White House Correspondent, the reason being is because the campaign wants to make sure the campaign was advertising in the right place, at the right time to the right people. What's the message that's being reworked, Hogan? HOGAN GIDLEY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Well, you make some great points there. But listen, we have 95 days until this election. 36 days before a lot of people start seeing ballots come in the mail. So it makes sense that a newly minted campaign manager stepping up from the deputy role and want to look at things and take inventory and figure out where you want to move with some targeting strategic messaging. So that's exactly what we're doing. And so he pulls them for a few days. I know the DC chattering class and the Beltway bureaucrats and political pundits care so much about that. But who cares, no big deal. We're going up full force with some targeted ad buys the first part of next week, and they're really going to show the difference. Elections are about choices. And when our ads go up, you're going to see Joe Biden's 50 year failed career in elected office, but also that he is an empty vessel, being filled by the socialist wing of his party, the Ilhan Omars, the Rashida Tlaibs, the Bernie Sanders. And they're the ones that are actually pulling in that direction. He's now embraced it, wanting to remake America. Some of the plans he's putting out aren't American at all. They read more like a socialist manifesto and so if I--"

Let me just put up the President's tweet from earlier, if I can, and I'll get your reaction to that. \"We just got 50 percent in Rasmussen, and much higher in our internal polls. We are doing a new ad campaign on Sleepy Joe Biden that will be out on Monday. He has been brought even further Left than Crazy Bernie Sanders ever thought possible.

And writes, quoting, \"We have heard from many customers reaffirming that these name variations are largely viewed in exactly the way they were intended as an attempt to have fun with our product marketing.\" It maintains products that sell will remain on the shelves. With us now Dennis Prager, national host of -- a radio host and author and co-founder of PragerU. Dennis, it's always great to see you."

      "utterance": "I'm wondering if Trader Joe's really stood firm here because they came out first saying, you know, those brands, we were going to change those brands anyway with or without the petition. And now they see this petition only has a few thousand signatures and now they are saying look, we don't -- we don't base our brand names on petitions. So, are they standing firm? Or are they're like, well, nobody really signed up for this?"

      "utterance": "Hey, listen, I don't care why. It is so rare for a company in America to do the right thing. This time, morally right, logically right thing. I don't care what the reason. It is something to celebrate. I want to make a point here that's really critical. I wrote an article which is available obviously for free. I'm not selling anything. It's on the internet. Five arguments that America is not racist. One of them is the amount of nonsense that's declared racist. If you are really racist, if a country really is or a company, then you have real evidence. Uncle Ben is racist. Trader Ming or Trader Jose is racist? Do you understand they have to invent things in order to make the argument that companies or America are racist? This is truly important for people to realize. The Redskins was not racist. American-Indians, Native Americans were polled both by the University of Pennsylvania and the Washington Post. Ninety percent said we have no problem or we like the name Redskins."

She says, quoting here, \"I think that the central issue at the heart of all this is that when any community is not allowed to control or control over their representation harmful stereotypes and caricatures are allowed to be perpetuated.\" Your quick thoughts on that, Dennis."

      "utterance": "The national anthem means different things to different people. I'm glad these guys are unified. But if people, if people don't kneel, they're not a bad person. I want to make that perfectly clear. I'm glad they had unity but if we have a guy who doesn't want to kneel because the anthem means something to him, he should not be vilified."

    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "I mean, Drew Brees had to apologize, Dennis, four times for saying that he respects the flag."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRAGER",
      "utterance": "That's right. It was one of the saddest chapters in American sports history, what Drew Brees ultimately said. Listen, the dishonesty is as bad as the act. Of course, it is an insult to the flag. The notion of, I don't mean to insult the flag when everyone is asked to stand for the anthem and some people deliberately do not, then that is a statement about the anthem. If they do it before the anthem, I have no issue. But if they do it during it. And finally, I just have to say to NBA and NFL and Major League Baseball fans, why you would go to games or watch games where the players announce how despicable you are is a puzzle."
