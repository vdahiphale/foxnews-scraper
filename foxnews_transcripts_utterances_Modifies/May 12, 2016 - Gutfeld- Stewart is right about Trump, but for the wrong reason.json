It's never been about immigration or assimilation. It's been the sense that the country has lost the will to sell itself to the people who come here. We could never tell new arrivals that America was great, for that violated the liberal decree that Stewart himself championed. By mocking our country's goodness, he repeats the blunder that made Trump something no one had ever expected: the new Jon Stewart for an angry, anxious world.",
