While he's met with the president and hopes to find a solution to try to get past this impasse, he's already indicated -- that is, Senator Rand Paul-- that, as far as this latest deal is concerned, he's a no vote, and, furthermore, even against a procedural vote on it scheduled for early next week.  He joins us right now on the phone.  Senator, good to have you.",

The fundamental flaw is that, if you make insurance expensive to buy through regulations, but then tell people they can buy it after they get sick, it leads to the death spiral we have with ObamaCare.  The Republican plan doesn't fix that. In fact, the Republican plan acknowledges the death spiral of ObamaCare will continue.
