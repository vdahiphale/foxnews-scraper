Bret, I think that president and Senate Republican majorities will be on the same page when we get to the point where we need to do another bill. And our red line is going to be liability and protections for those who are brave enough to begin to open up the economy again in the wake of the trial lawyers who are descending already, on hospitals, and doctors, and businesses. As of about a week and a half ago, 771 lawsuits already been filed. So, we're working on a narrowly crafted protection from liability for things directly related to the coronavirus, and that will have to be a part of any package. Because if we really going to get the economy up and going again, people have to be brave enough to begin to engage in economic activity. How about the presence of universities? Are they willing to open up with a fall or are we going to have another period of time, where not only K through 12 students but potentially college students are still at home? All of those questions need to be answered by the fall, liability, and protection will help provide the answer.",

Despite the prosecution and the defense now on agreement, Judge Emmet Sullivan has the final say and he's in no rush to rule. Yesterday, Sullivan appointed former Federal Judge John Gleeson to argue against dismissing the case. Two days before, Gleeson penned a Washington Post op-ed. \"There has been nothing regular about the department's effort to dismiss the Flynn case. The record reeks of improper political influence.\" But in a 2013 court document obtained by Fox News, Gleeson wrote in part, \"The government has near-absolute power to extinguish a case that it has brought.\" Judge Sullivan wants to hear why Flynn should not be held in contempt for perjury. He lied to an FBI agent, pleaded guilty twice, but announced his intention to withdraw the latest plea. But Sullivan's latest move could actually help Flynn with a presidential pardon, especially if the president loses re-election."

      "speaker": "MCCONNELL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's an 1800-page liberal wish list. It strikes me, it's hardly salvageable. Just to give you an example of some of the absurdity, there is money in there for illegal immigrants, it mentions the word, cannabis, of all things, 68 times more than the word jobs, or hire, or mentioned in the entire bill. It's a parade -- the parade of absurdities that can hardly be taken seriously. Let me tell you what I will predict, Bret. Bret, I think that president and Senate Republican majorities will be on the same page when we get to the point where we need to do another bill. And our red line is going to be liability and protections for those who are brave enough to begin to open up the economy again in the wake of the trial lawyers who are descending already, on hospitals, and doctors, and businesses. As of about a week and a half ago, 771 lawsuits already been filed. So, we're working on a narrowly crafted protection from liability for things directly related to the coronavirus, and that will have to be a part of any package. Because if we really going to get the economy up and going again, people have to be brave enough to begin to engage in economic activity. How about the presence of universities? Are they willing to open up with a fall or are we going to have another period of time, where not only K through 12 students but potentially college students are still at home? All of those questions need to be answered by the fall, liability, and protection will help provide the answer."

I think there's a high likelihood we'll do another bill, and I've just indicated what will need to be a part of any bill that actually gets a presidential signature and is brought up and passed by a Republican majority in the Senate."

I talked to the secretary of the Treasury about it yesterday, to the president's chief of staff, and to the president recently about this. I think we all believe that another bill probably isn't going to be necessary. But I'm not prepared today to put a precise date on when that will be. What I can tell you as I told you earlier that it's going to include the liability protections in order to get through the Senate and in order to be signed by the president, and we'll look at what the conditions are in the near future and decide how that ought to be crafted. But it was not going to be a $3 trillion left-wing wish list, like the Speaker is apparently going to try to jam down the throats of her majority either later this week or early next week."

More and more people believe that we can begin to safely engage again, practicing social distancing, wearing masks, which I had on until I stood here in front of the camera.

We have 23 members up, we have a really big class. And the reason we have a really big class is this is the class that took our majority back in 2014. So, we have a lot of people up. 23 up and the Democrats only have 12. This was a challenging cycle from the beginning to the middle, to now.

This is a false choice.\" Biden enjoys a five-point national lead over Trump in a new CNN poll that also finds Biden trailing Trump in critical battleground states. Now he's looking for help -- a running mate. At a virtual fundraiser, he said it will take five to eight weeks to find a woman to join the ticket, and the quote, \"there's about a dozen of them. We're keeping the names quiet because if anyone isn't chosen, I don't want anybody to think it's because there was something that was some liability that existed.\" Tonight he'll give a joint interview with Stacey Abrams after zooming with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer."

A suicide bombing in eastern Afghanistan kills five civilians, wounds at least 29 others. Officials say the attack was aimed at a military compound, but the bomb exploded prematurely. The Taliban is claiming responsibility for that attack. The planned swearing-in ceremony for Israel's new government was postponed today, reportedly because of a dispute over cabinet appointments. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to begin a historic fifth term in office thanks to a controversial power-sharing deal with rival-turned-partner Benny Gantz. The two cooling towers of a former nuclear power plant in southwestern Germany are demolished in a pair of early morning explosions there. The timing of the event was kept under wraps to prevent crowds from gathering during the coronavirus pandemic. Just some of the other stories Beyond our Borders tonight. We'll be right back."

Let's bring in our panel, Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, Susan Page, Washington bureau chief at \"USA Today,\" and \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen. Susan, your thoughts on Dr. Bright's testimony and what came out of it? SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"USA TODAY\": It was really the second testimony we had this week by a scientist raising questions about how the Trump administration has handled this terrible pandemic. And I thought the most alarming thing, at a time when we are seeing some progress, he was warning about the dangers of a big rebound toward the end of the year. That's troublesome, troubling at a time when we are trying to get the country opened up."

      "utterance": "It was. I don't see how this testimony helped anybody. He was complaining that we hadn't done more in January. Even Dr. Fauci was saying in late January that this wasn't going to affect most people. Into February, there were plenty of people saying this wasn't going to affect the whole country. Nobody saw this coming, once in a generation pathogen. All the public health experts thought they had seen this rodeo before. This was going to be like SARS, like avian flu, like swine flu, like Ebola, a serious public health challenge, but not a once-in-a-lifetime pathogen that shuts down our entire country. And so the president is trying to do something very difficult, which is handle a once- in-a-generation challenge, and we should be all finding ways to support him and move it forward, not criticize him from the sidelines."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Meantime, Jason, Thursday is usually a bad day lately because you get the weekly jobless claims. Another 3 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. That's the eight-week total to 36.5 million. It's an astonishing number. And that's why a lot of these governors are trying to figure out how to open safely. JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes, and I think it's going to be a rolling process, Bret. And I don't think the places in the country where the virus has hit hardest should be determining when the rest of the country opens up. This is something that's going to be determined locally. I think it's best that it's a decentralized process. And I also think that people are going to feel more comfortable or less comfortable given where they live in the country, and in some places, not until there is no vaccine or at least an antiviral drug available are people going to be comfortable going back to work or sending their kids back to school or resuming their economic activities. But that should be done on a state and city and local level. Washington can offer some guidance, but this can't be a one-size-fits-all plan to reopen."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Susan, the Senate Majority Leader saying this House Speaker, Democrat House bill is essentially a nonstarter, but saying that there will likely be other legislation, not saying when, but liability protection is his redline, and the president's as well."

      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "It's interesting he didn't close the door on it. He suggested he was likely to agree to another spending bill. That was significant, I thought. But the idea of liability protection is one that really divides the Republicans from the Democrats. Democrats worry that liability protection means that you're not going to take of workers, that it's a get-out-of- jail-free card for big business. So that may be the subject of some really intense negotiation if they're going to reach a deal."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "I think he's absolutely right on liability protection. We need it. We need to help these businesses reopen. We are asking them to do something inherently risky, which is restart their operations and help us restart the economy before the pandemic has been defeated. That has massive risks to all of them. When we asked them to shut down, we helped them mitigate the economic risk by providing $2.6 trillion in aid. Now we need to help them mitigate the legal risk by providing them with limited, targeted, temporary protections that will expire when the COVID emergency is over. It seems perfectly reasonable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Jason, the other thing, what's interesting was the politics, I think. He is obviously concerned about the map for the Senate, 23 Republicans up for reelection. And they have got some races that are really kind of going the other way to the point where he is still trying to recruit Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to run in that Kansas Senate race, not to much avail, yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RILEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is about the map, Bret, but on both sides. I think Nancy Pelosi and the House put forward this document with that map in mind as well. And I don't really see it as a serious piece of legislation. I see it as a campaign document, and something they want to use to go after Republicans with in the fall. They want to say if Republicans aren't for this, they are heartless, they don't care, they are mean-spirited, and so forth. And I think they are trying to bait McConnell and the Republicans into going along instead of facing that sort of criticism. But I'm glad that McConnell is pushing back. There's a lot of stuff in here, particularly things that they are doubling down on that we know don't work from the first two or three iterations of this legislation, like the bonus in unemployment insurance, which we now know is paying more money to stay home than their employers can pay them to come back to work. That's completely counterproductive. It's set to phase out, and the Democrats want to extend it. They also want a bailout states that have been behaving very irresponsibly in terms of funding their pensions and so forth, for years, and now want to say that all their financial problems are due to this virus. That is not something McConnell should go along with."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. I think this has turned out to be a red versus blue kind of issue, which is not something I would've predicted before we got to this point. And we saw protests in the three most crucial states, today, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan."

      "utterance": "Finally tonight, some good news from around the globe. A mayor in New Zealand did his first bungee jump in 10 years to celebrate the easing of most of the country's lockdown restrictions. That country moved to stage two of COVID-19 restrictions today. Most gatherings there will be limited to 10 people, social distancing guidelines will remain, so bungee away. And an operations manager at a cleaning company in Belgium wanted to put his unused cranes to work. He saw it in other countries being used, so he put his cranes at nursing homes in several Belgium towns so people can visit their relatives at the windows. I love that.
