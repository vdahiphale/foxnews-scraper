Kat, some in the conservative media are not siding with Donald Trump on this. For example, Wall Street Journal editorial page, the election wasn't stolen yet Mr. Trump wants an endorsement of his stolen claim to be litmus test for every Republican candidate. National Review, the Republican Party is so under the thumb of Trump consistently acknowledging reality about the election disqualifies somebody from leadership.

This was about Russia. The three reporters, Ellen Nakashima, Greg Miller, and Adam Entous, had written a story based on classified U.S. intelligence intercepts involving then Senator Jeff Session having a post-election conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. It can, of course, be illegal to leak such information. The Justice Department now says it followed the established procedures and the targets of these investigations are not the news media recipients but rather those with access to the national defense information who provided it to the media and thus failed to protect it as lawfully required. Acting Post editor Cameron Barr says the paper is deeply troubled by this use of government power. Joining us now is Mike Emanuel, Fox's chief Washington correspondent. Mike, the Trump administration is not the first administration to go after reporters' records in a leaked investigation, but since this was approved by Bill Barr and involved the reporting of the Russia probe that was aimed at President Trump and his inner circle, it could, of course, be viewed as political.",

Adding to the drama, it was about a meeting with then campaign advisor Jeff Sessions, who went on to become the attorney general when the articles were published. He was attorney general of the United States, and a couple weeks later, he announced he was going to crack down on a culture of leaking. And so he was not lying about that. Clearly, he was serious about going after the leakers. I'm not going to defend whether folks should leak classified information or not, but as a journalist, you tell your sources, hey, I am going to protect you, I'm not giving up your name for anything, but when big brother reaches over you, goes through your call records and has phone numbers and the length of time of the calls, it probably doesn't take long for the Justice Department to figure out with whom you're speaking, who might have had access to this classified information. And so as a reporter, you feel like you're pretty much naked. Your call records are out there and the government is going through them.",

If you cover the Bush administration as I did and remember the intense animosity that many journalists had toward Dick Cheney, especially over the Iraq war, it's kind of head-snapping to see the praise being hit on anyone with that last name. The Wyoming congresswoman, like her dad, is very conservative and takes a hawkish line on foreign policy. But she is in rhetorical war with Donald Trump and thus is getting strange new respect from the press. House Republicans with strong backing from Trump plan to dump Cheney from her number three leadership post this weekend. She has essentially abandoned the fight. Now, while critics say Cheney is stubborn, she is also taking a stance based on principles. She says the 2020 election was not stolen, putting her at odds with the former president, many GOP lawmakers, and millions of Trump voters. While Trump's claims of widespread fraud remain unproven, this has become a litmus test in the party and the media are laser-focused on Cheney because all of this is a proxy war for the GOP's future, and it reminds me of Mitt Romney, of John Bolton, of Michael Cohen and others who got awful press in the past until the pundits could cast them as leading voices in the Trump resistance. I'm Howard Kurtz. This is MEDIABUZZ.

But -- and all those liberal pundits might be having a field day with this. This is a huge, important story because the Republican Party is being asked and Liz Cheney won't stop asking the question whether or not they believe that the 2020 election was legitimate and that Joe Biden won it legitimately. If you have a party whose vast majority doesn't believe that, it is pretty hard to see how we can proceed with the stable democracy."

The question before us now, she says, is whether we will join Trump's crusade to delegitimize and undo the legal outcome of the 2020 election. Kat, the Guardian is calling Liz Cheney a martyr. But even if you're a journalist who thinks that she is standing up and courageously, you know, doing this at substantial risk to her own career, aren't Republicans in the House entitled to have somebody in a leadership position who agrees with most of their conference?"

He is not out there speaking all the time. But at the same time, he is still the focal point of so many conversations and this rift particularly in the GOP where obviously any time, you know, you break from your party, it is going to be a huge news story. People are going to be talking about it. But there is this unique sort of passion. It is just crazy.

He goes on to say this reminds him of Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, Russia, Russia, Russia, impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two.

      "speaker": "LIASSON",

His metric of success has always been how much he can dominate the media narrative, how many clicks he is getting and eyeballs, and that is what he wants to do. And as far as him being on social media, there is nothing stopping Donald Trump from summoning a group of cameras to Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster any time he wants. He can be on television all day every day if that is what he wants. So he is driving this. He wants to perpetuate what I believe is a lie, it is false, that he actually won the 2020 election, sometimes he says in a landslide. He is asking every Republican to choose whether they're with him on that or not."

Now, just moments ago on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Kevin McCarthy actually came out and formally endorsed Elise Stefanik, congresswoman from New York, to take Cheney's number three House leadership post. She has a more moderate voting record than Cheney and has voted with Trump much less often but, of course, she is sort of embracing the Trump position on this. Kat, some in the conservative media are not siding with Donald Trump on this. For example, Wall Street Journal editorial page, the election wasn't stolen yet Mr. Trump wants an endorsement of his stolen claim to be litmus test for every Republican candidate. National Review, the Republican Party is so under the thumb of Trump consistently acknowledging reality about the election disqualifies somebody from leadership.

In other words, it has tremendous advantages, structural advantages and otherwise going into the 2022 election cycle. So I don't think it's a party that is falling apart, but it is a party that is trying to figure out what it stands for. And on that, I think that is just a huge story and we are all going to be covering it for the next couple of years. Of course, it is legitimate that they can have whoever they want as conference chair in the House, but it is also really important whether they believe the democracy means sometimes your side loses an election."

That is one example. And another, you mentioned the Maureen Dowd column in The New York Times, you know, sort of fighting the last war over her service in the Bush administration when she worked for the State Department all about Iraq.

It is really, really insane to see. So, she doesn't really have super fans on either side, right? Because again, look, I'm still no fan of her foreign policy myself and I know a lot of people remember the Cheney family and all those sorts of things, but it is great to be able to talk about things outside of party lines, I think, sometimes and have those conversations.

Kat, based on the media coverage, is this one more piece of evidence, glaring evidence in the view of many conservatives that Facebook is biased to the left, that Silicon Valley is biased to left? Because in this Congress, at least, Republicans can't do anything about this decision."

      "utterance": "Yes. In the eyes of conservatives, it absolutely is. You see it as another example of bias. Of course, you know, it is one of many examples, right? I think it is so important to distinguish between free speech in the constitutional sense, which is that you're free to say anything you want without government punishment. And then the cultural view of free speech, which is, you know, cancelling people basically or blocking them from these platforms. I think that both are important, obviously, the constitutional when it is critical. But really, I think that this just really further gives a lot of these people ammunition. I always believe that including culturally the answer to speech you don't like is more speech and not less of it because then Trump does get to come out and say in other ways and other statements, see, look, I'm the victim here, they're not letting me speak, they've never done this before, I'm suspended indefinitely."

Twitter deleted that blog, saying, you can't have this on Twitter because it is the way of getting around the decision. So I think there is a lot of animosity here toward these companies which used to be so popular. Their CEOs used to be so popular.

    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The Trump Justice Department secretly obtained the phone records of three Washington Post reporters from 2017 as part of a leak investigation, a move approved by former Attorney General Bill Barr. This was about Russia. The three reporters, Ellen Nakashima, Greg Miller, and Adam Entous, had written a story based on classified U.S. intelligence intercepts involving then Senator Jeff Session having a post-election conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. It can, of course, be illegal to leak such information. The Justice Department now says it followed the established procedures and the targets of these investigations are not the news media recipients but rather those with access to the national defense information who provided it to the media and thus failed to protect it as lawfully required. Acting Post editor Cameron Barr says the paper is deeply troubled by this use of government power. Joining us now is Mike Emanuel, Fox's chief Washington correspondent. Mike, the Trump administration is not the first administration to go after reporters' records in a leaked investigation, but since this was approved by Bill Barr and involved the reporting of the Russia probe that was aimed at President Trump and his inner circle, it could, of course, be viewed as political."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "We all remember the Russia probe was a very sensitive topic with President Trump and a lot of his senior team. Adding to the drama, it was about a meeting with then campaign advisor Jeff Sessions, who went on to become the attorney general when the articles were published. He was attorney general of the United States, and a couple weeks later, he announced he was going to crack down on a culture of leaking. And so he was not lying about that. Clearly, he was serious about going after the leakers. I'm not going to defend whether folks should leak classified information or not, but as a journalist, you tell your sources, hey, I am going to protect you, I'm not giving up your name for anything, but when big brother reaches over you, goes through your call records and has phone numbers and the length of time of the calls, it probably doesn't take long for the Justice Department to figure out with whom you're speaking, who might have had access to this classified information. And so as a reporter, you feel like you're pretty much naked. Your call records are out there and the government is going through them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. From a journalist point of view, it is pretty chilling. No opportunity for appeal. You don't even find out it happens until much, much later as in this case. I was highly critical at the time when the Obama Justice Department secretly obtained phone records from reporters from Fox News and the AP classified or sensitive information having to do with Korea, North Korea. So, any news organization or journalistic critic that now slams Trump and Barr over this particular leaked investigation, shouldn't they have to include Barack Obama and Eric Holder in that criticism?"

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",

They also obtained several days' worth of his personal e-mails, not hi Fox News e-mails, his personal e-mails. So, folks here at Fox obviously didn't like it one bit. That is why it is not surprising at all that the folks down the street at The Washington Post are equally unhappy about the treatment that their reporters received for 2017 stories that they did about contact, alleged contact between the Russian ambassador and then campaign advisor for the Trump campaign, Jeff Sessions. Bottom line is if you like the First Amendment, you don't like hearing stories about this kind of stuff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. It is supposed to be done only in rare instances. Biden Justice Department is defending this as following procedures. The records that were seized involved those few months in early 2017, but the decision was made by Bill Barr during the 2020 campaign. At the same time, we're talking here about sensitive, classified U.S. Intelligence intercepts. So since such leaking can be illegal, not for reporters receiving it but for those who work for the government, could that justify from that point of view obtaining the phone records?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "That is the point that the Justice Department is making, that this is highly sensitive, U.S. classified information and it is not punishing the reporters, but going after the government officials who are to protect sensitive classified information in their roles that they have access to the sensitive America secrets. And so they defend their actions by saying that they're going after the leakers because next time, it could be even more sensitive leak. And so it makes presidents crazy from both parties the sensitive leaks. Certainly I remember from past presidents and clearly that continues today when they're trying to get to the bottom line of who is leaking America secrets and how big of a secret it may be."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

Well what about all of these other people that are still allowed to exist on there? Whether they be people in prominent political positions, celebrity or otherwise? They are just regular people. So, I think, you know, and that's essentially what the oversight board came back and said. They said, listen, you need to not be so arbitrary in your decision making because people need to know for sure that these decisions aren't made for political purposes, and that they're not agenda driven.

I understand the argument that these are private companies, and essentially, they can make these decisions but these private companies have to realize, if they are arbitrarily doing these things. If they can't justify what they are doing and say, this is a blanket reason, these are all policies, if you violate them, I don't care who you are, you are going to throw it off.

They obviously share a world view how am I going to make it work? I don't have all of those things necessary. I don't have access to all of that privilege, and all of that money. So yes, it causes people to self-reflect on their own life. Everyone knows that divorce rates are super high, I think they're around 50 percent right now. So, it makes people think about their own lives. And also, remember, you feel like you get to know these people, right? They're out in the public eye. They're public figures. You feel like, you're kind of living your life, much like you do with, you know, celebrities and reality TV stars. That's just a way that the American culture is right now.

Second, is that all they see from places like the New York Times, and the L.A. Times, is the negativity. That's what they think they see, that just another death, it's about the suffering and it's not about people who recover. Howie, the key element right now is whether or not the press is talking about a light at the end of the tunnel. Whether or not they're talking about the mask, masks coming off.

And the fact is, this is something that you learned from The de Beaumont Foundation the work that we're doing, the consequences of the virus today, in May of 2021 are so much worse than even the worst-case consequence of the vaccine. And that the public needs to understand that but it's up to the press. The way the press should box it and talk about the COVID-19 facts.

Trump complimenting Biden for getting vaccines out, Biden complimenting Trump on Operation Warp Speed. And the two of them turning to their own doctors and let them deliver the message. Howie, it's not going to come from Washington. It's not going to come from government, it's not going to come from celebrities. It's got to come from your own doctor. It's one of the key findings that we've learned."

But of course, there are problems in getting the vaccine to local doctors because of storage issues and how much of this has to be shipped. Just briefly."

And yet there is a hardcore people who don't want to take them. Look, they are entitled to their individual decisions. But as you pointed out, as many others pointed out, if they don't do it, it kind of hurts the whole country. Frank Luntz traveling the world apparently. Thanks very much for joining us."

      "utterance": "In the fallout over that colossal mistake involving Rudy Giuliani, first the Washington post, then the New York Times, and NBC all having to correct a false allegation that the FBI warned the ex-mayor that Russian intelligence was targeting him, one editor has to his credit gone on the record. Times executive editor Dean Baquet told the Post, quote, \"we weren't rigorous enough. I think we all tend to drop our guard when we get beat and are trying to catch up. We need to grill sources more to make sure we understand exactly what they're confirming. We've all discussed it, corrected it, and we need to do better.\" Good for Baquet. The Washington Post acting editor wouldn't talk to his own reporter. And by the way, Giuliani may have been slow to issue a denial, reporters tried to contact him because federal investigators seized his phones. A reporter from New York's Daily News one of the most grittiest and most story tabloids is openly trashing its likely new owner. With Tribune company negotiating a sale of the paper along with the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, and others, olden -- excuse me --olden Global Capital, Larry McShane calls it notorious hedge fund known for decimating newspapers like the Denver Post before picking the bones for profit. As he points out, Tribune fired half the newsroom three years ago. The staff is down to 100. These are really tough times for newspapers. Which is why other than rich guys, only hedge funds are buying them, and too often bleeding them dry. So, the news which ran the classic headline, ford to city, drop dead is trying to avoid death by strangulation. Washington Post editors created a whole lot of confusion with a memo what staffers can and can't do at public gathering. Attending a pride celebration or one for Juneteenth that's OK, but not protests or partisan activities. It's fine to join a celebration at Black Lives Matter plaza but not a protest. Aren't those similar? A news who employ can't hold a sign in a parade, or wear a hat backing or opposing a politician or policy, but can wear a rainbow cap and wave American flag or t-shirt celebrating their identity. But what if you wear a rainbow hat at a gay right's protest. Look, I'm all for reporters not joining in partisan activities but this sounds like you need a lawyer to decipher. The CEO of Washingtonian magazine has a revolt on her hands after saying she expects staffers to return to the office full time. Cathy Merrill said in a Washington Post op-ed that they need to be there to help their colleagues. Here's what she wrote. While some employees might like to continue to work from home and pop in only when necessary, that presents executives with a tempting economic option the employees might not like. What would that option be? Well, it would be turning them into contractors which Merrill said would cost them, she just came out and said it, their health and retirement benefits. Now the entire staff essentially went on strike, posting the same message on Twitter. We are dismayed by Cathy Merrill's public threat to our livelihoods. We will not be publishing today. Look, this is a difficult transition for companies across America, not just the media. Making not so subtle threats against your employees is really heavy-handed. Merrill later backed off saying she won't change her employee's status. And quote \"I'm sorry if the op-ed made it appear like anything else.\" Online protests sometimes work.
