It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A massive and potentially catastrophic category 4 hurricane is barreling directly towards the east coast. Florence is flexing her muscles and rapidly gaining strength over the Atlantic Ocean before its anticipated landfall later this week. Fox News meteorologist Adam Klotz is tracking the monster storm. It's gotten bigger since I even talk to you at 2 o'clock, Adam.",

      "sentences": "Dana, it has. We've just got a new update. Winds were at 130 miles an hour, now up to 140 mile an hour. This storm continues to strengthen. It's going to have plenty of time to do so, running over warm water, still a long ways away from this coast. You're looking -- there's Bermuda just to the north. So south of Bermuda currently, this is the paths it's going to take. And as it moves along this path, it will continue to strengthen. We're eventually going to be running up to maybe 150-mile-an-hour winds, getting up close to there anyway. This is now Thursday morning and you are looking at -- perhaps a landfall as this gets closer to the Carolina coast there, getting Thursday night into early Friday morning. That's the time frame we're looking with this, but it stays strong the entire way, likely making landfall as a category 4 storm. That's what our current model suggests. That puts those winds anywhere from 130 to 156 miles an hour. This is going to be a big wind event for folks right along the coast, as well as our rain event.  Now, typically, a storm is sitting where this storm is sitting would be turning off to the north, possibly missing land entirely because of a high- pressure system is being forced down along the Carolina coast, and pretty much all of our models at this point are in agreement with this. These are all of our tropical models and you see them all run up right along the coast, stretching from an area, perhaps, from Myrtle Beach up to the outer banks in North Carolina. That's kind of the cone of indecision at this point. But what we aren't as clear at is what happens once this storm gets there. I continue with the models and they all kind of disagree a little bit here. Some take it inland. Others let it spin just off the coast a little bit. If it spins off the coast, we could be seeing a lot of rain there. These are just some -- couple of forecasts models, but spots suggesting may be up over 2 feet of rain, widespread getting up to a foot of rain. So it's going to be a wind event, that's for sure. It's going to storm surge and we may be dealing with a lot of flooding also.",

So, one statistic really bears noting here, never hit 3 percent growth. Trump is going to hit 3 percent growth today. I don't like it when President Obama gets on his high horse and tries to claim the moral high ground because then he turns around and has his people wiretap you and call you a racist. He says we have to restore sanity to our politics. I think insanity is Maxine Waters, socialism, and abolishing ICE. And if you look back and say, you know, was this presidency a good presidency?

It was the simplest way to explain Benghazi is that after a plan terror attack they went after the filmmaker because they were incapable of saying radical Islam. That's the abomination. It's not a conspiracy. It was a moral failure on the part of an administration who couldn't utter the words that reflected true evil which was radical Islam.   Right now, Trump is like the world's largest planet and he keeps sucking people into their orbit and making them smaller. So, right now, Obama is just another asteroid in Trump's galaxy. It's just another person that is fighting him and it makes them looks -- it just makes them look much smaller. And I love how the media just keeps saying Obama's speeches are fiery. If that's fiery, a soggy sparkler is a three alarm fire because you don't get anything new, surprising, or unpredictable. He said the voters should step up. Remember, every time they step up, what happens? They threw out nearly 100 -- Democrat congressmen and senators combines about 90 or so, right? That's what they did when they stepped up.

Well, it didn't tell us anything, so it doesn't really matter. If the writers claiming to secretly control Trump's harmful impulses, why write an op-ed piece for the Times? That seems like the worst thing you do to control his impulses. It's like shooting yourself in the foot halfway through a marathon. So whoever wrote this didn't think it through and it could be absolutely anybody -- anybody. Mattis, sure. Pompeo, OK. Ivanka, definitely, probably. The assistant deputy secretary of commerce, why not? Doris in shipping? Yeah.  In fact, if anything is possible, why not some guy at The Times? The Jayson Blair of the moment, somebody acting out of concern to save America just like the piece said. Crazier things have happened. The Times once endorsed Anthony Weiner. So, if Trump wants to out the op-ed operative, all he's got to say is, hey, we looked into everyone here, so it must be somebody at The Times. Must be, could be, what's the difference? So, yeah, it could be the undersecretary for ditches and pipes or it could be Paul Krugman. Except, even The Times knows that if they Krugman's name on it, nobody will read it. Never miss a chance, Juan, to hit Krugman.

Now, if you'll recall, the high school was the scene of a mass shooting in February in which 17 people were killed. One of the dead was the team's offensive line coach. He saved several lives by putting himself between students and the gunmen. There was no pregame tribute, no moment of silence.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A massive and potentially catastrophic category 4 hurricane is barreling directly towards the east coast. Florence is flexing her muscles and rapidly gaining strength over the Atlantic Ocean before its anticipated landfall later this week. Fox News meteorologist Adam Klotz is tracking the monster storm. It's gotten bigger since I even talk to you at 2 o'clock, Adam."

      "speaker": "ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Dana, it has. We've just got a new update. Winds were at 130 miles an hour, now up to 140 mile an hour. This storm continues to strengthen. It's going to have plenty of time to do so, running over warm water, still a long ways away from this coast. You're looking -- there's Bermuda just to the north. So south of Bermuda currently, this is the paths it's going to take. And as it moves along this path, it will continue to strengthen. We're eventually going to be running up to maybe 150-mile-an-hour winds, getting up close to there anyway. This is now Thursday morning and you are looking at -- perhaps a landfall as this gets closer to the Carolina coast there, getting Thursday night into early Friday morning. That's the time frame we're looking with this, but it stays strong the entire way, likely making landfall as a category 4 storm. That's what our current model suggests. That puts those winds anywhere from 130 to 156 miles an hour. This is going to be a big wind event for folks right along the coast, as well as our rain event. Now, typically, a storm is sitting where this storm is sitting would be turning off to the north, possibly missing land entirely because of a high- pressure system is being forced down along the Carolina coast, and pretty much all of our models at this point are in agreement with this. These are all of our tropical models and you see them all run up right along the coast, stretching from an area, perhaps, from Myrtle Beach up to the outer banks in North Carolina. That's kind of the cone of indecision at this point. But what we aren't as clear at is what happens once this storm gets there. I continue with the models and they all kind of disagree a little bit here. Some take it inland. Others let it spin just off the coast a little bit. If it spins off the coast, we could be seeing a lot of rain there. These are just some -- couple of forecasts models, but spots suggesting may be up over 2 feet of rain, widespread getting up to a foot of rain. So it's going to be a wind event, that's for sure. It's going to storm surge and we may be dealing with a lot of flooding also."

It skyrockets, OK? And I have a lot more charts to bore you with, Juan, and I'm not going to do that because I know you're allergic to the facts. So, one statistic really bears noting here, never hit 3 percent growth. Trump is going to hit 3 percent growth today. I don't like it when President Obama gets on his high horse and tries to claim the moral high ground because then he turns around and has his people wiretap you and call you a racist. He says we have to restore sanity to our politics. I think insanity is Maxine Waters, socialism, and abolishing ICE. And if you look back and say, you know, was this presidency a good presidency? If it was so good, we would have had Hillary. She would have been the third Obama term, but no it wasn't good, and that's why you have President Trump."

So, if you're being strategic on the Democrat side, you would want to send him there to see if you could pull them over the top, because if the -- the Democrats that they plan to take back the house majority, they've got to go up through California and New Jersey."

Obviously, President Obama was dealing with a terrible economy when he took office, the greatest downturn that we've seen since the great depression in the U.S., and then you get President Obama leading us steadily, steadily up."

But when you get into situations like the one he tweeted about this morning, that he's saying, oh, this is the greatest economy in a hundred years, which prompted people, left and right, Jesse, apparently not you, but most people -- even honest people on the right said, hey, you're wrong, Mr. President."

Yeah, he softened up the economy so Trump could handle it. First of all, let's talk about the wild conspiracy theories of Benghazi. It wasn't a conspiracy theory. It was an abomination. It was the simplest way to explain Benghazi is that after a plan terror attack they went after the filmmaker because they were incapable of saying radical Islam. That's the abomination. It's not a conspiracy. It was a moral failure on the part of an administration who couldn't utter the words that reflected true evil which was radical Islam. Right now, Trump is like the world's largest planet and he keeps sucking people into their orbit and making them smaller. So, right now, Obama is just another asteroid in Trump's galaxy. It's just another person that is fighting him and it makes them looks -- it just makes them look much smaller. And I love how the media just keeps saying Obama's speeches are fiery. If that's fiery, a soggy sparkler is a three alarm fire because you don't get anything new, surprising, or unpredictable. He said the voters should step up. Remember, every time they step up, what happens? They threw out nearly 100 -- Democrat congressmen and senators combines about 90 or so, right? That's what they did when they stepped up. And also when they stepped up they voted for Trump."

The Times was Tonya Harding and Woodward was Nancy Kerrigan, taking out the legs of Bob's book at the perfect time. So who wrote the piece? Well, it didn't tell us anything, so it doesn't really matter. If the writers claiming to secretly control Trump's harmful impulses, why write an op-ed piece for the Times? That seems like the worst thing you do to control his impulses. It's like shooting yourself in the foot halfway through a marathon. So whoever wrote this didn't think it through and it could be absolutely anybody -- anybody. Mattis, sure. Pompeo, OK. Ivanka, definitely, probably. The assistant deputy secretary of commerce, why not? Doris in shipping? Yeah. In fact, if anything is possible, why not some guy at The Times? The Jayson Blair of the moment, somebody acting out of concern to save America just like the piece said. Crazier things have happened. The Times once endorsed Anthony Weiner. So, if Trump wants to out the op-ed operative, all he's got to say is, hey, we looked into everyone here, so it must be somebody at The Times. Must be, could be, what's the difference? So, yeah, it could be the undersecretary for ditches and pipes or it could be Paul Krugman. Except, even The Times knows that if they Krugman's name on it, nobody will read it. Never miss a chance, Juan, to hit Krugman. Shouldn't -- without further notice, Juan, I'm going to assume that the Times wrote it until they prove otherwise, because, the thing is, they should want to clear their name by proving to me that somebody else wrote it."

Then, if it is so crazy in the White House, why aren't people, like, hanging themselves from the chandeliers. I mean, why is everything happening that the president said was going to happen?
