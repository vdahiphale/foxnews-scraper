A Marist poll last week found that there was virtually no vendor gap when it comes to Justice Brett Kavanaugh among either Republicans or Democrats. Eighty percent of Republican women have a favorable view of Kavanaugh with 81 percent of Republican men agreeing. And the Democratic side, men have a greater unfavorable view of Kavanaugh, 85 percent to 75 percent of women. Well, the struggle over Kavanaugh as we noted in THE ANGLE shortly after he was nominated was always going to be political.   The Democrats were going to savage anyone Donald Trump nominated except maybe, if he re-nominated someone like Merrick Garland or something completely cuckoo like that. The perpetual rage against all things Trump also seems to intensify the more Trump accomplishes. And it's unrelated by the way to how optimistic and how confident American workers and consumers are about the economy. None of that even matters to the crazies on the left. Consider what the president, with the help of Mitch McConnell, has accomplished just on this very important issue of judicial nominations? Of course, two Supreme Court justices, 26 federal appellate court justices, and 41 federal district court judges. And by the way, they are just getting started. And of course, President Trump has chalked up so many other impressive wins, gets very little credit in the mainstream media for it. He successfully renegotiated NAFTA, forcing both Mexico and Canada to accept a deal that finally begins to treat American manufacturers and American workers fairly.",

Of course, establishment figures such as Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn, none of those guys wanted Trump to be the nominee. They've all really stepped up helping to push Kavanaugh over the confirmation finish line. Maybe, maybe they are closer all of them, to recognizing the time is up on the old GOP and Trump's policies are actually bearing fruit. All the excitement is with Trump, let's face it. All the momentum is with his ideas. There is too much on the line for intraparty squabbles any longer. And the choice for voters is now really simple. Mob rule or the rule of law? Perpetual rage or real results? Demonization, or due process? As an example, this is what the anti-Trump rage machine was up to over the weekend.

And let's walk through the stages starting from the beginning. First, Linda Sarsour disrupted the first confirmation hearing. Then Brett Kavanaugh was accused of rape, then of flashing his private parts. Then accused basically of gang rape. Then Soros paid radicals cornered Jeff Flake in an elevator. And after a second hearing, Kavanaugh was then basically being accused of being an alcoholic and of having anger issues. And when all that failed, a mob of crazy-eyed protesters smashed and clawed at the Supreme Court doors and waved filthy signs. Once Kavanaugh was confirmed Democrats of course promised impeachment and to abandon the Electoral College, and, finally, to pack the court to offset the five conservatives on the bench. Joining us now with reaction to this tragic disorder, Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institute and author of the book \"The Case for Trump.\" Victor, you've been covering this, you've heard of inflammatory bowel disease. This is an inflammatory anti-Kavanaugh Trump madness, OK.  And have Democrats in your mind in recent years, have they ever been this far left or this much unhinged?",

And out of that frustration they think big money. It's the party of the rich now, Silicon Valley, Wall Street, Hollywood, the Steyer brothers, maybe they will like that spectacle and they'll poor money in and we can win. And then some days they say we've got to import the tactics of the campus, so we have these upper middle class kids, identify politics, get in their face, mob them, dox them, shout them down, get rid of due process. And then sometimes they are frustrated in the system that used to be great between 2009 at 16, suddenly is antidemocratic. We need 10 senators from California, none from Wyoming, there are too few people there. Let's get rid of the Electoral College, or let's go back to 1869 before which we had different numbers of Supreme Court judges. So it's kind of frustrated, but it's kind of Nietzschean desire for power again, and they're frustrated because a lot of their dilemmas were self-inflicted.

A Marist poll last week found that there was virtually no vendor gap when it comes to Justice Brett Kavanaugh among either Republicans or Democrats. Eighty percent of Republican women have a favorable view of Kavanaugh with 81 percent of Republican men agreeing. And the Democratic side, men have a greater unfavorable view of Kavanaugh, 85 percent to 75 percent of women. Well, the struggle over Kavanaugh as we noted in THE ANGLE shortly after he was nominated was always going to be political. The Democrats were going to savage anyone Donald Trump nominated except maybe, if he re-nominated someone like Merrick Garland or something completely cuckoo like that. The perpetual rage against all things Trump also seems to intensify the more Trump accomplishes. And it's unrelated by the way to how optimistic and how confident American workers and consumers are about the economy. None of that even matters to the crazies on the left. Consider what the president, with the help of Mitch McConnell, has accomplished just on this very important issue of judicial nominations? Of course, two Supreme Court justices, 26 federal appellate court justices, and 41 federal district court judges. And by the way, they are just getting started. And of course, President Trump has chalked up so many other impressive wins, gets very little credit in the mainstream media for it. He successfully renegotiated NAFTA, forcing both Mexico and Canada to accept a deal that finally begins to treat American manufacturers and American workers fairly."

Brett Stevens, Hugh Hewitt and Erick Erickson all lined up behind the president in midst of the Kavanaugh fight, some more than others but nevertheless it's a big change.

Of course, establishment figures such as Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn, none of those guys wanted Trump to be the nominee. They've all really stepped up helping to push Kavanaugh over the confirmation finish line. Maybe, maybe they are closer all of them, to recognizing the time is up on the old GOP and Trump's policies are actually bearing fruit. All the excitement is with Trump, let's face it. All the momentum is with his ideas. There is too much on the line for intraparty squabbles any longer. And the choice for voters is now really simple. Mob rule or the rule of law? Perpetual rage or real results? Demonization, or due process? As an example, this is what the anti-Trump rage machine was up to over the weekend. Protesters in Portland blocked a major thoroughfare causing needless disruptions. When a driver dared to push through the blockade, this was the reaction of these open-minded and tolerant leftist."

The left is at war, Laura, and that is why they are constantly and immediately reaching for the most extreme, the most radical, the most violent in some cases because that's the only way that they can win this war. It's a war against the constitution, against free market economics, against individual liberty, against all the things for which Justice Kavanaugh is going to fight on the Supreme Court, therefore they had to destroy him. And when you would layer that on top of their absolute hatred for Donald Trump, this is why the left now and the Democratic Party and many in the media have been taken over and consumed and actually they're cannibalizing each other."

You are tedious, and you character, or your boss lived a derivative lifestyle on TV for how long? That's the only reason he first go noticed.  But what is that?

Look, the left is incapable of or unwilling to learn from history. Every time they go full radical like this they lose at the ballot box. Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bush 43, and now Donald Trump have all been beneficiaries of the leftist mob, their tactics, and their intent to destroy everything that has made this country great, our very foundational principles.

What about immigration, millions and millions of people coming into the country over the last x number of years, how is that changing the country? Is it good, is it bad, do we want more? That's actually really interesting stuff. I love that kind of debate. This kind of stuff is just like eighth grade stuff. Anyway, guys, great segment, thank you so much, Monica, Mark.

      "utterance": "The anti-Trump Kavanaugh resistance looks a lot to me like a progressively debilitating mental disorder. I'm calling it PKCS, post Kavanaugh confirmation syndrome. And let's walk through the stages starting from the beginning. First, Linda Sarsour disrupted the first confirmation hearing. Then Brett Kavanaugh was accused of rape, then of flashing his private parts. Then accused basically of gang rape. Then Soros paid radicals cornered Jeff Flake in an elevator. And after a second hearing, Kavanaugh was then basically being accused of being an alcoholic and of having anger issues. And when all that failed, a mob of crazy-eyed protesters smashed and clawed at the Supreme Court doors and waved filthy signs. Once Kavanaugh was confirmed Democrats of course promised impeachment and to abandon the Electoral College, and, finally, to pack the court to offset the five conservatives on the bench. Joining us now with reaction to this tragic disorder, Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institute and author of the book \"The Case for Trump.\" Victor, you've been covering this, you've heard of inflammatory bowel disease. This is an inflammatory anti-Kavanaugh Trump madness, OK.  And have Democrats in your mind in recent years, have they ever been this far left or this much unhinged?"

      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "I don't think so. I think you can trace it from that period from 2009 to 16 when Obama promised them that a new demography, immigration, identity politics, the system was geared for that. He got elected twice. And then suddenly they woke up and said he's kind of a narcissist. We lost the state legislatures, governorships, House, Senate, now the presidency and Supreme Court. And out of that frustration they think big money. It's the party of the rich now, Silicon Valley, Wall Street, Hollywood, the Steyer brothers, maybe they will like that spectacle and they'll poor money in and we can win. And then some days they say we've got to import the tactics of the campus, so we have these upper middle class kids, identify politics, get in their face, mob them, dox them, shout them down, get rid of due process. And then sometimes they are frustrated in the system that used to be great between 2009 at 16, suddenly is antidemocratic. We need 10 senators from California, none from Wyoming, there are too few people there. Let's get rid of the Electoral College, or let's go back to 1869 before which we had different numbers of Supreme Court judges. So it's kind of frustrated, but it's kind of Nietzschean desire for power again, and they're frustrated because a lot of their dilemmas were self-inflicted. They were the ones who were turned off the middle class, independents, the white working class in swing states. They didn't have to do that."

This is Boston University, what, fourth in her class. The point is when you go down the identity politics route and you start judging people by their ethnic background or their gender or their ideology rather than their talent or their wisdom or their character, that's what you get it. And it's kind of sad that the Democrats are going down this. These septuagenarians and octogenarians, Feinstein, Biden, Pelosi, they are so desperate to be hip and get back their party, so Joe Biden says he's going to beat Trump up outside of the locker room, or Feinstein has this Byzantine plot to undermine Kavanaugh with the Ford testimony. It's very pathetic that somebody hijacked their party and they are kind of deer in headlights. They don't know whether to be hip and go hard left or just suffer the irrelevance of being old and in the way."

There is a possibility, probably a pretty decent one that Donald Trump, obviously if he is reelected in 2020 he will have another Supreme Court opening. If Brett Kavanaugh who is a Bush appointee, Bush staff secretary, very mainstream person and judge, if he is subjected to this, can you imagine if Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat suddenly is open, or she retired -- she says she won't -- but what will they do then? Bill Maher is saying that the president doesn't have a right to appoint anyone else, basically."

It's just us. And we're either going to hang separates or hang together. So he's really destroyed the never-Trump movement because 90 percent of that small rubric of about 10 percent now say, you know what, I don't have any choice.

Documents that are going to declassified and then they are not or they're partially declassified. And we talked about this a few weeks ago, and I'm still not following what happened. The deputy attorney general with a few others from the intel community convinced the president, correct me if I'm wrong, not to declassify documents about the FISA warrant against Carter Page and other renewals of that warrant and kicked it over to the inspector general, correct? What else do we know about this?"

And that's really my biggest problem with the Department of Justice and the FBI is every time we try to get something out of the public, they cry wolf, and they claim there's going to be national security implications. So the president was very clear and said that these documents needed to be immediately declassified without reductions. Then what happened is that a meeting occurred which you just referred to, and then suddenly the I.G. was brought in. Now my challenge with the I.G., I don't have anything against the I.G., the I.G. is probably a great guy. But we are Congress. We believe people have a right to know this information. It needs to be made public. It's not very much information. But we want the president to declassify it and the president has mentioned that he would. So this has now been I think two and a half or three weeks, so it doesn't take that long, Laura. You are only talking about 20 pages of a FISA and I think about a dozen FBI reports from none other than Bruce Ohr, whose wife Nellie Ohr, was working for the Clinton campaign, effectively, in helping to feed the information into the FBI. So, I just don't know what they are thinking here. The president I think, he's a smart guy, but he needs to be careful about who he listens to, I think, sometimes."

You've got a dozen people now at the FBI and DOJ who are gone. So everything that we did on our committee we had to do. We had to make sure the American public knew that this information about what somebody was doing to basically set up a campaign and accuse them of colluding with Russians was really wrong. And we have now proven that the only collision that happened was collision with the Democrats and the Clinton campaign and the Russians. And I will tell you, I still want to know why nobody is investigating what Russians were, the Democrats and the Clinton campaign, talking to through Fusion GPS, and feeding that information into the FBI.

And what Amazon has done is it has decided to do the charitable thing where you can top up for charity whatever you purchase on Amazon, a percentage will go to these charities, but they relied on the government's charity regulator in the U.K. to pass muster for these things.
