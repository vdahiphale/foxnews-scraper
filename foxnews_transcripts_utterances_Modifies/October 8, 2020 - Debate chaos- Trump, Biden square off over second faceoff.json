OK, so it would be good to know how did you come to this decision, why not talk to the candidates beforehand? Why not try to see if we could work something out? Even Joe Biden said, well, could we move it a few days later? Like, he wasn't even trying to say let's try to do it. Now, President Trump says I'm not going to do it. I think that's fine. I think that -- I think it would be fine if he didn't. We have all been doing Zoom calls. It might be weird. You know, it's weird like when the dog barks and things like that.

And so this was a great way to change the topic. So it's kind of natural to be suspicious. But we all have to admit that when we did our remote, there wasn't less interruption. There was more, because you can't have eye contact and be around people. So the idea of having a virtual debate is going to be really hard for -- to improve upon anything. I think what they need to do is figure out how to have these people in a room safely nearby. They are both on the east coast, I imagine. And have a good solid ref. Have somebody that maybe apolitical, a Joe Rogan perhaps, somebody who don't know where is he going to go, but you know it's not going to be two against one -- whether left or right. It's just going to be down the middle. And I think that would be great, but I still think the town -- The Five town hall is the way to go. And I know he is watching.",

We all were there. We all know what happened. But it is true that Biden has been one step behind what the president has announced. So President Trump enacted the Defense Production Act to get PPE produced in higher quantities here at home, then Biden comes along and was, like, we should do the Defense Production Act. It was invoked two weeks ago. He says that they need a plan for vaccine distribution. Well, the president, a month ago, had a press conference at the White House, saying the military, which is the most efficient supply chain in the world, is going to help supply the vaccine to the people who need it the most. So it's just interesting that the president is being held accountable. And on the China issue, again, Kamala Harris dodged it completely, blaming the president for covering up the virus when it was the World Health Organization and the Chinese Communist Party that was lying about the spread, which is why it turned into a global pandemic. So -- and just one more thing on the issues with the Second Amendment that they haven't brought up. You know, the questions that aren't being asked in these debates benefit Democrats, because the Second Amendment is not a good issue for Democrats at a time when Kamala Harris wants to confiscate firearms.

OK, so it would be good to know how did you come to this decision, why not talk to the candidates beforehand? Why not try to see if we could work something out? Even Joe Biden said, well, could we move it a few days later? Like, he wasn't even trying to say let's try to do it. Now, President Trump says I'm not going to do it. I think that's fine. I think that -- I think it would be fine if he didn't. We have all been doing Zoom calls. It might be weird. You know, it's weird like when the dog barks and things like that. But I think that it would be fine. And now that Joe Biden is going to do this event on the 15th, that means that President Trump is free to go do something else. Like, where might he want to go to do an event on the 15th? And maybe just wait and just have one final debate in Nashville if that one can happen."

They are doing it because, in my opinion, Pence crushed it last night, right? And this was a great way to steer that spiral -- that downward spiral of that event. I mean, Kamala was an embarrassment. And so this was a great way to change the topic. So it's kind of natural to be suspicious. But we all have to admit that when we did our remote, there wasn't less interruption. There was more, because you can't have eye contact and be around people. So the idea of having a virtual debate is going to be really hard for -- to improve upon anything. I think what they need to do is figure out how to have these people in a room safely nearby. They are both on the east coast, I imagine. And have a good solid ref. Have somebody that maybe apolitical, a Joe Rogan perhaps, somebody who don't know where is he going to go, but you know it's not going to be two against one -- whether left or right. It's just going to be down the middle. And I think that would be great, but I still think the town -- The Five town hall is the way to go. And I know he is watching."

They could have done it this afternoon. They could have done it tomorrow. Trump has a full week to get healthy, get clean, and get tested.

He said the same thing about Kamala Harris. I don't think that he treats her any differently. He said some things about Hillary Clinton when he was running against her and still won the White House. So I'm not really sure it will have a big impact when you are looking at whether I'm going to have a job in a year, versus whether I want to be upset about someone getting called a mean name in the game of politics. Especially after Joe Biden called President Trump a clown and told him to shut up during the first debate. So there is that issue.

And it's beautiful because nobody is fact-checking it. And BBC actually fact-checked it and they backed Pence up. So Pence has opened the door for other people, and not just me and others, to talk about the transcript and say that this destructive lie, which has been around for three years and responsible for so much racial division, simply isn't true. And I think that was, like -- to me, that was the most important, moving part of the debate it. It meant a lot to me. I also thought it was funny when she was going after him about COVID, about his keep calm and don't panic stance. She brought up toilet paper hoarding."

But on energy, I thought Susan Page did a very good job asking Kamala Harris about the Green New Deal. And then they get into discussion about fracking. And she says I want to be very clear, Joe Biden will not ban fracking. What I thought was very interesting is that Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez then tweets, actually, fracking is terrible. And I thought this truce between the far left and the Biden-Harris campaign is a marriage of convenience until they see if they could reach their goal, which is to oust Donald Trump, and then you are going to see Biden and Harris. That administration just pulled in all sorts of directions by the left."

It's being placed on President Trump when Governor Cuomo is the one who praised him at the beginning for all the things he was providing, the Navy hospital, building up the Javits Center, et cetera. We all were there. We all know what happened. But it is true that Biden has been one step behind what the president has announced. So President Trump enacted the Defense Production Act to get PPE produced in higher quantities here at home, then Biden comes along and was, like, we should do the Defense Production Act. It was invoked two weeks ago. He says that they need a plan for vaccine distribution. Well, the president, a month ago, had a press conference at the White House, saying the military, which is the most efficient supply chain in the world, is going to help supply the vaccine to the people who need it the most. So it's just interesting that the president is being held accountable. And on the China issue, again, Kamala Harris dodged it completely, blaming the president for covering up the virus when it was the World Health Organization and the Chinese Communist Party that was lying about the spread, which is why it turned into a global pandemic. So -- and just one more thing on the issues with the Second Amendment that they haven't brought up. You know, the questions that aren't being asked in these debates benefit Democrats, because the Second Amendment is not a good issue for Democrats at a time when Kamala Harris wants to confiscate firearms. And there are five million new gun owners since the beginning of this year alone. It's the biggest year on record, and a lot of them are in swing states."

The second thing I want to bring up, though, is I don't think Joe Biden is really actually for packing the court. I don't think he is. But what would happen if he said that he is not? What would happen if he actually took a principled stand and he led on the issue? Would that mean that all the people on the left that are in this marriage of convenience, this tenuous truce decide, you know what, it's not even worth it?"

Like I said, I picked her -- I thought she was going to be the nominee. And I thought she was going to be the VP choice. But man, it's like all this time they didn't prep her? She just seems so light weight. So this is a huge win for Trump. And even though it was Pence, it's a huge win for Trump, because she's not really -- she maybe the number two spot, but they -- Biden is relying on her pretending or becoming the number one spot.

In fact, history shows, that the reason he didn't nominate someone right away was because the Senate wasn't in session. The second the Senate came back in session, he nominated Chase.

So, take a look at this bucket of baseballs and the heartfelt note attached to it. It was written by Randy Long of Alabama. Long who's 72, left that bucket and the note at a local batting cage. He explains in the note that his children and grandchildren are now grown, and he doesn't get to throw the balls around with them anymore. He ended the note with some advice that's just like eternal advice for all dads. He said, you won't believe how quickly the time will pass when you can play ball with the kids. Cherish those moments, give your kids a hug, and tell them you love them every chance you get. Jesse, you're up."
