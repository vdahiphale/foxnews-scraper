Plus White House Chief Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow, he's here on set with me and he's going to tell us what the president is planning to do with this economy and what he might do with Democrats.  But first, it's Super Tuesday Part 2 and the majority of polls are closing in Idaho. One of the six states holding democratic primaries tonight. Let's go live now to our Fox News election team.

Bret and Martha will be back and shortly. But first, gratitude and perspective. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now two months after the coronavirus entered the United States via China. Let's not forget where it came from, it's taken the lives of at least 27 Americans and infected nearly 800. Now these numbers will grow over the next weeks and months.   And they probably don't tell an accurate picture right now because of our relatively small testing sample. We've already talked about this. We all know that businesses and workers are already beginning to hurt. Working parents are dealing with the disruption of school closures, I'm one of them. My kids are out for the next week at least. Yet amidst all of the bad news, we have to keep our perspective. There is some good news. Our economy is the best in the world. Why? Due to the policies and the foresight of President Trump. He understands the importance - remember this - it's very critical to remember this at this time of preserving strong nation states, namely our own. And the solid foundation, the resilience of our work force, our ability to learn lessons quickly and these types of situations should give us full confidence that we're going to weather this just fine in the end.

So why force yourself to addresses this embarrassment in front of the cameras this evening? And speaking of embarrassment, old Joe, he just needs to stay away from the microphones and perhaps take a nap. Beyond the partisan bickering and fear mongering, now is the time for America to stand united. Preparation, not panic is the key to coping with this virus. If changes have to happen to our response, they have to be made and they have to be made quickly. We all know by now that many of the CDC's early coronavirus tests were faulty. That was no doubt, very problematic. Yet President Trump acted fast and he cut through the FDA's red tape. Soon millions of test will be available.

Actually, I prefer to call it the Chinese coronavirus, and the full title is the Chinese Communist Party's coronavirus, but let's follow the breadcrumbs. Back in November there were the first cases of the coronavirus in the city of Wuhan. By December the National Health Commission of the government of China had sent a commission down to investigate this new strain of pneumonia. They knew they had a problem. On January 1st they closed down all the military bases in and around Wuhan. They didn't tell the people of China, they didn't tell the world, but they closed down the military bases. The police force was protected, the military was protected from the virus. Then several million Chinese left the center of the epidemic, went throughout China, throughout the world, spreading the virus everywhere. Only after the horse had left the barn did they close the barn door. So everybody who was a victim of the coronavirus, everybody who dies as a result of the Chinese coronavirus virus is a victim of the Chinese Communist Party. And one more thing that as an American really, really gets my goat, and this is that the Chinese Communist Party is now whispering that the cause, the original source of the coronavirus was the United States of America.",

My Angle on why the Democrats are totally incapable of handling this coronavirus outbreak. And thank goodness, we have someone in the White House who is. Plus White House Chief Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow, he's here on set with me and he's going to tell us what the president is planning to do with this economy and what he might do with Democrats. But first, it's Super Tuesday Part 2 and the majority of polls are closing in Idaho. One of the six states holding democratic primaries tonight. Let's go live now to our Fox News election team. We have none other than Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. Bret, we thought this would happen but get out the brooms because it looks like a Biden sweep tonight."

      "utterance": "Bret and Martha, what a difference a couple of weeks make. Thanks so much. We'll be watching at 11. Well, we told you that Joe Biden - back three months ago Joe Biden was the man to beat. He had some stumbles along the way and continues to stumble but this is huge for him tonight. Bret and Martha will be back and shortly. But first, gratitude and perspective. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Now two months after the coronavirus entered the United States via China. Let's not forget where it came from, it's taken the lives of at least 27 Americans and infected nearly 800. Now these numbers will grow over the next weeks and months. And they probably don't tell an accurate picture right now because of our relatively small testing sample. We've already talked about this. We all know that businesses and workers are already beginning to hurt. Working parents are dealing with the disruption of school closures, I'm one of them. My kids are out for the next week at least. Yet amidst all of the bad news, we have to keep our perspective. There is some good news. Our economy is the best in the world. Why? Due to the policies and the foresight of President Trump. He understands the importance - remember this - it's very critical to remember this at this time of preserving strong nation states, namely our own. And the solid foundation, the resilience of our work force, our ability to learn lessons quickly and these types of situations should give us full confidence that we're going to weather this just fine in the end. But imagine how much worse the situation could be right now if we didn't have a President who acted staff to stop travel from key high risk areas."

If her handling of Benghazi is any guide, it would have been a nightmare and certainly her economy would have already stalled.

      "utterance": "Yes, That's what he's doing Jackie. By the way, both Sanders and Biden canceled their own election night rallies tonight and supposedly was out of concern for public health and safety. Really? Was this done to save lives or save face? The great socialist dream of the Sanders crowd was over even before tonight. Let's face it. So why force yourself to addresses this embarrassment in front of the cameras this evening? And speaking of embarrassment, old Joe, he just needs to stay away from the microphones and perhaps take a nap. Beyond the partisan bickering and fear mongering, now is the time for America to stand united. Preparation, not panic is the key to coping with this virus. If changes have to happen to our response, they have to be made and they have to be made quickly. We all know by now that many of the CDC's early coronavirus tests were faulty. That was no doubt, very problematic. Yet President Trump acted fast and he cut through the FDA's red tape. Soon millions of test will be available. Even democrat governors have said some really nasty things about Trump are now lauding his administration's response."

He doesn't give in to the bureaucracy. He bends it to be more nimble. He pushes obstacles out of the way and solves problems. He has a take charge, hands on approach to the coronavirus and every other problem he faces. He'll work with Democrats on a legislative package to help working families. He'll do for our emergency response system, what he's done for our economy, make it stronger and better day by day and that's The Angle. All right joining me now, Larry Kudlow, Director of the White House National Economic Council. Larry, you said today during the task force briefing that the President can use executive authority apart from what the coronavirus task force has the authority to do, to make things happen. What specifically?"

    {
      "speaker": "LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, U.S. NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL",

He intends to use the full power of the federal government, the full power of the federal government to deal with the challenges, be the health challenges or economic challenges of the coronavirus. He's going to be bold as you say, he's cutting through a red tape. We're getting things in order. Some glitches temporarily, all being dealt with and he's unveiled a massive economic program to see if we need any help in the next few months to deal with these challenges. And let me just add this, because of his policies which you noted, he's cut taxes, he's deregulated, he's opened up, he's had good trade deals."

      "utterance": "I mean, facts are in short supply but yes, now there are challenges ahead. So he is unveiled first of all, a payroll tax holiday. OK? Which may extend until the end of the year. That is a middle class, blue collar, tax cut that will take care -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Now we got Republican senators Larry. That's the only problem. We got Larry, Kramer from North Dakota and other Republican senators who are throwing up caution flags. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. KEVIN CRAMER, R-N.D.",
      "utterance": "Frankly, a short term deferral of taxes or a payroll - short term payroll reduction sounds more like a safety net than a stimulus package, quite honestly. It's a stimulus that the economy needs is for good handling of and management of the coronavirus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So you're not only going to have Democrats saying no to a payroll tax cut as some kind of re-election bid by Trump. You have even Republicans who now claim to care about the deficit. Sorry, but they don't claim to care about the deficit when they're shoveling money to the Pentagon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, we should be worried about economic growth and as I say, what we want to do is keep the economy as sound as it is. It has been a blue collar boom and we'd like to keep it that way. Hence the payroll tax holiday. Now we're talking all the Republican leaders. We are up in the Senate today for the luncheon with the president and the vice president and a bunch of us. We'll be negotiating with the leaders in both houses but I don't think anything wrong with this. Again, you talk about things like unpaid leave. So we have a bunch of targeted assistance plans. Unpaid leave from sickness, that's something on our list. Dealing with small businesses that may be faltering, that is on our list. Dealing with distressed sectors, you know we're worried about airlines. We're worried about energy. That is also on our list."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The airlines have made an enormous amount of money in the past three or four years as well, right? I mean, people complain. The seats are getting smaller, there's more seats on planes. Is a bail out of the airline industry really what needs to happen? Or does this need to be going to the workers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "No. I'm not talking about bailouts and this is a balanced package, most of which will go to the workers as I said. That's the beauty of the payroll tax holiday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What's the big complaint from Republicans on the payroll tax?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Well, I think they're looking at it by the way. I mean, I'm not giving up on this. I think a lot of people supported it. We heard it in the lunch today. President was very well received on this stuff. There's some issues. We will go through the issues. We will look at the financing. We will look at the length of the payroll tax holiday but again, we're dealing - if you're sick at home and you're not getting paid, we're going to help you. That's very important. It's another middle class assistance. If you have a small business, we have ways through FEMA, through SPA and other federal agencies, we don't need legislation for most of the stuff. We will help you. If you're in a distress area or - it's not a bail out but at the margin for example, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is said, maybe some tax deferral, some temporary tax deferrals will help out. So the president is really being bold here to make sure that his strong economy remains as strong as possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "If he has to cut a deal with the Democrats and go around some of the Republicans, would he do that and take a more popular - you're not as populous as I am, Kudlow but the president is and I am too. So how about take the populist appeal to the workers, work with the Democrats on that and somebody's - Braun - Senator Braun, I like him but he's - he seems very adamantly opposed to payroll tax."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "This is the earliest stage so the president unveiled this yesterday. He did it again today. We'll be negotiating. We're going to talk to the leadership of both Houses I think that's the way to play this game."

      "utterance": "Speaker Pelosi and I have released proposals that Congress must take. We need widespread and free coronavirus testing. We want paid sick leave and emergency unemployment insurance. We must expand snap and wick, School lunch and other initiatives. We want to make sure that small businesses can continue. There should be loans and even grants."

We'll have a look at some of the distress - Look, the travel industry is in huge problem right now. We know that. Planes, we know -"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But we also have Fauci out there - Fauci out there is - so I don't like cruises. I'm sorry but I really him but he's like I don't like cruises and indicating that a lot of people should stay home. I mean, do people really need to stay home when they're not in one of these hot spots like New Rochelle or right in the midst of we know, the outbreak in Washington State? I mean, Americans want to stay at home. This is ridiculous."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "But I think to some extent you got to listen to what he's saying. For example, if you're a senior citizen, if you're elderly, you better watch out because that's where the mortality rate is. If you're not healthy, if you have pre-existing conditions, you better watch out. That's where the mortality rate is. If you're healthy and younger, you don't have much to worry about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But if you tell people if you're older, you can't basically implicitly, you shouldn't fly. That is a killer for the airline industry. That in and of itself is a killer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "I don't want to include flying because I haven't heard that yet. All I say is the cruise ship story with all due respect and we worry about the cruise business, may not be the optimal time if you're an older person and you have health concerns. So I think Fauci is being very common sense. Mike Pence is running the task force. I sit on it. He's doing a terrific job and this too. Going back to the president's statement, he wants to use all of the federal powers available to get through these challenges."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",

He's way ahead of the curve on this economic - so therefore if they want to peck away at it, that's too bad because this will do us some good and it's - look, it's better than just giving everybody a rebate.

Well, whether you happen to be the President of United States or not, if you don't have symptoms and there's no indication from medical position that you need to be tested, you should not be tested and we know this from several tests and this is no different than other test. If you test people that have a low likelihood of having the disease then the probability that test, positive test will be a false positive increases significantly. So we don't like to test people that have - have a low likelihood of a disease and in the case of the president, he had not a direct exposure, not a direct contact. He has no symptoms. There's really no reason to test him."

That's what's destabilizing the markets. That's what's getting everybody sequestered in their homes. In this particular case, the President actually showed the right example. I have met the White House physician. He's a very sober guy. He gave his judgment so first lesson here, listen to your doctor. Doctor said don't get tested, right? Second lesson here is, he didn't have direct contact with someone with coronavirus. He had contact with someone who shook the hand or had a photo-op with someone who had coronavirus so how many times - is that, if he had gotten tested, Laura, he would have been sending a message to the United States. If you're walking down the street and you hear that someone in that hospital has coronavirus, get tested. We would have a surge of people that were convinced they had it. So actually he projected calm in this situation."

Both candidates have canceled their big events. Biden is addressing only his - I guess his close supporters in Pennsylvania tonight. But Bernie Sanders is not only not speaking to thousands like he was planned to do, he's not appearing in public, apparently out of concern for the coronavirus. Does this make sense absent some presence in one of the hot zones or containment zone such as New Rochelle or maybe in Washington State?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEL RIO",
      "utterance": "Well, part of the problem we have Laura, is that unfortunately as you know, there was a mishap in the testing and we are way behind testing in this country and as we ramp up testing in the country, we're probably going to find a lot of people who are infected, who we don't know about and at this point in time, until we have further data, we need to assume that there's a lot more communities that we are aware of that have community transmission of the virus. And when there's community transmission, one of the most effective strategies to control the transmission of a virus like this one is what we call social distancing. So it is prudent to establish social distancing. I think it's appropriate that in many of our communities we try not to bring a lot of people together until we have better data. One we have better data I think we can make better decisions."

We are going to assume every single arena we have has coronavirus in it? It's just not -- we don't have the sense that there is that much coronavirus here yet. There's definitely more than we know about, he's right about that, but we don't need this fear of going outdoors. It's agoraphobia. They have a diagnosis for that. Let's get the testing done, and then we can decide, not just avoid everything in the meantime. I went to the Knick game last week, by the way. There was no one there. The Knicks are terrible, that might be the reason"

We have a fake pool here at Fox, so we want this tournament to go on, but we don't want anyone to be endangered. They've already canceled the half-marathon in New York, Dr. Del Rio. They're canceling conferences. It is doing huge harm to the travel and entertainment industry. And I think that in and of itself is sending people into some panic, so they are going to buy water, they're fighting over toilet paper. That can't be good either. You can get infected by fighting over toilet paper, I guess, you take it to its extreme."

      "speaker": "DEL RIO",

And I was talking to somebody today, and I was saying the biggest risk you have maybe of going to a big arena today, or go to a tournament may be drinking too much beer and falling and hitting your head to, and for that reason we are not canceling those tournaments. So I would say, again, we need better information, we need more data, and we need to sit down and really look at the data carefully. But I couldn't agree with you and with the doctor any more that we need people to be prepared, but at the same time, we don't need to spread panic."

You've heard a lot of nutty things during this health crisis regarding the coronavirus, but that is one of the most infuriating things. Joining me now Steve Mosher, author of \"Bully of Asia,\" and Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Steve, the left is more obsessed with fact-checking Trump than addressing the lies of the Chinese here. What gives? And is this China's dividend from sprinkling so much money around the United States and holding these lavish conferences for journalists over the years, et cetera, et cetera."

      "utterance": "First of all, Laura, this is the Wuhan virus. Actually, I prefer to call it the Chinese coronavirus, and the full title is the Chinese Communist Party's coronavirus, but let's follow the breadcrumbs. Back in November there were the first cases of the coronavirus in the city of Wuhan. By December the National Health Commission of the government of China had sent a commission down to investigate this new strain of pneumonia. They knew they had a problem. On January 1st they closed down all the military bases in and around Wuhan. They didn't tell the people of China, they didn't tell the world, but they closed down the military bases. The police force was protected, the military was protected from the virus. Then several million Chinese left the center of the epidemic, went throughout China, throughout the world, spreading the virus everywhere. Only after the horse had left the barn did they close the barn door. So everybody who was a victim of the coronavirus, everybody who dies as a result of the Chinese coronavirus virus is a victim of the Chinese Communist Party. And one more thing that as an American really, really gets my goat, and this is that the Chinese Communist Party is now whispering that the cause, the original source of the coronavirus was the United States of America."

And remember that they knew about this virus in December and January, and they allowed a 15,000 and more of their own citizens to fly on direct flights to the United States. So we have 60 days of a million people coming in from China, many of whom were probably exposed to the virus until Trump leveled the travel ban. And it's pretty miraculous, given what China did, that we've only had one out of 10 million Americans die, and one out of 500,000 be infected. And it really shows you that this virus is a very strange virus. As a historian, we are going to have tests and more cases are going to show, but I think a lot of it is going to show that people are still shedding the virus that got over, and that we're more in a static than a dynamic situation, and the situation is six weeks after the travel ban, if you look at the origins of this whole problem, it's China. China let people come into this country knowingly that they may be exposing Americans, and they didn't care."

And Steve, I might add that now we're seeing all these articles pop up in \"Bloomberg\" and other media outlets saying look at the number of infected people every day is lower and lower because of China's great handling of this virus.

More importantly, though, it's another glaring sign that Biden just isn't up to the task of being president, handling, forget complex issues, issues that have been around, Dinesh, for, what, I don't know, 50 years in American political life. Dinesh D'Souza, conservative commentator and author of the upcoming book \"United States of Socialism\" hits the shelves in just a few months.

But here's Biden taking on an ordinary guy who comes up to him and asks him about his position on gun control. And I think Biden's irascibility, his indignation, his complete surrender to emotion over reason, I think this is the hallmark -- Shakespeare very gently used the term a second childhood. And what he meant is that we reach a stage in life when, ultimately, we return to the peevishness, the irascibility and a scum of the arrest ability of childhood, and Biden is showing all of those symptoms."

So I think what we're seeing here is a new Biden, and this is a very distressing sight.
