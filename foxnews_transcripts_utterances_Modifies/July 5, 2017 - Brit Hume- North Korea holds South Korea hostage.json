      "sentences": "Breaking tonight, the Trump administration issuing a warning to the global community: stand with the United States against nuclear-armed North Korea or America will hold you accountable. That's \"The Story.\" Good evening, I'm Dana Perino in for Martha MacCallum. That stark message delivered to the world super powers as the president touches down in Poland ahead of the G-20 Summit where he will face North Korea's enablers. It was a little more than 24 hours ago, while American celebrated Independence Day that North Korea test launched its newest weapon, a missile capable of reaching Alaska while carrying a nuclear warhead. The Pentagon noting: this is like nothing I have ever seen from the Hermit regime. Earlier today, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, addressed an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council leveling a warning to North Korea's backers. \"Make no mistake. North Korea's launch of an ICBM is a clear and sharp military escalation. The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies. There remains more that the international community can and must do. We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime. The world is on notice. If we act together, we can still prevent a catastrophe. We will not repeat the inadequate approaches of the past that have brought us to this dark day.\"  For years, the world has looked on as North Korea started its people and threatens its neighbors. Now that the rogue regime has become a clear and present threat to the U.S. mainland, it looks to be President Trump's problem to solve. Brit Hume joins me now, he is Fox News senior political analyst. Brit, this would -- I think you would agree, be considered the most urgent problem to date for President Trump's foreign policy team.",

He's now confronting what the world, I think, has regarded for many years now, many decades now, really, and a series of American presidents as well, as an almost insoluble problem. And the reason is not just the development of these advanced weapons, which we're now seeing being tested. It's been the fact that the North has, for decades now, literally had a gun to the head of South Korea's capital of Seoul. Not with a particularly advanced weapon, but because with a vast store of conventional artillery capable of inflicting unspeakable damage on Seoul with its population.  Seoul, South Korea, the capital of course, with its population in the neighborhood of ten million people. Look, if the United States and its allies or the United States acting alone were to attack North Korea, the conflict would not last very long and North Korea would be resoundingly defeated, but at what cost? And the cost would be felt by the people of South Korea. So, they have a gun to their head and that has been a restraining forest against the series of American presidents and other countries in the world seeking to deal with North Korea's outlaw behavior.",

But that process is the very process that you heard Nikki Haley just described as the one that's been tried before and has never worked. So, it is a bit of a mystery exactly what the administration has in mind. You know, we put forces in the area, we sent these signals and so on, but what happens if you actually use them? And that is where the question of the potential damage to Seoul and its millions of people come into play.

      "sentences": "Dana, you said it a second ago and I think it's very true that this could potentially be when the president meets with Vladimir Putin, this will be a full bilateral. Initially, it was thought it was going to be one of those quick meetings on the sidelines of the G-20, but it'd be a full bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia is widely seen and this goes back to be 2012 election campaign, where candidate Mitt Romney said it, as America's biggest strategic adversary. The president has long advocated having a more constructive relationship with Russia. And this meeting that he has with him on Friday could either be the beginning of the thaw or it could really kind of cement the freeze between the two countries. I have to tell you, there was a lot of skepticism among America's European allies, including here in Poland of Putin's intentions and there are a lot of people who were worried about America forging closer ties with Russia. I mean, you take Poland, for example, that shares a long border with Ukraine.  We all know what Russia is doing in Ukraine. It also shares a border with Kaliningrad, which is a -- you know, it is part of the Russian Federation and Kaliningrad City is home to the Baltic fleet. So, a lot of people will be watching tomorrow when the president gives his big speech in Krasinski Square, which was the historic sight of the 1944 Warsaw uprising against Nazi Germany. Will he talk about the promise of having better relations with Poland -- with the Russia, rather, or will he talk about the potential threat from Vladimir Putin?  As far as his visit here to Poland goes, it looks like the president is going to be on friendly territory. Andre Duda, who is the president of Poland, shares very much the same sort of political ideology as the president does. And when he speaks at the Krasinski Square, it's expected that he could have upwards of channels, 15,000 people there and it's likely that they will be very welcoming of the president. There could be some protests because the Law and Justice Party, which is the governing party here in Poland has attracted some protesters. But likely, if there are some, they will be small in number and probably kept at arm's length. Then let's head toward the end of the week when the president goes to Hamburg, Germany, for that G-20 Summit. Potentially, a chance to repair relations with some of the older European countries, if you will; like France and Germany, particularly, on the issue of climate change, but if you look at what Angela Merkel said last week and she'll be meeting with President Trump one-on-one on Thursday night. She's very skeptical about the president's stance on withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, suggesting that Europe may need to go it alone against the United States.  So, that's a high-stakes meeting as well, as will be the bilateral meeting, Dana, between the president and the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, on Friday. The two of them seem to have a good relationship at Mar-a-Lago, but it was during that meeting that Xi Jinping promised he was going to do more about North Korea. The president, in that tweet this morning, basically saying it looks like the Chinese are saying one thing and doing another when it comes to North Korea. Noting the trade has gone up between the two countries in the first quarter of this year. So, I think that could potentially be a very interesting meeting as well. Dana?",

And so, he's not coming into comfortable territory when he goes and he does his rallies in the United States, the Deep South, the Midwest and the rest, that's very friendly territory. Here, he's actually coming into a table of his peers, whether or not he sees them in that way and it'll be more hostile. And I think that's going to be a challenge.",

It's very clear that's not going to happen. The magic of Mar-a-Lago between Trump and Xi Jinping was by far the best foreign policy success he's had since he's become president. And yet over the last few days, we've seen very clearly he's going to unwind.

It doesn't matter. He is very important to him to show that he had a legitimate electoral victory in the United States.

The United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies. There remains more that the international community can and must do. We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime. The world is on notice. If we act together, we can still prevent a catastrophe. We will not repeat the inadequate approaches of the past that have brought us to this dark day.\" For years, the world has looked on as North Korea started its people and threatens its neighbors. Now that the rogue regime has become a clear and present threat to the U.S. mainland, it looks to be President Trump's problem to solve. Brit Hume joins me now, he is Fox News senior political analyst. Brit, this would -- I think you would agree, be considered the most urgent problem to date for President Trump's foreign policy team."

He's now confronting what the world, I think, has regarded for many years now, many decades now, really, and a series of American presidents as well, as an almost insoluble problem. And the reason is not just the development of these advanced weapons, which we're now seeing being tested. It's been the fact that the North has, for decades now, literally had a gun to the head of South Korea's capital of Seoul. Not with a particularly advanced weapon, but because with a vast store of conventional artillery capable of inflicting unspeakable damage on Seoul with its population. Seoul, South Korea, the capital of course, with its population in the neighborhood of ten million people. Look, if the United States and its allies or the United States acting alone were to attack North Korea, the conflict would not last very long and North Korea would be resoundingly defeated, but at what cost? And the cost would be felt by the people of South Korea. So, they have a gun to their head and that has been a restraining forest against the series of American presidents and other countries in the world seeking to deal with North Korea's outlaw behavior."

If that is not to happen and it does not look like it is happening, despite some earlier hope that it might be, then the question gets much more difficult because, you know, obviously we have the weaponry and we, I suppose, could try to impose additional sanctions on North Korea. But that process is the very process that you heard Nikki Haley just described as the one that's been tried before and has never worked. So, it is a bit of a mystery exactly what the administration has in mind. You know, we put forces in the area, we sent these signals and so on, but what happens if you actually use them? And that is where the question of the potential damage to Seoul and its millions of people come into play. And I've never heard anybody articulate strategy, a military strategy to get around that problem."

President Trump arriving in Poland just hours ago, ahead of the G-20 in days of meetings that could provide a reset of sorts with Europe. And of course, tensions running high as the president gears up for what could be his most important foreign leader meeting to date: a face-to-face with Vladimir Putin. Chief White House Correspondent, John Roberts, is live in Warsaw with the very latest. John?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Dana, you said it a second ago and I think it's very true that this could potentially be when the president meets with Vladimir Putin, this will be a full bilateral. Initially, it was thought it was going to be one of those quick meetings on the sidelines of the G-20, but it'd be a full bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia is widely seen and this goes back to be 2012 election campaign, where candidate Mitt Romney said it, as America's biggest strategic adversary. The president has long advocated having a more constructive relationship with Russia. And this meeting that he has with him on Friday could either be the beginning of the thaw or it could really kind of cement the freeze between the two countries. I have to tell you, there was a lot of skepticism among America's European allies, including here in Poland of Putin's intentions and there are a lot of people who were worried about America forging closer ties with Russia. I mean, you take Poland, for example, that shares a long border with Ukraine. We all know what Russia is doing in Ukraine. It also shares a border with Kaliningrad, which is a -- you know, it is part of the Russian Federation and Kaliningrad City is home to the Baltic fleet. So, a lot of people will be watching tomorrow when the president gives his big speech in Krasinski Square, which was the historic sight of the 1944 Warsaw uprising against Nazi Germany. Will he talk about the promise of having better relations with Poland -- with the Russia, rather, or will he talk about the potential threat from Vladimir Putin? As far as his visit here to Poland goes, it looks like the president is going to be on friendly territory. Andre Duda, who is the president of Poland, shares very much the same sort of political ideology as the president does. And when he speaks at the Krasinski Square, it's expected that he could have upwards of channels, 15,000 people there and it's likely that they will be very welcoming of the president. There could be some protests because the Law and Justice Party, which is the governing party here in Poland has attracted some protesters. But likely, if there are some, they will be small in number and probably kept at arm's length. Then let's head toward the end of the week when the president goes to Hamburg, Germany, for that G-20 Summit. Potentially, a chance to repair relations with some of the older European countries, if you will; like France and Germany, particularly, on the issue of climate change, but if you look at what Angela Merkel said last week and she'll be meeting with President Trump one-on-one on Thursday night. She's very skeptical about the president's stance on withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, suggesting that Europe may need to go it alone against the United States. So, that's a high-stakes meeting as well, as will be the bilateral meeting, Dana, between the president and the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, on Friday. The two of them seem to have a good relationship at Mar-a-Lago, but it was during that meeting that Xi Jinping promised he was going to do more about North Korea. The president, in that tweet this morning, basically saying it looks like the Chinese are saying one thing and doing another when it comes to North Korea. Noting the trade has gone up between the two countries in the first quarter of this year. So, I think that could potentially be a very interesting meeting as well. Dana?"

So, this will be the first time in history in G-20 that the American president will be so personally disliked and distrusted by a majority of leaders around the table. And so, he's not coming into comfortable territory when he goes and he does his rallies in the United States, the Deep South, the Midwest and the rest, that's very friendly territory. Here, he's actually coming into a table of his peers, whether or not he sees them in that way and it'll be more hostile. And I think that's going to be a challenge."

I think the meeting is going to go well. I think he could care less about the fact that it's upsetting the Europeans. Trump has made very clear this is something he wants to do. He's going to go ahead with it. So, I think he'll come across looking from his perspective and those that like Trump, they'll be delighted that he's continuing to say, I don't care, I'm absolutely meeting with Putin, I'm meeting him on my terms, I'm not going to do what other people tell me that they I should.

But if the Chinese weren't willing to squeeze North Korea when they were posing that kind of threat in the region, why would they suddenly do it's just because they're starting to pose a threat to Alaska or the continent in the United States? It's very clear that's not going to happen. The magic of Mar-a-Lago between Trump and Xi Jinping was by far the best foreign policy success he's had since he's become president. And yet over the last few days, we've seen very clearly he's going to unwind. They've had one phone call; the two presidents, it's not gone very well in the last couple of days and now going to see each other at the G-20. It's by far the most important moment."

But I'm not in any way surprised that Trump has no intention of bringing up the Russian hacks against the U.S. election, irrespective of what Trump may or may not have done with the Russians historically. It doesn't matter. He is very important to him to show that he had a legitimate electoral victory in the United States. Bringing up the election hacks after Obama did very little is completely it's against his personal interests. He's a man that's going to put his own interests before National Security; the country on that, we've seen that already, he's not going to bring it up."

But what I do agree with Molly is this statement was absurd. And I don't why they put that last hanger online at the bottom of the statement, to begin with. But here's the thing: I think this -- the CNN was given a gift here. They could've revealed his name and said, this is all part of the media -- they're trying to smear us, the Trump camp.

But when the news organization becomes the news story, I think you can try and lose sight of what you are supposed to do.

For people who aren't there, they may look at this and say, why am I supposed to care so much about something that means nothing? That really goes nowhere. Yes, there are larger philosophical considerations to be made here. Yes, there are more important things to talk about.

And that is dangerous, because the media do need to hold this president and this administration accountable and it becomes very easy to tune out what people are saying when they cover out outlandish stories, when they're covering ice cream or they're doing a front page, top of the new story on who -- what random person made a funny internet joke, instead of more substantive news.

Charlie Hurt is a political columnist for the Washington Times, and a Fox News contributor, and Zac Petkanas is a former aide to Hillary Clinton campaign.

Kris Kobach, who you mentioned is running this commission, in the state of Kansas has used this very type of information to purge voter rolls of American citizens who shared names, for example, with undocumented immigrants.

We have no idea how many people are, you know, commit voter fraud. We do know there's lots of evidence out there. In Virginia, for example, there are thousands of names over the past couple of years that have been found who are illegally on the rolls.

The NYPD calling the ambush a, quote, unprovoked assassination. The gunman was later killed by police, and we're learning he had a history of vulgar anti-cop rants on social media. Familia, meanwhile, she leaves behind three children. And today, the Pentagon announcing the death of army private, Hansen Kirkpatrick, killed in a deadly mortar attack in Afghanistan that wounded two others. The 19-year-old was hit by, quote, indirect fire, in the Heldman Province, where Afghan security forces are locked in constant clashes with the Taliban. The incident is currently under investigation. Kirkpatrick's commanding officer called him a caring, discipline, intelligent, young soldier. And finally, comedian Kathy Griffin not laughing tonight after reports claim she was questioned by secret service agents for over an hour, as the agency continues to probe that controversial photo of her holding the bloody head of President Trump. Griffin apologized for the stunt month, calling it a, quote, joke. Now to a case that is most likely the first of its kind. A parent in Canada is now fighting to omit their child's sex from the birth certificate, arguing the child should be able to determine if they want to be identified as a boy or a girl. Watch."

Governor, I'm sure that these parents know -- have the child's best interests at heart from their point of view. It may not be the choice that I make. But is this a situation where we have culture, science, ethics, and religion, all sort of clashing at once, and the government sitting there saying, well, we don't actually make the birth certificates like that?"

      "utterance": "Dana, this is a disturbing story on many, many levels. But one of them is because there really is one of two choices. A person is a male or is a female. That's a biological reality. You can pretend that someone, you know, is African-American when they're actually white. You can pretend anything you want. We all pretended things when we were children. But it doesn't change reality. And this is a disturbing trend where parents say that, well, my child can make that decision when he or she is six or seven. I've raised three kids. I've got grandkids. The truth is kids can't decide what they want for dinner. They don't have the maturity to make these kinds of decisions. And there're so many studies -- there is a great article by Doctor Michelle Cretella, president of the American college of pediatricians, in which she argues that this is really a damaging thing to children, it's disturbing."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "And so, you, as a former governor, if you were looking at this situation in your state, how might have you resolve this because you're talking about parents who love their child, and yet the state actually needs to, I guess, step in here and make a decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I think we've got to face reality. Sure, these parents, I'm going to say -- I'll grant and stipulate, they love their child, but they may not know how to love them in a way that makes sense for them biologically. Again, you can pretend that your little boy is really a little girl, but he's still a little boy. And unless you go through a gender reassignment surgery and change the biological nature of that child in the bodily functions, and there are many studies that show this is not something that ought to be entered into lightly. And, in fact, if it is, there are serious health consequences. And even in Sweden, where there is a lot more support for LGBQ activities, please know that the suicide rate is 20 percent higher for transgender individuals. This is not something that people ought to smirk at or laugh about, it's incredibly serious, and a lot of people seem to be just staring in the face at reality and saying, no, it's not boy or girl. It's whatever I wanted to be. Well, I'm sorry, Dana, that's not the way life deals us. It just isn't."

    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's already the beginning of a trend. There's a case in point, Katharine Hepburn, when she was a little girl, didn't want to be a little girl. She wanted to be a little boy, she cut her hair off. She went with the name Jimmy because she just didn't like it. Now she grew out of that phase and became one of the leading ladies of our time. But what if Katharine Hepburn had been allowed to just be Jimmy her whole life, that's the things were trying to deal with."
