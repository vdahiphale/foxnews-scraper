      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Wait until you see our time line tonight, huge breaking news. Learning that the anti-FBI Trump hater, Peter Strzok, has been escorted from FBI headquarters. He's out of the building, why does he still have a job? And we also know that James Comey tonight is under investigation. Andrew McCabe may now face criminal charges.  Now, Robert Mueller's witch hunt has now been exposed for rampant huge political bias as the origins of the so-called investigation were clearly illegitimate. And President Trump has been vindicated. And it's been less than a week since the inspector general's report was released but we now have clear evidence that there is a deep state in this country and it's slowly crumbling before our eyes. And, by the way, this is definitely without a doubt as I predicted, the year of the boomerang.  Earlier today, the I.G. Michael Horowitz was back on the Hill in what was an extremely contentious hearing. We've got all of the highlights and we'll roll out how the rampant bias from the lead investigator, Peter Strzok, has destroyed any credibility that is surrounding Mueller's partisan witch hunt.  Plus, we have news about Rod Rosenstein and his ongoing obstruction. And Mueller's pit bull, Andrew Weissmann, guess what? He's now the subject of Freedom of Information Act lawsuit surrounding his anti-Trump bias. Remember he's at Hillary's so-called victory party. And finally tonight, we can report that the United States has, in fact, pulled out of the U.N. so-called phony Human Rights Council. And it's about time.  Sit tight, stay tuned, buckle up, we're gaining huge momentum in tonight's very important breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "Peter Strzok has now been shown the door. According to his lawyer, the now infamous Trump-hating FBI agent is still collecting a paycheck. He has been escorted out of the FBI bureau headquarters after the I.G. report highlighted his rampant pro-Hillary and anti-Trump bias.   Now, we have known about this forever. Why didn't this happen earlier? Why did he still have a job? Now, we've been sounding the alarm about Peter Strzok for months. And now, everything that we have been telling you is coming true right before your eyes. Now, it's definitely the year of the boomerang. Now, this is so important, because the facts now are irrefutable. Peter Strzok, he was the lead agent in Hillary Clinton's 2016 criminal investigation where we know she committed felonies, where we know she mishandled classified top secret information on a private server. We also know she obstructed justice, deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washing the hard drives with Bleach Bit, and having aides destroy the evidence with hammers and removing SIM cards just for good luck. These are all irrefutable facts.   Peter Strzok was the guy, the agent that played the key role in drafting, remember, her exoneration letter with James Comey months before Strzok actually even interviewed Clinton or 17 other people. The same Peter Strzok who was then tapped to play the lead role in the phony Trump Russia collusion investigation. Now, he hates Trump. So, he fixed the Hillary Clinton investigation and then he starts going after Trump. He's the lead guy in every case. After months of inquiries, months of obstruction, the DOJ and multiple discoveries, we can now for you put together what is an accurate timeline of this destructive, biased culture at some of the highest levels of the FBI. It all starts with Trump-hating FBI love bird Peter Strzok and his mistress, Lisa Page. Now, look at this -- way back in 2015, Strzok texting page, \"Bernie Sanders is an idiot like Trump.\" On February 12, 2016, from Page, \"he simply cannot be president.\" And Strzok texts back, \"oh, abysmal.\"  And the text continues, and this is an important one -- on February 24, 2016, page texting, \"Hillary Clinton might be our next president. The last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear.\" And Peter Strzok, who conducts the interview with Hillary, is the lead investigator in the case, agrees.   In other words, time to cover our backs, fix the Clinton investigation, she's going to be our next president, we want to be on her good side. Then on March 3, 2016, \"Trump is a loathsome human being, he's awful. Hillary should win 100 million to zero. This man cannot be president.\"  On March 16 2016, \"I can't believe that Donald Trump is a serious candidate for president.\" The lead investigator in the Clinton server case, and by the way would be the lead in the start of the so-called Trump-Russia witch hunt. And on June 11, Strzok calls Trump bigoted. On July 18, Page calls Trump an enormous, well, expletive. On July 21, Strzok calls Trump a disaster. And, by the way, he's only days away from beginning the Trump so called collusion investigation.  These texts are even more troubling and they take a more troubling turn. Let's look at July 5, 2016, remember Comey that day, announced the FBI would not be pursuing charges against Hillary Clinton. Now, sometime shortly thereafter, the FBI opened their investigation into so-called Trump-Russia collusion and, again, we all know Strzok played a vital role in both these investigations, a lead role in both of them.  Then July 31, 2016, just days after Hillary Clinton's investigation ended, the fix was in, and the Trump investigation started. This is what Strzok texted then: \"Damn, this feels momentous, because this matters. The other one did, too, but that was to ensure we didn't F something up. This matters because this matters. So super glad to be on this voyage with you.\" Why does it matter? Because this investigation, what, it can hurt Trump? And other investigation, we can't mess it up because we're rigging Hillary Clinton's investigation? So she's not charged line everybody else in America would have been charged?  And look at this exchange just days later. August 8, 2016, Page writing, \"Trump's not ever going to become president right, right?\" Strzok responded: \"No, no, he's not. We'll stop it.\"   And then on August 15, 2016, Strzok telling Page, There's no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take that risk, it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.\" \"This matters, we'll stop it, an insurance policy in case he gets elected\" -- all comments from two senior FBI officials, responsible for investigating one candidate for president, and then the other candidate that they hate for something that was never, ever should have been started to be honest. And there's more. Following that exchange, more anti-Trump texts, August 26, 2016, Strzok is now the lead investigator in the case of Donald Trump. Quote: \"Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could smell the Trump support.\" October 19th, Strzok says, \"Trump is a bleeping idiot.\" On November 7, in response to an article predicting a possible Trump victory, Strzok writes, \"Oh my god, this is F-ing terrifying.\" And after the election, November 13, 2016, Page writing, \"I bought 'All the President's Men,' I figured I need to brush up on Watergate.\" After all you, my boyfriend, are trying to take him down.  Now, keep in mind, this is just a small sample. Hundreds and hundreds of these anti-Trump, pro-Hillary texts from Strzok and Page, and so many anti-Trump messages from at least three other high-ranking unnamed FBI officials.  Now, these were the people that cleared Hillary Clinton of obvious felonies, they rigged that investigation, she would not get charged, not be removed for being the nominee of the Democratic Party the way every other American would. They felt like they knew better than you, we, you know, we're the smelly people that like Walmart, because you get good deals there. And there was, of course, the same people tasked with investigating Trump. Now, is this what we call justice in the United States? This is what we call a free and fair investigation? Today, the lawyer for Peter Strzok actually implied his client was the victim of political targeting. Did he read his client's own texts?   By the way, I do have advice for Strzok and his attorney tonight. It's the same advice I offer Comey before he released his ridiculous self-serving book and went on that ridiculous book tour. You do, Peter Strzok, you do have the right to remain silent. I'm suggesting you use it. And earlier, Inspector General Michael Horowitz was back on the Hill, this time in front of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, where he was absolutely grilled over his findings and surrounding the destructive level of bias among the highest levels in the FBI.  Now, take a look at this moment from House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy. He's back on his game. Take a look.",

Now, the constant stonewalling, the slow-walking coming from the Justice Department has now led Judicial Watch to sue the Department of Justice for the release of Andrew Weissmann's text messages related to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As you know, Weissmann, big-time Democratic donor, tapped by Robert Mueller to play the lead role in the ongoing Russia witch hunt, New York Times called Weissmann's Mueller's pit bull. He was at Hillary's, quote, victory party. It didn't work out that way. And we have frequently documented Weissmann's prosecutorial misconduct many times on the show. Now, we'll keep you updated on that story as this FOIA request plays out in court. Now, tonight, with McCabe fired and potentially facing charges, Strzok on his way out, Comey under investigation, Weissmann is now in the spotlight in terms of bias in Mueller's witch hunt is now being reviewed. In other words, our two-tiered system of justice, hopefully, I pray, is being dismantled, brick by brick.

And Fox has confirmed tonight that Peter Strzok, the controversial FBI agent was escorted out of FBI headquarters here in Washington last Friday. But it appears that for now at least he still has a job. We spoke to his attorney who put out a statement and says that Strzok is cooperating with an internal investigation at the FBI. Interesting because, we're learning it on the same day that Strzok came under fire as did former FBI director James Comey, at a House hearing where Republicans asserted that bad apples at the agency were so biased, that they prejudged not just the outcome of the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe but also the outcome of the Russia investigation involving President Trump. Republican Trey Gowdy pressed on the newly revealed text from 2016 in which Strzok talked about stopping Trump from being elected. Democrat Elijah Cummings, you see him there, he openly admitted at the hearing he would prefer to distract and talk instead about the child migration controversy, at one point charging that the president has set up child internment camps, that's the phrase that Cummings used. Tonight, the president, meanwhile, wrapped up an urgent meeting on Capitol Hill with House republicans on immigration, they are floating bills that would allow immigrant families to stay together while they wait for an immigration judge to hear their case. White House officials say the president could support one of those bills but only if it has funding for a border wall other border security measures. And Democrat Chuck Schumer has said he will not support such a measure. It's interesting because Schumer has been complaining about these detention centers, about the way children are being treated at the border. But he's saying tonight he is not going to support legislation that would actually fix this problem, and make sure that children are not separated from their families. Schumer stated reason he thinks it will take too long to pass the legislation, it will be easier for the president to just use his pen and change this on an executive basis. I can tell you White House officials here think that the real reason is he wants to keep this political issue alive, Sean.",

Learning that the anti-FBI Trump hater, Peter Strzok, has been escorted from FBI headquarters. He's out of the building, why does he still have a job? And we also know that James Comey tonight is under investigation. Andrew McCabe may now face criminal charges. Now, Robert Mueller's witch hunt has now been exposed for rampant huge political bias as the origins of the so-called investigation were clearly illegitimate. And President Trump has been vindicated. And it's been less than a week since the inspector general's report was released but we now have clear evidence that there is a deep state in this country and it's slowly crumbling before our eyes. And, by the way, this is definitely without a doubt as I predicted, the year of the boomerang. Earlier today, the I.G. Michael Horowitz was back on the Hill in what was an extremely contentious hearing. We've got all of the highlights and we'll roll out how the rampant bias from the lead investigator, Peter Strzok, has destroyed any credibility that is surrounding Mueller's partisan witch hunt. Plus, we have news about Rod Rosenstein and his ongoing obstruction. And Mueller's pit bull, Andrew Weissmann, guess what? He's now the subject of Freedom of Information Act lawsuit surrounding his anti-Trump bias. Remember he's at Hillary's so-called victory party. And finally tonight, we can report that the United States has, in fact, pulled out of the U.N. so-called phony Human Rights Council. And it's about time. Sit tight, stay tuned, buckle up, we're gaining huge momentum in tonight's very important breaking news opening monologue."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Peter Strzok has now been shown the door. According to his lawyer, the now infamous Trump-hating FBI agent is still collecting a paycheck. He has been escorted out of the FBI bureau headquarters after the I.G. report highlighted his rampant pro-Hillary and anti-Trump bias. Now, we have known about this forever. Why didn't this happen earlier? Why did he still have a job? Now, we've been sounding the alarm about Peter Strzok for months. And now, everything that we have been telling you is coming true right before your eyes. Now, it's definitely the year of the boomerang. Now, this is so important, because the facts now are irrefutable. Peter Strzok, he was the lead agent in Hillary Clinton's 2016 criminal investigation where we know she committed felonies, where we know she mishandled classified top secret information on a private server. We also know she obstructed justice, deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails, acid washing the hard drives with Bleach Bit, and having aides destroy the evidence with hammers and removing SIM cards just for good luck. These are all irrefutable facts. Peter Strzok was the guy, the agent that played the key role in drafting, remember, her exoneration letter with James Comey months before Strzok actually even interviewed Clinton or 17 other people. The same Peter Strzok who was then tapped to play the lead role in the phony Trump Russia collusion investigation. Now, he hates Trump. So, he fixed the Hillary Clinton investigation and then he starts going after Trump. He's the lead guy in every case. After months of inquiries, months of obstruction, the DOJ and multiple discoveries, we can now for you put together what is an accurate timeline of this destructive, biased culture at some of the highest levels of the FBI. It all starts with Trump-hating FBI love bird Peter Strzok and his mistress, Lisa Page. Now, look at this -- way back in 2015, Strzok texting page, \"Bernie Sanders is an idiot like Trump.\" On February 12, 2016, from Page, \"he simply cannot be president.\" And Strzok texts back, \"oh, abysmal.\" And the text continues, and this is an important one -- on February 24, 2016, page texting, \"Hillary Clinton might be our next president. The last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear.\" And Peter Strzok, who conducts the interview with Hillary, is the lead investigator in the case, agrees. In other words, time to cover our backs, fix the Clinton investigation, she's going to be our next president, we want to be on her good side. Then on March 3, 2016, \"Trump is a loathsome human being, he's awful. Hillary should win 100 million to zero. This man cannot be president.\" On March 16 2016, \"I can't believe that Donald Trump is a serious candidate for president.\" The lead investigator in the Clinton server case, and by the way would be the lead in the start of the so-called Trump-Russia witch hunt. And on June 11, Strzok calls Trump bigoted. On July 18, Page calls Trump an enormous, well, expletive. On July 21, Strzok calls Trump a disaster. And, by the way, he's only days away from beginning the Trump so called collusion investigation. These texts are even more troubling and they take a more troubling turn. Let's look at July 5, 2016, remember Comey that day, announced the FBI would not be pursuing charges against Hillary Clinton. Now, sometime shortly thereafter, the FBI opened their investigation into so-called Trump-Russia collusion and, again, we all know Strzok played a vital role in both these investigations, a lead role in both of them. Then July 31, 2016, just days after Hillary Clinton's investigation ended, the fix was in, and the Trump investigation started. This is what Strzok texted then: \"Damn, this feels momentous, because this matters. The other one did, too, but that was to ensure we didn't F something up. This matters because this matters. So super glad to be on this voyage with you.\" Why does it matter? Because this investigation, what, it can hurt Trump? And other investigation, we can't mess it up because we're rigging Hillary Clinton's investigation? So she's not charged line everybody else in America would have been charged? And look at this exchange just days later. August 8, 2016, Page writing, \"Trump's not ever going to become president right, right?\" Strzok responded: \"No, no, he's not. We'll stop it.\" And then on August 15, 2016, Strzok telling Page, There's no way he gets elected. But I'm afraid we can't take that risk, it's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.\" \"This matters, we'll stop it, an insurance policy in case he gets elected\" -- all comments from two senior FBI officials, responsible for investigating one candidate for president, and then the other candidate that they hate for something that was never, ever should have been started to be honest. And there's more. Following that exchange, more anti-Trump texts, August 26, 2016, Strzok is now the lead investigator in the case of Donald Trump. Quote: \"Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could smell the Trump support.\" October 19th, Strzok says, \"Trump is a bleeping idiot.\" On November 7, in response to an article predicting a possible Trump victory, Strzok writes, \"Oh my god, this is F-ing terrifying.\" And after the election, November 13, 2016, Page writing, \"I bought 'All the President's Men,' I figured I need to brush up on Watergate.\" After all you, my boyfriend, are trying to take him down. Now, keep in mind, this is just a small sample. Hundreds and hundreds of these anti-Trump, pro-Hillary texts from Strzok and Page, and so many anti-Trump messages from at least three other high-ranking unnamed FBI officials. Now, these were the people that cleared Hillary Clinton of obvious felonies, they rigged that investigation, she would not get charged, not be removed for being the nominee of the Democratic Party the way every other American would. They felt like they knew better than you, we, you know, we're the smelly people that like Walmart, because you get good deals there. And there was, of course, the same people tasked with investigating Trump. Now, is this what we call justice in the United States? This is what we call a free and fair investigation? Today, the lawyer for Peter Strzok actually implied his client was the victim of political targeting. Did he read his client's own texts? By the way, I do have advice for Strzok and his attorney tonight. It's the same advice I offer Comey before he released his ridiculous self-serving book and went on that ridiculous book tour. You do, Peter Strzok, you do have the right to remain silent. I'm suggesting you use it. And earlier, Inspector General Michael Horowitz was back on the Hill, this time in front of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, where he was absolutely grilled over his findings and surrounding the destructive level of bias among the highest levels in the FBI. Now, take a look at this moment from House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy. He's back on his game. Take a look."

That is textbook bias. It is quite literally the definition of bias -- allowing something other than the facts to determine your decision. These agents were calling her president before she was even interviewed. They were calling for the end of the Trump campaign before the investigation even began.

So, this wouldn't be the first time he hasn't given us information. Frankly, I think we're entitled to it. I want to -- well, I got 30 seconds. I don't have time to get into another subject area here.

Now, the constant stonewalling, the slow-walking coming from the Justice Department has now led Judicial Watch to sue the Department of Justice for the release of Andrew Weissmann's text messages related to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As you know, Weissmann, big-time Democratic donor, tapped by Robert Mueller to play the lead role in the ongoing Russia witch hunt, New York Times called Weissmann's Mueller's pit bull. He was at Hillary's, quote, victory party. It didn't work out that way. And we have frequently documented Weissmann's prosecutorial misconduct many times on the show. Now, we'll keep you updated on that story as this FOIA request plays out in court. Now, tonight, with McCabe fired and potentially facing charges, Strzok on his way out, Comey under investigation, Weissmann is now in the spotlight in terms of bias in Mueller's witch hunt is now being reviewed. In other words, our two-tiered system of justice, hopefully, I pray, is being dismantled, brick by brick. And thank God because as Chairman Gowdy said earlier today, we cannot survive with the justice system that is this corrupt. If we don't get this right -- these are my comments -- and as we know it should be and expected to be, a constitutional republic, equal application under the law, equal justice under the law, guess what? The United States in truth will no longer exist. Here now with reaction, Fox News contributor Sara Carter, author of the brand new book \"The Russia Hoax\" and, of course, yes, the conspiracy to save Hillary Clinton and destroy Donald Trump which is out in just a couple of weeks.

And today, it was the perfect example of it. It was a blistering denunciation of James Comey who is bereft of judgment and temperament and competence. And one of the things that was brought out by Trey Gowdy today is, here's James Comey, who fought the special counsel in Hillary Clinton case, and yet stole government documents, leaked them to the media, to trigger a special counsel in the Donald Trump case. You know, if this isn't evidence of bias that led to a dilating investigation without crimes of a president of the United States, I don't know what is."

And I think that once those documents are turned over, if they are turned over. I mean, think about this, Sean, Congress has to fight tooth and nail for every single document. Representative, you know, Jim Jordan today, was very explicit. He said, you know, Rod Rosenstein was withholding this information from Congress.

So, James Comey -- I mean, wait until the second part of the inspector general's report comes out, it will not be good for James Comey, because he's also going to be delving into whether he abused his position of power by using a fabricated document, the dossier, paid for by Hillary Clinton, to wiretap the Trump campaign."

And they've now been caught, the texts are there, you can read them. You have to be an idiot not to realize they're totally biased. And the Mueller investigation is built around. Strzok, after all, was the lead investigator that Mueller selected. Now, it turns out that there are two of the unnamed people who were texting equally horrible things about the president, with an equal amount of bias, presently part -- I believe this is correct although this is just a report -- they may be part of the Mueller team. We will not know that until Mueller is investigated. As I said the other night, the investigators need to be investigated if we're going to see justice here.

And Fox has confirmed tonight that Peter Strzok, the controversial FBI agent was escorted out of FBI headquarters here in Washington last Friday. But it appears that for now at least he still has a job. We spoke to his attorney who put out a statement and says that Strzok is cooperating with an internal investigation at the FBI. Interesting because, we're learning it on the same day that Strzok came under fire as did former FBI director James Comey, at a House hearing where Republicans asserted that bad apples at the agency were so biased, that they prejudged not just the outcome of the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe but also the outcome of the Russia investigation involving President Trump. Republican Trey Gowdy pressed on the newly revealed text from 2016 in which Strzok talked about stopping Trump from being elected. Democrat Elijah Cummings, you see him there, he openly admitted at the hearing he would prefer to distract and talk instead about the child migration controversy, at one point charging that the president has set up child internment camps, that's the phrase that Cummings used. Tonight, the president, meanwhile, wrapped up an urgent meeting on Capitol Hill with House republicans on immigration, they are floating bills that would allow immigrant families to stay together while they wait for an immigration judge to hear their case. White House officials say the president could support one of those bills but only if it has funding for a border wall other border security measures. And Democrat Chuck Schumer has said he will not support such a measure. It's interesting because Schumer has been complaining about these detention centers, about the way children are being treated at the border. But he's saying tonight he is not going to support legislation that would actually fix this problem, and make sure that children are not separated from their families. Schumer stated reason he thinks it will take too long to pass the legislation, it will be easier for the president to just use his pen and change this on an executive basis. I can tell you White House officials here think that the real reason is he wants to keep this political issue alive, Sean."
