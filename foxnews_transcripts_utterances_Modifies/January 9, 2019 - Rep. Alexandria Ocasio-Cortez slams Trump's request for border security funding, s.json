This is his first Oval Office address and he chose to do it on immigration. You can choose to think that it was the speech didn't move the ball. You can choose to think that the speech was factually incorrect, but I do think that the networks did the right thing in taking the speech and that he, you know, gets this reputation for being someone who walks around the White House fuming all the time.

There were gunshots outside of my window and there was an active shooter running around because I was responsible for their safety, of them and me. So, I don't understand why Pelosi and Schumer threw around comments today, just today for example and their response, saying the words tragic and collateral damage, talking about the furlough when that disingenuous comment when our federal employees are being assaulted and murdered at the border. When our communities, our Midwestern and low income and minority communities and more are being decimated by the drug war, by drugs pouring over the southern border. I encourage you and everyone to read the 2018 DEA Drug Threat Assessment Report which categorized and was quite clear about the level of prolificness that drugs are flowing across the borders, in both ports of entry and not (ph). And the crippling effect that those transnational narco cartels have on literally everything in our system, including our prison populations, and including diplomacy and bureaucracy and politics and entire towns that are literally in the palms of their hands. So, when the wall is -- when they say oh, the wall is a morality issue or they talk about this, all of these government employees at the moment, those to me, greater consequences that we are dealing with right now that are being lost in that oversimplified response to the national conversation."

ICE agents are the actual people that apprehend illegal immigrants for committing human rights violations like child sex trafficking and homicide and things like that.

Those were facts ignored by the media and, of course, by Ma and Pa Kettle. Trump had put them in a fact-check box. But the best overreach, there's a bona fide emergency on the border, said \"The Washington Post\" just days ago. Jesse brought it up here yesterday. Then when Trump brought up this humanitarian crisis, the same paper called him a liar. Was it because he used their analysis? No wonder nobody pays attention to these so-called fact-checkers.

It doesn't mean you don't fight the crack epidemic. Police officers go after crimes. They don't go after people. So when you reduce illegal immigration, you will therefore reduce crime. I also don't like when they say this is a manufactured crisis. OK? Juan says, you know, in 2000, there were 100,000 illegal border crossings per month. Now there are 60,000 border crossings per month. That's like saying my home got broken into in 2000 five times, and now it gets broken into three times. It doesn't mean you don't do anything about securing your home. They're just trying to ignore the problem. Another statistic which was pretty amazing, Trump said last night that one in three women, when they make the journey north, gets raped when they're trying to come to America.

In fact, Daddy tells us that when Miles appeared, the doctor shouted, \"Oh, my God, he's huge!\" Normally, you know, at this table, the five of us, we like to argue. There will be hiccups, throw-ups, lots of late nights. But there's nothing that compares to a happy, healthy baby. So on this one, \"The Five\" agrees: Best wishes to Lauren, Brett, and baby Biles."

Then on FOXNewsPodcasts.com, which anybody can go to, I have Elbert Guillory on my podcast. He's fantastic. We talk about Donald Trump's speech and AOC, Robert de Niro calling Trump a racist.
