But the tendency to group local separate incidents into one greater national phenomenon often doesn't reveal real truth. It only serves to obscure specifics in each single case. The Dallas police had no connection at all to those incidents, but they took bullets because of them. They suffered for a media narrative.   Fact is, today's police get more training, are subject to internal affairs and citizen review boards. They face more rules and procedures than ever. They've gotten better. But have we? We obsess over Islamophobia, condemning negative portrayals of Islam but we afford no such sensitivity to police. So the idea that law enforcement is just racist whites killing blacks continues even though we know it's absurd. I could recite the facts. How more whites die from police than blacks or that black and Hispanic cops are more likely to fire a gun at blacks than white cops, but why would I do that?  You can't change minds that refuse to change.  As emotional conclusions, formed well before the facts are ever known. So put on your outrage helmets; the road is about to get bumpy once again. Protest, if you wish, and shout if you must, and be happy you're safe and protected by some of the greatest people on earth.",
