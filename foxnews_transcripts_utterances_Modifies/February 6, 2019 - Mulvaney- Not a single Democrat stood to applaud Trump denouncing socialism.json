      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, President Trump's momentous, unifying address, receiving widespread praise and needless to say, the radical left, their friends in the hate Trump media, they're not too happy. Wait until we show you the reaction to the -- and their analysis to the president's pivotal speech. And we have major breaking developments tonight surrounding Robert Mueller himself investigating the investigator, shocking news also for the Democratic Party, and what is going on in Virginia.  First, it began with Governor Ralph Northam's support of the grotesque brutality of infanticide when he advocated for a law where even when a baby is delivered, living on its own, that he or she would be kept comfortable and then the mother alone would still have the right to choose to deny the needed medical care to save the human soul, the essence of innocence.  Then, the Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, then he faced bipartisan calls to resign, but not for the cruelty and evil supportive infanticide, but over another big controversy, his racist yearbook photo, which featured under his name, and his medical school yearbook, but after first apologizing for the photo of the Klansmen and blackface, well, then, Northam then denied he was in the picture at all. And then at a really bizarre press conference, admitted to -- well, I dressed up in blackface during a separate instance and almost reenacted Michael Jackson's moonwalk before his wife, thankfully, stepped in, citing the inappropriate circumstances.  Then a short time later, Northam's soon-to-be so-called replacement, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, well, he found himself now embroiled in a massive Democratic Party scandal. This is now going up to the upper echelons of the Democrats, both locally and nationally. And earlier this week, a college professor named Vanessa Tyson came forward with serious allegations of violent sexual assault by Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. This dates back to 2004, the Democratic National Convention in Boston. Now, viewer warning, what you are about to see is extremely graphic. In a detailed statement, Tyson claimed, quote: As I cried and gagged, Mr. Fairfax forced me to perform oral sex on him. I cannot believe given my obvious distress that Mr. Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual. Mr. Fairfax has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience, in service to his political ambitions, and has threatened litigation and given his false assertions. I'm compelled to make clear what happened.  NBC News tonight reporting, that the lieutenant governor, Fairfax, himself responding to the allegations in a private meeting, he actually said, they quote him, \"F that B.\" OK? In case kids are watching. Now this just happened this week. And while his office denied the remarks, the lieutenant governor is calling that encounter consensual. Now, on this show, we're going to be consistent. Unlike most TV shows and hosts, we firmly believe in the process, due process, the presumption of innocence, the very thing that the Democratic Party always denies to any Republican or anyone that is conservative.  Now, let's not ever forget what they did to Justice Kavanaugh. Democrats believe in guilt by accusation, no trials, no juries, just the court of public opinion. And for Democrats, accusations are disqualifiers for public office.   And these charges against Fairfax are beyond serious. And unlike the Kavanaugh accusations, well, in the case of Fairfax accuser, well, they actually recount a specific time, date, and location. And over the years, Tyson even confided with close friends about this incident and what happened. So, the big question right now for the Democratic Party, is, will they demand that Lieutenant Governor Fairfax resigned? And where are all of those Democrats who said they believe, well, the now debunked accusers in the Kavanaugh case? Here to refresh your memory. Look at this.",

Do they stand with all survivors of sexual abuse? Or only when it's made against a Republican or a conservative? Is it just about politics, not about the cause?  Because breaking today, we have more trouble in the commonwealth of Virginia. The third now in line to be governor, Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring, he is dealing with his own devastating scandal that just broke. Earlier today, Herring that he announced that he too appeared in blackface in the 1980s.   So, that means two-thirds of the Democratic leadership in Virginia have appeared in blackface. And get this, over the weekend, Herring called on Governor Northam to resign over the issue. So, the question tonight is, will he do the same? Now, in case you are wondering, the fourth in line to be governor happens to be a Republican. The speaker of the House, and delegate Kirk Cox. This could be very interesting.  We'll keep you posted on the dumpster fire that is now the Democratic Party nationally and in Virginia. But first, let's turn to the powerful remarks from President Trump at last night's State of the Union, where he promoted American greatness, urging political cooperation, getting things done, highlighting the people, the principles, the ideals that make this country the greatest place on earth.

      "sentences": "All right. Those who saw the speech gave the president extremely high marks. By the way, record-breaking audience last night, breaking his record last year, and Obama's.   But now, Speaker Newt Gingrich, he wrote this. He said, it was, quote, so effective and powerful that it changed the trajectory of history and that, quote, the emotions of Tuesday night matched anything President Reagan achieved in his address to Congress.  Look at this fake news CNN poll. The American people agree. Seventy-six percent of viewers gave his speech a positive rating. CBS News poll, 76 percent of their viewers approved of the president's remarks.  The State of the Union obviously resounding success, and one of the finest moments for the president or frankly any president, for that matter. One of the key reasons, why was this speech is so powerful? Well, it's the success that the president has had.  There is no shortage of real, substantive accomplishments that he has had in two short years. Millions of forgotten men and women, their lives have been impacted dramatically. Two years, he's accumulated a track record of achievement unlike anything we have seen in modern history. Record-setting tax cuts, trade deal, energy independence that we never dreamed of, the best in 65 years, regulatory reforms and renewal, prison reform, national security successes in the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, Canada, Mexico, even our European allies. Two Supreme Court confirmations from a list he promised he would use. An American economy that is booming and breaking records like never before. Now, for many of you, even conservative friends of mine, doubted, is he really a conservative? Well, he governs as a conservative and more importantly, unlike a lot of politicians, keeps his promises.  I told you he would deliver on the things he was promising to the country during the campaign. And, make no mistake -- it will be no different when it comes to the issue of border security. That wall will somehow -- I can't tell you exactly how -- it will be built. Now, the consequences of neglecting border security -- well, that will be catastrophic for this country. In the past two years alone, we have witnessed what is beyond a serious crisis, not with the Democrats or the fake news media tell you, a manufactured one.   In the last two years alone, ICE officers, brave men and women that serve us every day, have made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults on American citizens, 30,000 sex crimes, 4,000 murders, homicides, immigration.  Security officials, they are now pleading for help. They want the strategic border wall built. They want to stop the 90 percent of heroin coming into this country, other drug trafficking like fentanyl, human trafficking, young girls being sold into prostitution and other criminal activity. And that's why, under the Obama administration, Democrats, well, they didn't call walls immoral. That's why President Obama himself sounded an awful lot like Donald Trump from last night's State of the Union. Amazing. They supported -- when Obama's president, Obama sounds like Trump. But now, they want no t part of it. Why? Why would they put their hatred of this president ahead of keeping this country safe and secure? The life and death issue of drugs and opioids and heroin s and fentanyl.   Watch this.",

Before we get to our guests, we continue our \"Hannity Watch\" on the deep state tonight with huge breaking news, implicating directly now, for the third time, that special counsel Robert Mueller. \"The Hill's\" John Solomon who's going to join us. Mueller was hauled in front of the FISA court in the early 2000s to answer for FBI surveillance abuses, many of them reportedly included omissions of material facts to the secret court, in other words, exculpatory information. As the story explains, former FBI official Trisha Anderson told congressional investigators late last year, quote, it preceded my time with the FBI, but as I understood it, there was a pattern of some incidents of omissions that were of concern to the FISA court that resulted in the former director of Mueller himself actually appearing before the FISA court. And the special counsel is declining to comment. Does that sound familiar? Not disclosing to the FISA court that the s dirty dossier that they were told, bought and paid for by Hillary, uncorroborated, put together by a Trump hater, full of Russian lies, they never investigated that? Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testifying that they would not have had a FISA application without the dirty dossier. We have exposed night after night, Robert Mueller is on a partisan witch hunt. Look at the team of Democrats he hired. Jeannie Rhee donated to Hillary's PAC, even more importantly, was an attorney for the Clinton Foundation, part of Mueller's team.  His pit bull, Andrew Weissmann, was that Hillary's election night party. And he has a long record of also withholding exculpatory information and prosecutorial abuses, like in the case of Sidney Powell's book, \"License to Lie.\" She'll be here in a moment. And, remember, Mueller hired FBI lovers Strzok and Page, and we all know where they stand. They had the insurance policy. They thought Hillary should won 100 million to zero. And, of course, all this evidence isn't stopping collusion conspiracy theorists like crazy man Adam Schiff, who is now expanding the scope of the House Intelligence probe into President Trump despite no basis to do so in every aspect of his life. The president reacted to Shifty Schiff's move and here's what he said.",

I think actually that the Governor Northam is probably today in a stronger position than he was over the last 48, 72 hours because the two subsequent Virginia leaders, the lieutenant governor, and the A.G., who are next in line, are also in similar situations of scandal. So, I think the pressure on him may very well subside.

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, President Trump's momentous, unifying address, receiving widespread praise and needless to say, the radical left, their friends in the hate Trump media, they're not too happy. Wait until we show you the reaction to the -- and their analysis to the president's pivotal speech. And we have major breaking developments tonight surrounding Robert Mueller himself investigating the investigator, shocking news also for the Democratic Party, and what is going on in Virginia. First, it began with Governor Ralph Northam's support of the grotesque brutality of infanticide when he advocated for a law where even when a baby is delivered, living on its own, that he or she would be kept comfortable and then the mother alone would still have the right to choose to deny the needed medical care to save the human soul, the essence of innocence. Then, the Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, then he faced bipartisan calls to resign, but not for the cruelty and evil supportive infanticide, but over another big controversy, his racist yearbook photo, which featured under his name, and his medical school yearbook, but after first apologizing for the photo of the Klansmen and blackface, well, then, Northam then denied he was in the picture at all. And then at a really bizarre press conference, admitted to -- well, I dressed up in blackface during a separate instance and almost reenacted Michael Jackson's moonwalk before his wife, thankfully, stepped in, citing the inappropriate circumstances. Then a short time later, Northam's soon-to-be so-called replacement, the lieutenant governor, Justin Fairfax, well, he found himself now embroiled in a massive Democratic Party scandal. This is now going up to the upper echelons of the Democrats, both locally and nationally. And earlier this week, a college professor named Vanessa Tyson came forward with serious allegations of violent sexual assault by Lieutenant Governor Fairfax. This dates back to 2004, the Democratic National Convention in Boston."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, viewer warning, what you are about to see is extremely graphic. In a detailed statement, Tyson claimed, quote",
      "utterance": "As I cried and gagged, Mr. Fairfax forced me to perform oral sex on him. I cannot believe given my obvious distress that Mr. Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual. Mr. Fairfax has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience, in service to his political ambitions, and has threatened litigation and given his false assertions. I'm compelled to make clear what happened. NBC News tonight reporting, that the lieutenant governor, Fairfax, himself responding to the allegations in a private meeting, he actually said, they quote him, \"F that B.\" OK? In case kids are watching. Now this just happened this week. And while his office denied the remarks, the lieutenant governor is calling that encounter consensual. Now, on this show, we're going to be consistent. Unlike most TV shows and hosts, we firmly believe in the process, due process, the presumption of innocence, the very thing that the Democratic Party always denies to any Republican or anyone that is conservative. Now, let's not ever forget what they did to Justice Kavanaugh. Democrats believe in guilt by accusation, no trials, no juries, just the court of public opinion. And for Democrats, accusations are disqualifiers for public office. And these charges against Fairfax are beyond serious. And unlike the Kavanaugh accusations, well, in the case of Fairfax accuser, well, they actually recount a specific time, date, and location. And over the years, Tyson even confided with close friends about this incident and what happened. So, the big question right now for the Democratic Party, is, will they demand that Lieutenant Governor Fairfax resigned? And where are all of those Democrats who said they believe, well, the now debunked accusers in the Kavanaugh case? Here to refresh your memory. Look at this."

Where is Elizabeth Warren, who is in more trouble herself after claiming Indian heritage, that you never had, Native American heritage? Where is Kirsten Gillibrand? Do they believe this accuser? Do they stand with all survivors of sexual abuse? Or only when it's made against a Republican or a conservative? Is it just about politics, not about the cause? Because breaking today, we have more trouble in the commonwealth of Virginia. The third now in line to be governor, Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring, he is dealing with his own devastating scandal that just broke. Earlier today, Herring that he announced that he too appeared in blackface in the 1980s. So, that means two-thirds of the Democratic leadership in Virginia have appeared in blackface. And get this, over the weekend, Herring called on Governor Northam to resign over the issue. So, the question tonight is, will he do the same? Now, in case you are wondering, the fourth in line to be governor happens to be a Republican. The speaker of the House, and delegate Kirk Cox. This could be very interesting. We'll keep you posted on the dumpster fire that is now the Democratic Party nationally and in Virginia. But first, let's turn to the powerful remarks from President Trump at last night's State of the Union, where he promoted American greatness, urging political cooperation, getting things done, highlighting the people, the principles, the ideals that make this country the greatest place on earth. Take a look."

Millions of our fellow citizens are watching is now gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern, not as two parties, but as one nation.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Those who saw the speech gave the president extremely high marks. By the way, record-breaking audience last night, breaking his record last year, and Obama's. But now, Speaker Newt Gingrich, he wrote this. He said, it was, quote, so effective and powerful that it changed the trajectory of history and that, quote, the emotions of Tuesday night matched anything President Reagan achieved in his address to Congress. Look at this fake news CNN poll. The American people agree. Seventy-six percent of viewers gave his speech a positive rating. CBS News poll, 76 percent of their viewers approved of the president's remarks. The State of the Union obviously resounding success, and one of the finest moments for the president or frankly any president, for that matter. One of the key reasons, why was this speech is so powerful? Well, it's the success that the president has had. There is no shortage of real, substantive accomplishments that he has had in two short years. Millions of forgotten men and women, their lives have been impacted dramatically. Two years, he's accumulated a track record of achievement unlike anything we have seen in modern history. Record-setting tax cuts, trade deal, energy independence that we never dreamed of, the best in 65 years, regulatory reforms and renewal, prison reform, national security successes in the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, Canada, Mexico, even our European allies. Two Supreme Court confirmations from a list he promised he would use. An American economy that is booming and breaking records like never before. Now, for many of you, even conservative friends of mine, doubted, is he really a conservative? Well, he governs as a conservative and more importantly, unlike a lot of politicians, keeps his promises. I told you he would deliver on the things he was promising to the country during the campaign. And, make no mistake -- it will be no different when it comes to the issue of border security. That wall will somehow -- I can't tell you exactly how -- it will be built. Now, the consequences of neglecting border security -- well, that will be catastrophic for this country. In the past two years alone, we have witnessed what is beyond a serious crisis, not with the Democrats or the fake news media tell you, a manufactured one. In the last two years alone, ICE officers, brave men and women that serve us every day, have made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults on American citizens, 30,000 sex crimes, 4,000 murders, homicides, immigration. Security officials, they are now pleading for help. They want the strategic border wall built. They want to stop the 90 percent of heroin coming into this country, other drug trafficking like fentanyl, human trafficking, young girls being sold into prostitution and other criminal activity. And that's why, under the Obama administration, Democrats, well, they didn't call walls immoral. That's why President Obama himself sounded an awful lot like Donald Trump from last night's State of the Union. Amazing. They supported -- when Obama's president, Obama sounds like Trump. But now, they want no t part of it. Why? Why would they put their hatred of this president ahead of keeping this country safe and secure? The life and death issue of drugs and opioids and heroin s and fentanyl. Watch this."

If Democrats continue to oppose border security because of just a pure hatred for Trump, the very things they supported a few short years ago, at some point, they bear responsibility.

This should not be a partisan issue. They should be an issue about life and death and protecting the American people. And, well, look at this CBS News poll. Seventy-two percent of you, we, the people, favor of the president's points and point of view on and his remarks on the issue of immigration. And sadly, despite the overwhelming approval from \"We, the People\", the mainstream hate Trump media singing a much different tune, taking their cues from their friends that sat on their hands last night in the Democratic Party, which is not a party of eliminating ICE and open borders, higher taxes, late-term abortions.

Before we get to our guests, we continue our \"Hannity Watch\" on the deep state tonight with huge breaking news, implicating directly now, for the third time, that special counsel Robert Mueller. \"The Hill's\" John Solomon who's going to join us. Mueller was hauled in front of the FISA court in the early 2000s to answer for FBI surveillance abuses, many of them reportedly included omissions of material facts to the secret court, in other words, exculpatory information. As the story explains, former FBI official Trisha Anderson told congressional investigators late last year, quote, it preceded my time with the FBI, but as I understood it, there was a pattern of some incidents of omissions that were of concern to the FISA court that resulted in the former director of Mueller himself actually appearing before the FISA court. And the special counsel is declining to comment. Does that sound familiar? Not disclosing to the FISA court that the s dirty dossier that they were told, bought and paid for by Hillary, uncorroborated, put together by a Trump hater, full of Russian lies, they never investigated that? Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testifying that they would not have had a FISA application without the dirty dossier. We have exposed night after night, Robert Mueller is on a partisan witch hunt. Look at the team of Democrats he hired. Jeannie Rhee donated to Hillary's PAC, even more importantly, was an attorney for the Clinton Foundation, part of Mueller's team. His pit bull, Andrew Weissmann, was that Hillary's election night party. And he has a long record of also withholding exculpatory information and prosecutorial abuses, like in the case of Sidney Powell's book, \"License to Lie.\" She'll be here in a moment. And, remember, Mueller hired FBI lovers Strzok and Page, and we all know where they stand. They had the insurance policy. They thought Hillary should won 100 million to zero. And, of course, all this evidence isn't stopping collusion conspiracy theorists like crazy man Adam Schiff, who is now expanding the scope of the House Intelligence probe into President Trump despite no basis to do so in every aspect of his life. The president reacted to Shifty Schiff's move and here's what he said."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "On what basis would he do that? He has no basis to do that. He's just a political hack who is trying to build a name for himself and I think that's fine because that's what they do. But there would be no reason to do that. No other politician has to go through that. It's called presidential harassment. And it's unfortunate. And it really does hurt our country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And we're going to have more. John Solomon breaking that news, also Mick Mulvaney coming up in just a minute, the president's chief of staff. Joining us first, America First Action senior advisor Sean Spicer, \"Washington Times\" columnist Monica Crowley. Monica, I will start with you. Where are those people that said, \"I believe\"? Where's Kamala Harris? Where's Kirsten Gillibrand? Where's Spartacus? They only believe when it's an accusation against a conservative or Republican."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON TIMES",
      "utterance": "Well, of course, Sean. And now, we are seeing their hypocrisy in bold relief. You know, it's all fun and games when a conservative or Republican is being targeted in this way but when it's one of theirs, they had for the hills, and they started circling the wagons. What we are seeing in Virginia is really quite striking. If you submitted this idea as a screenplay, nobody would buy it because nobody would believe what is happening here. I think actually that the Governor Northam is probably today in a stronger position than he was over the last 48, 72 hours because the two subsequent Virginia leaders, the lieutenant governor, and the A.G., who are next in line, are also in similar situations of scandal. So, I think the pressure on him may very well subside. But all of this swirling around these Democrats and their rank hypocrisy is pointing out to the American people that the attack on Brett Kavanaugh, the subsequent attacks on the president and other conservatives and Republicans just smack of raw politics, and that's why most of the American people are tuning all of it out."

An Oval Office address or rally, this is something of the whole world is turning into, listening to. And the president laid out a very, very clear taste of where we've come the last two years, in a way that connects the dots. A lot of times you hear economic information, month-to-month, the president was able to put it all together, connect the dots, and explain to people where we've come from since he got elected. Secondly, and equally as important, he laid out a path of where we are headed. He talked about this vision of al American greatness. So, those two things were critical."

For example, look at Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez not exactly happy. The freshman lawmaker took to the airwaves after the speech saying the president feels threatened by her insane policies.

He's unrelenting, tenacious, he's going to get money for the Wall, the deadline is now approaching.

Elizabeth Warren on wealth tax, we hear people talking about a 70 or higher percent tax rate, radical redistribution of wealth and which I think will help the President in 2020 and then on this issue, the very things Democrats supported for the last - just a few years ago, they won't even sit with the President, how can you get anything done with that opposition?"

There people have lost 20% of their body weight in the last couple of years, it doesn't work, it never has worked. One thing that always stuns me about socialists is that despite the fact that history is just littered with examples of how it doesn't work and hurts people, they come out and say well, they just didn't do it right. If you give us the power to do it, if you elect us, we'll be socialist and we'll do it right this time."

There are a lot of other things but for the same reason that people lock their doors at night which the President talked about in the State of the Union speech, it's a common-sense approach.

Finally at least. Where is Kamala, where's the rest? Anyway, it takes tremendous courage, he said for someone to come forward in the way that she did,\" and that's about it. And he added, \"this is a deeply disturbing allegation that should be thoroughly investigated,\" good for him. But our villain of the day has been \"The Atlantic's Jemele Hill under fire for a deleted tweet jokingly supposedly, calling for the assassination of President Trump, using the same phrase as shouted by the person who killed Malcolm X. After every criticism, she got rid of the tweet denying it was a reference to Presidential assassination. All right, let not your heart be troubled, we'll never be the Hate Trump media.
