I suppose I can say the same about Griffin by simply pointing to the contents in any bus station public toilet. But if you are mentally stable -- unlike Griffin -- you will see this for what it is. First, it is a beheading of the president. Imagine how CNN would react if it were President Obama or Hillary Clinton, done by someone here. Brian Stelter's lip would be extra sweaty -- if that's indeed possible.  But Griffin's art also mocks those murdered by ISIS. The joke is deliberately linked to those beheadings. The joke is not just on Donald's head, but on theirs as well. So sure, call it art. But we know what it is. It is a copout. You are milking attention through an infantile effort to enrage. So, if we get mad, you win. So we should shrug instead. I would say Kathy should hang her head in shame, but she must know what shame is first. All right.

While we were sitting there talking about USSR. And how they were infiltrating in our hemisphere, and they were trying to undermine capitalism, they were obsessed with the post-Vietnam -- like America as the loser. Do you think possibly 37 years from now or like around 2047, the media will finally go, hey, this radical Islam stuff is pretty dangerous and we will already move on fighting robots? My point is this, the media has always been behind the times when it comes to the true threat. So right now, what I believe that the Trump administration has done, naively, perhaps sloppily, perhaps in certain ignorant ways of the process was trying to go after the greater risk at the time which is the apocalyptic threat of radical Islam, and that made them say, let's back channel and talk about Syria, this and that, and do things there.  So they made some mistakes. But the idea is bigger. And while the media is focusing on Russia, they are focusing on Islam, and this is exactly what happened with the cold war. There are people like Reagan who understood the real threats, but the media was still licking their wounds about Vietnam and how America was at fault.",

And that is why he is always winning. But I was thinking about this in a bigger picture that, if you think about the 1980s, 37 years ago, the media was on the wrong side of the cold war. While we were sitting there talking about USSR. And how they were infiltrating in our hemisphere, and they were trying to undermine capitalism, they were obsessed with the post-Vietnam -- like America as the loser. Do you think possibly 37 years from now or like around 2047, the media will finally go, hey, this radical Islam stuff is pretty dangerous and we will already move on fighting robots? My point is this, the media has always been behind the times when it comes to the true threat. So right now, what I believe that the Trump administration has done, naively, perhaps sloppily, perhaps in certain ignorant ways of the process was trying to go after the greater risk at the time which is the apocalyptic threat of radical Islam, and that made them say, let's back channel and talk about Syria, this and that, and do things there. So they made some mistakes. But the idea is bigger. And while the media is focusing on Russia, they are focusing on Islam, and this is exactly what happened with the cold war. There are people like Reagan who understood the real threats, but the media was still licking their wounds about Vietnam and how America was at fault."

But he is frustrated with the press, you know, in general, saying that again today about fake news. And as it relates to this Russian investigation with Charles Krauthammer, where is the evidence of this? And how did all of these leak? There's dozens of names of people that were involved in the campaign transitions that they have asked for the names of, and they've been now leaking different names, you saw Boris Epstein's name, the leak, because he is Russian, so that adds a little bit to the story. But where is the evidence there. He is cooperating fully. You know? So, this to me is just really left hysteria, I don't see any evidence thus far that want to go ahead and do this and spin the wheels on it, it is just like flogging at the mouth over Russia and making these accusations. So far what I've seen is people saying they're going to cooperate like Jared Kushner through his Attorney Jamie Gorelick, and other people. So let's see where this goes.

And you know, they don't have the sea interceptors on submarines because they do not have that in production yet. They do not have anything land-based on the pacific, so it is like a 50/50 shot each time they try to intercept this thing. It is the hardest military technology and development today. It is about, you know, it's billions of dollars. The problem is if they successfully launch something, California or Hawaii, whether we intercept it or not, we are going to have to send over the barrage of missiles to take out every military installation immediately in North Korea. Do they want that? No. China doesn't want that. South Korea doesn't want that.

He tweeted a photo of my guests for my Saturday show. I don't know if you could look closely there of my guests. He wrote, wow, unless Greg Gutfeld changed the name of his show to \"Freak Show,\" he should fire his booker. Now, to take a look at who is there, you got Terrace (ph), the black guy, talking about him. The white woman, Kat (ph), next to him, or Matt Iceman (ph), the person next to him, or is it Joey Jones, his legs were blown off in Afghanistan while he was serving our country. So I have been asking Brad, what freak do you mean? The term \"freak show\" goes back a long way. People with oddities and abnormalities, physical deformities. I am just trying to figure out what he was implying. I have asked him. He has blocked his tweets, because he is a coward. He has not apologized. He did this on Memorial Day. I just think he is a scumbag. Brad Trent has a website, bradtrent. I think you can contact him, if you like. Jesse."

This is his third novel. It is called \"Trophy Son.\" I read it in a day. I love it. Even if you do not like tennis, it is a page-turner. And I have a picture of me playing tennis this weekend. The crew, Michael, Carol and Garrett who all helped me this weekend, and Josh was there as well."

She is in Arizona but born in Iowa, 1917. Inspiration because she was working her whole life. The family celebrated with Mexican food because that is what she wanted. So from all of us at \"The Five,\" to you, Irene, happy birthday."
