So you've heard the definition of crazy, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Well, the Democrats invented a new kind of crazy, knowing the outcome of an event well in advance and still expecting a different result. That's impeachment. The worst planned adventure since the Donner Party. The Dems blew all their energy on a losers bet, one that made the Iowa mess possible. Instead of wowing America, they fell flat on their faces because they were distracted. A return to Greg's Rule, Republicans run things, Democrats ruin them. The difference is one letter, which stands for impeachment.  So once again, the losers return to their hallucinations. The snakes on the wall, they're real if you are Adam Schiff, because now Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians.",

They are like imaginary mice and Schiff's the crazy cook on the table screaming. But those mad ravings had us waiting for the stock market crash, a tyranny, World War III, IV, and V, all paranoid nightmares that never came. Instead, all we got were stock market highs, trade deals, dead tariffs, and jobs. And since those successes are under Trump, the delusions only deepen. Without a real vision beyond anger, they cling to these mental phantoms. Look, early on, we told the Dems impeachment was a dead fish. We said don't follow Adam. He is selling you drugs that only end in bad trips.   But did they listen? Nope. To them, bad drugs are better than no drugs, which is why they will be back at the lab coming up with a new paranoia pill. But we know not to gulp them. Let them have them all, because we saw it coming, but they have it coming. All right, where to start, Jesse, big fat waste of time. The only winner in this whole thing, us.

I thought he would maybe vote to acquit the president on at least one of the articles, considering in West Virginia the president is very popular. And it would've been politically safe for him to do so. But he voted with Democrats.   This was predicted as a bipartisan acquittal. It did not end up being that way. But there is obviously going to be a lot made of Mitt Romney's vote. I don't think that it really matters, because the president has a 95 percent approval in the GOP. The American people have given him an approval rating at the highest he's seen throughout his presidency.  Throughout this trial, Adam Schiff was trying to say that he is going to cheat and steal and that you can't trust the American people to make decisions in the next election. I think people probably took that pretty personally. And so moving forward, I don't think that his vote really matters when it comes to the numbers. And the president has had a lot of wins. And as soon as Mitt Romney does something the Democrats disapprove of, he will no longer be the moral clarity that they are claiming today. And I would like to go back to the election against Barack Obama when they were calling him a racist. They were calling him an animal abuser. And of course, he was waging a war on women. So, you know, maybe some of those people can take back some of the things that they said about him at that point.",

So you've heard the definition of crazy, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Well, the Democrats invented a new kind of crazy, knowing the outcome of an event well in advance and still expecting a different result. That's impeachment. The worst planned adventure since the Donner Party. The Dems blew all their energy on a losers bet, one that made the Iowa mess possible. Instead of wowing America, they fell flat on their faces because they were distracted. A return to Greg's Rule, Republicans run things, Democrats ruin them. The difference is one letter, which stands for impeachment. So once again, the losers return to their hallucinations. The snakes on the wall, they're real if you are Adam Schiff, because now Trump could offer Alaska to the Russians."

But those mad ravings had us waiting for the stock market crash, a tyranny, World War III, IV, and V, all paranoid nightmares that never came. Instead, all we got were stock market highs, trade deals, dead tariffs, and jobs. And since those successes are under Trump, the delusions only deepen. Without a real vision beyond anger, they cling to these mental phantoms. Look, early on, we told the Dems impeachment was a dead fish. We said don't follow Adam. He is selling you drugs that only end in bad trips. But did they listen? Nope. To them, bad drugs are better than no drugs, which is why they will be back at the lab coming up with a new paranoia pill. But we know not to gulp them.

And it would've been politically safe for him to do so. But he voted with Democrats. This was predicted as a bipartisan acquittal. It did not end up being that way. But there is obviously going to be a lot made of Mitt Romney's vote. I don't think that it really matters, because the president has a 95 percent approval in the GOP. The American people have given him an approval rating at the highest he's seen throughout his presidency. Throughout this trial, Adam Schiff was trying to say that he is going to cheat and steal and that you can't trust the American people to make decisions in the next election. I think people probably took that pretty personally. And so moving forward, I don't think that his vote really matters when it comes to the numbers. And the president has had a lot of wins. And as soon as Mitt Romney does something the Democrats disapprove of, he will no longer be the moral clarity that they are claiming today. And I would like to go back to the election against Barack Obama when they were calling him a racist. They were calling him an animal abuser. And of course, he was waging a war on women. So, you know, maybe some of those people can take back some of the things that they said about him at that point."

And the reflection of the impeachment polls reflects exactly how people come down, what they're voting on, and the momentum on this has been towards the president from the start.

She left the door open, though, on lowering drug prices and infrastructure, though, in that lunch, though. The second possibility is that she is really, really frustrated with her caucus. As I said in April, I think that in a way, if she did it spontaneously, it's like, she just -- you know, sometimes you do get so mad and frustrated you want to rip something. Break a pen. I actually don't know if I could do that, break a pen. Or the third thing is it was planned all along. And she knew she was going to do it. And she did it on purpose so that the cameras could catch it, and she wanted to make a statement."

It's like she tore up a betting slip that she bet her house on. And I think it -- for me, personally, it affected me and that it made me realize the speech was way better and more powerful than I thought. Because you could see the frustration build up in her, and I thought it was a pretty good speech. Then I go, well, maybe it really hit her where it hurts. On the other hand, we lead this segment talking about that, so she gets a win by focusing attention on this act. You take the attention away from the substance of the speech. That's why I wouldn't put too much emotion in it, even though I thought it was cheap. I mean, I think the bigger problem for me is, you know, I get it. You hate Trump. But can't you be happy for people who got jobs, who got welfare or not clapping for an African-American girl getting a scholarship? I mean, if a Republican didn't clap for that, my god. And the numbers for women employment, no applause from white women wearing white, I mean can't you say, yeah, I can't stand the guy but damn. He is doing good for them."

But I think not standing for people who have school choice or for clapping at appropriate times when it comes to unemployment shows the Democrats really are interested in power. They're not necessarily interested in all these issues that they claim to care about. And also, you know the optics on this. You know, when Kayla Muller's parents were there, the young girl who was captured by ISIS, abused, raped, and murdered by Al-Baghdadi when they're talking -- when he is talking about that, and then Nancy Pelosi's back there shuffling her papers behind him and not paying attention to that. The optics there are not good. And so Nancy Pelosi can try and tell her left wing of the party and try to, you know, coddle them and make sure that they know she's doing all the right things for them. But overall, the country is looking at that and they can see that she has really played her hand poorly last night in a long line of things that have not gone well for her over the last six months."

I don't know. But clearly, they got an issue between the two of them. But I will say when the president says stuff like, oh, yes, we're doing more than anybody for pre-existing conditions -- and you just know this is not true. I'll let you decide if you want to call it a lie, but it's just not true. And when he does stuff like, oh, yes, I care so much about giving this scholarship to this little black girl, but I'm going to give the Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh and then I'm going to do it like a reality show and have Mrs. Trump put it around his neck. You think to yourself, oh is Oprah giving away cars here today?"

I'm going to continue to work hard. I'd like to do this for the next four years. Can I say one thing about Nancy Pelosi? I'm not making this the strongest of predictions. But I think the other thing that could have been is that I think she knows that that's probably her last State of the Union that where she sits there, because one, like there's an election, so you never know what could happen. Like the Republicans come back then she wouldn't be the speaker. But I also think, remember, in 2018, when she won, she basically -- there was a wink and a nod that she would not run again. And so, her final act as a speaker at the State of the Union was to rip up the President's speech. I think it'll be like the second paragraph in the legend -- all the literature that's written about her in the future."

He marginalized them on healthcare saying 130 of you in the House voted to take away 130 million Americans private healthcare. And by the way, they want to give it to illegal immigrants. That's a very extreme position. He had stuff for the base. He had stuff on guns, on pro-life, on immigration, the wall update, and then laid really sharp traps with these guests he had where he wells up the chamber with enthusiasm and emotion for these guests. And then he goes, oh, and by the way, this was the person whose husband died from a roadside bomb planted by Soleimani that I killed, and that was very effective. And then he had some bipartisanship too. He think he offered his hand on drug prices, the Mars mission infrastructure, a trillion trees. And at the end, it was a great show, well-produced drama. But the flourish at the end when he's talking about the American pioneer, the settlers, this adventure that we're all on, and this is a country with a very young spirit.

So if you promise you'll even be more helpful than you probably in the KKK, what Van Jones is saying essentially is that Trump is making it clear that he's putting Blacks first, while Democrats see Blacks as a group that competes among a bevy of other groups, because it's such an identity, obsessive party, that you're just a pocket. You have the best numbers for minorities in women. And in an even interesting thing, Trump is like one of the best liberal presidents we've seen. I mean, he's a better Democrat than most Democrats. You talk about prison reform, you talk about drug pricing, you talk about a trillion trees, you talk about black colleges, I mean, he's out Obama-ing Obama.

And if you look at the polling on Bernie Sanders' policies, people do not like the socialism aspect of this. And Joe Biden coming out of Iowa, while his communications director is still questioning the validity of the results, Joe Biden is taking the L essentially, and also going after Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg pretty hard, and said today, look, if Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, every single Democrat running for any kind of office will have the label of socialists over their head, and we're going to have to explain that. And that's not going to work when it comes to Democrats who feel like the party has gotten far too left for their liking when it comes to issues like health care and other economic factors."

I do not think he's going to get the nomination. Everyone that's saying Bernie is this big threat to Trump, I would just have to disagree. Everyone over 50 years old hates Bernie Sanders, only very liberal and very young Americans like Bernie Sanders. He's going to go in there, as Carville said, saying the Boston bombers should be allowed to vote in the election, and he'll probably vote for Bernie, and I'm going to take away your health care and give it to an illegal immigrant. The guy's a communist sympathizer. He's been in the Senate for decades, never done a damn thing. He's not photogenic. Hillary hates him. The powers (INAUDIBLE) hate him. It's only going to cause chaos. It's not going to be a good thing for Bernie or the Democrats are. And that's why I want Bernie to win."

I think that what could help him quickly is if Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, maybe some of the other -- maybe Michael Bennett, he's real low in the polls, if they could all get behind and say we are coalescing behind Biden, that might inspire some confidence."

And Derrick Nnadi, he started his celebration by making snow angels with confetti on the field. Of course, that's pretty fun. But he also said he would help animals as well. So in partnership with KC Pet Project, Nnadi paid up the adoption fees for every single dog in all of the shelters locations. So that's nearly 80 pets. They've already left the shelters with new families and more are expected to head home today. He's been working with KC Pet Project for quite a while even before they got into the playoffs. And he would cover the cost of a different dog's adoption each time. So he's pretty amazing guy and congratulations to the Chiefs. And congrats to all the new dog family members."

Well, take a look at this group of sixth-graders from McClintock Middle School in Charlotte. They devised a way to help a toddler with a rare genetic disorder. Children with Kabuki Syndrome needed daily help in the form of an oxygen tank. But you know, how do you get around with an oxygen tank if you're a little guy? That's where the sixth graders entered. They came up with a device that allows Emmett Hightshoe to easily move around with her oxygen tank. Emmett's mom said this project by the sixth graders is life-changing not only for the child, but for the family, and of course lots of other families with the same disorder. Way to go sixth graders."
