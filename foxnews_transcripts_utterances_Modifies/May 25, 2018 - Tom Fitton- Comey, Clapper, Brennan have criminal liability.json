And so, the defense secretary really has a few roles here. One is to provide the trained and ready forces and to be able to say with confidence that we can attack, we can defend, we can do whatever we need to do. And that message is very important. Secondly, of course, he advises the president on the readiness and the state of readiness, and the president is very forceful in what he's saying. Is that we have had the most trained and ready force that we've had in the long time, 700 billion defense budget, the biggest ever.   And so, I think that's really two of key pieces that the secretary of defense plays in these negotiations.

And what the audience didn't know is that the North Korean had a separate facility that they had already build and ready to go.   And so, they use this explosion just for some media coverage. But in the end, they were deceiving us. And so, one of the things though, that I still haven't really seen defined here is, how do both sides, the US and North Korea, truly define denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, because right now, it sounds like a very one-sided compromise when you think about it on behalf of the North Korean. And I just don't know why they would give up their nuclear arsenal just for loosening of some sanctions.  So in the end, the President is going to have to convince Kim Jong-un who really in the end, really wants some regime preservation in this new face of economic modernization, that he has to convince Kim Jong-un that he can still preserve his regime and give up nuclear weapons in the process.",

When you heard what Secretary Pompeo said when he returned, he talked about having North Korea on par with South Korea, I think is the term used.  So what you have got as an opportunity. And let's remember, you know, Kim Jong Un was educated we believe in Switzerland, right? So he's got a Western education and he came to power with really two visions, when his father and grandfather came with a self-reliant nation, a powerful military. Kim Jong-un came with nuclear power and economy, a strong economy. And so, he may be willing to tradeoff the nuclear power if we come in and with building infrastructure. And remember, you know, there are some families that are still divided from the demarcation line. And they are the same people, the same work ethic, and that North Korea can be an economic powerhouse. And this could be the end game for Kim Jong Un and President Trump.",

Good evening, gentlemen. I'm going to start with you, Daniel Hoffman, are we witnessing as we look at the last 24 hours from where did it begin with one say Pyongyang saying that the US is looking for an appalling tragedy to occur, and the President yesterday cancelling the summit. And then, if you change your mind though don't hesitate to call. I mean, this has been a roller coaster of activity; is this the kind of thing that happens in all diplomatic negotiations?"

But I think it's important to note is that, the North Koreans played a hand. They tried to behave -- as if they didn't want the summit. Secretary Pompeo said they ghosted us. They rejected planning meetings. And they disparaged our vice-president and the national sanctuary adviser. And the president called their bluff. And right away, the response from North Korea was conciliatory, not bellicose. And looks like the summit might be back on. I think this can only strengthen our hand as we head possibly to Singapore next month."

I mean, look, if this was the same administration that worked the Iran deal, we would be begging and pleading for them to come to the negotiation table over and over again just to get them to sign some paper, you know, that's a weak deal in the end. And so, what we're seeing here is a very significant event that is playing out on the world stage, and I think the president in the end did the right thing here."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TONY TATA, RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that is deliberate on the president's part. And the military is the teeth behind the diplomatic effort, the information effort, the economic effort that is going on here. And the president is masterfully synchronizing all of that. And so, the defense secretary really has a few roles here. One is to provide the trained and ready forces and to be able to say with confidence that we can attack, we can defend, we can do whatever we need to do. And that message is very important. Secondly, of course, he advises the president on the readiness and the state of readiness, and the president is very forceful in what he's saying. Is that we have had the most trained and ready force that we've had in the long time, 700 billion defense budget, the biggest ever. And so, I think that's really two of key pieces that the secretary of defense plays in these negotiations. And of course, there's operational stuff on the ground in South Korea that General Vince Brooks and his team will be doing as they hope prepare and head to Singapore."

So even while there is this bellicose kind of back and forth, North Korea still doing what it should be doing and President Trump said I will not meet you until you agreement to denuclearize."

They have apparently eliminated them. But, you know, now we'll have to wait and see whether they are really serious about coming to the table. And I think, you know, only time will tell. But, you know, I think we did synchronize the message very well.

I mean, in 2008, you have to remember, we have to look at history here, you know, a bunch of journalist were invited to watch the destruction of this cooling tower that there really to extract weapon's grade plutonium. And what the audience didn't know is that the North Korean had a separate facility that they had already build and ready to go. And so, they use this explosion just for some media coverage. But in the end, they were deceiving us. And so, one of the things though, that I still haven't really seen defined here is, how do both sides, the US and North Korea, truly define denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, because right now, it sounds like a very one-sided compromise when you think about it on behalf of the North Korean. And I just don't know why they would give up their nuclear arsenal just for loosening of some sanctions. So in the end, the President is going to have to convince Kim Jong-un who really in the end, really wants some regime preservation in this new face of economic modernization, that he has to convince Kim Jong-un that he can still preserve his regime and give up nuclear weapons in the process."

When you heard what Secretary Pompeo said when he returned, he talked about having North Korea on par with South Korea, I think is the term used. So what you have got as an opportunity. And let's remember, you know, Kim Jong Un was educated we believe in Switzerland, right? So he's got a Western education and he came to power with really two visions, when his father and grandfather came with a self-reliant nation, a powerful military. Kim Jong-un came with nuclear power and economy, a strong economy. And so, he may be willing to tradeoff the nuclear power if we come in and with building infrastructure. And remember, you know, there are some families that are still divided from the demarcation line. And they are the same people, the same work ethic, and that North Korea can be an economic powerhouse. And this could be the end game for Kim Jong Un and President Trump."

That's a theory that's out there, it certainly possible that some in (inaudible) were concerned that he was moving too fast and they wanted to put the brakes on him.

And when you hear Clapper and Brennan, and Comey and the rest, complaining and criticize President Trump for highlighting their corruption, you're looking at a list of people who have in my view significant criminal and civil liability over what went on, on their watch during the Obama administration and after. And, you know, when you hear Brennan go crazy and attack Trump like he is, you have to wonder why on earth that this -- why do on Earth was he ever allowed near any counter-intelligence investigation related Mr. Trump.

And what we're seeing today is that, basically, all of the concerns that he's sort of hinted at back then a year ago, over a year ago, have came to fruition. And as Tom pointed out, even the Democrats are having to acknowledge that yes, indeed, they did insert a spy into the political campaign. And I think it is absolutely unprecedented. We've, you know, we've heard of hence of this kind of thing back during the '60 and '70s. It was not, I would argue, it's not nearly as bad and as extensive as this.

So, you know, right now, we've got the FBI and Department of Justice, as Greg says, who stone wall, they're stone walling, slow walking and saying they don't have records when in fact they do have records, and they have been lying.

You know, we've got these FOIA cases out there now. I mean, we're waiting on the text messages. There's a process now in court for these various text messages. He can order the Justice Department and FBI start complying with the transparency law. These agencies don't think they answer to the president, and they don't think they answer to Congress. And I think what they are doing here, Judge, is they're protecting the Mueller operation which has its origins in all of these spying and FISA warrants, national security letter where they're taking up the phone records on the campaign, unmasking and use of Clinton DNC dossier. That's all part of Mueller's operation now and that's why they are resisting Congress because they know if that gets uncovered, Mueller's operation ends."

And I heard from Sean Hannity and others and said, no, read the context of the entire remarks. I was not working that day. So I read the context of their remarks and I quickly amended my statement. I still think that when you use hot button words like savage or animal you got to be extremely careful that you are not demonizing an entire group and I think that that's what the Democrats seized on. I think the president in some cases creates more problems for himself than it's worth. But I do believe that every effort should be used to crush MS-13. The president is absolutely right. They are a menace just as the bloods and creeps are a menace, you know, these other -- just like the mafia was a menace and the Russian mob is a menace. They are horrible people. They have no right to be in the country. We want -- they them behind bars or deported for sure. We just have to be careful not to paint with a broad brush."

You know, I think that one of the reasons that people love President Trump and that he is elected is because he is a straight talker. If you take a baseball ball to a 16-year-old and a machete and cut somebody up you are an animal. And the most frustrating part is that in, I believe it was 2014 when there was this big influx from Central America, they were coming in and they were saying I am a Latin king I'm MS-13 I got all my tattoo and we were letting them in, should we have?"

The fact that he was taken out of context isn't an accident. The New York Times and CBS had headlines where they said he called undocumented immigrants animals. That's a lie. These people are animals. He talked about MS-13 gang members. This is an organization that its name comes from the violent initiation ritual that you have to go through to become one of their killers.

President Trump called off the planned meeting yesterday but said on Twitter this evening, \"We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the summit which if it does happen will likely remain in Singapore on the same date June 12th. And if necessary will be extended beyond that date.\" A Florida judge declaring that state law against smokeable medical marijuana is unconstitutional. Current state law allows medical marijuana to only be consumed orally or by vaping. But a judge today said Floridians have the right to use marijuana however it's recommended by the physicians including smoking in private places. Florida's Department of Health is appealing the judge's decision. I'm Jackie Ibanez. Now back to \"Hannity.\" For all of your headlines, log on to Foxnews.com. Have a great evening."

Or asking to end your big tax cut and raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch.\" But according to former Clinton pollster and Fox News contributor Doug Schoen it's the Democrats who could be in trouble. He wrote an article earlier this week titled, quote, \"A civil war is looming for Democrats. Primary results Tuesday in four states explain why.\" Doug joins us now, but also with us is radio talk show host and member of President trump's media advisory board, Gina Loudon, and Turning Point USA founder, Charlie Kirk.

They are animals and need to be called as such and need to be gotten out of here any way we can, who we make it clear that we don't want Nancy Pelosi as a speaker like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania. We want pro-growth agenda, we don't want redistribution, we want compromise on health care and we want compromise on immigration. Put simply, the Democrats can win he House as moderates.

GINA LOUDON, MEMBER, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN MEDIA ADVISORY BOARD: You know, in my profession going back years as somebody who does psychological analysis I've seen derangement and people lose touch many times. But I can honestly tell you that in America and even in history, we rarely see an entire population of people so out of touch, that as you point to, judge, that they would pick MS-13 members over American angel moms who lost their children, or a higher taxes over trying American economy or for crying out loud nuclear war with North Korea over peace. It doesn't even make sense. And as you watch this whole spygate thing goes down -- go down, it begins to remind you a little bit of ghoul (Ph) about at the end of the ring, when you are just watching this self-annihilation happening you feel really bad because it's so grotesque.

You're describing like a moderate Republican agenda for America. The modern day Democrat Party they want universal health care for all, they want a 90 percent income tax. They're socialist like.
