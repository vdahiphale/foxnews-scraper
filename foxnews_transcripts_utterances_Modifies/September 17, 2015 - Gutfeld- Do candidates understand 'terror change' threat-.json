Let's don't lose sight of the big picture here. I will win a war that we can't afford to lose.   I am so sorry that I've made fun of him in the past. But the hard truths heard last night, revealed what also wasn't said. As the conversation went deep, others went for coffee. It was a smart move. Any conversation rooted in substance can be hairy for those candidates who don't have time to read. But it's a fact. We need adults in the room now who are dead serious about what's going to kill us. The head of the U.S. Central Command just told Congress, only four to five trainees from the half-billion dollar plan to prep 500 fighters, ended up fighting in Syria. Four or five. And so as Syria unravels and refugees flee, we need a plan to deal with failing states and the creeps planning awful acts within. What do we do about the jihadists coming here and those already here? What about the massive cyberattacks we just experienced? Will the more vile target hospitals or transportation? If they kill the power, people die.  This is what's called \"terror change\": The escalating risk created by new technology married to apocalyptic terror. Each day, some ghoul gets one step closer to doing something unspeakably bad. If you don't understand this threat or refuse to learn or prefer to coast on platitudes, do us a favor and bow out now, you're a danger to yourself and to this country.",
