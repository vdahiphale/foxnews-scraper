      "sentences": "Good evening from Washington. I am Laura Ingraham. This is 'The Ingraham Angle.' It was another -- we say every day -- huge news day, and we've got it covered for you from every angle. President Trump goes on offense after a serious 24-hour news cycle full of vicious attacks from the swamp. Mr. Trump's attorneys are locked in a battle to keep federal investigators from misusing protected information that was seized by the FBI from his personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Whitewater Independent Counsel Ken Starr, is going to give us an expert analysis on the danger to the attorney-client privilege, especially when the client is the president. And meanwhile, the mainstream media are swooning over James Comey's so-called revelations. In tonight's 'Angle,' I will expose the most important revelation at all.  Plus, Carter Page says he will prove in court that many of Comey's statements last night are simply not true. You don't want to miss my exclusive interview with a former Trump campaign advisor, and also, don't miss my one-on-one with the true champion of free speech. That's Brent Bozell (ph). He'll join us for our 'Defending the First' segment.  By the way, get a load of this, desperate Democrats slipping in the polls, trying a new scare tactic. Voting Republican kills women. Yes, the pro-life party, OK. But first, the petty prattling of James Comey. That is the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Look up the word 'priggish' in the dictionary. I'll wait. OK. I'll help you out. Here it is, self-righteously, moralistic and superior. Well, that pretty much sums up former FBI Director Jim Comey's performance during his big ABC book launch interview last night. But it's not his imperious, condescending, holier-than-thou attitude that should concern most of you.  It is what the man actually did while FBI director to compromise government investigations and abuse government power. And his goofy new memoir titled 'Higher Loyalty,' he probably doesn't realize how much he hurts himself on the bureau he used to lead. During his sit down with ABC, Comey revealed, unwittingly perhaps, a clear anti-Trump animus.",

As Jonathan Turley wrote, 'Besides being subject to nondisclosure agreements, Comey falls under federal laws governing the disclosure of classified and non-classified information.  Assuming that the memos were not classified, though it seems odd that it would not be classified, even on the confidential level, there is 18 USC 641, which makes it a crime to steal, sell, or convey any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or any department or agency thereof.'  So, think about this, when Trump tweets that Comey is a weaker leaker and should be in jail, well, he pretty much nails it. Comey admitted he was a leaker, but he wants no repercussions because he claims he was doing it for the good of the country. I think that is bull. He was doing it to try to rehab his own reputation after being fired. Trump's big mistake, of course, was not firing him on his first day in office. Last night, Comey double down on his attack, president and may have shown his true motivation.  During the hour gabfest, Comey claimed Trump was morally unfit for office, and then he coyly suggested that he couldn't say for sure whether the Russian prostitute story wasn't sure or if the Russians had more information with which to blackmail the president.",

Let's hear it from some former agents who once thought highly of him and one who still does. Joining us now from Tampa is former FBI agent, Bobby Chacon, and in San Francisco, Terry Turchie, the FBI's former director of counterterrorism, and former FBI assistant director, Ron Hosko, still thinks very pretty favorably of Comey, and joins me here in studio. I'm delighted to have these gentlemen. Great to talk to you. Ron, I want to start with you. You have a lot of respect for Jim Comey. Just the sound bites I have played in that opening monologue, I think from the issue of -- well, it's possible, speculating like any other pundit on television, that does an enormous disservice to the people still working in the FBI because everyone watching that is going to think, aha, Jim Comey didn't like him, he said he was afraid, during that first briefing, why did he feel uneasy?",

That to me is the troubling part. Jim Comey is the former director of the FBI. He is certainly entitled to his opinions. He has a right to his opinions. I assume his book went through prepublication review at DOJ. And so now comes time for the reckoning. Who believes that? Who thinks he is self-aggrandizing? And for me, what is the potential harm on the men and women who work in that building and across our country trying to keep us safe? That is my biggest concern.

And I think a strategy is now designed around making sure that his book sells a lot and he can go out and get vengeance for whatever hard feelings he has about the president after what happened.   I have to tell you, what really bothers me and why I feel so strongly the way I do, if you look at the last Friday at about the same time all kinds of experts and everything out were coming out about this book, we also have the IG's report come out. Inside the seventh floor, on the seventh floor, at that very time that all of this was going on, McCabe was actually calling the assistant directors of New York and Washington field and chastising them for this week that occurred.  Now, I think that idea, that was something that was common practice up there and probably a lot more going on, then we ever would have thought.

Thank you so much for joining us. My friends, we are witnessing an extraordinary and possibly historic legal case playing out in New York. President Trump's lawyers are trying to block federal investigators from indiscriminately searching through thousands of documents seized from his personal attorney. At stake is the attorney-client privilege, which is an even bigger deal, when the client is the president. Joining us now to examine the implications of this, former whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr in Dallas and his former deputy who interviewed president Clinton in that investigation so long ago, Sol Wisenberg is in Raleigh, North Carolina. We'll also talk about Comey. Sol, I want to start with you. The president's attorney, Michael Cohen's office was rated, now they say the president and Cohen should have access to what you have, or a special master, which is a third party, should review the documents. What should we take from that decision?",

She's not going to do with the president and Cohen wanted, which was to let them decide what is privileged and what is not, like you would do if you got a subpoena. But it's not necessarily a terrible ruling for the president or Mr. Cohen. Keep in mind, really striking what the U.S. attorney's office is doing here, Laura, because if you look at their manual, in the section that talks about searching attorneys who are subject or targets, it says before the warrant is approved, you have to think about and decide on what procedures you are going to use when you search through the documents. Either a filter team, which the government wants here, or a special master, or a judicial officer. It is right here in the U.S. attorney's manual, but the government doesn't want to do it, the special master, doesn't want to do a judicial officer. By God, in the case of Lynne Stewart, the attorney who was convicted of aiding and abetting a terrorist, even she got a special master, but the president of the United States doesn't get one. So, I think it is really striking. And I agree with Judge Napolitano, who was on earlier today, who said the government shouldn't even get to look at this stuff until a judge, either Judge Wood or a magistrate that she points looks at it, because this is the attorney for the president of the United States.",

      "utterance": "Good evening from Washington. I am Laura Ingraham. This is 'The Ingraham Angle.' It was another -- we say every day -- huge news day, and we've got it covered for you from every angle. President Trump goes on offense after a serious 24-hour news cycle full of vicious attacks from the swamp. Mr. Trump's attorneys are locked in a battle to keep federal investigators from misusing protected information that was seized by the FBI from his personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Whitewater Independent Counsel Ken Starr, is going to give us an expert analysis on the danger to the attorney-client privilege, especially when the client is the president. And meanwhile, the mainstream media are swooning over James Comey's so-called revelations. In tonight's 'Angle,' I will expose the most important revelation at all. Plus, Carter Page says he will prove in court that many of Comey's statements last night are simply not true. You don't want to miss my exclusive interview with a former Trump campaign advisor, and also, don't miss my one-on-one with the true champion of free speech. That's Brent Bozell (ph). He'll join us for our 'Defending the First' segment. By the way, get a load of this, desperate Democrats slipping in the polls, trying a new scare tactic. Voting Republican kills women. Yes, the pro-life party, OK. But first, the petty prattling of James Comey. That is the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Look up the word 'priggish' in the dictionary. I'll wait. OK. I'll help you out. Here it is, self-righteously, moralistic and superior. Well, that pretty much sums up former FBI Director Jim Comey's performance during his big ABC book launch interview last night. But it's not his imperious, condescending, holier-than-thou attitude that should concern most of you. It is what the man actually did while FBI director to compromise government investigations and abuse government power. And his goofy new memoir titled 'Higher Loyalty,' he probably doesn't realize how much he hurts himself on the bureau he used to lead. During his sit down with ABC, Comey revealed, unwittingly perhaps, a clear anti-Trump animus."

      "utterance": "Wasn't necessary for his goal? What was his goal exactly? Beyond just alerting the president to this information? The fact is, Comey, and a one-on-one national security briefing, chose to omit a material fact that would most certainly have given the president a fuller understanding of the intent behind the dossier. It would have certainly spurred him to ask more significant questions. Stephanopoulos, well, he gets credit for asking the question, but boy, it would have been nice to have some real aggressive follow-ups. Such as, what other material facts have you withheld from key government officials in briefings, Mr. Comey? Remember, this is the man who admitted last year to leaking government information to reporters through a proxy."

I woke up in the middle of the night and Monday night because it didn't dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation, there might be a tape. My judgment was, I needed to get that out onto the public square. I ask a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, that should be a big problem for Comey. They treated it very briefly last night at ABC. As Jonathan Turley wrote, 'Besides being subject to nondisclosure agreements, Comey falls under federal laws governing the disclosure of classified and non-classified information. Assuming that the memos were not classified, though it seems odd that it would not be classified, even on the confidential level, there is 18 USC 641, which makes it a crime to steal, sell, or convey any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or any department or agency thereof.' So, think about this, when Trump tweets that Comey is a weaker leaker and should be in jail, well, he pretty much nails it. Comey admitted he was a leaker, but he wants no repercussions because he claims he was doing it for the good of the country. I think that is bull. He was doing it to try to rehab his own reputation after being fired. Trump's big mistake, of course, was not firing him on his first day in office. Last night, Comey double down on his attack, president and may have shown his true motivation. During the hour gabfest, Comey claimed Trump was morally unfit for office, and then he coyly suggested that he couldn't say for sure whether the Russian prostitute story wasn't sure or if the Russians had more information with which to blackmail the president."

      "utterance": "What isn't possible, Jim? What kind of statement is that? That's unreal. Comey just sank his own reputation and undoubtedly harmed the reputation of the FBI leadership, not the rank and file, but the leadership as a whole. His motivation seems clear. He didn't like Trump from the get-go. He considered him undignified and fairly unintelligent, wearing ties and his tanning goggles too long. The most revealing part of the ABC interview was when his wife, Patricia Comey, just popped in."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The Trump hatred seems to run a strong in this family. Though he says he didn't vote in the election at all, Comey ended up being a partisan who believed by his own admission that Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he was worried about any taint that that email investigation would have brought. And when she went to south -- this is the worst thing, when someone starts to immortalize their meeting, they go in the car, and they type it out of my computer -- he immortalized his meetings with the president-elect in the hopes of collecting damaging evidence that could be then used against him at a later time. Maybe an insurance policy. Of course, Comey is trying to inflate himself from his anti-Trump bias charge by saying, well, look, I don't want him impeached, but listen carefully."

The bottom line is, Comey debates himself and the FBI he used to lead. Don't take it for me. Don't take my word for it. Let's hear it from some former agents who once thought highly of him and one who still does. Joining us now from Tampa is former FBI agent, Bobby Chacon, and in San Francisco, Terry Turchie, the FBI's former director of counterterrorism, and former FBI assistant director, Ron Hosko, still thinks very pretty favorably of Comey, and joins me here in studio. I'm delighted to have these gentlemen. Great to talk to you. Ron, I want to start with you. You have a lot of respect for Jim Comey. Just the sound bites I have played in that opening monologue, I think from the issue of -- well, it's possible, speculating like any other pundit on television, that does an enormous disservice to the people still working in the FBI because everyone watching that is going to think, aha, Jim Comey didn't like him, he said he was afraid, during that first briefing, why did he feel uneasy?"

The impact of the book, the timing of the book, the content of the book, and certainly, the content of some of these comments on how they are perceived by the public. That to me is the troubling part. Jim Comey is the former director of the FBI. He is certainly entitled to his opinions. He has a right to his opinions. I assume his book went through prepublication review at DOJ. And so now comes time for the reckoning. Who believes that? Who thinks he is self-aggrandizing? And for me, what is the potential harm on the men and women who work in that building and across our country trying to keep us safe? That is my biggest concern.

I have a lot of respect for Ron. I've never met him personally, but I've watched him talk about a lot of issues pertaining to the bureau and I've also been aware of his reputation. He and I differ at this point in having any respect for James Comey. I think James Comey's higher loyalty is to his wallet at this point. And I think a strategy is now designed around making sure that his book sells a lot and he can go out and get vengeance for whatever hard feelings he has about the president after what happened. I have to tell you, what really bothers me and why I feel so strongly the way I do, if you look at the last Friday at about the same time all kinds of experts and everything out were coming out about this book, we also have the IG's report come out. Inside the seventh floor, on the seventh floor, at that very time that all of this was going on, McCabe was actually calling the assistant directors of New York and Washington field and chastising them for this week that occurred. Now, I think that idea, that was something that was common practice up there and probably a lot more going on, then we ever would have thought. He knew who did the leaks, McCabe knew who did the leaks, but he went in the very next day and he also told the director he had no idea. That just is appalling to me that you would --"

Why didn't he just come out and say, you know something, this is how it went down. Instead, he had to go through his pal to go to the reporter because he didn't want to be known.

Joining us now from New York for an exclusive interview is the one and only, Carter Page. Carter, it is good to see you. First of all, I want to play, if you don't mind, before we get into your filing, what was said about you last night in this interview. First of all, the full screen, so we can read it. Stephanopoulos said, you also had your eye on Carter Page, who had also been working with the Trump campaign. Comey says, correct, Stephanopoulos says, what was your concern there? Then Comey, says, was he in any way coordinating with the Russians as an effort to influence our elections? We hear the word collusion all the time. Collusion is not a word that is familiar to me from my work. Comey continues and says, if is anybody conspiring or aiding and abetting, helping the Russians accomplish their goal of interfering in the American election, that is what the counterintelligence investigation was all about.'

I filed a complaint last September and I plan to do an update that complaint. It is interesting, because everything -- it was an honor to speak after the three FBI, former FBI officials. Everything they are saying about restoring the dignity and kind of looking out for the dignity of the FBI, they reflect the people -- I never met Mr. Comey. They were the type of individuals that were just on before me that really represents exactly what I am used to dealing with, in terms of all of my interactions, both at the FBI, but also CIA and other intelligence services. You know, I hope, in order to do that, what they need to do is, in terms of the restoration of the dignity of the FBI, is to release all of the FISA warrant applications, to get all the right info out there, as to what actually happened."

It is so beyond any common sense. What's interesting, over the last 24 hours, week or so as this has sort of become the big news item, I was always wondering, how come I never got -- out from the FBI never reached out to me after I sent them a letter in September of 2016, offering to talk to them?

      "utterance": "Each one gets worse than the next, Carter. Because in each successive application for the FISA warrant, they knew they'd continued to omit material facts. Thank you so much for joining us. My friends, we are witnessing an extraordinary and possibly historic legal case playing out in New York. President Trump's lawyers are trying to block federal investigators from indiscriminately searching through thousands of documents seized from his personal attorney. At stake is the attorney-client privilege, which is an even bigger deal, when the client is the president. Joining us now to examine the implications of this, former whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr in Dallas and his former deputy who interviewed president Clinton in that investigation so long ago, Sol Wisenberg is in Raleigh, North Carolina. We'll also talk about Comey. Sol, I want to start with you. The president's attorney, Michael Cohen's office was rated, now they say the president and Cohen should have access to what you have, or a special master, which is a third party, should review the documents. What should we take from that decision?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "My understanding is that you are right, she said, first of all, Cohen gets a copy of everything that the government has. That is number one. Number two, the government said, we want to start looking at the documents. Not even our filter team. Number three, the judge has said, I may still appoint a special master. She's not going to do with the president and Cohen wanted, which was to let them decide what is privileged and what is not, like you would do if you got a subpoena. But it's not necessarily a terrible ruling for the president or Mr. Cohen. Keep in mind, really striking what the U.S. attorney's office is doing here, Laura, because if you look at their manual, in the section that talks about searching attorneys who are subject or targets, it says before the warrant is approved, you have to think about and decide on what procedures you are going to use when you search through the documents. Either a filter team, which the government wants here, or a special master, or a judicial officer. It is right here in the U.S. attorney's manual, but the government doesn't want to do it, the special master, doesn't want to do a judicial officer. By God, in the case of Lynne Stewart, the attorney who was convicted of aiding and abetting a terrorist, even she got a special master, but the president of the United States doesn't get one. So, I think it is really striking. And I agree with Judge Napolitano, who was on earlier today, who said the government shouldn't even get to look at this stuff until a judge, either Judge Wood or a magistrate that she points looks at it, because this is the attorney for the president of the United States."

      "utterance": "Let's go to Ken Starr. Ken, a general question, imagine if Hillary Clinton's attorney's office had been raided, had to turn over their phones, computers, big deal, went in to three locations, what do you think the media's reaction might have been to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Very negative. The attorney-client privilege is sacrosanct. Yes, there are exceptions. But my word, we are a country where we lift up the rule of law, and that means process counts, procedure counts. And I couldn't agree more with what Sol just said that the special master, the third party review is exactly the kind of thing that one would expect the government reasonably to say, we are dealing with the president of the United States, even if we weren't, it's a good procedure. But we are certainly should use the kind of procedures that are most protective of the dignity of the presidency. So I think it is unfortunate and unwise that the government is playing super hardball here."

Your reaction to that?"

His book 'My FBI' is specifically and expressly a tribute to the men and women of the FBI, how courageous they are, putting their lives on the line each and every day, protecting America, now especially with counterterrorism. And before him, Judge William Webster, a former judge, we have had great directors of the FBI. And so I don't think this is besmirching the bureau at all because the work of the bureau goes on. These are great men and women. I must say, of the thousands of agents that I have known of and the many hundreds that I personally worked with, not one had any issue with respect to basic integrity and to acknowledge and honor their traditions of the FBI.

Everywhere where they are attacking they are suppressing conservative thought. Now they are going to the social media giants. These social media giants have audiences in the billions.

The Republicans did that with Clinton, and I know because I was there, and I was all rah-rah, go Ken Starr. But it backfired on Republicans because people didn't think inherently trying to undo the results of a presidential election was the right way to go.

Under the agreement, the Justice Department will not crackdown on Colorado's legalized marijuana industry if the senator will stop blocking the president's DOJ nominees. Usually think Democrats block Republican nominees but we have a Republican senator blocking our nominees. It's reprehensible. Let's discuss the merits of this deal with self-described marijuana lawyer, Robert Corry, a lot of work for him in Denver, and here in the studio with me, the chairman of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, Washington, D.C.-based attorney, John Talcott. Great to have both of you. John, let's start with you on this. The president on marijuana, he didn't talk a ton about this during the campaign. But I think his supporters were all about law and order. They weren't for big weed as far as I can tell."

      "utterance": "Exactly. It is a real shock because if you look at this polling -- first of all, the polls nationwide don't say what a lot of the supporters wanted to say, the supporters of legalization want it say. They actually say most people don't favor full-blown legalization. What they favor is maybe some decriminalization, and actually most Republicans don't even favor any kind of legalization or decriminalization. The numbers are -- there are still a majority of Republicans who don't favor this course of action that he's taking anywhere in the country. So what you've got is him going against his base to take this position that I think it's kind of indefensible. I can almost see somebody saying, it should be legalized everywhere. But to say it should be incubated in these various states where we've already seen in Colorado it's a virtual disaster. But we should incubate this industry in various states so they could export it through the black market to other states is kind of insane."

The people want it to end, no question about that. So this was a good deal for everybody. It's a good deal for thousands of people who are employed in America's newest industry. But let's go to the next step. And it is true, Congress needs to be they want to make the change. Not Attorney General Jeff Sessions, really, not even president Trump. The onus ought to be on Congress to eliminate federal marijuana prohibition. And I think the ball is firmly in their court."

Who cares what happens to the next generation of Americans? They are making money as is big billionaire weed, like big tobacco, 100 years big billionaire weed, and I know, John, I am on your side on this and I want to be fair to Robert, but to me this is not why President Trump won the election. I know there are a lot of young people who love pot. I get it. They want to smoke pot. They love pot. The truth about pot and its medical effects, truth?"

There's about six times more likely to be schizophrenia if you smoke pot regularly. If you smoke pot regularly there are some studies that show you are eight times more likely to kill yourself. When you spend, I find this amazing that somebody is saying this is a good deal for the America people. First of all, the America people don't favor this. Second of all, politically it's idiotic because every state that has legalized except for, and there's only nine of them unless you don't count Maine, that's eight of them because it hasn't really come in full force in Maine, there's eight of them. Seven of those eight voted against the president. So none of the states that are going to be happy about this are ones that support the president in any way, shape, or form."
