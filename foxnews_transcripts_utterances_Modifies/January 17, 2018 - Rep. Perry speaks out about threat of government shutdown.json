And since the Senate didn't want to do that and many members of the House didn't want to do that, then we came back September, we passed 12 appropriations bills. It's been 100 days. The Senate has passed zero.  They have no reason to do anything. They're just going to continue doing these one-month C.R.s. Meanwhile, you got troops in contacts. You got troops out on the front line. You got people that aren't flying, people -- we got half the ships that we used to. And we're not going to fund that, and go month to month to month, and then finally give them some funding, oh, I don't know, maybe four months before the end of the fiscal year and then blame them when they can't spend it correctly. It's absurd.",
