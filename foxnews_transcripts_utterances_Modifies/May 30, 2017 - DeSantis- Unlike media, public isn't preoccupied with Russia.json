How big of a deal right now to you, Congressman, is this ongoing debate about what Jared Kushner knew and when he knew it? I mean, other White House officials have said they don't see anything untoward or unusual going on here. Other administrations have had back channels to the Russians in the Kennedy days to the Soviets. So, why are they making a big deal of this?  What do you say?",

And that had been the main media narrative.  So, now we're talking about, during the transition, where it would certainly be appropriate for the incoming administration to develop relationships with other countries. So, the fact that a back channel was discussed, in and of itself, is not improper at all. I think it would be -- the media would have to produce some evidence that somehow there was something improper that was discussed. And, of course, like a lot of these stories, they're puffed up. There's a lot of smoke. But when you push aside the smoke, you don't really see the fire.  And I think this is a case where we don't have any fire. Maybe there is. But I haven't seen it.",

You know this far better than I that it's not unusual since the Russians and/or Soviets in their older days were always a source of concern.  Every time a new president took over, there were sort of secret communications, some well-known, others less well-known, for each side to get to know the other. I think that was the case with John Kennedy, a new, young president coming in.   So, ironically, it was his younger brother Bobby Kennedy would assume the role of attorney general, who played that go-between. We still don't know the degree to which he did and what was outright legal by today's standards vs. what's going on here. But does it make you uncomfortable if there were?
