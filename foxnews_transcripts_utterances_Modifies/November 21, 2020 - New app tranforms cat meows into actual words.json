We have anchors smirking at their cynicism, anchors whose skepticism went missing during the Russian charade. You have consultants defending election results, even though they sold the snake oil dressed up as polling. They looked down at Trump before he even took office. They accused him of a myriad of insane crimes. They pushed a dossier, then impeachment with lies about his family in between. They pushed his tax returns down our throats. They called Arizona just to be first, not to be right. They declared victory before millions of votes were counted.  You notice a trend here? It's the hurry, the rush -- the rush to be done with this man and this movement, which is beyond harmful considering how momentous this election really was. It was so obvious a group effort: the media, tech industry, entertainment, academia, the most powerful industries joining hands to undo this bad nightmare called Trump, when in fact, it really wasn't a bad nightmare. It was just a dream that they couldn't share with millions of Americans that they looked down on and that they couldn't brainwash. This movement was a reaction to them and to their power. This movement gave them the finger. And now those entities are feverishly trying to break that finger.  Trump was evil, because they couldn't predict or control him, and it drove them nuts, so they drove him out. The late night clowns, the CNN chuckle buckets, that never Trumpers who are also never winners. They had to be right, because their egos were bigger than their principles. So now, they are stuck losing forever, hoping Hunter is clean, that the Chinese play nice, and that they are the smart ones. The only way they could become more invisible is if they go on Seth Meyers. So now the table is clear, it's us versus them. Those who wish to create narratives that set us against each other. Because the more we quarrel amongst ourselves, the more we will leave them alone and we can't let that happen. Our eyes are open.  We see how relieved they are now as if somehow this is all going to go away. Well how wrong they are.",

They called Arizona just to be first, not to be right. They declared victory before millions of votes were counted. You notice a trend here?

This movement gave them the finger. And now those entities are feverishly trying to break that finger. Trump was evil, because they couldn't predict or control him, and it drove them nuts, so they drove him out. The late night clowns, the CNN chuckle buckets, that never Trumpers who are also never winners. They had to be right, because their egos were bigger than their principles. So now, they are stuck losing forever, hoping Hunter is clean, that the Chinese play nice, and that they are the smart ones. The only way they could become more invisible is if they go on Seth Meyers. So now the table is clear, it's us versus them. Those who wish to create narratives that set us against each other.

It was Don Lemon and all of these people just talking about how they felt about the most recent thing that Trump had said. This is not news. And it's the same thing with comedy. It's not really comedy, all these late night people saying, well, now finally, we can do jokes that are about something else than Trump. And I think two things about that are wrong. One you could, you could joke about whatever you want. And two, were they jokes at all? I even looked what recent Trevor Noah jokes. This is one I found, okay. Oh, and looks like Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham are also partnering with Trump to undermine the election, which is a terrible idea. But I would love to see these three together in heist movie.

And we talked about earlier that unemployment under this President has really plummeted. And to me, the most interesting figure is the unemployment rate of those without high school diplomas, which has fallen to levels that was never seen since they started recording these numbers. And it's almost half of when the President took office. That to me is absolutely crushing that narrative. And also in my opinion, sort of equalizing things racially and socioeconomically far more than those degrees do and those debts do that somehow matter more than those people who have racked up debt, caring for themselves and their families.
