I mean, you had the speeches from Nikki Haley, of course -- and Tim Scott who completely blew everybody away with his own personal life story of going from picking cotton to Congress, and talking about his grandfather not having an education and never learning to read, but then seeing him go to Congress and make a big difference in the world.   He talked about his primary and how he beat out a number of other Republican opponents. I thought that was really compelling. But for me, the most compelling part of the entire night, I think, was the Cuban immigrant, Mr. Maximus, I believe was his last name. Talking about the flirtation and the danger that we are seeing now on the left with socialism and communism and his personal experience with that and him saying we are not going to give up what we have rightfully earned as a family. This is the last place that we are going to be. We are not abandoning that. There is nowhere else to go. We will stand up for America and the freedom that has flourished here. So really they hit back on a lot of the themes of the Democrats in terms Republicans not being happy warriors, being divisive, being bullies, and being, you know, white party rather than having any kind of diversity.",

I've got to tell you. I think the production quality of it was great. Like, you can watch that all night long not be diverted in terms of your attention.  It moved quickly. Think of all of those people that are not practiced politicians that never read off a teleprompter before. They got prepared for this. And they nailed every one of those speeches. And they felt passionately about what they were talking about, Mr. Pollock there, of course, talking about his daughter, Meadow, was very compelling. I also really liked the segment -- it was kind of a show, but the meeting of the released hostages in the Oval Office with the president, because some of these things -- some of these policies, like, right to try, but also telehealth. Telehealth actually pulls so well all across America, but especially in rural areas because that's where you need it the most.  So I felt like they were just nailing it on policy. And I said last night. You had more policy in the first hour of the Republican convention then you did in four days of the Democrats. Now, the other thing I would say in terms of what -- just to pick up something Katie said. People are talking about the suburbs as if they are just one model, the suburbs.  There's a lot of diversity in the suburbs. And those are things called excerpts, right? So those were the sort of -- more farther out from the cities, not quite rural America but in between. There's a lot of middle- class people there. And I think that they were showing those people. Look, we have a party here that can get things done. Remember the incumbents are very hard to beat. They have records to run on. So I think last night was absolutely amazing. It was also -- one other thing and I'll shut up. The conventions are always the first primary speeches of the next election. And what you saw last night from Nikki Haley and Tim Scott I think were kind of their debut for potential runs in 2024. You will also hear from Tom Cotton tonight, the Senator from Arkansas. There is maybe a little bit more of that to come. But I think that the party is showing they have breadth and depth and diversity.",

And I was looking for prescriptions, for ideas, for policies. Well, obviously, there is no platform except we back President Trump's make America great again agenda. So forget that. But when it comes to looking at the speeches, and even President Trump's speech for ideas, I just didn't see it. I saw what you saw, Jesse, about grievance, fear, name-calling. So for me, Trump has been the incumbent for four years, four years.  He had control of the House, Senate, and the White House. So I may have missed it, guys. But, you know, no fix on Obamacare or make healthcare better. He said that was going to happen quickly. It's going to be simple. No fix on immigration law, nothing on immigration law.

      "sentences": "Well, first, I have an idea for a show. It's called The Post Five Fact-Check, where it's just three solid hours of fact- checking everything Juan just said because that's how long it would take. The argument always about playing to the base, what is the base, no -- everybody gets away with saying he plays to the base but they never define it. Because when you get down to define it, it just turns out it's everybody who votes for him, people who generally want law and order, people who want normalcy, safety. They want to have good schools. They want to have low taxes. Everybody is in the base. I hate to tell you. But I saw a lot of powerful moments, and everybody pretty much hit on them.  Tim Scott, Meadows dad, Maximo Alvarez, the hostage segment was really interesting. And again, segment, it was like a talk show. I also will throw Don Jr. in there, because it's always a compliment when you say -- it's kind of backhanded compliment when you say you're surprised by how well somebody did, but I was surprised, because I thought it was well written. I thought it was well written, and I thought it was really well delivered. I felt like he found his voice. And I didn't see that coming. But I will say -- there was another criticism when you say they played to the base. What's the other way? They say they are throwing red meat. It's a bunch of red meat. But I think at this point in 2020, America will prefer red meat over dead meat.   We are watching riots and violence all over. Everything that the Democrats ignored and pretended didn't exist, swept under the rug, even though the governor of Wisconsin just declared an emergency, I guess, over something nonexistent. So I think that if red meat is what the Republicans are delivering, then America is a carnivore and the Democrats are feeding tofu.  So I think right now Trump has the upper hand because the Democrats gave it to him. By wimping out and being cowards about the violence and the horrible riots that are going on and people storming restaurants and intimidating people into agreeing with them or else. And a guy protecting his charity gets beaten unconscious as he tries to put out a fire. While this stuff is happening and the Democrats aren't doing crap, and Joe Biden is hiding from actually making a statement about this. You know what? Trump has got it. He's going to have a landslide, and the Democrats are going to give it to him.",

And the Republicans last night shot that gap and just dropped a huge hand grenade their -- announced (ph) a choice. It's not a referendum. There is a stark contrast between the president and Joe Biden. And they also made Joe Biden unlikable. He's not a nice guy.  Because nice guys don't let mobs and communists come in and destroy decades of hard work. There's a big dichotomy when they had Joe with the DNC sitting there getting bossed around by his Zoom (ph) wall of radicals. You juxtapose that to Donald Trump who is there engaging and honoring frontline workers who have made a lot of sacrifice. That was a big difference there.  Also, Dana brought it up, the fact that President Trump has secured the release of 50 hostages in just four years from 20 different countries, very historic. If you don't have empathy, compassion, or strong character, you don't do that. Very skilled negotiator and he was able to get it done. Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed because the Obama-Biden restorative justice policies didn't let school administrators' red flag a clear killer. He made a great point about that and said Joe Biden didn't even know what year it happened. And then you had Parnell, Sean, who is a total stud platoon leader talk about he came from a family of Democrats. And the Democratic Party under Joe Biden has totally forgotten about regular working-class Americans who want to use their Secondment Amendment rights. The McCloskey's came on, eloquently described how they were trying to defend their home, yet they were charged and the mob was not. And if Joe Biden comes, the mob takes over. Steve Scalise, shot by an actual socialist, made a very clear point. And I thought Don Jr.'s line about Beijing Biden, that's going to stick, too.  But I agree with everybody. The Cuban-American gentlemen, when he said that he hears these echoes of fake promises about free healthcare and free education, and he knows what that means. And it sells -- sends a chill up his spine. And he knows that only in America can you control your own destiny. That was a very powerful message.

So the Democrats did it all last week. I think that they will -- I think they actually said the country will end. Like, there will be no more United States of America if Donald Trump wins again. And now you see the Republicans saying this is what will happen if Biden wins. I think the rhetoric has been ratcheted up across the board. You had Nancy Pelosi today saying that the Republicans were the enemies of the people in regards to mail-in voting. So the rhetoric gets hot when you get closer to an election. But I think that most voters strip that away and they think about what will my life be like in four -- under four years if this president or that candidate. And then that's how they make their choice. I don't think they worry too much about the highfalutin rhetoric.",

They don't give a lot of speeches. They hate politics, but they are the best character witnesses for their husbands. And I think that's why people will want to tune in tonight.

I mean, you had the speeches from Nikki Haley, of course -- and Tim Scott who completely blew everybody away with his own personal life story of going from picking cotton to Congress, and talking about his grandfather not having an education and never learning to read, but then seeing him go to Congress and make a big difference in the world. He talked about his primary and how he beat out a number of other Republican opponents. I thought that was really compelling. But for me, the most compelling part of the entire night, I think, was the Cuban immigrant, Mr. Maximus, I believe was his last name. Talking about the flirtation and the danger that we are seeing now on the left with socialism and communism and his personal experience with that and him saying we are not going to give up what we have rightfully earned as a family. This is the last place that we are going to be. We are not abandoning that. There is nowhere else to go. We will stand up for America and the freedom that has flourished here. So really they hit back on a lot of the themes of the Democrats in terms Republicans not being happy warriors, being divisive, being bullies, and being, you know, white party rather than having any kind of diversity."

      "utterance": "It was -- remember that last week you had some people in the Republican Party sort of downplaying expectations for the production value because they only had about four weeks to plan, where the Democrats had about four months. I've got to tell you. I think the production quality of it was great. Like, you can watch that all night long not be diverted in terms of your attention. It moved quickly. Think of all of those people that are not practiced politicians that never read off a teleprompter before. They got prepared for this. And they nailed every one of those speeches. And they felt passionately about what they were talking about, Mr. Pollock there, of course, talking about his daughter, Meadow, was very compelling. I also really liked the segment -- it was kind of a show, but the meeting of the released hostages in the Oval Office with the president, because some of these things -- some of these policies, like, right to try, but also telehealth. Telehealth actually pulls so well all across America, but especially in rural areas because that's where you need it the most. So I felt like they were just nailing it on policy. And I said last night. You had more policy in the first hour of the Republican convention then you did in four days of the Democrats. Now, the other thing I would say in terms of what -- just to pick up something Katie said. People are talking about the suburbs as if they are just one model, the suburbs. There's a lot of diversity in the suburbs. And those are things called excerpts, right? So those were the sort of -- more farther out from the cities, not quite rural America but in between. There's a lot of middle- class people there. And I think that they were showing those people. Look, we have a party here that can get things done. Remember the incumbents are very hard to beat. They have records to run on. So I think last night was absolutely amazing. It was also -- one other thing and I'll shut up. The conventions are always the first primary speeches of the next election. And what you saw last night from Nikki Haley and Tim Scott I think were kind of their debut for potential runs in 2024. You will also hear from Tom Cotton tonight, the Senator from Arkansas. There is maybe a little bit more of that to come. But I think that the party is showing they have breadth and depth and diversity."

And I was looking for prescriptions, for ideas, for policies. Well, obviously, there is no platform except we back President Trump's make America great again agenda. So forget that. But when it comes to looking at the speeches, and even President Trump's speech for ideas, I just didn't see it. I saw what you saw, Jesse, about grievance, fear, name-calling. So for me, Trump has been the incumbent for four years, four years. He had control of the House, Senate, and the White House. So I may have missed it, guys. But, you know, no fix on Obamacare or make healthcare better. He said that was going to happen quickly. It's going to be simple. No fix on immigration law, nothing on immigration law.

      "utterance": "Well, first, I have an idea for a show. It's called The Post Five Fact-Check, where it's just three solid hours of fact- checking everything Juan just said because that's how long it would take. The argument always about playing to the base, what is the base, no -- everybody gets away with saying he plays to the base but they never define it. Because when you get down to define it, it just turns out it's everybody who votes for him, people who generally want law and order, people who want normalcy, safety. They want to have good schools. They want to have low taxes. Everybody is in the base. I hate to tell you. But I saw a lot of powerful moments, and everybody pretty much hit on them. Tim Scott, Meadows dad, Maximo Alvarez, the hostage segment was really interesting. And again, segment, it was like a talk show. I also will throw Don Jr. in there, because it's always a compliment when you say -- it's kind of backhanded compliment when you say you're surprised by how well somebody did, but I was surprised, because I thought it was well written. I thought it was well written, and I thought it was really well delivered. I felt like he found his voice. And I didn't see that coming. But I will say -- there was another criticism when you say they played to the base. What's the other way? They say they are throwing red meat. It's a bunch of red meat. But I think at this point in 2020, America will prefer red meat over dead meat. We are watching riots and violence all over. Everything that the Democrats ignored and pretended didn't exist, swept under the rug, even though the governor of Wisconsin just declared an emergency, I guess, over something nonexistent. So I think that if red meat is what the Republicans are delivering, then America is a carnivore and the Democrats are feeding tofu. So I think right now Trump has the upper hand because the Democrats gave it to him. By wimping out and being cowards about the violence and the horrible riots that are going on and people storming restaurants and intimidating people into agreeing with them or else. And a guy protecting his charity gets beaten unconscious as he tries to put out a fire. While this stuff is happening and the Democrats aren't doing crap, and Joe Biden is hiding from actually making a statement about this. You know what? Trump has got it. He's going to have a landslide, and the Democrats are going to give it to him."

But if you want the best defense of the best attack on leftism, you've got to go to somebody who has had experience on the other end of it. And that was Maximo Alvarez, the Floridian who escaped Cuba. What he did say, America -- his dad told him there's no other place to go. What he was trying to say is if leftism is allowed to take over America, then there will be no place, period, ever for freedom. What if these riots and the arson and the class warfare became, like, a permanent thing? It's happening in Portland. They're into their, what, 90 days now. This isn't just something that's going away because of the militancy and the bureaucratic cowardice has combined to create this horrible -- this horrible gutting of the American dream.

And the Republicans last night shot that gap and just dropped a huge hand grenade their -- announced (ph) a choice. It's not a referendum. There is a stark contrast between the president and Joe Biden. And they also made Joe Biden unlikable. He's not a nice guy. Because nice guys don't let mobs and communists come in and destroy decades of hard work. There's a big dichotomy when they had Joe with the DNC sitting there getting bossed around by his Zoom (ph) wall of radicals. You juxtapose that to Donald Trump who is there engaging and honoring frontline workers who have made a lot of sacrifice. That was a big difference there. Also, Dana brought it up, the fact that President Trump has secured the release of 50 hostages in just four years from 20 different countries, very historic. If you don't have empathy, compassion, or strong character, you don't do that. Very skilled negotiator and he was able to get it done. Andrew Pollack, whose daughter Meadow was killed because the Obama-Biden restorative justice policies didn't let school administrators' red flag a clear killer. He made a great point about that and said Joe Biden didn't even know what year it happened. And then you had Parnell, Sean, who is a total stud platoon leader talk about he came from a family of Democrats. And the Democratic Party under Joe Biden has totally forgotten about regular working-class Americans who want to use their Secondment Amendment rights. The McCloskey's came on, eloquently described how they were trying to defend their home, yet they were charged and the mob was not. And if Joe Biden comes, the mob takes over. Steve Scalise, shot by an actual socialist, made a very clear point. And I thought Don Jr.'s line about Beijing Biden, that's going to stick, too. But I agree with everybody. The Cuban-American gentlemen, when he said that he hears these echoes of fake promises about free healthcare and free education, and he knows what that means. And it sells -- sends a chill up his spine. And he knows that only in America can you control your own destiny. That was a very powerful message. And you're going to see the polls move in the battlegrounds after this week."

Bernie Sanders who praised Fidel Castro as a humanitarian and said, well, he has done some bad things but at least he has a reading program for his people. And last night, Mr. Alvarez laid out that he watched people who look exactly like him starve and die as a result of people like Fidel Castro and Bernie Sanders making all these promises and taking all the power for the elites at the top and leaving the people with nothing. And so yes, there are conclusions to be drawn there when it comes to ideologies that have infiltrated the Democratic Party. And you can say, well, Joe Biden is the nominee. Well, it's very obvious when you sign a unified document with platforms about socialism in them. You have major socialists speaking at your convention that it is controlling major parts of the party in your agenda should you win the White House."

So sometimes, you have to make a decision to protect yourself. One thing I want to say about the fact that -- now, both parties are describing that there will be a dystopian future for America on November 4th no matter who wins, right? So the Democrats did it all last week. I think that they will -- I think they actually said the country will end. Like, there will be no more United States of America if Donald Trump wins again. And now you see the Republicans saying this is what will happen if Biden wins. I think the rhetoric has been ratcheted up across the board. You had Nancy Pelosi today saying that the Republicans were the enemies of the people in regards to mail-in voting. So the rhetoric gets hot when you get closer to an election. But I think that most voters strip that away and they think about what will my life be like in four -- under four years if this president or that candidate. And then that's how they make their choice. I don't think they worry too much about the highfalutin rhetoric."

But also, there was something not in the speech. And I thought it was interesting. So he talked about how his grandfather never learned to read or write. His -- Scott's communications director, Sean Smith, tweeted this today that when Tim Scott was a kid, his grandfather used to hold the newspaper at the breakfast table and pretend to read it so that they would get into the habit and know that that was really important to do.

His is the opposite. He realizes that the defeatist mentality creates defeated people. That is what we're talking about almost every day now, so we're worried that this country is going in the wrong direction, because there's this message that America doesn't serve millions and millions of people. And he is proof that that is not true. Same with Herschel Walker, by the way, who we haven't mentioned, who was also fantastic.

I mean, he's a United States Senator, incredible historic, given that he's from South Carolina. But Dana, I would say that the best of him it was that his goal was to counter President Trump's problem with race in this country and his attitudes towards so many black people in this country. So he tried to help the President, I think, with two groups, white suburban women who are turned off by charges that the President is a racist, and most Americans at this point think that's true according to the polls, and secondly, with black men, who are a group that, you know, they could -- he could see some support coming from that quarter. But you remember, Scott was highly critical of Trump when it came to fine people on both sides and Charlotte.

He talked about how he's not into victimhood status and his life shows that. And what I loved about what he had to say is he gave thanks and gratitude to the American people and the progress that they have made and say -- and said the reason why I was able to be a congressman and ultimately a senator is because American voters judged me by my character, and not by the color of my skin. And at a time when it seems like people are asking us to do the opposite of that, to see his success and his family's story and the credit to his family for guiding him and pointing him in the right direction really is such an American success story that lots of people can emulate."

I liked when Tim Scott said that he had to deal with the Democrats on police reform but they backed away because they didn't want to solve the problem. They wanted to keep the issue alive for the election. Also, Vernon Jones, Black Democrat state of Georgia, talked about how the Democrats were the little Kunta Kinte cloth but they take the votes for granted. He said Black Americans don't want to fund the police, and that's a big lie. Also, Herschel Walker, the point where he said Donald Trump and I are very similar. When we see an obstacle, whether it's either in the political realm or on the football field, we run over it. And that may be kind of a bruising style for a lot of people, but it's effective."

The reality the Trump economy was so powerful, it's still withstanding a hurricane disguised as a disease. Other lies fall into the usual muddy area of opinion. There's one about Trump downplaying the pandemic, this after noting the death devastating impact on jobs from the shutdown that Trump initiated. That some downplaying shutting down travel, the economy, getting ventilators to those who claimed were needed. And Trump did this without killing people in rest homes.

But I did notice that they fact check Nikki Haley for calling Biden's public option government-run health care. But if you remember when ObamaCare was being passed, Democrats openly campaigned on this being done step to get to Medicare for all. So, I don't think that that fact-check is needed to be done."

That was in the data. Next up, Melania Trump getting ready for her big speech tonight. Will she get the same media treatment as Joe Biden?"

I think that -- well, she did say that the First Lady is going to make some reference to what she might like to do in a second term, which I think will be interesting to find out. She obviously loves children, and she glows around them in any capacity. So maybe it will have to do with that. We'll have to wait and see. I do think that Jill Biden, on the merits, got praised for her speech and I think that Melania Trump will as well. These are reticent speakers, they don't seek the limelight. They don't give a lot of speeches. They hate politics, but they are the best character witnesses for their husbands. And I think that's why people will want to tune in tonight.

I'm hoping that Nick Sandmann shows up in a Ferrari just covered in bling -- covered in bling and for, and it's all paid for by CNN and Jeff Zucker, which who I wonder if they're actually going to carry Nick Sandmann as he just kind of basically does a victory lap around the media.

He literally was silent in the face of verbal abuse, physical intimidation, and this just sinister band of social media predators that try to destroy his life.

As of right now, he has raised nearly $6,000 at the current rate. Another $600 will be donated for each touchdown he scores. He wants to hit a goal of $12,000 by the end of the season.

Caleb Simpson and Irvin Salazar got the cars from Amazon. Then, they had to put smaller engines in to slow the cars down. They didn't want trouble with the police.
