The FBI crime data report out, murder rates up 4.3 percent year over year, murder rates from 2019 to 2020 up 29.4 percent. Robbery down. But these numbers do not include numbers from New York or L.A., which significantly could increase those. If you look at the FOX News polls, voters extremely or very concerned about higher crime rates, 79 percent. Oops, that's the issue that GOP handled better, crime plus 13. Next one is extremely or very concerned about, 79 percent. It's amazing how I knew that was coming. Let's bring in our panel, Ben Domenech, editor at large of \"The Spectator,\" host of \"The Ben Domenech Podcast\" on FOX News Radio, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for Reuters, and Mollie Hemingway, editor in chief, there she is, at \"The Federalist.\" Mollie, it seems like more races, at least on the Republican side, are really focusing in on this in their ads and their messaging. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Right, we talk about all the other issues, the border, economy, inflation, energy. But it's really crime that threatens to bury Democrats in a month here. It is an issue that is pervasive. It hits people across the country. We all, we saw the members that these murder rates were up this year over last, but it's really that 2020 figure that is so staggering, that 30 percent increase in murder. And we all know what was happening that year. We all know that this was about some radical policies, whether it was the race riots or whether it was defunding the police or having prosecutors who refuse to prosecute crime. So it's really tied with the Democrat Party, this crime issue, in a way that's going to be very hard for them.",

As a woman of conscience and faith, I cannot concede that. It was not a free and fair election. He won under the rules of the game at the time, but the game was rigged against the voters of Georgia."

Meantime, that race against incumbent Governor Brian Kemp, there you see Kemp up in the latest average of polls, and our power rankings have this a lean Republican. There you can see kind of the pinkish red, the yellow are the toss-up in the middle there. You can check that out on FOXnews.com/Politics. We're back with the panel. Each of you chose a governor's race around the country. Ben, we will start with you."

      "utterance": "I chose Arizona because I think it's a fascinating election for a lot of different reasons. I think Kari Lake, an outsider by every definition, is actually likelier to win this fall than Blake Masters potentially when it comes to the Senate race. She is up against Katie Hobbs who has been avoiding to this point any kind of debate with the assumption that she was running ahead based on her past experience as a statewide elected candidate. I don't think that's true anymore. And I think that Hobbs actually should debate Lake if she has any kind of hope of having any kind of momentum going into November. Lake is a very compelling and charismatic candidate, and I believe will probably end up winning."

      "utterance": "I chose Oregon. It's an interesting state because it should be just reliably Democrat. It's a sapphire blue state. And yet the Republican has a chance of winning this race, in fact, she is ahead, over the Democrat because of this spoiler independent who is backed by Phil Knight, which is an indication that businesses feel that Oregon has gone too far left in making it almost hostile for businesses to operate there, and that the soft on crime policies that the Democrat candidate supports, the drug friendly policies that she supports, are a problem for the state. But this also shows that crime is one of those issues that mean that a very solid Democrat state might not be Democrat for governor."

      "speaker": "MASON",
      "utterance": "It sure does, those two issues. And Mr. Michels has not moved to the center on the issue of abortion, which some candidates when they get to the general election will moderate their opinions a little bit to attract that wider piece of the electorate. He has not done that, and that so far does not seem to be hurting him in the polls between the two men are very, very tight. And I think those two issues that you just highlighted will be part of what drives voters from both sides, the left and the right, to vote on the Election Day."
