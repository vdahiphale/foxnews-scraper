And when he became a millionaire, then he stopped attacking millionaires and started attacking billionaires. And the other thing is when he became a millionaire that first year, he didn't pay his fair share, he actually only paid 1 percent to charity, so he doesn't really put his money where his mouth is. And he doesn't have a health care plan. All he does is scream about Medicare for all. He doesn't say how the plan works or how he's going to pay for it.

Ruth was an immigrant and she was a widow who'd felt like she had no future left for her. Then you go to David, who's supposed to be the king, he's been anointed, but now he's hiding it and he's probably - if he had drugs back then he'd be on every - all the drugs everybody because he's terrified in fear and in despair.

We pay for his health care, his staff, his travel, his security. We pay for everything. And all he does is he goes around and makes promises he can't keep and he spends money that we can afford to spend. Bernie Sanders has never saved anything. He's never budgeted anything. And when he became a millionaire, then he stopped attacking millionaires and started attacking billionaires. And the other thing is when he became a millionaire that first year, he didn't pay his fair share, he actually only paid 1 percent to charity, so he doesn't really put his money where his mouth is. And he doesn't have a health care plan. All he does is scream about Medicare for all. He doesn't say how the plan works or how he's going to pay for it. So I think a lot of people should be nervous on the Democrat side, if Bernie gets the nomination, you're going to have four more years of Donald Trump as president."

His vision, I think, is in the mainstream. He wants to make sure that we have a living wage. He wants to make sure that children have access to college.

That's what it's like to be an American, all right? It's when somebody questions your success as though somehow you don't deserve it. At that moment Bernie Sanders went from a socialist to an individual who prides his liberty and that was actually gratifying. That would never have happened on MSNBC or anywhere else. The real problem here is that we -- every five years, we have to inoculate against socialism because it's not taught in the universities. Basically, capitalism is like a vaccine against the disease of socialism. It eradicates socialism, so you forget that it's there and then it comes back, just like the measles. Just like the measles. So what you need -- capitalism actually enables socialism to exist, just like a vaccine allows people not to take the vaccine."

I watched him sell cars. I watched him give guitar lessons, anything he could do to make ends meet. And he did make ends meet. And he told me, he said, son, I don't care if you're poor, in the middle, or if you're rich, always know that if you woke up in America today it's one of the best days of your life because people don't have the right to chase the American dream around the world. Work as hard as you want to, son, and dream as big as you can, and remember our constitution does not guarantee as happiness. It guarantees us a right to pursue happiness.

But it's having a powerful effect on people because it really - that's the first time that God is mentioned, a name for him in the Bible. And so, God who sees and you think about it. Hagar look at it, everybody thinks the Bible is like this 5,000-year-old dusty book that has no relevance. Hagar was sex trafficked. Hagar was a slave. Hagar was a single mother. Ruth was an immigrant and she was a widow who'd felt like she had no future left for her. Then you go to David, who's supposed to be the king, he's been anointed, but now he's hiding it and he's probably - if he had drugs back then he'd be on every - all the drugs everybody because he's terrified in fear and in despair.

His funeral will take place at the Middle Tennessee veteran's cemetery. It's located at 7931 McCrory Lane in Nashville. Tomorrow at 10 AM. He was known for his warm smile, kindhearted and gentle way and those who know him are hoping that you will give him the sendoff he deserves, so if you can make it there to the funeral at Nashville, I know that they would really, really appreciate it.

The Los Angeles Clippers pulled off the biggest come from behind victory in NBA playoff history down 31 points and they came back. At one point they had a 0.1 chance probability they would win. Kind of like what the New York Times gave Trump of winning, but they did. They came back and they pulled off a huge victory and I think one of the owners Steve Ballmer was freaking out in the stands if he could show the big man right there, losing his mind. Big win for the Clippers. Never give up everybody."
