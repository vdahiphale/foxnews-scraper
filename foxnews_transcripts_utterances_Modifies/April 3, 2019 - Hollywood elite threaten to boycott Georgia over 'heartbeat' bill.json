Media guru Frank Luntz breaks it all down, and Tammy Bruce reacts. Plus, House Judiciary Dems move to subpoena the full unredacted Mueller report, in an obvious attempt to reclaim the narrative. The President's lawyer Rudy Giuliani is here with the Trump team's first reaction.  And Raymond Arroyo is here with examples of elites targeting America, Hollywood boycotting Georgia over a state law, and why is Chick-fil-A being banned from another airport. But first, Dems' sound and fury, signifying nothing, that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Today, the Democrats engaged in a bit of theater in a desperate effort to keep the Russian collusion drama going. Jerry Nadler's Judiciary Committee along party lines voted to subpoena the entire unredacted Mueller report, and all supporting evidence from the Department of Justice.",

Never mind that Mueller found no criminality in his two-year probe and that there is nothing in the report to justify impeachment, which is what the Democrats obviously wanted. Nadler and his crew are just trying to distract from their own embarrassment. And for the Democratic theory here to be correct, think about what has to be. Bill Barr, an internationally respected legal mind and former Bush Attorney General, would've had to knowingly distort Mueller's fact-finding on both collusion and obstruction. And two, Mueller, Barr, most everyone involved in this investigation would have to be in some way in cahoots, working to protect the President at all costs.  Now tonight, we do have reports from The New York Times that there are anonymous investigators from the Mueller team who feel that Barr's summary was incomplete. Well, the report doesn't say who is upset in The New York Times or what they're really upset about, it's kind of murky. We'll wait and see if anything comes of that.   But, why would Mueller stand by without objection, if Barr had skewed in his - his lengthy findings? It's 400 page of report, right, in a four-page summary. Well, answer Mueller wouldn't do that. Now remember, it only took him hours to correct a false report from BuzzFeed earlier this year, and also remember both Republicans and Democrats went to great pains to build Mueller up as a consummate pro, an upstanding citizen and legal mind.",

So, what next, Hamburglar in Chief, what the President's diet tells us about his Presidency, or Hair Force One, what's under Trump's ball caps and why it should concern you. Tomorrow my friends, activists from dozens of far-Left groups are themselves promising massive protests nationwide, got to keep it going, got to keep it going. What the purpose of the protests? Well of course anyone with a brain knows it's about collecting email addresses for 2020, that's what it's really about.   But what they claim the protests tomorrow are going to be all about is that they want to pressure Bill Barr to immediately release the entire unredacted Mueller report and all the underlying witness interviews and so forth.  Now, this is truly moronic. If Barr or any Attorney General bowed to some organized protest and abandoned the classified information redaction process, he or she would risk serious legal jeopardy. But who cares? You know, concepts like the rule of law, they mean nothing to these people whose sole purpose in life is to resist Trump by any means necessary. So, tomorrow, along with their release the report signs, the protest organizers should really be passing out tinfoil hats. But my question is, what happens when they run out of conspiracy theories? What then? Who knows, but until then, it'll be more sound and fury signifying nothing and that's THE ANGLE.  Joining me now is Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy and Richard Goodstein former Hillary Clinton aide and Democratic Strategist. All right, Richard, will this routine ever get tiring for Democrats who try to convince us what they really want to do is, they want to get down to governing.

But first, Dems' sound and fury, signifying nothing, that's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Today, the Democrats engaged in a bit of theater in a desperate effort to keep the Russian collusion drama going.

Bill Barr, an internationally respected legal mind and former Bush Attorney General, would've had to knowingly distort Mueller's fact-finding on both collusion and obstruction. And two, Mueller, Barr, most everyone involved in this investigation would have to be in some way in cahoots, working to protect the President at all costs. Now tonight, we do have reports from The New York Times that there are anonymous investigators from the Mueller team who feel that Barr's summary was incomplete. Well, the report doesn't say who is upset in The New York Times or what they're really upset about, it's kind of murky. We'll wait and see if anything comes of that. But, why would Mueller stand by without objection, if Barr had skewed in his - his lengthy findings? It's 400 page of report, right, in a four-page summary. Well, answer Mueller wouldn't do that. Now remember, it only took him hours to correct a false report from BuzzFeed earlier this year, and also remember both Republicans and Democrats went to great pains to build Mueller up as a consummate pro, an upstanding citizen and legal mind."

So, what next, Hamburglar in Chief, what the President's diet tells us about his Presidency, or Hair Force One, what's under Trump's ball caps and why it should concern you. Tomorrow my friends, activists from dozens of far-Left groups are themselves promising massive protests nationwide, got to keep it going, got to keep it going. What the purpose of the protests? Well of course anyone with a brain knows it's about collecting email addresses for 2020, that's what it's really about. But what they claim the protests tomorrow are going to be all about is that they want to pressure Bill Barr to immediately release the entire unredacted Mueller report and all the underlying witness interviews and so forth. Now, this is truly moronic. If Barr or any Attorney General bowed to some organized protest and abandoned the classified information redaction process, he or she would risk serious legal jeopardy. But who cares? You know, concepts like the rule of law, they mean nothing to these people whose sole purpose in life is to resist Trump by any means necessary. So, tomorrow, along with their release the report signs, the protest organizers should really be passing out tinfoil hats. But my question is, what happens when they run out of conspiracy theories? What then? Who knows, but until then, it'll be more sound and fury signifying nothing and that's THE ANGLE.

Now, there's one warning here, which is a lot more women than we realize have been victims of sexual assault, genuine assault, and so they're watching this very carefully. But the Vice President clearly apologized, he acknowledged he was wrong, he admitted that he'd made mistakes. He said that times have changed and he has to change with them. So, he took responsibility for his actions. Make no mistake, there are going to be a lot of people coming forward, I don't think this is done.

The reality is, I am absolutely confident that the Attorney General will put out a very, very complete part, if not all of it, whatever he can legally and maybe they should change the law if they want to, and so that every grand jury - all grand jury testimony is just open to everybody and there's no attorney-client privilege."

If Congress, if these politicians in Congress can get their hands on people's tax returns and they go after the Democrats' and they go after Republicans' tax returns, what have we become? It has to be resisted.

And it's kind of a flip from when I grew up and your generation later, it was true, too, that we grew up with the ACLU was the guardians of free speech, left wing, the Warren Court. And it's not that way anymore. The left now, if you go to any campus in the United States, they are dismantling the First and Fifth Amendments. And it's the left, it's not conservatives that are censoring searches on Facebook or Twitter or working the Google searches. And it's the left that went after the Associated Press reporters and FOX's James Rosen and weaponized the IRS. And I really do believe in 2020 Donald Trump will not have his CIA director or his FBI director go to a FISA court or finagle with foreign intelligence to put a mole or to surveil Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders campaign.

Now it is the left. And it's not just the mayor of South Bend. Remember that during George H.W. Bush's funeral, we zoomed in on Trump during the prayer service and we were saying, all the other presidents were reading the Apostles' Creed and he didn't. He doesn't believe in God. And here in California, I remember that Jerry Brown, I don't know if you recall, he said that Trump was against global warming, the idea of global warming, and therefore he doesn't fear God or the wrath of God, almost of if heaven is powered by wind machines and solar panels."

I don't want to mention, I don't want to impugn, I don't want to suggest that anybody's religion is questionable, however, and then you go and trash Trump and that's OK. So he has this sort of facade that he is calm and rational and he's liberal and he's tolerant, and yet that means he can say the most intolerant and personal vitriol of anybody.
