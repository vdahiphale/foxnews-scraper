And essentially, they're leaving their drug addict with enough supply to kill themselves. They're feeding them collusion smack. And they can't even admit that they're addicted to it, so they're constantly going back to it, and they're going to end up destroying their chances for any re- election because they look like they're obsessed over something.

How come you never look at the Ukrainians giving the Manafort documents to the DNC, or Chris Steele drumming up all that stuff up from Russia? How about -- when did you know there was no collusion?

So, if the Mueller report is so good for him, why is he attacking Mueller and why are Republicans reacting as if, oh, the Democrats are the ones that are just so hungry to put Mueller on display. Well, if that's the case, if Mueller is like someone who has exonerated the president, you would think the president would, therefore, say I welcome having him testify.

Nancy Lee Grahn tweeted a shot of children wrapped in emergency blankets at a detention center blaming Trump for that. If the time and date hadn't been cropped from the picture you'd see it occurred under Obama. Now Nancy's deliberate lie was retweeted 30,000 times. Now 30,000 people are as dumb as she is. But for the left it wasn't a crisis then and it wasn't a crisis six months ago when collusion was the weapon to unseat Trump. But now that's failed. You claim Trump tortures kids while denying the same kids their beds. This is how Democrats solve the border crisis, making it worse. So no cots for tots. What's next? Boycott dairies that send milk to feed them? And now, they use pictures of the dead as if they actually care? They don't one bit. They're exploiting the suffering just to win an election and shame on all of them."

For a party that preaches tolerance, this once again demonstrates they have very little civility. When somebody is sick enough to resort to spitting on someone, it just emphasizes a sickness and their desperation and the fact that we're winning.\" The unidentified employee was reportedly released from police custody after Eric declined to press charges.

Whenever you hear them you instinctively want to blame the guy who spit or the vandal, the person who punched someone or the person who doxxed a kid at school. But you realize a lot of the responsibility is the media that has raised the temperature in the last couple years and pushed division. The Trump family can't possibly be as bad as what the media says that they are. It's impossible actually. But they push it, they push it, that's why Smollett chased his path, that's why people attacked Trump supporters, that's what politics is now a personal vendetta. We have the soccer player - what's-her-name Rappen A (ph) - OK no one knows who she is, until she does this, then she becomes a protected class. She expands her media footprint by screaming infantile PAP. So the self- centered athlete causes the sports money, but she's trending by being a selfish grandstander. This is the same problem. The media makes it so that people think this might help them or make this emotionally gratifying thing by attacking somebody, but you just look like a loser."

      "utterance": "All right. So we've already celebrated Father's Day, but I have an excellent nominee for Father of the Year. Take a look at this video. This is a one and a half year old boy chasing an inflatable ball on a sunny Florida day when he falls in the pool. When his dad sees him fall, the dad springs into action. Albert Passavanti leapt over a 4-foot safety fence to save his son's life. And what a beautiful dive, in case you didn't notice. I gave him 10 points for the dive. But I give him a million points for the save. So folks, while you're having summer fun, be safe around the pool and lock the baby gates. Because in case you didn't know, drowning is the number one cause of death for children ages 1 to 4."
