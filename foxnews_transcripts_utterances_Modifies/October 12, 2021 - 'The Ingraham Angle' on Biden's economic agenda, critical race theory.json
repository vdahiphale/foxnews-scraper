On June 22, Loudoun County, Virginia, father, Scott Smith was arrested after an outburst at a local school board meeting. You probably saw the video. Well, that meeting was deemed an unlawful assembly after many attendees spoke out forcefully about policies surrounding transgender students. Well, it became national news. And Smith himself became kind of a poster child for a new form of what they were calling, domestic terror. No one saw to uncover the source though of his anger. That until the Daily Wire Luke Rosiak wrote there, and he did some diggings. Smith claims now that, weeks prior to that, a boy allegedly wearing a skirt entered a girl's bathroom and sexually assaulted his ninth grade daughter. Scott Smith is here exclusively tonight with more. But first, diversity, equity and exclusion. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, every once in a while on on-air exchange slipped through the cracks on one of the other cable networks that's worth watching. Such was the case this morning on CNN of all places where they booked a point counterpoint on critical race theory.",

Telling companies and individuals to check their white privilege and re-examine their obsession with merit-based hiring. Turns out that's a lucrative business. But money can't buy you logic. Instead of refuting Ms. Nomani's evidence, proving the poisonous effects of CRT curricula, he merely pulled a Terry McAuliffe, saying parents should generally stop butting in, leave education to the experts.

Jon Gruden has been in football for longer, frankly, than I've been alive. And he's an exceptional football coach. What he said was absolutely wrong. Nobody condones it. But at the same time, that does not mean that there is a perpetuation of discrimination throughout the National Football League. There have been so many people that have been able to earn a livelihood that has transformed their families through the National Football League. And I think the one thing we got to do is take a look at his emails, move that to the side and stay focused on the fact that people of all races and all creeds can enter the NFL, or any other major sport for that matter, and actually thrive and succeed in America. What the left wants to do with it by taking that and have it be the new focus to make you think that all of America thinks that way, I think is the wrong way to go, is the wrong focus.

And while Biden's administration is now seeking to target parents, protesting CRT in schools, they're missing the real problem that's hurting all communities. Nearly 4.3 million Americans at all-time record quit their jobs in August. Nearly 900,000 of those were workers at restaurants and hotels. In the meantime, inflation continues to outpace wages at an alarming rate. Joining me now is Ohio Senate candidate, J.D. Vance. J.D., so Americans are suffering economically. Some are choosing to opt out of the workforce, I think, for a variety of reasons. But we're obsessing on Gruden, or DEI, or how awful America is on the left. That is their daily obsession. J.D. VANCE, \"HILLBILLY ELEGY\" AUTHOR: Yes. I think it goes to show that so much of this is a distraction for the fact that Biden's policies have failed normal people. And you're exactly right. I mean, why does it matter what Jon Gruden said in an email 10 years ago. Who are the victims? Who are the people victimized? Certainly, not the recipients of his email, certainly nobody affected today by it. I think it's ridiculous that the guy lost his job over it. But more importantly, I think it's ridiculous that our media is so focused on this when we have real problems to solve. I actually see - obviously the economic consequences of a lot of workers not working is a problem. I see the fact that so many workers are refusing these vaccine mandates as a good thing. It suggests there's some fight in the American people that they're not willing to accept these vaccine mandates and they're pushing back against it. That's a good thing at the end of the day, even though it is going to cause some short-term disruptions.",

On June 22, Loudoun County, Virginia, father, Scott Smith was arrested after an outburst at a local school board meeting. You probably saw the video. Well, that meeting was deemed an unlawful assembly after many attendees spoke out forcefully about policies surrounding transgender students. Well, it became national news. And Smith himself became kind of a poster child for a new form of what they were calling, domestic terror. No one saw to uncover the source though of his anger. That until the Daily Wire Luke Rosiak wrote there, and he did some diggings. Smith claims now that, weeks prior to that, a boy allegedly wearing a skirt entered a girl's bathroom and sexually assaulted his ninth grade daughter. Scott Smith is here exclusively tonight with more. But first, diversity, equity and exclusion. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, every once in a while on on-air exchange slipped through the cracks on one of the other cable networks that's worth watching. Such was the case this morning on CNN of all places where they booked a point counterpoint on critical race theory."

I mean, this is the volume of the book from 'Critical Race Theory' that as these people say teach in law schools. But unfortunately, it is now trickling down into little books for children, like 'Woke Baby', 'Gender Queer'. In it, there is unfortunately very graphic symbol of pedophilia and pornography."

Enter the defender of critical race theory in this discussion, a guy who was billed as simply a concerned parent, but who actually works the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion racket in Austin, Texas. Telling companies and individuals to check their white privilege and re-examine their obsession with merit-based hiring. Turns out that's a lucrative business. But money can't buy you logic. Instead of refuting Ms. Nomani's evidence, proving the poisonous effects of CRT curricula, he merely pulled a Terry McAuliffe, saying parents should generally stop butting in, leave education to the experts.

They prove their DEI bona fide ease by linking to goofy DEI posters like this one, or by hiring people not on merit, but according to the latest woke rules.

And everyone but the lowest of the low know it. But what we're doing to our schools, our workplaces, our everyday life is corrosive and divisive. The only people we really help by hiring, firing or promoting people based on immutable characteristics are the people getting rich off teaching bitterness and virtue signaling, where hard work and effort will usually suffice.

And that's a lot of power to force you to live in a country dominated by the DEI police, which takes us back to that discussion that caught my attention earlier today. What a great country it is that a Muslim-American woman who arrived here not speaking our language is far better versed in the guarantees of our Constitution and the meaning of our declaration than countless native born DEI experts. Not to mention, the buffoons now occupying the White House. Think of the tens and millions of immigrants, who becomes small business owners and successful professionals. And who did so by the way without relying on government handouts, or DEI mandates to clear the path for themselves. So maybe, just maybe, it's time for us to focus more on parenting and less on complaining. More on showcasing talent, and less obsessing on race, or ethnicity. And that's the 'Angle'.

They're the ones that spilled the milkshake on the table and tried to act like they didn't spill it themselves. And parents are waking up to this. They have realized that what they want to do unfortunately, is weaponize our children against American society. This type of division does not help our children succeed. It doesn't help our children succeed. And so when Brianna Keilar and other people on the left get confronted with the evidence of what's happening in our schools, they can do nothing else but try to backtrack and blame other people. But the fault is theirs, because they got caught trying to divide our country. And that does not - that's not what's best for America."

Among their targets are programs that encourage equity and anti-racism, and work to reduce unconscious bias in the classroom. Congressman, this is the media's convenient framing. So the parents who are saying no, we want real education, they're the radicals. And the CRT experts, the pushers of all this division are the normal people. OK."

      "speaker": "DONALDS",

The Tampa Bay Times and media outlets like that, what they really want is to support the radical left in their agenda, which is, frankly, to unwind our entire country and our entire society. And they're not comfortable and they're not happy with just winning a political fight, or winning a political election. They want to distill it down to our kids. What parents want more than anything else, is for their children to learn reading, writing, arithmetic. They want to learn history, so their children are empowered to take over the country that will be left to them. But if we let radical leftists and newspaper organizations and media organizations divide our country, there'll be nothing left for them to take over. Our nation is great. People can come here, thrive and prosper, and make the best of their lives as they see fit. But we can never survive this rank division that the radical left wants to bring in a form of critical race theory. That's why it should not be taught. Its element should not be in textbooks. People should be free to learn our history, learn all our history, but be prepared to lead America going forward, not divide America going forward."

Should it have cost him his job? I'm not quite sure. But the key point is this, what happens when these kind of emails come out is that the left seizes on them to perpetuate this division they think that exists in America. Jon Gruden has been in football for longer, frankly, than I've been alive. And he's an exceptional football coach. What he said was absolutely wrong. Nobody condones it. But at the same time, that does not mean that there is a perpetuation of discrimination throughout the National Football League. There have been so many people that have been able to earn a livelihood that has transformed their families through the National Football League. And I think the one thing we got to do is take a look at his emails, move that to the side and stay focused on the fact that people of all races and all creeds can enter the NFL, or any other major sport for that matter, and actually thrive and succeed in America. What the left wants to do with it by taking that and have it be the new focus to make you think that all of America thinks that way, I think is the wrong way to go, is the wrong focus. But once again, this is the left's agenda all the time. It is the right America."

And while Biden's administration is now seeking to target parents, protesting CRT in schools, they're missing the real problem that's hurting all communities. Nearly 4.3 million Americans at all-time record quit their jobs in August. Nearly 900,000 of those were workers at restaurants and hotels. In the meantime, inflation continues to outpace wages at an alarming rate. Joining me now is Ohio Senate candidate, J.D. Vance. J.D., so Americans are suffering economically. Some are choosing to opt out of the workforce, I think, for a variety of reasons. But we're obsessing on Gruden, or DEI, or how awful America is on the left. That is their daily obsession. J.D. VANCE, \"HILLBILLY ELEGY\" AUTHOR: Yes. I think it goes to show that so much of this is a distraction for the fact that Biden's policies have failed normal people. And you're exactly right. I mean, why does it matter what Jon Gruden said in an email 10 years ago. Who are the victims? Who are the people victimized? Certainly, not the recipients of his email, certainly nobody affected today by it. I think it's ridiculous that the guy lost his job over it. But more importantly, I think it's ridiculous that our media is so focused on this when we have real problems to solve. I actually see - obviously the economic consequences of a lot of workers not working is a problem. I see the fact that so many workers are refusing these vaccine mandates as a good thing. It suggests there's some fight in the American people that they're not willing to accept these vaccine mandates and they're pushing back against it. That's a good thing at the end of the day, even though it is going to cause some short-term disruptions."

I mean, I went to San Diego to visit some family over Christmas, and you walk outside into public beach, and it was like 99 percent of the people were wearing masks. And you realize that the mask and the entire lockdown regime, the anti- COVID thing became this sort of weird blue state culture war-ish. It wasn't about public health. It wasn't about protecting people. It was really about showing that they were virtuous. And unfortunately, that's continued. I mean, we're now 18 months into this thing, we've got to get back to some level of normalcy.

And there was some crazy stuff being talked about. People, for things, for - against things. I wasn't there for any - I'm good with gay people, cross gender people, everybody. Anybody who wants to be a good American, I'm good with. I went there to find out why our children weren't safe. And the next thing I know, another parent, activist, approached my wife and started antagonizing her. And I turned around and said, stop. And then I tried to tell the lady what had happened to my daughter. And she looked me down in the face and said, that's not what happened. And that just struck me, like, how do you know what happened? You don't even know me. And then she kept going in and the police came and the officer was trying to help out. He said, we needed to be kind to one another. And I said, ok, and I turned my head and she started in on me again and threatened my family business, my livelihood, everything that gives my family what we need. She threatened to ruin my business on social media. The next thing I know, I'm getting touched from all over the place. I didn't know who was touching me, who was grabbing me.

And then last Friday night the phone rang, I actually believe it was a text, from a concerned parent to my wife. It said I need to know what the boy's name is. And we said we will never discuss that. Why? And then they proceed to tell my wife that there was another assault at Broad Run High School and the rumor is that it's the same boy. I couldn't believe -- I started to argue with my wife about it, because is aid this is impossible. Stop feeding into social media. This didn't happen."

But too small, and progressives think the base won't turnout.\" Joining me now is Bret Baier, SPECIAL REPORT anchor, author of the brand new book out just today \"To Rescue the Republic,\" everyone should buy about Ulysses S. Grant. Bret, we're going to get to your incredible new book in a moment. First, your thoughts on the bind that Democrats find themselves in."

I'll tell you, Progressives feel if this is not too big they're not going to have the turnout to the midterms, and they fell like that is the thing that will lead to their demise. Moderates think that too big a package will lead to their demise and be a PR ploy and something to talk about for the GOP. And you just have to look back at history. And we call always do that, look back in history. 2010, remember the midterms there after the Obamacare vote and what that led to. It was, in President Obama's words, a shellacking in the midterm that Republicans picked up even though Democrats and progressives believed that this was the thing that everyone wanted. In that race in 2009 just before that, there was a governor's race that was kind of a canary on in the coalmine about what was to come. That governor's race was in Virginia, and the Republican beat the democrat significantly. Now there is a very contested Virginia governor's race, and it will interest to see if it follows history."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "So this book is really about the forgotten history of Grant and how he saves the United States. And what people can take from it, and leaders especially, I think, is that we have to keep fighting for the republic every day. It's that important. And freedom is not free. It sounds like a cliche, but it really isn't. And it takes effort. And it takes really a lot of effort to get people together. Grant's eight years in office are characterized really broadly as being scandalous. And there were scandals. But he did amazing thing. The 13th, 14th, 15th amendments. He fought for black citizenship, the right to vote. And he also fought the KKK. But most importantly, he kept the union together, and that was his goal. I think to fight for the republic every day and not give us is what leaders could take away from it."

And unlike in the Senate, every single House Republican voted against this terrible bill, including my next guest. Indiana Congressman Jim Banks joins me now. Congressman, the media is framing this as staving off catastrophe. So we're kicking the can down the road, to use that terrible cliche, into December when before Christian nobody wants get the pile of coal in their stocking."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. JIM BANKS, (R-IN)",
      "utterance": "That's right, Laura. Keep in might, they are racing the debt limit so that they have the room to pay for their massive, radical socialist agenda, the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. Speaker Pelosi talked about scaling it back a little bit today. But make no bones about it, this is still a massive bill that would transform American and make this a socialist nation overnight if the Biden agenda passes. And that's why Republicans have to do a better job of communicating to the American people how dangerous this reconciliation bill really is. That's why I put out a memo today with a Republican study committee with 42 reasons that every Republican should vote against this bill, and 42 reasons that the American people should be aware that this bill is not just the price tag, it's not just what it will do to inflation. But the dangerous components in this bill that will affect your daily life, like shutting down your daycare facility, especially if it's faith-based daycare facility. It will give illegal immigrants free college tuition and child tax credits. It will create a climate police department. This was a whacky idea that AOC came out with a couple of years ago. We all laughed at it at the time because we thought it would never happen, and now it's on the brink of happening."

And why is Singapore with an 80 percent vaccination rate and strict COVID restrictions now seeing an explosion of cases and even deaths, while Scandinavia, free of mandates, they're wide open, they're seeing the opposite. Dr. Harvey Risch has some interesting data about why this is happening next."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So if vaccines are really the ticket back to normalcy, why is Singapore where 83 percent of the population is fully vaxxed in the midst of another COVID wave. Meanwhile, in Scandinavia life is essentially back to normal, no mandates, vax passports, masks, everything is open. Despite a much lower vaccination rate places like Denmark are averaging fewer than one COVID death a day. So what is going on? My next guest has some ideas. Dr. Harvey Risch, Yale epidemiology professor joins me now. Dr. Risch, what is going on here? It's confusing to average Americans."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. HARVEY RISCH, YALE PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY",
      "utterance": "Singapore has done very well, very thorough at vaccinating its population, but the population has very little natural immunity. Hardly anybody got the infection in the first place, and now the vaccines are wearing off. The vaccine immunity has a finite lifespan of somewhere between three and six months, and it's losing that over time, and more people are getting infected again. People can get infected while the vax is working fully, but they're relatively protected from very severe outcomes, which is a good thing by and large for the people who take it. But they really need much more natural immunity from the infection going forward in order to prevent what they are seeing. And they need that natural immunity to combat other viruses, other strains that may be coming as well. And after a longer lasting protection, natural immunity is much longer lasting than vax immunity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "You mean the natural immunity that our own government claims isn't really protective at all. OK. Well, a big problem, professor, Doctor, that Singapore has is its mixed messaging from the leader. Watch."

      "utterance": "Cut back on social activities to slow the spread of the virus. Get vaccinated if you haven't already done so. Go for your booster shot when your turn comes. As more people are exposed to the virus and recover, our immunity levels will increase. COVID will spread less quickly among us."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
