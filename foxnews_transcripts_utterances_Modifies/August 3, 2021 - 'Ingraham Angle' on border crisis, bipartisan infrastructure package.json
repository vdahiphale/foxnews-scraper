This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Now, illegals aren't just crossing our border at record numbers, they're now being sent all over the United States oftentimes with governors and mayors knowing nothing about it. We have a report tonight from McAllen, Texas, where many of these odysseys begin. Also, Hunter Biden offers a laughable justification for his art. And another Olympian, I don't know if you've seen this, uses the podium to protest. Raymond Arroyo has that in seen and unseen. But first, a bridge to nowhere. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Roads and bridges, broadband expansion, fixing potholes, repairing rusting bridges, fixing train tracks, increasing internet access for everybody. It all sounds pretty reasonable, right? Any country should have all that. Remember, Trump wanted to do infrastructure and yet Pelosi impeachment never got it done. Well, tonight, I'm going to tell you what counts as infrastructure. The Republicans agreed to this without even ever having read a draft of the bill. They put - it was put together mostly by the majority parties' committee staff. Now, in June, a bipartisan group of senators led by Mitt Romney thought it was a good idea to engage with President Biden on this thing called an infrastructure bill that would cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Now, the deal included Biden's pledge and who they are all together in one room, that it would be a standalone. In other words, it wouldn't be linked with this $3.5 trillion or $4 trillion spendarama that the Democrats were cooking up to pass through this thing called reconciliation, which means you only need a simple majority. Of course, Biden is so out of it, he couldn't remember though what he said to whom about the negotiations. And so he ended up tipping the Democrats hand.",

      "sentences": "Ain't going to be one. Now again, she plays hardball while Republicans are waiting for a Wiffle ball game to start. She's not taking up infrastructure until they get their gargantuan spending package to a simple majority vote. Simply put, by agreeing to this order of things, the Romney group gave up all of their leverage, as Democrats are able to bypass them entirely on their way to a simple majority vote on a $3.5 trillion package that no one's seen. Now, some of what we do know that will be included in this second bill: Universal pre-k; free meals for all students; family medical leave; a pathway to citizenship for the DACA recipients; greener farming; and expansion of Medicare. And that's just the beginning. And today, more than a month after the Romney group met with Biden, the Democrats finally released their Infrastructure Bill, $110 billion roads, bridges, major projects; $66 billion for railways; $65 billion for broadband. But that's not all. There were more gems buried in the text, which most senators obviously won't have the time to read. It's 2700 pages after all. It includes funds for new state imposed carbon reduction requirements; $1 billion to the Appalachian Regional Commission, which is co-chaired by Joe Manchin's wife; millions for wildlife crossing structures; it refers to women as socially disadvantaged individuals; and in one part of the bill stipulates that gender identity will be a protected class under federal law. Of course, this is how it always goes, all right, when one party has been given all the leverage. They get cocky, and they go too far, but in this case, who's going to stop them. White House Senior Advisor Mike Donilon sent out a positively giddy note to Democrats today. In part, saying, \"President Biden continues to propose and deliver plans that the American people, across party lines, agree are good for the country.\" He's doing exactly what he said he'd do when he ran for the job acting not as a president of the red or blue states, but a president of the United States. Well, amidst an unprecedented crisis of Biden's own making at the White House amidst the new pessimism and confusion about Biden's handling of the COVID Delta variant on the border, it's breaking down. His approval numbers last week hit a low of 50 percent. But now, courtesy of the Romney group, Republicans have given Biden bragging rights. They've given him a lifeline. He'll not only be able to claim a huge legislative victory, and more significantly a glide path to this gargantuan $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, legislation that can pass a single GOP vote, and it can transform huge sectors of American society perhaps forever. The Democrats justified the cost of the infrastructure bill by claiming, by the way, it was fully paid for. Huh. Well, here's the Wall Street Journal's analysis that just came out tonight. \"West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and his Senate Republican friends are stressing that their deal is fully paid for, but read their lips: No new deficit spending, read their bill, though it relies on a great degree on savings and revenue already baked into the fisc or the treasury. And that's unlikely to happen. Now, given that we already loaded an unconscionable burden of debt on our kids and our grandkids, and given how fast our economy began to recover from the pandemic, that's good news. A smart path would be for the Romney group right now to reassess their support for this infrastructural deal and it includes Mitch McConnell, by the way, go to the voters. Explain how the Democrats changed the rules mid game and head into the midterms with a clear message that America just needs to open up for business fully without burdensome mandates, no more accounting gimmicks and no more legislative games. We're not going to do any of that. Otherwise, we may be rebuilding some bridges, but the country is going nowhere good. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now and I'm really delighted he is with us, Senator Bill Cassidy, one of the Republicans who's been out in front on pushing this deal. Senator, I really appreciate you joining me tonight. You know my view on this. But I wanted to give you a chance to defend this bill as good for America. But first, have you had a chance to read the 2700 plus pages of text that comprise this bill?",

And by the way, did I mention, it creates a heck of a lot of jobs. And I disagree with your representation. It is paid for.

Now, by the way, that makes our people more, more competitive.

And look today at what that has done to inflation in our country. The highest rates of inflation since 1991. Now, do the math with this, a $1 trillion infrastructure deal and $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that Nancy Pelosi says the infrastructure bill will not pass her house without the reconciliation bill passing with it. And imagine what that will do to inflation in this country. You're already paying more for a gallon of milk.

And DHS sources are telling us that border patrol stations here in the McAllen area were running nearly 600 percent over capacity this past weekend. And as a result of that, there are now mass releases of migrants happening pretty much nonstop. Take a look at this remarkable video that we shot over the weekend from right here in Mission, Texas. This is Sunday afternoon. Our drone video showing a massive group of illegal immigrants being held by Border Patrol under Anzalduas Bridge. It's the largest group we have ever seen in all of our trips to the border. We're talking at least 1000 people as Border Patrol sources tell us more than 8000 illegal immigrants were apprehended just here in the Rio Grande Valley alone over the weekend. Sunday night in La Joya, we came across this large group of more than 200 migrants who turned themselves into Border Patrol. Many of the migrants were visibly coughing as COVID-19 cases continue to surge amongst the migrant population here in the Rio Grande Valley, a more than 900 percent increase just in the month of July. In downtown McAllen today, we watched all day long as Border Patrol released illegal immigrants from their custody in mass. Border Patrol buses dropped off loads of the migrants at a local Catholic charity every 30 minutes. We watched over and over as busloads of the migrants were emptied out and released to the charity. Several hundred in total. Staff members for Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley then walked the migrants across the street to McAllen Central Station. That's where they were given bus tickets to travel elsewhere across the country. And Fox News has now learned of a second local hotel where the charity is housing COVID positive migrants, this time in Weslaco. City officials there say, they recently found out that charity has been quietly housing infected migrants at this Texas inn in Weslaco without ever being told by the charity. And earlier today, I reached out to the executive director of that Catholic charity and I asked her straight up, how many COVID positive migrants are you guys housing in local hotels here in the Rio Grande Valley? She told me \"I've been advised not to comment\". Laura.",

As you just heard from Bill, facilities are so overrun that busloads of illegals are being sent all over the United States, including many that are COVID positive. One senior Customs and Border Protection source told The Washington Examiner, \"They aren't tested at encounter. Unaccompanied children and family units are moved out of custody quickly. If they're infected and don't have obvious symptoms, they're sent out.\" Joining us now, Texas lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick.

Look at the narrative, the narrative they're spinning versus where we really are with daily COVID deaths. According to \"Politico,\" the spread \"of the Delta variant and conflicting opinions about how best to address it has led to behind-the-scenes finger- pointing and weeklong tensions between the CDC and the White House,\" adding that Biden officials have \"been openly frustrated by what they see as overly alarmed coverage\" of so-called breakthrough case among the vaccinated.

The reality is it makes no difference at all. The CDC's own numbers show that 40 percent of school aged kids already have this virus by March of 2021, which means it could be over 50 percent now, which means whatever we were doing didn't prevent them from getting the virus. What prevented them from having bad outcomes is that it's not dangerous for children.

This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Now, illegals aren't just crossing our border at record numbers, they're now being sent all over the United States oftentimes with governors and mayors knowing nothing about it. We have a report tonight from McAllen, Texas, where many of these odysseys begin. Also, Hunter Biden offers a laughable justification for his art. And another Olympian, I don't know if you've seen this, uses the podium to protest. Raymond Arroyo has that in seen and unseen. But first, a bridge to nowhere. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. Roads and bridges, broadband expansion, fixing potholes, repairing rusting bridges, fixing train tracks, increasing internet access for everybody. It all sounds pretty reasonable, right? Any country should have all that. Remember, Trump wanted to do infrastructure and yet Pelosi impeachment never got it done. Well, tonight, I'm going to tell you what counts as infrastructure. The Republicans agreed to this without even ever having read a draft of the bill. They put - it was put together mostly by the majority parties' committee staff. Now, in June, a bipartisan group of senators led by Mitt Romney thought it was a good idea to engage with President Biden on this thing called an infrastructure bill that would cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Now, the deal included Biden's pledge and who they are all together in one room, that it would be a standalone. In other words, it wouldn't be linked with this $3.5 trillion or $4 trillion spendarama that the Democrats were cooking up to pass through this thing called reconciliation, which means you only need a simple majority.

In other words, if you vote for the infrastructure plan, which needs a filibuster proof majority, you're effectively paving the way for this massive budget bill, multi-trillion dollar extravaganza creating brand new entitlement spending and transforming much of American society from top to bottom. Oh, and that bill, as I said, will only need to pass by a simple majority. You get it. But the Republicans had once again, looks like they've been played. Remember, Pelosi, she doesn't mess around."

      "utterance": "Universal pre-k; free meals for all students; family medical leave; a pathway to citizenship for the DACA recipients; greener farming; and expansion of Medicare. And that's just the beginning. And today, more than a month after the Romney group met with Biden, the Democrats finally released their Infrastructure Bill, $110 billion roads, bridges, major projects; $66 billion for railways; $65 billion for broadband. But that's not all. There were more gems buried in the text, which most senators obviously won't have the time to read. It's 2700 pages after all. It includes funds for new state imposed carbon reduction requirements; $1 billion to the Appalachian Regional Commission, which is co-chaired by Joe Manchin's wife; millions for wildlife crossing structures; it refers to women as socially disadvantaged individuals; and in one part of the bill stipulates that gender identity will be a protected class under federal law. Of course, this is how it always goes, all right, when one party has been given all the leverage. They get cocky, and they go too far, but in this case, who's going to stop them. White House Senior Advisor Mike Donilon sent out a positively giddy note to Democrats today. In part, saying, \"President Biden continues to propose and deliver plans that the American people, across party lines, agree are good for the country.\" He's doing exactly what he said he'd do when he ran for the job acting not as a president of the red or blue states, but a president of the United States. Well, amidst an unprecedented crisis of Biden's own making at the White House amidst the new pessimism and confusion about Biden's handling of the COVID Delta variant on the border, it's breaking down. His approval numbers last week hit a low of 50 percent. But now, courtesy of the Romney group, Republicans have given Biden bragging rights. They've given him a lifeline. He'll not only be able to claim a huge legislative victory, and more significantly a glide path to this gargantuan $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, legislation that can pass a single GOP vote, and it can transform huge sectors of American society perhaps forever. The Democrats justified the cost of the infrastructure bill by claiming, by the way, it was fully paid for. Huh. Well, here's the Wall Street Journal's analysis that just came out tonight. \"West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and his Senate Republican friends are stressing that their deal is fully paid for, but read their lips: No new deficit spending, read their bill, though it relies on a great degree on savings and revenue already baked into the fisc or the treasury. And that's unlikely to happen. Now, given that we already loaded an unconscionable burden of debt on our kids and our grandkids, and given how fast our economy began to recover from the pandemic, that's good news. A smart path would be for the Romney group right now to reassess their support for this infrastructural deal and it includes Mitch McConnell, by the way, go to the voters. Explain how the Democrats changed the rules mid game and head into the midterms with a clear message that America just needs to open up for business fully without burdensome mandates, no more accounting gimmicks and no more legislative games. We're not going to do any of that. Otherwise, we may be rebuilding some bridges, but the country is going nowhere good. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now and I'm really delighted he is with us, Senator Bill Cassidy, one of the Republicans who's been out in front on pushing this deal. Senator, I really appreciate you joining me tonight. You know my view on this. But I wanted to give you a chance to defend this bill as good for America. But first, have you had a chance to read the 2700 plus pages of text that comprise this bill?"

And by the way, did I mention, it creates a heck of a lot of jobs. And I disagree with your representation. It is paid for.

Now, by the way, that makes our people more, more competitive.

But my biggest concern is this, Laura, do the math with me go, back to January when we passed - when they passed the $1.9 trillion so-called COVID Relief Bill. And look today at what that has done to inflation in our country. The highest rates of inflation since 1991. Now, do the math with this, a $1 trillion infrastructure deal and $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that Nancy Pelosi says the infrastructure bill will not pass her house without the reconciliation bill passing with it. And imagine what that will do to inflation in this country. You're already paying more for a gallon of milk. Every time you pump up a gas, or fill up your gas tank at the gas pump, you're going to pay twice as much when these guys are done with it.

Together, the infrastructure bill and the spending plan would run the country $4.7 trillion, 55 percent of voters say that's too much, 64 percent oppose a federal tax hike to pay for this\" Now, I think, Congressman, we know that the infrastructure bill, that doesn't include a tax increase, obviously, the follow on bill, which Senator Cassidy thinks is less likely to pass, I do not understand that. He said - that's obviously does include a tax increase for people over $400,000. So what does this tell you? What the selective polling showcasing the White House is doing?"

And you're right, the tax increases and everything else that comes with the almost $110 billion out of this $1 trillion deal will go toward roads and bridges and what anybody in America would define or consider is infrastructure.

And over in McAllen, there's been busload after busload, migrants being dropped off at a Catholic charity, before of course, they're fanning out all over the country courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer.

And DHS sources are telling us that border patrol stations here in the McAllen area were running nearly 600 percent over capacity this past weekend. And as a result of that, there are now mass releases of migrants happening pretty much nonstop. Take a look at this remarkable video that we shot over the weekend from right here in Mission, Texas. This is Sunday afternoon. Our drone video showing a massive group of illegal immigrants being held by Border Patrol under Anzalduas Bridge. It's the largest group we have ever seen in all of our trips to the border. We're talking at least 1000 people as Border Patrol sources tell us more than 8000 illegal immigrants were apprehended just here in the Rio Grande Valley alone over the weekend. Sunday night in La Joya, we came across this large group of more than 200 migrants who turned themselves into Border Patrol. Many of the migrants were visibly coughing as COVID-19 cases continue to surge amongst the migrant population here in the Rio Grande Valley, a more than 900 percent increase just in the month of July. In downtown McAllen today, we watched all day long as Border Patrol released illegal immigrants from their custody in mass. Border Patrol buses dropped off loads of the migrants at a local Catholic charity every 30 minutes. We watched over and over as busloads of the migrants were emptied out and released to the charity. Several hundred in total. Staff members for Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley then walked the migrants across the street to McAllen Central Station. That's where they were given bus tickets to travel elsewhere across the country. And Fox News has now learned of a second local hotel where the charity is housing COVID positive migrants, this time in Weslaco. City officials there say, they recently found out that charity has been quietly housing infected migrants at this Texas inn in Weslaco without ever being told by the charity. And earlier today, I reached out to the executive director of that Catholic charity and I asked her straight up, how many COVID positive migrants are you guys housing in local hotels here in the Rio Grande Valley? She told me \"I've been advised not to comment\". Laura."

But it's really not the same as what was in place under Trump in a way, because while it's technically the same, this administration not going to enforce it. As you just heard from Bill, facilities are so overrun that busloads of illegals are being sent all over the United States, including many that are COVID positive. One senior Customs and Border Protection source told The Washington Examiner, \"They aren't tested at encounter. Unaccompanied children and family units are moved out of custody quickly. If they're infected and don't have obvious symptoms, they're sent out.\" Joining us now, Texas lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick. Dan, late tonight a U.S. official confirmed to the AAP that the number of unaccompanied children picked up by border authorities will likely hit the all-time high in July.

Imagine, Laura, if you lived in Mission, or La Joya, or Westlake. I've been to those towns many times. And at 2:00 in the morning and 3:00 in the morning you have people milling all around your streets, walking by your house. These people are everywhere. When they leave the bridge, Laura, where did they go? They get on a bus and go to some city in America taking COVID, their crime background if they are criminals, or delivering drugs.

      "utterance": "Exactly, exactly. So that's why the next question about will they stay open, that's where we worry, because when you have lots of kids, particularly every child under 12 has not been vaccinated."

      "utterance": "This is an evil woman. Tonight, she tweeted \"The data is clear, until vaccination rates are up across the country, masking is the best way for schools to protect us and those around us regardless of vaccinate status.\" Phil, they don't want to go back to school, they don't want to go back to the classroom."

      "speaker": "KERPEN",
      "utterance": "Laura, it is opposite of what the data show. We have very little data comparing masked to unmasked schools because the CDC has tried very carefully to avoid doing that comparison. The only time they ever did that study was for the first semester of Florida schools when they found that there was a little bit lower cases in the masked than the unmasked, and then they never updated the study, because if you look at the full year Florida data, which there is a preprint from Brown University researchers that do, they found that over the full school year the opposite was true, and it was the unmasked schools that had lower cases than the masked rules. The reality is it makes no difference at all. The CDC's own numbers show that 40 percent of school aged kids already have this virus by March of 2021, which means it could be over 50 percent now, which means whatever we were doing didn't prevent them from getting the virus. What prevented them from having bad outcomes is that it's not dangerous for children. And this idea that we need to mask them or else Randi is going to walk off of the job again and close schools should be taken as what it is. It is just a naked thread to walk off of the job again for another shakedown, for another Zoom school relaxing on the couch or on the beach."

They've got to pull a Reagan with the air traffic controllers from the gubernatorial level. Gentlemen, thank you. And a new ad takes on woke-a-cola. The Last Bite next."
