      "sentences": "All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders here. And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this whole trade issue.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And you're watching \"Your World.\"  And it could have worse. As I show you the Dow today down about 328 points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better, or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves.  All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside the U.S. On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue, but that it's not welcome noise here.  So, again, this could have a lot been worse. There was some confusion early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in technology stocks at all. Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no, they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment restrictions on China.  And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points southward on what was a crazy day on the markets.   We're going to be at this from all angles right now. Let's first go to Fox Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all sorted out. Hey, Deirdre.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Neil. You said it. It could have been much worse. So, the markets did close clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day. And, of course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional tech exports from the U.S. to China. Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details on the plan.  Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff spats. So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in months.   That's how we finished up. You can see red across the screen. One area I really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&P 500 tech companies get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas. So that's the highest foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors. And, of course, critics of our current trade policy say that China has been stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual property, hard data, every year for the past decade. But then there was even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property.  It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that has some projections baked in is possible. But experts say, bottom line, the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely understandable. What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are interconnected. So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies that source half of their products and components from China.  So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel. Even Apple has sold more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S. And Apple gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China.  Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will not be forced to eat the bitter fruit. That is a translation, a direct quote. But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of course, investors really showed their anxiety. So, we had the Nasdaq, you can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day percentage decline since March. Third day down in a row. So, that's the longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time.  Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there. You can see Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent. And, then, of course, even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S. 10-year. Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're fearful or they feel less certain of the future.   And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling 2.875 percent. And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically for the past four out of five weeks. So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it. We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil.",

And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe. And so Harley is in a tough spot. That tariff went from 6 percent to 31 percent. And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the U.S. and sold in Europe. And they can't possibly pass that along to consumers.   So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it. In the long term, they're going to move production away from the U.S. Europe was an expanding market for Harley-Davidson. They love it over there. And U.S. sales have been down.  You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their motorcycles. In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent. And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no more. Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore.  Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand and Australia. This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the president had intended. His trade policies designed to keep and create jobs here in the U.S. In this case, it appears they will be eliminating them -- Neil.",

The administration, which I wish they would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech leader in a short period of time. And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property. So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25 percent or more ownership. And, again, this was just speculation. It was in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a little bit. It's something obviously that they have toyed around with.   Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so this is not necessarily news, per se. But it is -- it is a different twist, to your point.

Immigration policy is a good proof of that. Also, it lacks credibility, because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike. It really, really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us. So it doesn't make any sense. People dismissed it.

It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of these efforts towards China.

They're trying to fulfill their oversight function here. And so I think we have a real collision that's not in any -- is not going to be sorted out in the near term.",

      "utterance": "All right, you have been listening to Sarah Sanders here. And it's safe to say the Washington press corps is more concerned with the immigration issue than a lot of folks losing their shirts today on this whole trade issue. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And you're watching \"Your World.\" And it could have worse. As I show you the Dow today down about 328 points, we had been down almost 500 points, and a lot of that over a building trade war and concerns this could get worse before it gets better, or that there are no signs of concessions on the part of any of the principal parties, namely the Chinese and ourselves. All of this on the same day that Harley-Davidson was indicating, because of these threat of tariffs, they're moving a lot of their operations outside the U.S. On a separate issue, General Motors has indicated that a lot of its Chevy Blazers will now be made in Mexico, not citing just the trade issue, but that it's not welcome noise here. So, again, this could have a lot been worse. There was some confusion early on in the markets as to whether the administration was also recommending that they were urging the Chinese and others not to invest in technology stocks at all. Then Peter Navarro ends up popping up on CNBC to say, no, no, no, no, no, they're not going to be, nor are there plans in the works for investment restrictions on China. And that brought us down to the levels we're at right now, about 328 points southward on what was a crazy day on the markets. We're going to be at this from all angles right now. Let's first go to Fox Business Network's Deirdre Bolton with how it all sorted out. Hey, Deirdre."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. You said it. It could have been much worse. So, the markets did close clearly lower, but certainly off the low points of the day. And, of course, the big headline, the Trump administration moving to block Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech firms and moving to block additional tech exports from the U.S. to China. Our sources are saying the Treasury Department is going to make an official announcement at the end of this week, bring us more clarity, more details on the plan. Now, the level of difficulty is, of course, much higher when you start to talk about blocking investment than when we're just engaging in tariff spats. So the stock market heading for the biggest one-day slide in months. That's how we finished up. You can see red across the screen. One area I really wanted to highlight are the techs, because S&P 500 tech companies get about 60 percent of their revenue from overseas. So that's the highest foreign exposure out of any of the index's 11 sectors. And, of course, critics of our current trade policy say that China has been stealing anywhere between $30 billion and $50 billion worth of intellectual property, hard data, every year for the past decade. But then there was even a stronger report, a more recent one that came out from the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property. It has a much higher number, stating that up to $600 billion in theft that has some projections baked in is possible. But experts say, bottom line, the motivation to want to level the playing field is completely understandable. What gets complicated is that so many American businesses are interconnected. So, for example, here's seven big tech American companies that source half of their products and components from China. So, HP, IBM, Dell, Cisco, Unisys, Microsoft, Intel. Even Apple has sold more iPhones in China in the last three years than in the U.S. And Apple gets about 20 percent of its annual revenue from China. Now, the Chinese president of course says China will punch back and will not be forced to eat the bitter fruit. That is a translation, a direct quote. But as the tension rises between the world's two biggest economies, of course, investors really showed their anxiety. So, we had the Nasdaq, you can see there, closely lower, essentially 2 percent, biggest one-day percentage decline since March. Third day down in a row. So, that's the longest losing streak for that tech-heavy comp in about two months' time. Even Asia overnight, you can see how markets reacted there. You can see Hong Kong's Hang Seng down by more than 1 percent. And, then, of course, even on our own bond market, right, there was this flight to safety in U.S. 10-year. Investors typically, of course, buy these bonds when they're fearful or they feel less certain of the future. And prices really went up, so, therefore, those yields went down, settling 2.875 percent. And just worth noting, these yields have fallen basically for the past four out of five weeks. So, Neil, what is clear is, investors really don't know what to make of it. We have the tariffs and now we have this idea of blocking direct investment, which is a much more muscular and, quite frankly, threatening move than tariffs, which really only apply to very specific products, Neil."

    {
      "speaker": "JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "They're getting a double whammy at Harley-Davidson, Neil, because the steel and aluminum tariffs hit their raw materials costs. And now the European Union, of course, imposing an addition 25 percent tariff on motorcycles made here and shipped to Europe. And so Harley is in a tough spot. That tariff went from 6 percent to 31 percent. And today, in a regulatory filing, Harley said that is going to add more than $2,000 a bike to the cost of a motorcycle made here in the U.S. and sold in Europe. And they can't possibly pass that along to consumers. So, in the short-term, they're going to have to eat it. In the long term, they're going to move production away from the U.S. Europe was an expanding market for Harley-Davidson. They love it over there. And U.S. sales have been down. You look at the first quarter of this year, U.S. sales of Harleys down double digits, as guys like me get older and maybe give up their motorcycles. In Europe, it had been growing by about 7 percent. And so those bikes, made in the U.S. and shipped to Europe, will be no more. Harley has four plants here in the U.S., York, Pennsylvania, Kansas City, Missouri, and two in their home state of Wisconsin, and now apparently bikes destined for Europe will not be made there anymore. Instead, they will be made in places like Brazil and elsewhere, Thailand and Australia. This is not, as you pointed out at the outset, what the president had intended. His trade policies designed to keep and create jobs here in the U.S. In this case, it appears they will be eliminating them -- Neil."

The administration, which I wish they would articulate what they're trying to do, because I understand, and I think most -- a lot of people do -- and it's the idea of curbing this ambition, the stated ambition by China to sort of be the world's tech leader in a short period of time. And one way to get there, perhaps the only way they can get their with their own timeline, is to continue to steal our intellectual property. So the idea is to restrict investments from companies where China has a 25 percent or more ownership. And, again, this was just speculation. It was in a few media outlets, the White House trying to take -- take it back a little bit. It's something obviously that they have toyed around with. Peter Navarro has talked about this kind of thing for maybe two decades, so this is not necessarily news, per se. But it is -- it is a different twist, to your point. It's not -- it's not the trade stuff anymore, as much as it is, hey, we want to take direct aim at your ambitions to usurp America's perch as the world's tech leader."

And then, later on, the treasury secretary, Mnuchin, came out to say, no, no, no, it wasn't singling out China, as if to say there's other players here, as if that eased the angst.

Immigration policy is a good proof of that. Also, it lacks credibility, because we all know -- I mean, this does -- this hurts us more than it hurts them, the fact that it's going to kill Apple or Nike. It really, really hurt them manufacturing their goods there that are sent to us. So it doesn't make any sense. People dismissed it. And I really think people are definitely blaming the China trade today. The bigger problem, though, it's really tech. We saw that breaking down last week. Leadership has been very thin in the stock market. Without five or six super cap techs in the S&P 500..."

It needs to make clear what it intends to do with all of these efforts towards China. Now, if the objective here is to exact the most amount of pain and pressure on China possible, they need to make sure that they're not injecting pain on American businesses. And that's a concern, especially when you look at really artificially diminishing the amount of capital that can come into this country. I worry about the impact on businesses.

Some read into that a sign that the Chinese are trying to find a middle ground here, where they can talk tough, but they don't have to respond in kind and invite a war. What do you see?"

What did that do? That dropped RMB by 1.5 percent in five days, 3.5 percent over the last month. So they're already ready. That is going to negate any kind of trade tariff that we are going to impose. And I think they know, at the end of the day, that there's so lack of clarity coming out of the White House, that they're just preparing for it. Also realizing that they have had a real soft patch of data coming in. So, perhaps Trump is trying to hit them while they're weak."

If a company, one after the other, like GM considering making all its Blazers now in Mexico, and, of course, we have been talking about a number of other companies that have been doing the same or considering preemptive move like Harley-Davidson, that has got to have a domestic economic impact.

Having said that, I think, ultimately, saner and cooler heads will prevail, and this will somehow get resolved. I hope this is not a negotiation ploy, because it's rather ham-fisted.

But that was the one that was out there for hours in the markets. They had to dial that back a little bit. But they're still looking at putting a limit to who can invest in technology. That's how it interpreted, hence, technology falls off a lot. So if this is more from just goods and services to, I don't know, even companies and stocks you invest in, then what?"

And I heard about the investment situation this morning. Then I saw Secretary Mnuchin's response. And so I'm completely unclear as to what is happening. And there we go again.

So there was this now new -- or renewed trust that President Trump must know what he's doing, there's a method to all of this. Do you subscribe to that, or is there now a reassessment, well, maybe not. Maybe this is a little impulsive. Maybe there's not a method to the madness. Maybe it's just madness."

I think it's so ham-fisted and so unpredictable that sometimes you create a fire out of a smoke bomb, and the next thing you know, you have got a real conflagration going, and you don't know how to put it out. And that -- I'm worried we're headed that way. Having said that, I will give him credit for again treading in these places that need to be addressed. I just think there's better ways to do it.

And if they can dehumanize the other side, that's what they want to do, because that justifies driving opposing thought from the public square. The thing that troubles me, Neil, about all of this, this kind of incitement to physical intimidation and bullying is not to be normalized. It's not normal for a constitutional republic.

What was your reason for handling the investigations the way you did? What was the reason for getting these wiretaps and for conducting the surveillance? Were you using an informant? Was it a spy, that sort of thing? And the fact is, DOJ is not in the business normally of turning over documents. And so I think, institutionally, there's a huge amount of reluctance to give Congress what it wants. But Congress is beating the drum. They're on the warpath.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLAUDE ARNOLD, FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I -- first of all, people don't understand the breadth of ICE's mission. Immigration enforcement is half of the mission. It has an entire component, homeland security investigations, that investigates all crime related to the border. It's the investigative arm for all of DHS. It's the second largest investigative entity in the U.S. government and it investigates a lot of things, drug smuggling, human trafficking and smuggling, child pornography, export of illegal technologies. It has a huge national security responsibility. It's the second largest representation on the Federal Joint Terrorism Task Force after the FBI. So to say you just need to get rid of ICE, I think people don't understand all that ICE does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, a lot of them were saying, right after these apprehensions, well, does it change and does their mission statement change given on the administration? It was this administration that, led by Jeff Sessions, said, we're going to enforce a policy where we can, yes, separate kids from their parents, something that wasn't done, at least not the same way exactly, in the Obama administration. So do you have to pivot depending on the administration?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARNOLD",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there was a pivot done on how enforcement was conducted during the Obama administration. And, really, it's just been a return to the status quo. But people have been -- they have developed a sense of entitlement that you can just come to the country illegally and expecting it's OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Oh, no, you're quite right. People forget how we were apprehending underage kids and then who were -- drugs deals and all. You're quite right about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARNOLD",
      "utterance": "Right. Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But who calls that? Do you answer then to whatever the presidential directive is or what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARNOLD",
      "utterance": "Yes, of course. You're part of the executive branch. ICE does what the president tells them to do through the executive chain of command. I mean, it's the executive branch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, if there were no ICE, to these people's interests, the protesters, who would handle this border stuff?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARNOLD",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the important thing here, Neil. What is going on is, the same people who want ICE abolished, they opposed there being any wall on the border. They oppose changing the loopholes that encourage and allow people to stay in the U.S. illegally. So, the last stand against those who make it in here illegally is ICE. So if you get rid of ICE, then you completely have open borders and no immigration enforcement. And that's by design. They want that to happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Amazing. All right, Claude Arnold, thank you very much, former ICE agent. He's put himself in a lot of harm's way over the years just to deal with that. People should remember that, no matter what your feelings on this particular issue. We will have more after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Thirty seconds away from that deadline. What is Rod Rosenstein going to do? Is he going to give the Republicans what they want? Tomorrow, we will get the read on all of this from Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte. He also was one of the fellows who came up with a plan to settle this immigration mess. His measure went nowhere, but that doesn't mean that immigration progress couldn't still come up somewhere. A one-on-one with probably one of the more powerful players on Capitol Hill tomorrow, Bob Goodlatte. We will see you then. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.
