But we had a funeral today in a church called Mary Help of Christians. And there's a beautiful image of Mary, the Pieta, where she holds the broken body of her son at the foot of the cross. And in that sense, I think, in the darkness of our grief, there's a light of faith that shows us that God is with us, sharing in our own sufferings and our own pain. This is the -- this is really the message of Lent that we just began on Wednesday, when these shootings took place.  And so we are called to have faith in the darkness of our grief today.",
