That's our top story tonight. I'm Dana Perino, in for Martha MacCallum. Today marks the day one of John Kelly's tenure as President Trump's Chief of Staff, and he was quick to make his presence felt. Within hours of being sworn in, we would learn that one of the administration's most colorful, controversial, and short-lived day without; removed from his position at Kelly's direction.  Anthony Scaramucci only joined the administration ten days ago. His selection prompted Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, to quit, forced the ouster of then-chief of staff Reince Priebus, and led to General Kelly's (INAUDIBLE), which in turn led to Scaramucci's demise. It's enough to make your head spin. This afternoon, Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, addressed the news.",

Except a couple of hours later, yes, a bit more chaos. Look at how quickly all this went down after General Kelly was sworn in as the new chief of staff, you can see Anthony Scaramucci was in the oval office, they're with President Trump and the new chief of staff in the back of the room. But by 7:00 a.m. when the president moved onto a cabinet meeting, Scaramucci was gone. In one fell swoop, this enables Kelly to establish order inside the White House, in a way that former Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, never did. Kelly, establishing a chain of command so that everyone, as you heard there, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, allegedly, will no longer be able to report just directly to the president. They'll have to go through the chief of staff. The White House, initially, putting out a statement saying that it was basically Scaramucci's choice that he wanted to have a clean slate for the new chief of staff. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders made clear that the president was not happy about Scaramucci's profanity-laced interview with the New Yorker Magazine last week. And she also made it clear that there was an expectation of -- with some that maybe Scaramucci would go back to his job at the export/import bank. But even that is murky now if you look at exactly how she phrased all this. Watch.",

My goal is to make sure that if you live in South Carolina, you get the same amount of money from the federal government as you would if you lived in California, with more flexibility that'll put Democrats in a box. It will make health care more accessible to you. If you don't like what's going on, you complain to your governor or your state house guy, rather than the bureaucrat in Washington.

West Virginia, under my approach, gets 43 percent more money than under Obamacare, with more flexibility. Montana, where a Democrat exists; there's 200 percent more.

Within hours of being sworn in, we would learn that one of the administration's most colorful, controversial, and short-lived day without; removed from his position at Kelly's direction. Anthony Scaramucci only joined the administration ten days ago. His selection prompted Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, to quit, forced the ouster of then-chief of staff Reince Priebus, and led to General Kelly's (INAUDIBLE), which in turn led to Scaramucci's demise.

Look at how quickly all this went down after General Kelly was sworn in as the new chief of staff, you can see Anthony Scaramucci was in the oval office, they're with President Trump and the new chief of staff in the back of the room. But by 7:00 a.m. when the president moved onto a cabinet meeting, Scaramucci was gone. In one fell swoop, this enables Kelly to establish order inside the White House, in a way that former Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, never did. Kelly, establishing a chain of command so that everyone, as you heard there, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, allegedly, will no longer be able to report just directly to the president. They'll have to go through the chief of staff. The White House, initially, putting out a statement saying that it was basically Scaramucci's choice that he wanted to have a clean slate for the new chief of staff. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders made clear that the president was not happy about Scaramucci's profanity-laced interview with the New Yorker Magazine last week. And she also made it clear that there was an expectation of -- with some that maybe Scaramucci would go back to his job at the export/import bank.

So, somebody like General Kelly who is the Four-star Marine, an amazing public servant, what would you advise him when he's looking at these big domestic policy issues and how to sort of shepherd that through the process to success for the president?"

That and single-payer health care, the government closest to the people is the best government. The health care closest to the people is the best health care. We had Republican Governors up and the White House today, we look to Washington to fix Obamacare, we should've looked to the governors. I'm excited about Gram (INAUDIBLE), which empowers governors or states under Obamacare to get 40 percent of the money -- New Yorker, California, Massachusetts, and Maryland. My goal is to make sure that if you live in South Carolina, you get the same amount of money from the federal government as you would if you lived in California, with more flexibility that'll put Democrats in a box. It will make health care more accessible to you. If you don't like what's going on, you complain to your governor or your state house guy, rather than the bureaucrat in Washington. I'm so excited about this. Mr. President, don't let us quit. Make us keep trying. I think we can pass this bill to block grant the money back to the states."

We took a really principled position on health care that we should send the money back home closest to the patients and had hearings and votes in the normal course of business that we could get this done. West Virginia, under my approach, gets 43 percent more money than under Obamacare, with more flexibility. Montana, where a Democrat exists; there's 200 percent more. So, the bottom line is: by 2026, we want to make sure that every state gets the same block-granting works. And Mr. President, you make sure that we tried this before we say that we failed.

But in the first budget of the Trump administration, when that money comes in, it will have that string attached to it now, so if the Supreme Court were to grant the government expedited review, the government will lose, that is why, that is why it is not asking for the expedite reviews, the best thing that the government can do is to adopt the Trumpet budget, which will have the string attached to it, the cities are so starved for cash, they will take the federal cash, and it just comply with the strings attached, and when they do take the money within agreement and I am calling a string, that they will cooperate with ICE, then the courts will force them to cooperate with the ICE, or discords the money that already received."

So there is a tremendous disconnect here, some of the Sanctuary City folks are a principled people that want to help decent immigrants that have overstayed their visa, but failing to communicate to the government when you have a potentially violent person on your hands is to show no respect for public safety and whatsoever."

Chris Stirewalt is Fox News politics editor, Josh Kraushaar, Politics Editor in National Journal and Jon Lieber is the head of Eurasia Group Practice, tracking U.S. politics and policy, Josh let me start with you, because you wrote about this internal document, they can't say that this is a fake full, this is their own research, basically telling them that they are in some deep do-do."

So tomorrow, I guess they could have a clean slate's that they say that they want."

He can make General Kelly double chief of staff, triple super-duper chief of staff, but if he doesn't abide by the rules that he set for himself, none of it will matter."

Deportation, and that is where we need to focus, I don't see Jeff Sessions of the Justice Department totally has our number as an immigrant advocate community, as a Senator, he was always tormenting us in any way that he could from Alabama, but if you are a member of the immigrant advocacy community tonight, why not consider a different word? Let's talk about the p-word for a minute, why are ICE agents allowed to walk the streets with police across their uniform? They are not police, they are immigration customs unit, so I think that for the dreamers, the immigrant advocates, everyone who is pushing and failing to succeed in terms of relief or get some relief for undocumented immigrants, we need to realign our focus towards the actual issue here, and that is ICE, it is not semantics, it is nothing academic, it is not what Silicon Valley wants to be in San Francisco like a discussion around the campfire, this is real."

The Latinos, the Hispanic community, appreciate that, I work with so many from that community in southern California, the idea that somehow they don't like ICE, they don't like law enforcement, it is their families that are being preyed upon, and they don't mind being called illegal aliens, a lot of them that I know are actually good people, it is a term that is being used for political expediency, to go after Trump, but it is a term that doesn't mean anything for the bigger picture."
