When you look at places -- even England, Jeremy Corbyn who is the head of the Labour Party, he's known for his anti-Semitic comments. It's routinely said in places like Hungary. There's many Jews who are attacked in France and fearful of wearing religious garb. And so, it's -- when you start to see this stuff creep in the United States, I think that's why people of the Jewish faith are so on guard because the holocaust happened when there was no state of Israel.

The spokesperson said \"We apologize to anyone who found this t-shirt distressing,\" as if distressed shirts are the problem. But as you know, once you apologize, you just egg on those who are bored. Another member of the press safety patrol tweeted to Bloomingdale's that \"Its apology wasn't sincere. Please try again.\" The tweet dripped as if 1,000 apologies could ever satisfy those who sniffed fear. So good job, Bloomingdale's. Today, one dummy and a storefront window is cold and topless, while another dummy scores its scalp. I can hardly wait to see where this is headed. I saw a mannequin in Soho wearing fishnet stockings.

Is this the first time that anyone in public office has ever been accused of something? And it seems like maybe it's because an election year. But it seems like that the party and leadership is sort of flailing. They're unsure what to do. And as we've said, there needs to be due process. There needs to be an investigation. But what is shocking to me is that there's nothing -- no standards in place for this.

He had witnesses that poke holes in the accuser's story. He had everything locked down.

But unfortunately, Democrats in Virginia are in the kind of pickle you're rarely see in politics even in these crazy times because Justin Fairfax is book ended by two men who are involved in photo racism scandals. Mark Herring will be just as guilty if Ralph Northam has to step aside because of his blackface passed because Mark Herring arguably has done, essentially, the same thing. So it's impossible for one of them to leave and the other to stay, and that leaves Fairfax who could be in real legal jeopardy here, and then the state flips over to a Republican governor.

There was collusion. There was Stormy. Where is Stormy? Trump was insane, Trump was unstable. Trump was a Russian agent. And you have the Kavanaugh was a gang rapist. This Christmas list of scandals all went away and what are we left with?

I want to take them at their word, certainly by seeing that video that did not seem very contrite. This is not her first apology. This is actually, at least, her second apology that she's had to make for anti-Semitic remarks. So there seems to be a pattern here. I'm hoping that she can get coached and that she can, you know, actually be more contrite. But based on the public reaction, I actually think we saw more contrition from Governor Northam and what he's been through than her remarks. So we'll see if this happens again. She'll be watching closely. But the best point you bring up is that how unsafe it is in many parts of the world to practice Judaism today. When you look at places -- even England, Jeremy Corbyn who is the head of the Labour Party, he's known for his anti-Semitic comments. It's routinely said in places like Hungary. There's many Jews who are attacked in France and fearful of wearing religious garb. And so, it's -- when you start to see this stuff creep in the United States, I think that's why people of the Jewish faith are so on guard because the holocaust happened when there was no state of Israel. This isn't about Israel. This is about anywhere around the world you can be attacked for being Jewish and we have to be careful."

The spokesperson said \"We apologize to anyone who found this t-shirt distressing,\" as if distressed shirts are the problem. But as you know, once you apologize, you just egg on those who are bored. Another member of the press safety patrol tweeted to Bloomingdale's that \"Its apology wasn't sincere. Please try again.\" The tweet dripped as if 1,000 apologies could ever satisfy those who sniffed fear. So good job, Bloomingdale's. Today, one dummy and a storefront window is cold and topless, while another dummy scores its scalp. I can hardly wait to see where this is headed. I saw a mannequin in Soho wearing fishnet stockings.

According to police, they received an anonymous call about a tiger that was found in an abandoned house. The callers admitted that they went to this abandoned house to smoke some marijuana and they thought they were hallucinating - it was some bad weed I guess - when they stumbled upon this large cat. Police say it was a 350-pound female tiger, well fed, living in an unlocked rinky dinky cage secured by nylon strap and screwdriver at the top of the cage."
