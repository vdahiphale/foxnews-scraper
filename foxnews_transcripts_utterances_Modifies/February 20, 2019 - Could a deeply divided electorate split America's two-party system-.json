Thomas wrote in a concurring statement on a libel case yesterday that the ruling made in the mid-60s which claimed that people who were in the public eye, then, had fewer rights when it came to libel laws may need some revisiting.  Here is what he said, \"We did not begin meddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified. The states are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm.\" So is the door opening here for the president to fight back against what he calls fake news?   Joining me now, Shannon Bream, chief political correspondent, and anchor of \"Fox News @ Night\". Shannon, great to have you with us. Thank you for being here tonight. You saw the president in that sound bite from a while back. He has always claimed that he needs to have a better retaliation mechanism for what he calls fake news. What do you think?",

People are critics of the president that in some way, the ability of public figures to be able to sue people who go after them should actually be rethought in the way that we understand Supreme Court law now. You know this case back in the 1960s. Sullivan v. New York Times was all about that idea of setting a higher standard. So, now after that ruling, if you're a public figure and someone comes after you, you should normally be able to use states libel laws, slander laws, those kinds of things.  But now, you as the public figure have a burden of showing there was actual malice by the person, by the entity that brought these charges or wrote the story about you, and Justice Thomas is saying, listen, as you quoted there, I think the states need to be able to figure out this -- you know, whole idea for themselves. We don't need to use the Constitution to do something it doesn't say.

In this circumstance, Nick Sandman did not do anything, and he didn't know that there was any public controversy.

Let's not forget he in this letter that he now allegedly sent or made himself had the brothers make had a death threat in it with a gun pointed at a man with the noose that said MAGA according to this guy. He then went on national television and accused anybody who questioned his story of racism. And this is the problem. The left has used identity politics for decades to divide and conquer in this country. When he throw in a via narrative that assumes that anybody you know, who accuses a MAG supporter of any kind of wrongdoing, that person is guilty, that only adds fuel to the fire. And the truth is that journalists in this country at the highest levels in this case, they didn't always use alleged. They in fact smeared the entire country and said this is -- this is America in 2019. This is the situation.  Journalists should not be assigning innocence or blame based on gender and skin color. They should be assigning it based on the facts.

The Trump administration announced yesterday that it wants California to return $2.5 billion that the state has already spent on the project. And the Transportation Department says it's canceling a nearly billion-dollar grand for the bullet train, because, quote, \"the new proposal represents a significant retreat from the states initial vision and commitment and frustrates the purpose for which the federal funding was awarded.\" But Governor Newsom believes this is payback for his opposition to the president's immigration policies. In a statement he says \"It's no coincidence that the administration's threat comes 24 hours after California led 16 states and challenging the president's farcical national emergency. The president even tied the two issues together in a tweet this morning. This is clear political retribution by President Trump and we won't sit idly by. This is California's money and we're going to fight for it.\"  Now the tweet he's referring to from President Trump is this one. It says \"The failed fast train project in California with a cost overruns are becoming world record setting is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall.\" Now the estimated cost for the bullet train is now approaching $77 billion.

Quoting, \"Hundreds of athletes who have change gender by declaration and limited hormone treatment have already achieved honors as women. They were -- that were beyond their capabilities as men.\" And the op-ed was really just Martina Navratilova doubling down because back in December she tweeted, quote, \"There must be some standards and having a penis and competing as a woman would not fit that standard.\" That drew the ire of Rachel McKinnon, the first trans-athlete to win a world title in track cycling who called Navratilova transphobic, quoting, \"She trades on age-old stereotypes and stigma against trans women treating us as man just pretending to be real women.\" Martha? Currently, the International Olympic Committee rules said that trans men are allowed to compete without restriction, trans women have to show their testosterone is below a certain level, but Navratilova argues that lowering hormone levels doesn't solve the problem of men being naturally bigger and stronger. The trans rights group Trans Actual says, quote, \"If trans woman had an advantage in sport why aren't more trans women winning gold medals left, right, and center? Because trans women don't have an advantage. Navratilova says she can stand up for herself, but worries that labeling every critic transphobic will bully some people into silence and submission.

Here is what he said, \"We did not begin meddling in this area until 1964, nearly 175 years after the First Amendment was ratified. The states are perfectly capable of striking an acceptable balance between encouraging robust public discourse and providing a meaningful remedy for reputational harm.\" So is the door opening here for the president to fight back against what he calls fake news? Joining me now, Shannon Bream, chief political correspondent, and anchor of \"Fox News @ Night\". Shannon, great to have you with us. Thank you for being here tonight.

People are critics of the president that in some way, the ability of public figures to be able to sue people who go after them should actually be rethought in the way that we understand Supreme Court law now. You know this case back in the 1960s. Sullivan v. New York Times was all about that idea of setting a higher standard. So, now after that ruling, if you're a public figure and someone comes after you, you should normally be able to use states libel laws, slander laws, those kinds of things. But now, you as the public figure have a burden of showing there was actual malice by the person, by the entity that brought these charges or wrote the story about you, and Justice Thomas is saying, listen, as you quoted there, I think the states need to be able to figure out this -- you know, whole idea for themselves. We don't need to use the Constitution to do something it doesn't say.

This came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. He said that he was disparaged by something that had been published in the New York Times. It was a really tough time in the country and there were a lot of competing interests. But that was expanded beyond that to include public figures and as you said, a lot of people can become public figures without ever intending to. And so, then, did they lose the ability to go after people who have come after them. And as that definition has expanded, a lot of people have said it is time to redefine it, to talk about -- you know, the fact that it's one thing if you're the president of the United States, it's another thing if you're a high school kid on a trip to D.C."

New York Times, maybe it's time to put together that case and bring it. But right now, he does appear to be the only one current member of the court that's kind of signaling, it's time to do this."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes, there's some major differences, Martha. You're perfectly right to point that out because we didn't have Twitter or Facebook, the Internet, any of the things that we know, you know, look to people where they do become overnight sensations in a good or a bad way in a matter of seconds. But one thing we did have going on in the 1960s was that really pitched battle over civil rights and the movement where the country was deeply divided and in a lot of pain over that. And that's -- you know, a lot of people think what motivated most of this ruling because the court thought it was so important to have very vigorous public debates. And that people should be able to go after government officials without fear of retribution. So, some real changes put some underlying themes that -- you know, we're dealing with today still."

In this circumstance, Nick Sandman did not do anything, and he didn't know that there was any public controversy.

And when I see people like the Washington Post, you know, ignore the facts and destroy a young man's life in the way that they have done to Nicholas Sandman. As a parent, I feel passionate. And then, just as an attorney, I feel passionate because I heard the introduction and I think the status of the law today is needs to be changed so that a person like Nick, so that a Twitter mob cannot attack him. It needs to be changed so that when an organization like the Washington Post, decides to write an article without doing any investigation and breaching every journalistic standard out there, that they can be held accountable. And I'm confident that we are going to prevail on this argument. And so, I'm very passionate about the law as well."

I mean, if you just look at the fact that he's 16 years old, he's -- probably has another 70 years of life or more on this planet, and everything he does, every day for the rest of his life is going to be affected. Nick is also a very intelligent person who could do very well and will do very well in school. But every job interview that he -- that he goes on, he's going to show up on the Internet and they're going to say, \"Oh, Nick Sandman, I'm not sure if my clients or my customers would want to talk to Nick.\" So this is going to follow him around his entire life.

Now, as you rolled that security video of the brothers, we can tell you that they originally came off of different security video, that grainy security video. They were sought after as persons of interest, at one point called potential suspects by police and now it looks like they're going to be key witnesses in the case against Jussie Smollett. Police are at least reporting saying, that they never cooked a deal with them but the Osundairo brothers have become cooperative witnesses with the prosecution laying out what we've heard through leaks anyway is their version that they were paid to rehearse and ultimately staged this attack on January the 29th. So we have heard that the testimony has wrapped up with the -- with the grand jury. And watching someone walk by, that is Gloria Schmidt. She is an attorney for -- Gloria, could you come here for a moment? That's Gloria Schmidt who's an attorney for the brothers. Come here real quick while we're online.

People are criticizing individuals in left-leaning media spaces because they feel folks jumped on this too much. I did some research before I came here today and basically, everyone from reporters to anchors always contextualize it with the word \"alleged,\" \"alleged assault,\" \"alleged victim.\" Now there were pundits and there were opinion taters who took a decisive stance, but as far as reporters and anchors, and journalists, they kept it correct."

Let's not forget he in this letter that he now allegedly sent or made himself had the brothers make had a death threat in it with a gun pointed at a man with the noose that said MAGA according to this guy. He then went on national television and accused anybody who questioned his story of racism. And this is the problem. The left has used identity politics for decades to divide and conquer in this country. When he throw in a via narrative that assumes that anybody you know, who accuses a MAG supporter of any kind of wrongdoing, that person is guilty, that only adds fuel to the fire. And the truth is that journalists in this country at the highest levels in this case, they didn't always use alleged. They in fact smeared the entire country and said this is -- this is America in 2019. This is the situation. Journalists should not be assigning innocence or blame based on gender and skin color. They should be assigning it based on the facts. And the issue here is not necessarily believing his initial story as a victim when it came forward, it was painting all MAGA Trump supporters as racist as they have done since Donald Trump took office in 2016."

I would challenge your guest to find one journalist or anchor who actually said or took out the word alleged victim or alleged individual from this case. I think what Jussie Smollett has done actually creates a level of insecurity as it relates to believability and that's the real argument here. The conversation about politics is really a buck conversation. We're talking about a guy who may have and I believe he did lie about being victimized and there are real actual victims of assault every single day. Now, you look at those victims with the side eye because of this guy. If he did this he should have a criminal impact and I predict that grand jury is going to come back with a true bill. He's got to have an arrest warrant tonight or tomorrow."

And he thought, I guess, you know, I mean we'll see what he thought, but it appears that he was trying to you know, build himself up in some way through this process at the sacrifice of other people who may have been in need of the law enforcement in Chicago and also at the sacrifice of those who support President being marred by it and you know by suggestion. I just want to point out that -- here's a fox a statement from Fox today because a lot of this was suggested that perhaps he was going to lose his spot or his spot was going to be diminished on his series Empire which was one of the reports that had come out of some of the local reporters in Chicago. They say he continues to be a consummate professional on set and we have previously stated he will -- he is not being written off the show. Mark Geragos is supposedly representing him. I don't know if he's still going to, Rashad. He, of course, is known for representing folks like Michael Jackson, and Scott Peterson is also on that list. He's had a lot of high-profile clients. I don't know if he's still going to stand by him now that he is some the subject of the investigation. Your thoughts."

Once again, this comes down to a guy whose credibility is shot to hell at the moment and I think he will have an arrest warrant put out for him. Once again, a guy trying to feed a narrative and that's what's really dangerous here, feed a narrative that was politicized from day one. I'm saying let's go above and beyond the politics of this. Look at Jussie Smollett as an individual who did something really, really horrible and that there are real victims who deserve our passion, compassion, and they deserve justice."

The Trump administration announced yesterday that it wants California to return $2.5 billion that the state has already spent on the project. And the Transportation Department says it's canceling a nearly billion-dollar grand for the bullet train, because, quote, \"the new proposal represents a significant retreat from the states initial vision and commitment and frustrates the purpose for which the federal funding was awarded.\" But Governor Newsom believes this is payback for his opposition to the president's immigration policies. In a statement he says \"It's no coincidence that the administration's threat comes 24 hours after California led 16 states and challenging the president's farcical national emergency. The president even tied the two issues together in a tweet this morning. This is clear political retribution by President Trump and we won't sit idly by. This is California's money and we're going to fight for it.\" Now the tweet he's referring to from President Trump is this one. It says \"The failed fast train project in California with a cost overruns are becoming world record setting is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed wall.\" Now the estimated cost for the bullet train is now approaching $77 billion.

But that doesn't mean that the administration can politicize the issue divide people and yank the money back. In fact, it was allocated by Congress and now the scale has been contracted and there's a hard date of December 2022, by which the project has to meet certain standards. I don't see this winning in the court. This is one of 46 legal options between the president and California. Let me make a bigger point. We can do better than this. We can even get stupid stuff done right now. We need a national, not just to California, a national infrastructure strategy, bold vision, killer execution and go back to the roots.

And, but, President Trump has a solid base of support and now he's expanding that base. So, as he gives more of these speeches, as he speaks out on policy, as people see that his policies are working his job approval goes up. And that's the key to winning reelection because the Democrats will have a free-for-all. I mean, Bernie Sanders right now is we had him in our polls, he was at 16 percent (Inaudible) with a 25 percent."

But it's a derangement contest, the most deranged anti-Trump voter is the one who is likely to come out of that field. So, Bernie being a socialist. I mean, President Trump his best in the speech, he said America is not a socialist country. And when he said the majority of Americans suggest they agree with him. Bernie Sanders announced today that he's running as a socialist in the Democrat Party."

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. The group Athlete Ally, a nonprofit that supports transgender athletes is now cutting ties with Martina Navratilova. The organization has removed her from its advisory board and as a company ambassador. Navratilova who came out in 1981, wrote an op-ed in the Sunday Times criticizing transgender women who compete in women's sports. Quoting, \"Hundreds of athletes who have change gender by declaration and limited hormone treatment have already achieved honors as women. They were -- that were beyond their capabilities as men.\" And the op-ed was really just Martina Navratilova doubling down because back in December she tweeted, quote, \"There must be some standards and having a penis and competing as a woman would not fit that standard.\" That drew the ire of Rachel McKinnon, the first trans-athlete to win a world title in track cycling who called Navratilova transphobic, quoting, \"She trades on age-old stereotypes and stigma against trans women treating us as man just pretending to be real women.\" Martha? Currently, the International Olympic Committee rules said that trans men are allowed to compete without restriction, trans women have to show their testosterone is below a certain level, but Navratilova argues that lowering hormone levels doesn't solve the problem of men being naturally bigger and stronger. The trans rights group Trans Actual says, quote, \"If trans woman had an advantage in sport why aren't more trans women winning gold medals left, right, and center? Because trans women don't have an advantage. Navratilova says she can stand up for herself, but worries that labeling every critic transphobic will bully some people into silence and submission. Martha."

Tonight, we can tell you, just moments ago, Cook County State's Attorney's Office has now approved charges against Jussie Smollet for disorderly conduct this evening. This in a case that a number of politicians called a modern-day lynching. He claimed that on his way home late one evening in the freezing cold in Chicago someone had put a rope around his neck that they had thrown bleach on him, that they were yelling racist and homophomic -- homophobic slurs at him and that they said this is MAGA country. Let's bring in Charlie Hurt for reaction. We are going to have Charlie Hurt to talk Virginia politics tonight. But this breaking news changes the story this evening. Charlie, what's your reaction to this so far?"

You know, when you first started to kind of hear this a couple days ago that this might have been what was the directions going in it just, you can't believe that somebody would do something like. And it highlights something that we've seen increasingly I feel like, especially in the last couple of years where this desire to politicize crime it's so dangerous. And until America gets one thing straight, and that is that crime is not political. Crime is crime. And if you commit a crime you're going to be persecuted and prosecuted for the fullest extent of the law. And we don't care about the politics. And it's enforcing the law. Until we remind ourselves that that's what the law is about then we're not going to achieve equal justice under law. And it's these politicians they are the worse at it. They take an event like this and they try to politicize it. They try to turn it into a weapon that they can use on the political stage where it does not belong. And the sad, tragic result of it is that because politicians do this sort of thing. It encourages what appears to be very sad, pathetic people to stage things like this."

Well, it's interesting too, and the note I got I just got from Ahern (Ph) is that he was -- this was an indictment that he was charged. So, you are going to get a legal mind who went to law school not from the journalism school to tell you why they would go to the grand jury and then just go straight ahead and charge him. I'm trying to figure that out right now. But other than that, obviously a very exciting day and a very embarrassing day for Jussie Smollett who according to police account now staged his own attack."

Good points that you make on the language that we've seen on this so far when we -- you know, there is also the issue of the letter, which is unresolved in terms of who put that letter together and whether or not it came from the two brothers, or whether it came from him. Those are all open questions that we will see as we go through the process in the story. But Judge Napolitano when we spoke about this the other night said that that could -- that could constitute mail fraud. So, I mean, there's obviously issues in terms of what is going to be ultimately charged here. And Mike, you understand --"

And what we have heard and this where you start getting all the anonymous police sources. What we have heard to the anonymous police sources that are among the items taken from the brother's house was a magazine with letters cut from it. So that would match up, so that would be a pretty easy forensic piece of work to do to match the letter to the magazine."
