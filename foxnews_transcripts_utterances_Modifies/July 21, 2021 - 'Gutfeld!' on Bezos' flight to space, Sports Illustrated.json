      "sentences": "What's so funny? All right. So, you remember these Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue? It's the one that had as much to do with sports as I do. I was more of a Better Homes and Gardens kind of guy. I wasn't the best at landing a free throw, but damn I could landscape a backyard in more ways than one, Chadwick. I bring up that old magazine because like Hunter Biden it's now trying hard to change. For their 2021 swimsuit edition, they featured three stars on the cover, a tennis pro, Naomi Osaka, a rapper Megan Thee Stallion, and trans activist, Leyna Bloom. The magazine has ticked more boxes than a meth head doing his SATs. But damn, that's going to confuse the 90-year-olds who's still subscribed to the ones legendary magazine. But it's perfect for it's designed his outrage theater for the right and noble approval seeking from the left and both work hand in hand to help Sports Illustrated prop up their brand like the corpse in Weekend at Bernie's. But because the desperation for relevance is so obvious, the consumers shrugs. People know a participation trophy when they see one. While their peers in the media plot their enlightened editorial perspective, the average guy and gal rolls their eyes, their disbelieving eyes. It's happening everywhere sports, politics, life in general, everything's woke. It's no longer about reality. It's the perception of inclusion and exclusion that changes the definition of reality, and any resistance is seen as bigoted, hateful, and reactionary. Now, I get the tennis pro, but like the equipment she uses, the rest of this wokism is a racket. Thank you. Hence, the connection between trans activism and Sports Illustrated, especially when the magazine ignores the elephant in the room, which is the impact of male to female trans athletes on female sports. The trans model cover protects them. But it's a fair question, would she had been on the cover if she wasn't trans? But asking that question is like asking why a sports magazine cover would have swimsuits in the first place. I never understood this. I like to keep my general interests in me looking at half naked women separates. I mean, imagine if Popular Mechanics had a swimsuit issue. I mean, I wouldn't mind. I have a thing for plumbers and their ballcocks. That can -- that controls the flow of water in a toilet tank, people. Thank you. But thanks to the trans cover, the SI staff looks woke as opposed to a bunch of dirty old drooling editors. And it gets activists off your back really easily. It's like a shop owner spray painting, BLM, we're with you, on the plywood protecting their window. If you're woke and the Twitter mob might let you survive, otherwise, they'll talk to you like a statue of Abe Lincoln. The women's magazines got this early on putting plus size models on their covers. They did this because they knew for decades, your obsession with rail thin mannequins led to eating disorders. All the editors are still obsessed over being thin, but now they use heavier models as a shameless stab at enlightenment. Obesity has its own health risks, but bring that up, shame on you for fat shaming. It's not about the needs of the readers or viewers, anyway. The media is the only industry that holds barely disguised contempt for their customers. They're no different than Chinese fentanyl producers, cell phone companies, and any government employee that is supposed to help you. It's now about creating a virtue signaling stew to placate terrified advertisers. Sports Illustrated is just one example of an effort to blend in, in order to escape the wrath. Victoria's Secret drop their iconic angels calling them unattainable, which is the whole point of supermodels. They aren't supposed to be attainable like you and me or else they would be unattainable. It's the truth symbol of inequality. The real discrimination in life is between levels of physical appeal, not race. But that was the point of the Angels, right? They were quite literally out of this world, but now we want women grounded in real life Victoria's Secret says. So, who are their new models? Well, not models, it's their brand ambassadors and they are our soccer player Megan Rapinoe, transgender model, Valentina Sampaio, and plus-size model, Paloma Elsesser, among a few others. So, is that grounded in real life? Maybe I have no idea. I'm a stone-cold super freak. Try me. And I love being grounded in real life. But if you mean it, they just skip the Teddy's and sell sweatpants. Don't sell the extent expensive lingerie that's grounded in reality. If I want that, I'll rummage through Kilmeade's office. Stuff he has is disgusting. Don't forget, once the woke police take over every aspect of what we consume, there's no telling where it'll stop. You can almost picture it.",

      "utterance": "What's so funny? All right. So, you remember these Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue? It's the one that had as much to do with sports as I do. I was more of a Better Homes and Gardens kind of guy. I wasn't the best at landing a free throw, but damn I could landscape a backyard in more ways than one, Chadwick. I bring up that old magazine because like Hunter Biden it's now trying hard to change. For their 2021 swimsuit edition, they featured three stars on the cover, a tennis pro, Naomi Osaka, a rapper Megan Thee Stallion, and trans activist, Leyna Bloom. The magazine has ticked more boxes than a meth head doing his SATs. But damn, that's going to confuse the 90-year-olds who's still subscribed to the ones legendary magazine. But it's perfect for it's designed his outrage theater for the right and noble approval seeking from the left and both work hand in hand to help Sports Illustrated prop up their brand like the corpse in Weekend at Bernie's. But because the desperation for relevance is so obvious, the consumers shrugs. People know a participation trophy when they see one. While their peers in the media plot their enlightened editorial perspective, the average guy and gal rolls their eyes, their disbelieving eyes. It's happening everywhere sports, politics, life in general, everything's woke. It's no longer about reality. It's the perception of inclusion and exclusion that changes the definition of reality, and any resistance is seen as bigoted, hateful, and reactionary. Now, I get the tennis pro, but like the equipment she uses, the rest of this wokism is a racket. Thank you. Hence, the connection between trans activism and Sports Illustrated, especially when the magazine ignores the elephant in the room, which is the impact of male to female trans athletes on female sports. The trans model cover protects them. But it's a fair question, would she had been on the cover if she wasn't trans? But asking that question is like asking why a sports magazine cover would have swimsuits in the first place. I never understood this. I like to keep my general interests in me looking at half naked women separates. I mean, imagine if Popular Mechanics had a swimsuit issue. I mean, I wouldn't mind. I have a thing for plumbers and their ballcocks. That can -- that controls the flow of water in a toilet tank, people. Thank you. But thanks to the trans cover, the SI staff looks woke as opposed to a bunch of dirty old drooling editors. And it gets activists off your back really easily. It's like a shop owner spray painting, BLM, we're with you, on the plywood protecting their window. If you're woke and the Twitter mob might let you survive, otherwise, they'll talk to you like a statue of Abe Lincoln. The women's magazines got this early on putting plus size models on their covers. They did this because they knew for decades, your obsession with rail thin mannequins led to eating disorders. All the editors are still obsessed over being thin, but now they use heavier models as a shameless stab at enlightenment. Obesity has its own health risks, but bring that up, shame on you for fat shaming. It's not about the needs of the readers or viewers, anyway. The media is the only industry that holds barely disguised contempt for their customers. They're no different than Chinese fentanyl producers, cell phone companies, and any government employee that is supposed to help you. It's now about creating a virtue signaling stew to placate terrified advertisers. Sports Illustrated is just one example of an effort to blend in, in order to escape the wrath. Victoria's Secret drop their iconic angels calling them unattainable, which is the whole point of supermodels. They aren't supposed to be attainable like you and me or else they would be unattainable. It's the truth symbol of inequality. The real discrimination in life is between levels of physical appeal, not race. But that was the point of the Angels, right? They were quite literally out of this world, but now we want women grounded in real life Victoria's Secret says. So, who are their new models? Well, not models, it's their brand ambassadors and they are our soccer player Megan Rapinoe, transgender model, Valentina Sampaio, and plus-size model, Paloma Elsesser, among a few others. So, is that grounded in real life? Maybe I have no idea. I'm a stone-cold super freak. Try me. And I love being grounded in real life. But if you mean it, they just skip the Teddy's and sell sweatpants. Don't sell the extent expensive lingerie that's grounded in reality. If I want that, I'll rummage through Kilmeade's office. Stuff he has is disgusting. Don't forget, once the woke police take over every aspect of what we consume, there's no telling where it'll stop. You can almost picture it."

I think your point about this playing into the woke Gods essentially to prevent there being the culture mob coming out of them is totally true. I mean, think about it, there are three covers here. They want to make sure all the boxes are checked. And so, the transgender point, Leyna is not an athlete, but there are in fact, a million transgender athletes out there.

But when I saw that, I totally, I totally cried, and hearing and seeing Wally Fung story the, the elderly woman and at 82, at age 21, she competed with all the guys for mercury seven. This was you know, a million years ago. She beat all of them. But because of her gender, she wasn't an astronaut, and she still was a trailblazer her whole life. And then I just feel like it -- she now is accomplishing what she wanted to do, her true dream. It's never too late. It's not too late. And seeing her excitement was really, it was really inspirational and I felt like they did a good homage to history, like they brought up a piece of canvas from the Wright flyer, an Amelia Earhart's goggles, and I feel like they were, they were really honoring history.

Yes, I love a good poop joke. Restaurant locations across the country are reportedly running out of beef and chicken and other staples which raises the question, who wants to eat staples? Am I right? But Taco Bell is not alone. You might remember back in May, it was major drama at Chick-Fil-A when they dealt with a dipping sauce shortage of its own. So, there you have it shortages at Chick-Fil-A and now at Taco Bell. If we had had a third example, we would have led the show with the story. It's a little joke about the media because I always need three things. Why am I telling you this? But it tells you a basic truth about life. You don't need a silver fork to eat good food.
