Remember, we got this 45-day window for that to happen, which the president was optimistic about today, that we could avoid any problems. He certainly hopes so. I am talking about the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Kevin Brady.  I like to say about the chairman the hardest-working guy when it came to these tax cuts. You can thank him, because long before anybody else was putting this together, he was putting this doing it alone.  He joins us right now.  Chairman, are you worried about these tariffs? Because if you think about it, the higher resulting costs in some items if they come to fruition could wipe away whatever benefits you see from these tax cuts.",

Every president has known this, but ever president faces same dilemma. How do you -- how do you stop China's cheating without punishing Americans while you do it? He's taken the issue on. And I think one of the smarter things that the president is doing here is giving that 30 to 45 days to assess some of those potential tariffs to let industries suggest alternatives, better ways to tackle this.  I think it also buys time to actually have that dialogue with China about how do you start addressing the stealing of intellectual property, the forcing American technology transfer to China. And are there ways, cooperative ways, to lower that trade deficit.   So I think that the announcement also triggers an awfully important part of time for the dialogue to happen.",
