And Adam Schiff claims that he only got it like this week. And you had Alyssa Fonic who sits on the same committee in the House saying yesterday not only should he not be making stuff up, but today pointing out that -- how long did he have this complaint and why didn't he share it with the committee, because they were only given two hours to look at the complaint. So, obviously, it's political. And, you know, Democrats are doing this to set up the president. The reason why Bill Barr is mentioned in the complaint is, obviously, tactical to try to take him out so he cannot defend the president, just like Jeff Sessions could not defend the president against the Russia probe. And it's very tactical in what was said and what was laid out. And the question for Republicans, you know, there's a lot of fodder for them here, too, the dozens -- half a dozen U.S. officials that are named in the complaint.  Well, who are those people? Can they bring them up and say why didn't you file a whistleblower report if this was that important? And also, who's behind the writing of the complaint?

I mean, if they had released the complaint that the intelligence committee in the Senate and the House received without the transcript, people would believe the complaint over the transcript. So, you release the transcript and hope that people can look at it and know exactly what was said. But the timing here now comes into question because the complaint is dated August 12th, 2019. And Adam Schiff claims that he only got it like this week. And you had Alyssa Fonic who sits on the same committee in the House saying yesterday not only should he not be making stuff up, but today pointing out that -- how long did he have this complaint and why didn't he share it with the committee, because they were only given two hours to look at the complaint. So, obviously, it's political. And, you know, Democrats are doing this to set up the president. The reason why Bill Barr is mentioned in the complaint is, obviously, tactical to try to take him out so he cannot defend the president, just like Jeff Sessions could not defend the president against the Russia probe. And it's very tactical in what was said and what was laid out. And the question for Republicans, you know, there's a lot of fodder for them here, too, the dozens -- half a dozen U.S. officials that are named in the complaint. Well, who are those people? Can they bring them up and say why didn't you file a whistleblower report if this was that important? And also, who's behind the writing of the complaint? This is not just an email that someone sent as a, hey, I have information, I need to meet with you. It's very clearly written by a lawyer, or a team of lawyers, and possibly a research team."
