Breaking tonight, we've got two very big stories for you. Both of them are related to China. Hunter Biden is indeed under investigation by the DOJ and top Federal Prosecutor in Delaware. The son of the incoming President is now set to be investigated by his Father's own Justice Department, Senator John Kennedy standing by on that. Also Lisa Boothe and Deroy Murdoch ready to way in. Also this evening, what are the facts around this story? The relationship between California Congressman Eric Swalwell a member of the House Intelligence Committee and an accused Chinese spy. The young woman who goes by Christine Fang or Fang-Fang as she was known in the United States, specifically, what did Nancy Pelosi know about this investigation? It all happened under her roof as speaker of the house. The spy reportedly closed it up to Swalwell and at one point he even raised money for his campaign. So here is what we do know. She entered the United States as a college student back in 2011. She spent 4 years getting close to several United States officials. She had affairs with at least two of them in an effort to get United States Intelligence.",

He must know something the rest of us don't know. And in fact, that has become a habit from a lot of people. They will go around saying, while, there are things you don't know that we can't tell you but it's bad. So a lot of stuff was going on. It was very unfair on the President. I think hindsight we see that it was all not true. And so I think you can't go around behaving that way and expect you're going to enjoy the benefit of the doubt. There are legitimate questions. I'm not accusing anyone of anything. It is perhaps exactly the way he says and I hope he takes up your invitation to come out and explain it. But the broader question here is there are a lot of legitimate questions that I think are important to answer. Just as a member of congress at his constituents.

So they used the defensive briefing for investigative purposes. We know that now. We didn't know that then. So obviously that is a practice that the FBI I hope has corrected. And the broader issue of the Chinese espionage issue is a huge issue. This is exactly what they do. They do recruit Mayors. They do go down and try to get close to two students per activist, but also through people and business and others. They try to get close to local leaders. They play the long game and this is a prototype of exactly the kind of efforts they try to carry out. They get to know you when you are a city councilman and hopes that one day you might be a U.S. Senator a Member of Congress and Member of the Cabinet and in a position to help them. At a minimum because you have a pro-China view of things, pro-China narrative in your head, but also potentially because you have compromising information on you that they can use to get you to vote or support initiatives that they want.

This is obviously one of the most important diplomatic relationships that are on that list of countries that you deal with. And you know, one of the other famous ambassadors to China was President George H. W. Bush, who by that point had been shot down in World War II over the Pacific and earned a metal for his valor in that situation. He had been a member of congress. He had been an ambassador to the United Nations. And he went to become the Head of the CIA. It is Pete Buttigieg qualified for that role?",

It doesn't mean he's not qualified to be an ambassador to some way, I just personally believe that you are dealing with the second largest economy in the world. It is the second most powerful military in the world and near-peer competitor of the United States. The country with whom the relationship we have will define the rest of the 21st century. I think it's important that we send someone to that post that has some depth of understanding about all of the issues related to that country and our relationship with them.

In a statement, Hunter Biden says \"I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately including with the benefit of professional tax advisors\". His father's presidential transition team says \"President-Elect Biden is deeply proud of his son who has fought through difficult challenges including the vicious personal attacks of recent months only to emerge stronger. The U.S. Attorney's office in Delaware says it refuses to comment on an ongoing investigation. The source familiar with the matter tells Fox News the investigation into Hunter began in 2018. http://Foxnews.com, Brooke Singman reports a source saying the investigation was predicated in part by a suspicious activity report from transactions in China and other foreign nations. She also reports the two sources familiar with the investigation say this inquiry regards looking into the laptop that was connected to Hunter Biden. Fox News first reported in October that the FBI subpoenaed a laptop and hard drive connected to Hunter with a money laundering investigation in late 2019. President Trump spent months on the campaign trail criticizing Hunter Biden as he pursued international business ventures while his father was Vice President. Hunter Biden served on the Board of the Ukrainian in Energy Company, Burisma and sought a joint business venture in China. The investigation into Hunter could very likely be ongoing when his father is President of the United States.

This case is always troubled me, not because of alleged money laundering or any of that. I don't know about that. I don't know what the facts are. But we do know this. President Obama put Vice President Biden in charge of the foreign affairs of two whole countries, China and Ukraine. And that's a fact. It's also a fact that in both cases, his son, Hunter Biden walked away with tens of millions of dollars of contracts from connected people in those two countries.

I want to ask you about something else because we are getting very close to these vaccines rolling out. Today, 3,000 Americans died of a record, terrible record that we recognize and we pray for all of them today. Joe Biden is selecting Xavier Becerra to be the Head of HHS. He will stop in at a time when this issue is going to still be in crisis mode. What are your thoughts on his selections?",

He supports single payer government run health insurance, which means 190 million Americans if he could implement it would lose their on-the-job employer provided health insurance. But also, and especially his position on abortion, you know, it is - it's one thing to believe, as many Americans do, that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion.

That is called sex-selected abortion. When Mr. Becerra was Attorney General he pressured catholic hospitals to perform abortions. He clearly favors tax payer funded abortions.

Deroy let me start with you. Joe Biden and Xavier Becerra differ on a lot of things. They differ on Medicare for all, which Becerra is clearly a proponent of and that would have to be passed through Congress. Going into the teas before, we played Joe Biden botching his last name. And we didn't do that just because to make fun or to say oh, he messed up. I think a lot of Presidents, when you are dealing with all of the staff members and new people.

It obviously gives his opponent something to discuss rather than whatever Biden is trying to present. I agree, this is not a centrist choice. This is not a moderate choice. This isn't the kind of choice that is going to bring us together or unify the country. It's going to divide the country and split the country. And I heard Senator Kennedy earlier say that a lot of people are religious and that's why they feel the way they do about abortion. I'm not a religious person but I do believe that if a woman has an abortion, it's a child, it is a human being that has been killed. And frankly, if you are a crisis, crisis pregnancy center, it is not appropriate for the government to tell you that you need to advertise abortion any more than I would expect the people from the Democratic National Committee to be forced to run ads and wide tax cuts are great idea. So, there is a real first amendment problem there. There is a freedom of expression problem there. And a choice like this is not the kind of choice that brings Americans together.

So, Becerra as part of the COVID-19 team, he's joined by Dr. Fauci, by Dr. Murthy, Dr. Nunez, and these individuals will lead the effort on how we tackle COVID-19 and how we deal with a broken health care system. And the reason why I say our healthcare system is broken is because here's what we know. We know that our healthcare system cannot handle one percent of the American population being sick. One percent of our population being sick and our healthcare system is completely overrun. So, you are going to need to reimagine how we do healthcare in this country. Which means you need somebody who understands how Capitol Hill works. One thing that this, that Xavier Becerra understands is how Capitol Hill works. He understands how to get bills passed. He spends a lot of time there. He knows how to work through the courts. And so he provides a valuable asset to the team of folks that will be dealing with COVID-19, the aftermath of this pandemic and how you move the country forward, or as Joe Biden put it, how you build back better and how do you build a better healthcare system that works for all Americans.

The Media Research Center did a study of 1,750 Biden voters in seven swing states and found that 45 percent had no idea about the Hunter Biden scandal and 9.4 percent would have abandoned Biden for Trump had they have known, which would have changed the outcome of the election, which I still have questions about.

And if we don't do that, if we, you know, aggregate that responsibility, we disenfranchise millions of voters, including voters in Missouri, including voters in Texas and other places. And so, the Constitution is very clear, the elector's clause specifically grants to state legislatures the ability to designate time, place, and manner of those elections, right? Nobody else. Just the legislature. So, essentially the claim here is that the laws were very clear in these states. And I'll use Pennsylvania as an example. Pennsylvania said we are going to expand mail-in voting. But an important safeguard is that all ballots are counted on election day. Well, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said well, we don't actually believe that. You can count them three days after.

Breaking tonight, we've got two very big stories for you. Both of them are related to China. Hunter Biden is indeed under investigation by the DOJ and top Federal Prosecutor in Delaware. The son of the incoming President is now set to be investigated by his Father's own Justice Department, Senator John Kennedy standing by on that. Also Lisa Boothe and Deroy Murdoch ready to way in. Also this evening, what are the facts around this story? The relationship between California Congressman Eric Swalwell a member of the House Intelligence Committee and an accused Chinese spy. The young woman who goes by Christine Fang or Fang-Fang as she was known in the United States, specifically, what did Nancy Pelosi know about this investigation? It all happened under her roof as speaker of the house. The spy reportedly closed it up to Swalwell and at one point he even raised money for his campaign. So here is what we do know. She entered the United States as a college student back in 2011. She spent 4 years getting close to several United States officials. She had affairs with at least two of them in an effort to get United States Intelligence."

But he as a member of the Intelligence Committee was going around telling people the President was an agent of a foreign government and obviously when people hear that from someone who was on the Intelligence Committee, they think he must know something. He must know something the rest of us don't know. And in fact, that has become a habit from a lot of people. They will go around saying, while, there are things you don't know that we can't tell you but it's bad. So a lot of stuff was going on. It was very unfair on the President. I think hindsight we see that it was all not true. And so I think you can't go around behaving that way and expect you're going to enjoy the benefit of the doubt. There are legitimate questions. I'm not accusing anyone of anything. It is perhaps exactly the way he says and I hope he takes up your invitation to come out and explain it. But the broader question here is there are a lot of legitimate questions that I think are important to answer. Just as a member of congress at his constituents. But in the house if he wants to continue to serve in this important role, and I'm not saying that he doesn't have good answers. I don't know. But there is a tremendous amount of irony, obviously."

The other thing that really strikes me is the defensive briefing that he was given as soon as they figured out that she was trying to get information out of him, they went right to him and let him know. And President Trump was not afforded that information. He was basically treated as a target during the course of the investigation to his campaign. Why is the treatment so different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously there are different time periods, different agents probably, uncertainty those briefings and in fact, we know that as part of the President's briefing there were people at that defensive briefing after get become President-Elect who were there simply to observe him to see how he reacted as he was totally sort of, things. So they used the defensive briefing for investigative purposes. We know that now. We didn't know that then. So obviously that is a practice that the FBI I hope has corrected. And the broader issue of the Chinese espionage issue is a huge issue. This is exactly what they do. They do recruit Mayors. They do go down and try to get close to two students per activist, but also through people and business and others. They try to get close to local leaders. They play the long game and this is a prototype of exactly the kind of efforts they try to carry out. They get to know you when you are a city councilman and hopes that one day you might be a U.S. Senator a Member of Congress and Member of the Cabinet and in a position to help them. At a minimum because you have a pro-China view of things, pro-China narrative in your head, but also potentially because you have compromising information on you that they can use to get you to vote or support initiatives that they want. It's very troubling. And I know that this isolated to this one story unfortunately."

There is suggestion that the Former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, is on the shortlist to potentially becoming the ambassador to China. This is obviously one of the most important diplomatic relationships that are on that list of countries that you deal with. And you know, one of the other famous ambassadors to China was President George H. W. Bush, who by that point had been shot down in World War II over the Pacific and earned a metal for his valor in that situation. He had been a member of congress. He had been an ambassador to the United Nations. And he went to become the Head of the CIA. It is Pete Buttigieg qualified for that role?"

      "utterance": "No, he's not. Look the - and it's - no disrespect towards the Mayor of the City, but frankly, he just doesn't have the breadth and depth of experience interacting with China, in fact his only experience to China as to my understanding is he worked at McKinsey, the consulting group that actually has this China related issues in regards to them and some of the companies things they have supported. It doesn't mean he's not qualified to be an ambassador to some way, I just personally believe that you are dealing with the second largest economy in the world. It is the second most powerful military in the world and near-peer competitor of the United States. The country with whom the relationship we have will define the rest of the 21st century. I think it's important that we send someone to that post that has some depth of understanding about all of the issues related to that country and our relationship with them. And again, with all due respect to Former Mayor South Bend, Indiana, I just don't think that's what gets you ready for it."

First things first, what is your reaction to the Eric Swalwell story? He was obviously a very outspoken critic of what he saw as a deep and tangled web of Russia collusion within the Trump campaign. He talked about it all the time."

It was outrageous and irresponsible the way that he conducted himself in the attacks that he made against President Trump. But knowing what we know now, it is even more absurd and ridiculous that he was so willing to do that when he had his own situation. And I certainly think it deserves to be tapped into and looked into deeper.

Either the United States or China will lead in the 21st century. They are our number one national security threats and our biggest economic competitor. President Trump was right to hold a hard line against them. He was the first politician in decades to stand up, stop appeasing China, and say enough is enough. Joe Biden has proved he is weak on that and now we find out information that he started your show with that Hunter Biden is being investigated in his dealings with China by the Justice Department, which I think also proves to be very problematic."

With regard to your travels and your work on those trips to China, to North Korea, which are obviously very linked and your thoughts on the person who should be the ambassador to China, it was Jon Huntsman during the Trump administration, the Former Governor of Utah, who had a lot of excessive international experience as well, what about Pete Buttigieg in that role?"

Who has had no interactions that I am aware of at a high level with Chinese officials or you know, shown and or demonstrated a great depth of knowledge. I think the President was right to put people in those roles that had a large understanding they had relationships and understood what they were going into. Again, Donald Trump was the first person in decades to stand up and fight back and hold a hard line against China. We have to make sure that that continues. Donald Trump has been right in that. We are at a great crossroads in how we deal with China and it needs to be very, very aggressive in making sure that America continues to be the leader in this coming century."

You know talk about the pressures of that, how all of that gets figured out in the beginning of the administration."

I think we will see how all of those things unfold and make sure that any fraud that exists, make sure that they route that out and get to the bottom of everything, every legal vote is counted. And when that process is fully completed, then I think we can lean into those decisions. Certainly, I think he has a right to put whoever he wants in place at the correct time and we will see what happens.

Joe Biden's son Hunter is under Federal Investigation into money laundering and tax violations that look into and make inquiries about his business dealings in China and in other countries while his father was the Vice President under Barack Obama. So all of this is going to be investigated now by what will be most likely for all intensive purposes January 20th.

      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. And Hunter Biden is under investigation. He says the U.S. Attorney office in Delaware informed his lawyers yesterday that they are looking into his tax affairs. In a statement, Hunter Biden says \"I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately including with the benefit of professional tax advisors\". His father's presidential transition team says \"President-Elect Biden is deeply proud of his son who has fought through difficult challenges including the vicious personal attacks of recent months only to emerge stronger. The U.S. Attorney's office in Delaware says it refuses to comment on an ongoing investigation. The source familiar with the matter tells Fox News the investigation into Hunter began in 2018. http://Foxnews.com, Brooke Singman reports a source saying the investigation was predicated in part by a suspicious activity report from transactions in China and other foreign nations. She also reports the two sources familiar with the investigation say this inquiry regards looking into the laptop that was connected to Hunter Biden. Fox News first reported in October that the FBI subpoenaed a laptop and hard drive connected to Hunter with a money laundering investigation in late 2019. President Trump spent months on the campaign trail criticizing Hunter Biden as he pursued international business ventures while his father was Vice President. Hunter Biden served on the Board of the Ukrainian in Energy Company, Burisma and sought a joint business venture in China. The investigation into Hunter could very likely be ongoing when his father is President of the United States. The President-Elect has previously said that the Justice Department would remain independent under his administration. Martha."

Look, just because you are accused of something doesn't mean you did it. But this is serious. I would describe it but its grave and in part because of the allegations, if you will, or money laundering and tax fraud but also because the Biden campaign disclosed it. I think if this were much ado about nothing, they wanted have felt the need to say something. And I think at this juncture, both Mr. Biden's are going to have to offer a full disclosure to the American people. This case is always troubled me, not because of alleged money laundering or any of that. I don't know about that. I don't know what the facts are. But we do know this. President Obama put Vice President Biden in charge of the foreign affairs of two whole countries, China and Ukraine. And that's a fact. It's also a fact that in both cases, his son, Hunter Biden walked away with tens of millions of dollars of contracts from connected people in those two countries. And they are at the very least, there was an appearance that America's foreign policy could be bought. And that has always bothered me as much as anything else. I think this issue or this new disclosure rather is going to raise the issue again of how and why many major news organizations and social media platforms tried to tap down \"The New York Post\" story about the laptop and the things on it."

It's clearly a story for exactly the reasons that you state and that's why we looked into it extensively at the time and we continue to cover it. It's about the President, the future President of the United States' son and it is now going to be a DOJ investigation under him. This is not about a family member who robbed the cornerstone that is not related to geopolitical events. In this case, there is a very good reason to take a close look at it and as you say, innocent until proven guilty. But it's obviously a story, obviously something we need to dig into. I want to ask you about something else because we are getting very close to these vaccines rolling out. Today, 3,000 Americans died of a record, terrible record that we recognize and we pray for all of them today. Joe Biden is selecting Xavier Becerra to be the Head of HHS. He will stop in at a time when this issue is going to still be in crisis mode. What are your thoughts on his selections?"

You have to be pretty insipid not to see that he is going to be controversial. He doesn't have a background in health care, number one. Number two. He supports single payer government run health insurance, which means 190 million Americans if he could implement it would lose their on-the-job employer provided health insurance. But also, and especially his position on abortion, you know, it is - it's one thing to believe, as many Americans do, that a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. But it's quite another to encourage abortion, to be an abortion enthusiast."

That is called sex-selected abortion. When Mr. Becerra was Attorney General he pressured catholic hospitals to perform abortions. He clearly favors tax payer funded abortions. When he was Attorney General Mr. Becerra pressured pro-life pregnancy crisis centers to actually advertise abortions. Now, I'm going to listen to Mr. Becerra's confirmation hearings and I am going to have an open mind. But as I say, you would have to be pretty insipid not to see that the allegation against him is going to be not just that he supports a woman's right to choose, that he is an abortion enthusiast.

All are Fox News Contributor welcome to all of you. Good to have you here tonight. So, let's start there and go backward with Becerra and then I want to talk to all about Hunter Biden. Deroy let me start with you. Joe Biden and Xavier Becerra differ on a lot of things. They differ on Medicare for all, which Becerra is clearly a proponent of and that would have to be passed through Congress. Going into the teas before, we played Joe Biden botching his last name. And we didn't do that just because to make fun or to say oh, he messed up. I think a lot of Presidents, when you are dealing with all of the staff members and new people. But this is something has been around for a long time. Which raises the question, how well does he understand? How well does he know this person? How well does he understand Xavier Becerra and what he stands for what he's is all about?"

You know, Beccaria (Ph), not very smooth and you think he would sit there if you didn't know the name, you'd rehearse it a few times or something like that. It obviously gives his opponent something to discuss rather than whatever Biden is trying to present. I agree, this is not a centrist choice. This is not a moderate choice. This isn't the kind of choice that is going to bring us together or unify the country. It's going to divide the country and split the country. And I heard Senator Kennedy earlier say that a lot of people are religious and that's why they feel the way they do about abortion. I'm not a religious person but I do believe that if a woman has an abortion, it's a child, it is a human being that has been killed. And frankly, if you are a crisis, crisis pregnancy center, it is not appropriate for the government to tell you that you need to advertise abortion any more than I would expect the people from the Democratic National Committee to be forced to run ads and wide tax cuts are great idea. So, there is a real first amendment problem there. There is a freedom of expression problem there. And a choice like this is not the kind of choice that brings Americans together. It's the kind of choice that splits Americans apart."

But with regard to the, you know, bringing people together, and the sort of, there were a lot of people out there when we went across the country that said, you know, I think things will just calm down if Joe Biden is elected. It won't be so chaotic. Is that what is reflected in a pick like this?"

      "speaker": "RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

Teams of individuals that will handle this issue. So, Becerra as part of the COVID-19 team, he's joined by Dr. Fauci, by Dr. Murthy, Dr. Nunez, and these individuals will lead the effort on how we tackle COVID-19 and how we deal with a broken health care system. And the reason why I say our healthcare system is broken is because here's what we know. We know that our healthcare system cannot handle one percent of the American population being sick. One percent of our population being sick and our healthcare system is completely overrun. So, you are going to need to reimagine how we do healthcare in this country. Which means you need somebody who understands how Capitol Hill works. One thing that this, that Xavier Becerra understands is how Capitol Hill works. He understands how to get bills passed. He spends a lot of time there. He knows how to work through the courts. And so he provides a valuable asset to the team of folks that will be dealing with COVID-19, the aftermath of this pandemic and how you move the country forward, or as Joe Biden put it, how you build back better and how do you build a better healthcare system that works for all Americans. And so, he's going to be part of this team that includes with medical professionals, that includes --"

So, it's a blackeye for the media, as well as big tech that suppress it. And that did have a profound impact on the election. The Media Research Center did a study of 1,750 Biden voters in seven swing states and found that 45 percent had no idea about the Hunter Biden scandal and 9.4 percent would have abandoned Biden for Trump had they have known, which would have changed the outcome of the election, which I still have questions about. But point being is that it was ignored and it was intentionally ignored because most of the media knew that it would impact the electorate against Joe Biden.

I think it's very important now as you sort of see that the vice president or the president- elect, rather, excuse me, has not picked an attorney general which this will sort of fall into their purview. And when you have somebody like Merrick Garland on the short list who is currently on the district court of appeals, a person who you know is going to come in with a clear mind, who will not be persuaded by politics and will actually look at this and what the laws are, and knowing that the president-elect has also said that the Justice Department has the role as an independent arbiter that this case will play its course out. Abd if it results in Hunter Biden being found guilty, then so be it. And I think Joe Biden is very clear on this that the Justice Department will be independent and it will do its job without interference from the White House.

But a Chicago teachers union is disputing the science and they are digging in their heels on a plan that was set in motion for the kids to begin going back in January. The union Twitter account tweeted and then deleted, quote, \"the push to reopen schools is rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny.\" But a flood of evidence in a new study shows that sadly it is black and Latino students who are suffering the most from not being in their classrooms every day. Quote, \"students of color could be 6 to 12 months behind compared with 4 to 8 months for white students while all students are suffering, those who came into the pandemic with the fewest academic opportunities are on track to exit with the greatest learning loss. It's been called a generational learning loss that would devastate an entire generation over time.\" Joining me now, Robby Soave, associate editor at Reason. Robby, great to have you back on the show tonight. So, what kick to this tweet into motion was that the Chicago school system was laying out their plan. They said that on January 11th, the kindergarteners would go back and the kids with moderate to severe special education needs would go back after January 11th and then K through 8 were going to return their return hybrid model on February the 1st. And basically, they filed an injunction, the teachers union, saying that they thought that this was arbitrary and they were manipulating the statistics to justify their decision. They really don't want to go back, Robby. ROBBY SOAVE, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, REASON Yet, teachers unions everywhere have pulled out all the stops to prevent schools from reopening. In my own city of D.C., I believe they dumped fake body bags in front of the district official's headquarters."

But here, what is so interesting is the effects of keeping schools closed are so obviously sexist and racist. You talked about the harm to underprivileged disproportionately minority students. It's also true that, I think according to studies 800,000 women have had to drop out of the workforce to take care of their kids while they are not at school. So, you can't say the people who want schools to reopen are guilty of these things. It's exactly the reverse."

I mean, it seems, you really just have to ask the question, why are they so averse to getting back to the classroom when you've had several studies in Lancet, the Journal of American Medical Association, you've got the three top officials that we just heard from, all saying that they have had very minimal transmissions by students in school. Now, if there is a teacher who has a very clear medical problem, there is no doubt in my mind that there can be some kind of compromise worked out to work from home. But you know, it -- one of the things that has been brought up by Randi Weingarten a lot when I spoke with her, is we just don't have the money. The money is not in place to prepare these schools. Eight hundred billion dollars of the original, of the original CARES Act still hasn't been spent, Robby. What is at the root of this?"

Is that what you feel is the strongest argument here? And explain to everybody how you feel, what you think."

      "speaker": "SCHMITT",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I think today as you mentioned, Missouri along with 16 other states joined the fight for election integrity. And that's really what this is about. Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of this republic. And it's important that every legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is not counted. And if we don't do that, if we, you know, aggregate that responsibility, we disenfranchise millions of voters, including voters in Missouri, including voters in Texas and other places. And so, the Constitution is very clear, the elector's clause specifically grants to state legislatures the ability to designate time, place, and manner of those elections, right? Nobody else. Just the legislature. So, essentially the claim here is that the laws were very clear in these states. And I'll use Pennsylvania as an example. Pennsylvania said we are going to expand mail-in voting. But an important safeguard is that all ballots are counted on election day. Well, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said well, we don't actually believe that. You can count them three days after. Even if they're not postmarked on election day, we'll assume they were cast or mailed on election day. That's not what the legislature designate. In places like in Wisconsin, they allowed --"

Why didn't they hear it if it was such a good case?"

      "speaker": "SCHMITT",
      "utterance": "Well, this is a little different theory. This is essentially that under the constitutionality of the elector's clause which designate the state legislatures to make those laws, the courts changed it. Another example that cited here is in Milwaukee, for example. In Democrat counties, they change, they ignore the law and allowed voters in those Democratic counties to sure the ballots. They were open before election day. They weren't supposed to be able to do that. In Wayne County in Michigan. They just forgot about it and ignored the signature requirement. What we know is, look, this is a bipartisan issue. The Carter-Baker Commission from 20 years ago said mail-in balloting create the most opportunity for fraud --"

I know you feel that the runway is very short. But when you do hear about this complex between the state legislature, which is supposed to have governance over how elections are run in each state being overridden by courts that are largely elected in these states, it does feel like it raises constitutional questions."

    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "These are not frivolous concerns. And certainly, they are important going forward. We do know that there were illegal orders given. We do know that there were votes negated. We do know that there were votes not counted. But this is unlikely to succeed because of the relief that is being sought. This is sometimes called the Hail Mary filing. It doesn't quite capture it. This is not Aaron Rodgers throwing a touchdown from midfield in Lambeau. This is Aaron Rodgers throwing a touchdown from midfield in Dallas for a score in Wisconsin. I mean, this is a feat that would be very difficult to achieve. It hasn't been achieved in the past. And part of the problem is this sticker shock, that they are asking for relief that would effectively negate the certification of millions of votes. And that has not succeeded. And you were right to note about the Pennsylvania case. There was not a single dissenting vote. In order to accept the case like this you are going to need five justices. So, you could lose Chief Justice Roberts but you got to bring along all five of the other conservative justices. Not one of them filled a dissent when the Pennsylvania case was dismissed."

What we do know is that there is an investigation going forward, that's not that much of a surprise because the laptop was subpoenaed. They don't just do that for recreational purposes. And on the laptop were some really disturbing e-mails. And as a lawyer, you look at it and there was an informality, a fluidity to these business deals that were being discussed. Millions of dollars involving Hunter Biden, his uncle and references to Joe Biden. There were gifts like a diamond that came from China. All of these things tend to worry you as an attorney, because there is so much of this in play. And it is easy to violate laws including tax laws.
