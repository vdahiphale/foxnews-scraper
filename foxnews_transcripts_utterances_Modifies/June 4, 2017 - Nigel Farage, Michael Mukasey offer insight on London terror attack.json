Many streets in central London right now still cordoned off this morning where at least seven people have been killed, dozens others hurt in last night's rampage. It started with a van running down pedestrians on London Bridge followed by a knife attack -- several knife attacks in a nearby restaurant district. The three attackers shot and killed by police eight minutes later. And new this morning, we're learning that 12 people have now been arrested in Eastern London in connection with this attack.

As you mentioned, a white van was moving at a fast rate of speed south across London Bridge, it plowed into pedestrians then it moved on to a nearby area where the attackers then exited the vehicle and went on a stabbing spree.

So London is very quiet this morning. There are fewer people out of the street that I would normally expect to see on a Sunday. I mean, generally, generally, people do in this city and don't forget we have the threat of IRA terrorism you know, long before this. People generally do respond incredibly well despite the horrors that have taken place but I do detect there is one slight change of attitude and that is that every time one of these things happen, you know, our leaders showed their regret, their sorrow, their astonishment and their shock and I think we're a little bit less shocked than we used to be. We're kind of getting used to this, which is very, very bad news indeed and I people are beginning to say what are our leaders actually going to do? Just expressing sorrow, just talking and using words like solidarity simply isn't enough. And Maria, I make this prediction. You know, Teresa May have spoken -- Theresa May have spoken outside the steps of Number 10 today and she's actually used the phrase, Islamic terrorism. Now, that in itself may well be a first because many of our politicians have been in denial as indeed Hillary was on this point. But unless people see some really concrete action is going to be taken, then I think the calls for interning thousands of suspects will grow louder and louder.",

And I also want to hear, which I have a bit of from the Prime Minister that we do want to try if we possibly can to stop some of this stuff being there, you know, freely available on the internet. I mean, that is an absolute minimum. But what really angers people is I mean, for example, is you know, two or three years ago, you know, I was part of the campaign that said, if anybody left this country and forth in Syria for ISIS, they should be stopped from getting back into Britain. And you know something, 400 people have returned to Britain having been radicalized further and brutalized in Syria. 400 have been let back in and only one has been stopped.

My question would be, \"Why would you show any tolerance for Islamic extremism?\" Tolerance of evil is a crime and, so I think they need to view this much more toughly than they have been so far. For our part in the Congress, we do have a President that's taken a different approach, both in terms of being forward pressing against ISIS abroad but also concerned about our borders here at home. And I would say one thing we can do in the congress is to understand that terrorism is a big problem but it's part of a larger problem of this ideology of militant Islam, and that's nurtured by groups like the Muslim brotherhood, and we've been working in Congress to try to designate them as a terrorist organization because I think that would really go to solving the root of this problem, which is at its heart in ideological problem.",

Many streets in central London right now still cordoned off this morning where at least seven people have been killed, dozens others hurt in last night's rampage. It started with a van running down pedestrians on London Bridge followed by a knife attack -- several knife attacks in a nearby restaurant district. The three attackers shot and killed by police eight minutes later. And new this morning, we're learning that 12 people have now been arrested in Eastern London in connection with this attack.

In that eight minutes, seven people were killed at least 48 people were wounded and the three attackers themselves were killed by police. It all happened not far from where I am now standing and as you can see over my shoulder, the street here is still closed off. The scene last night here was indeed very different. As you mentioned, a white van was moving at a fast rate of speed south across London Bridge, it plowed into pedestrians then it moved on to a nearby area where the attackers then exited the vehicle and went on a stabbing spree. What authorities say now is that the attackers have not yet been publicly identified but the survivors say they will never forget what they saw."

    {
      "speaker": "FARAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's jumpy in one way because I've been in London all morning and there are a lot of police cars around, a lot of police on the streets, quite a lot of sirens and I guess we now know there've been a lot of raids in East London and at least a dozen people have been detained. So London is very quiet this morning. There are fewer people out of the street that I would normally expect to see on a Sunday. I mean, generally, generally, people do in this city and don't forget we have the threat of IRA terrorism you know, long before this. People generally do respond incredibly well despite the horrors that have taken place but I do detect there is one slight change of attitude and that is that every time one of these things happen, you know, our leaders showed their regret, their sorrow, their astonishment and their shock and I think we're a little bit less shocked than we used to be. We're kind of getting used to this, which is very, very bad news indeed and I people are beginning to say what are our leaders actually going to do? Just expressing sorrow, just talking and using words like solidarity simply isn't enough. And Maria, I make this prediction. You know, Teresa May have spoken -- Theresa May have spoken outside the steps of Number 10 today and she's actually used the phrase, Islamic terrorism. Now, that in itself may well be a first because many of our politicians have been in denial as indeed Hillary was on this point. But unless people see some really concrete action is going to be taken, then I think the calls for interning thousands of suspects will grow louder and louder."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

What kind of concrete action do you want to see Nigel, because you think about the fact we had the Westminster Bridge attack in March followed up by the Ariana Grande attack last week, the concert, now this? Three attacks in three months. What concrete action do you want to see that we are not seeing coming out of the U.K.?"

I want to hear that in the Mosques in this country, we will actually be unafraid to kick out of this country people who go in there and preach hate because frankly, we've been too politically correct to do any of that. And I also want to hear, which I have a bit of from the Prime Minister that we do want to try if we possibly can to stop some of this stuff being there, you know, freely available on the internet. I mean, that is an absolute minimum. But what really angers people is I mean, for example, is you know, two or three years ago, you know, I was part of the campaign that said, if anybody left this country and forth in Syria for ISIS, they should be stopped from getting back into Britain. And you know something, 400 people have returned to Britain having been radicalized further and brutalized in Syria. 400 have been let back in and only one has been stopped. And that's why Maria I say, we don't want words. We don't just think the Prime Minister outside Number 10 Downing Street saying enough is enough. We want her to actually do something."

      "utterance": "No, because her competitor which is Mr. Corbyn at least the Socialist Party - Labor Party that he himself is a very, very, you know, quite a hard less socialist. Corbyn himself is -- seem to be weak on terrorism and weak on terror. So just because Theresa May was home Secretary Charge of our Homeland Security for six years, you know, some may say she failed and didn't do enough, but it's very difficult to see the Labor Party, the socialists gaining any benefit from it. Many of these people and these incidents have proven that sometimes the attackers have been on watch lists. There are tens of thousands of people on watch lists in the U.K., even more so when the U.S. What do we need to do to get ahead of this knowing that we are already watching these perpetrators that are going on to commit real damage?"

I can't say anything else we can do -- now we could -- we could take a 3,500 who were genuinely suspected terrorists themselves as opposed to being linked and associated.

The sister of the guy who blew himself up at Manchester tweeted out a message congratulating him on entering -- on entering paradise. Now, that's not a crime, but what it does show is that he had a support system that there are many people in this community who agree with him.

There are three people whose records are under subpoena, John Brennan, former Director of the CIA, Susan Rice, former National Security Adviser and Samantha Power.

We secure that scene, you go through it and process it looking for DNA, forensics, bomb making, any possible link to the individuals involved in anyone who may have helped him or provided logistical support. You get -- you coordinate responses together and you start running down tips and leads at the same time. While you're doing that, you got to deploy a large number of highly visible officers throughout the entire city so that you can get on with the day-to-day operations of the city at the same time focus on investigation that requires intense resources."

      "speaker": "LINSKEY",

I remember when I was a chief of Boston, at one time we get three separate terrorist plots that are going on. So they might've been ongoing investigations that they've decided to move on now. That they have enough information to go forward. So they're definitely people that are engaged in terrorist activities may be associated with last night or maybe individual plots. The authorities are rounding up those individuals that they think can cause harm. And the rundown whoever's associated whether it's computer linked, forensics data, and signals monitoring as far as who they were talking to in the U.K. or outside U.K. and figure out what brought them together, how they were radicalized and whether they were supported."

I mean, we have tens of thousands of people right now on a watch list in the U.K. They're almost 30,000 people. Tell us how the best route to get ahead of this if you are already on the watch list. How is it possible that you're able to carry out this kind of attack?"

The number of people who are potentially talking about and thinking about and indicate they may want to cause harm clearly outwhelmes law enforcement resources. That's true in the U.K., it's true in Boston. To truly surveil somebody for 24 hours a day, it takes 40, 50, 60 individuals with electronic surveillance and other activities. It's a - it's a daunting task and we have to engage the public on the front end to start reporting these individuals when they see radical activity when they're talking about doing these things. We had it with the Boston police captain whose son, unfortunately, have mental health issues and started talking about doing Jihadist activities. The captain was brave enough to go to the FBI authorities and say I think you should be looking at my son and as a result, a school bombing and shooting attack was thwarted because of the courage of that father. We need other fathers, other mothers, aunts, uncles, religious community members to step up when individuals are indicating that they no longer be - want to be in polite society and that they intend to harm people."

I was with Michael Mukasey, former Attorney General here and you know, there are groups of people whether be in the U.K., in France, that are not just assimilating with the west and they are following their Sharia Law and the leaders are allowing it. What do you want to see done? I mean, when you look at the fact that even under the Obama administration, we weren't even allowed to look at people's social media account. It was just wrong, it was targeting people. If we looked at what they were saying on social media, of course, have we done that, we would've seen that they were putting out hate."

We need concentric circles of security, the first line of security obviously is our military forces. They need to go where if there are people who are telling us that they intend to harm us, our military forces need to go outside and in that other ring and deal with that threat. Then we need inner circles of security as we come into the United States and we need policies and procedures that are consistent with keeping people safe. But at the same time, we do want to make sure balancing the freedom and ability to have the lives the way they are here, the one thing we don't want to do with was throw the baby out with the bathwater where we go to a one side completely extreme and when you start taking away the rights that we've fight so valiantly for here.

When Theresa May made the comment today about we need to have some embarrassing conversations, what's embarrassing is that they've had open borders for so long, and now they act like they're shocked that people had come in through the open doors and windows and are killing them. You know, if you keep getting hurt by mosquito bites, at some point, you decide to start killing mosquitoes. And what happens across this world is that we recognize that when we are being destroyed and devoured by the mosquitoes, by this evil, at some point you have to just attack it head-on and quit dancing around the fact that it is Islamic terror carried out by religious fanatics."

    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I think it's going to be a real confusing time for the Brits because they're going to be looking. Jeremy Corbyn is certainly not one who has been overtly ready to start closing the borders and being more strict about who comes in, and Theresa May hasn't. So, you know, the sad thing is they don't have a really clear choice in this. We did have a choice last November in America, and we made the choice. And that's why Donald Trump, one of the reasons, for sure, that Donald Trump was elected. Maria, at some point, you know, we can pretend that this is not real. And I watched the mayor this morning, and he came out in his statements saying we're one of the safest places in the world. Go tell that to the parents of teenage girls who were having to identify their daughter in the morgue with a toe tag. I'm sorry, but, you know, that isn't working for the people who are now afraid for their kids to go to a ball game or a concert, or just to be walking about the streets with their friends for fear of something that is a random, yet targeted attack on the totally innocent victims that we're seeing in these terrorist attacks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think you made a great point. I did see Sadiq Khan's comments, the Mayor of London there, and they -- you know, they really coincide with the comment from Prime Minister Theresa May who says, the attack on the London Bridge shows that there is far too much tolerance of Islamist extremism in Britain today. Do you think that suggests things will change in the coming weeks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "I don't know if the politicians are capable of making change. They live behind locked doors surrounded by armed guards. They're carefully protected. But the average citizen is not, and they seem to be the living in these bubbles, and they'll make statements after a terrorist attack. But then, there's still this irrational approach to try and to believe that it's OK to leave your doors unlocked and not expect people to come in and raid your house. Look, most everybody, Maria, that you and I know have doors locked at night, they have alarm and security systems, and why do they do that? It's not because they're paranoid. It's because they're taking care of their family's safety. But when you don't protect your own country's borders, then you're not acting even rationally as a leader of your country in the same way that you would act in your own home. That doesn't make sense."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

You know, we were talking earlier with Michael Mukasey that the Obama administration spied on so many people. They spied on Lindsey Graham, they spied on Rand Paul. We know this now. The Intelligence Community told Lindsey Graham. He's out there saying he was also unmasked; why were they wanting him to be unmasked? All of this as Donald Trump is trying to push through, you know, his policies like the travel ban and getting constant resistance from the left, Governor."

America's a melting pot, that's what we've always been, but we've got people who come, and they're not willing to melt. They don't want to become part of us, they want us to change into them. And we can't do that, we're not going to do that. And we need to have a screening process, and that's what President Trump has said from the beginning."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I'll tell you, Maria. This is something that is, unfortunately, somewhat predictable in the sense that you have some of these simmering insular communities in places like great Britain, and France, and Belgium that we've seen over the last month and even years. And these attacks are becoming more and more regular. I think that there is a different approach that probably needs to be taken. Maybe Prime Minister May has finally recognized that. Although, I will say, she said they've shown far too much tolerance for extremism. My question would be, \"Why would you show any tolerance for Islamic extremism?\" Tolerance of evil is a crime and, so I think they need to view this much more toughly than they have been so far. For our part in the Congress, we do have a President that's taken a different approach, both in terms of being forward pressing against ISIS abroad but also concerned about our borders here at home. And I would say one thing we can do in the congress is to understand that terrorism is a big problem but it's part of a larger problem of this ideology of militant Islam, and that's nurtured by groups like the Muslim brotherhood, and we've been working in Congress to try to designate them as a terrorist organization because I think that would really go to solving the root of this problem, which is at its heart in ideological problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm really glad you brought this up because the Muslim brotherhood is a group that, to me, seems to have infiltrated the U.S. government. I mean, for some reason, the Muslim brotherhood keeps coming up because they are very involved in certain decision-making. I mean, do you believe the Muslim brotherhood is a terrorist organization?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Oh, without question. If you look at what they do, they're dedicated to promoting Islamic supremacism, they support societies based on Sharia law, you look at some of the radical clerics in places like Egypt and throughout the Middle East, they have deep roots with the Muslim brotherhood. And so, the brotherhood really provide, I think, the ideological framework that obviously does provide financial support and support of terrorism as well. But I would say that is kind of the foundation from which groups like ISIS are able to really wreak havoc."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, if you're so sure of this, why didn't President Obama ever called them a terrorist organization? Should President Trump becoming and calling out, \"The Muslim brotherhood is a terrorist organization.\" And what are the implications of that, Congressman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, we - I mean, we went round and round with the Obama administration. If you remember when the Muslim brotherhood government took over Egypt, the Obama administration backed the brotherhood. And when President Morsi government was deposed and President el-Sisi took over, Sisi is very much opposed to radical Islam. Many of us in Congress thought that Obama's administration should work with Sisi, but yet they really preferred to work with the brotherhood. And so, that, I think, is something I've never really understood. We in Congress can do legislation to designate the brotherhood. I do think that there is the ability of the executive to take some unilateral action, so I would definitely tell the President that that would be a good thing to do. I think it would be very clarifying."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "All right. So you want him to deem them as a terrorist organization, bottom line. Let me ask you this, being on the Foreign Affairs Committee, what kind of interaction or participation will the U.S. have with the U.K. in terms of combating terrorism?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we obviously -- they're a strong ally. We have to provide them with support. We do intelligence, logistics, military support. But one thing we do have to look at is there's a lot of focus, say, on the travel ban from the six countries, places like Somalia, which are obviously a high risk of terrorism. I think the issue, though, with this is we're seeing is there's a lot of homegrown terrorism in countries that are strong allies of ours. Great Britain, Belgium, France, some of these European countries. And so, a lot of times, those people can come into our country without even getting a Visa because they have a Visa waiver. So that's just something that we have to come to terms with and realize that this is a threat that's emanating from many places throughout the world."

I wouldn't have covered anyone certainly coming from the U.K. And I understand the need to be vigilant. Of course, it's actually because it looks like we could have more and more domestic homegrown terrorism, which is what happened in Manchester and we know for all the rest. We're not sure who all these people are right now. I am concerned though by the rhetoric already of what's coming out about this. We don't have all the answers. I think Teresa May struck exactly the right tone, as did the Mayor of London who Donald Trump then went and attacked on Twitter. But needlessly --"

And that's all that Donald Trump ceased on, to scare people, to scare us here at home, and I think that's unfortunate. I -"

We've just had these numerous occasions here in London, which every week we come here expecting to talk about something in the political system, and then all of a sudden we have these terrorist acts that are taking place. I mean, as a parent, I'd be scared to death to send my children out to a nightclub, and sooner or later, terrorism is exactly that. It creates terror. It makes people fearful. It's not about the numbers, it is certainly the numbers of those who were killed and wounded last night, that it creates a mindset, a the mindset is these people can basically disrupt the political process here in this country and elsewhere."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

How do you make that statement?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. I think - listen, I'm not sure what I would do if I was in that position. I - you know, being the mayor or in government office and these times is obviously difficult. You want to make sure that people feel as comfortable as possible but also to tell them, \"Hey, you can't just maybe walk around like you used to. And there is a dangerous threat out there.\" You know, and they just felt with this in Manchester as well, but I don't think that the right tactic is for the President of the United States, first of all, to attack another foreign leader which is what Sadiq Khan is - I mean, imagine if the day after 9/11, someone from another country went after the way that Giuliani was managing Bloomberg with - you know, eventually Bloomberg with managing the situation here. I don't think it's appropriate. I think that it sends the wrong message and I don't know why on a day like today, we need to be making more enemies than friends. I think the right tone was obviously Donald Trump's second tweet, which is we stand with you, we're here to support you in any way. But his first inclination was to prop up his travel ban. And the travel ban would have made no difference."
