The President's approval rating hitting a new low of 43 percent as his failures keep piling up. In Afghanistan, Joe left Americans behind. He is covering this up, this whole hostage crisis; still taking orders from the Taliban. The Commander- in-Chief launching a hideous drone strike. They hit the wrong target, killing kids instead of ISIS. Murders up everywhere, Biden's crime plan failed. Inflation is wiping out our wage gains. The recovery is weak and Biden hasn't crushed COVID. He promised to unite us, but his mandates are dividing us. France pulled their Ambassador. Russia hacked us to pieces. And OPEC told Joe to take a hike when he asked them to pump more oil. And now, even Biden's beloved mainstream media is admitting there is a problem.",

Liberals in the media pushing a fake claim that Border Patrol agents there were whipping Haitian migrants in Del Rio after these photos were released. The story was debunked within hours.

I have F.B.I. operators there and I have U.S. Marshals there because \"America's Most Wanted\" and this show works so well, because the public doesn't want to call the cops. So we got over 500 good tips that we turned over to the F.B.I., and you know, everybody has seen that photograph of him at the restaurant. I know that one of our viewers, you know called in and said it's the Carboni restaurant in Merida in Mexico in the Santa Lucia District. So we got terrific tips. People have been swamping our hotline, swamping our social media, texting us like crazy. We've got good tips of in Mexico from Mexico. My philosophy is that he had at least nine days of a head start while his world famous lawyer and the dirty Laundrie parents, you know, we're given fake red herrings. He was never in that swamp. So we got a lot of calls, I believe that wherever they took him in that camper and dropped him off, gave him a ton of money, probably burner phones that can't be traced, et cetera. I thought he was heading up the panhandle. He'd go across Alabama, Louisiana, get to Texas, with all that's going on, on the border, there is no border, so he could walk across into Mexico anywhere. So that picture makes some sense. We also got a ton of calls from the people that live along the Appalachian Trail, and we got a call from one of Gabby's best friends who said, yes, I don't know if the police know this, but Brian lived on the Appalachian Trail for three months out of -- with a tent in a backpack. So those tips we turned over, and that sounds very reasonable to me. But he got such a head start. And this family is so dirty and this lawyer, when he called the cops last week on that big red herring saying, oh, you know, the dirty Laundrie has called me up and said, you know, Brian went to the swamp and then we went out and found his car and we put a note in it because we're afraid and Brian would kill himself. And we said come home, Brian, and he didn't come home. So Thursday, we went and got the car. And so you know this -- their lawyer Bertolino calls the cops on Friday and say I'm going to do the right thing and tell you that they're so worried that he might be in the swamp. Another big red herring. So he left before Gabby's parents filed the missing person's report.",

The Appalachian Trail thing is very interesting. That's rugged terrain. He has experience up there, but that's a risk because again that's still in the United States.

      "sentences": "Another week, another creepy Cuomo in the news, this time though, CNN's Chris Cuomo. Shelley Ross, a former executive producer at ABC and CBS accusing Chris of sexual harassment at a party back in 2005. So in a \"New York Times\" op-ed, Ross claims Cuomo greeted her with a strong bear hug while lowering one hand, grab and squeeze her on the butt, upon greeting her at a bar. She says Cuomo told her quote, \"I can do this now that you're no longer my boss.\" Ross says she said, 'No, you can't,\" while pushing him off of her with her husband sitting right there as her witness. Chris Cuomo later sent her an e-mail apologizing to both of them for his actions. With a subject line reading, \"Now that I think of it, I am ashamed.\" Unquote. The email began with quote, \"Though, my hearty greeting was a function of being glad to see you, I apologize to you as well for even putting you in such a situation.\" He closed out the e-mail, with \"Next time, I will remember the lesson no matter how happy I am to see you.\" Not sure if that was the lesson. Cuomo is not denying the allegations, telling \"The New York Times\" it happened 16 years ago, and was not sexual in nature. He said, I apologize to her then and I mean it. CNN pretty much has their hands full at this point. Cuomo's buddy, Don Lemon was accused in a lawsuit of assaulting a man at a bar in 2019. And this all while the network is suffering from an ugly losing streak. Ratings at CNN have been abysmal since Trump left office. They rarely crack a million viewers during a single hour day and night. Joining me now are \"Outnumbered\" cohost and author of the upcoming book \"For Such a Time as This,\" Kayleigh McEnany. So Kayleigh, I wonder if he's going to use his brother's excuse, \"Hey, I'm just Italian.\" KAYLEIGH MCENANY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CO-HOST, \"OUTNUMBERED\": Yes, I think he will. Yes, I was just joking. In fact, he kind of went on in this e-mail. So he apologizes to her in it, and then goes on to kind of cover his legal tail feathers by saying, \"Hey, Christian Slater did this, but he had negative intent. I didn't have negative intent.\" He's a lawyer. Your intent doesn't matter, you grabbed someone's butt.",

They hit the wrong target, killing kids instead of ISIS. Murders up everywhere, Biden's crime plan failed. Inflation is wiping out our wage gains. The recovery is weak and Biden hasn't crushed COVID. He promised to unite us, but his mandates are dividing us. France pulled their Ambassador. Russia hacked us to pieces. And OPEC told Joe to take a hike when he asked them to pump more oil.

The Del Rio Bridge in Texas filled with thousands of illegal Haitians all week, third world conditions, garbage, sleeping and dirt in a hundred degree weather, suffering babies. It's awful. Biden let thousands of Haitian migrants into American and flew some back to Haiti, a few migrants biting I.C.E. officers on their flight home. Liberals in the media pushing a fake claim that Border Patrol agents there were whipping Haitian migrants in Del Rio after these photos were released. The story was debunked within hours.

The left wants to mislead with a fake crisis to distract from the real crisis they created down there.

The smell unbearably horrific. We've got porta-potties all behind us, some people weren't even using the porta-potties. It's just been remarkable to look at. You've probably seen all the drone shots, all the video. They basically went out into the wilderness here in Del Rio and found sticks, plants, whatever they could find to build structures here to get out of the sun. And there's dust blowing all over the place, every time a gust of wind picks up, there is dust picking up who knows what out there in the field. It truly is third world like conditions out here and local law enforcement are on record describing it that way. Third world like shanty town exactly as you said."

They will literally go down to the banks of the Rio Grande, get naked, strip down, and they'll just wash themselves in the river. We were watching that as they were crossing over on live television. They do have some washing stations here now, where they can wash their hands and that sort of thing. But other than that, we've seen moms getting their kids naked. They bring big buckets of water. They pour it over their kids, wash them down with some soap, and they just do it out in public like that."

We don't know where they're from, or what's in them. But the migrants were actually complaining to me that they feel it's not enough food. They only get one or two meals a day. They were asking us, as journalists, saying you need to find out why we don't have more food here."

      "utterance": "What's interesting about this camp is they were never detained. They're not in Border Patrol custody. They're not in custody until they get put on a bus and processed. So everybody you saw under this bridge here, they weren't detained. They were just hanging out. They were using the bridge for shade, and they just decided to start gathering there because Border Patrol was so overwhelmed. They're not in Border Patrol custody until they're actually with an agent, put onto a bus and taken to a processing center. And I think that's one of the things people didn't understand. I think they thought everybody was kind of like walled in here and they couldn't go anywhere. Absolutely not true. They would leave the camp and go through the bush -- the bushes and they would just walk back into Mexico whenever they wanted."

Again, Border agents who do the processing and the transport tell me the only ones who get tested are ones who are showing blatant symptoms that they might be exactly what I just did on accident because of all the dust out here -- coughing, fever, high temperature, that sort of a thing."

      "speaker": "MELUGIN",
      "utterance": "We have not. We were worried about that. There were a lot of whispers about that, which is why there's hundreds of Texas DPS troopers here. But what Border Patrol did was the first people they yanked out of this camp were largely the single adult males because they told us they were worried about that, too. What happens once the word leaks out that that first plane gets back to Haiti. They all have cell phones here. They all have brand name clothes, not all of them -- a lot of brand name clothes, soccer jerseys, that sort of thing. Nice cell phones. What happens when that first plane gets repatriated back to Haiti and they start texting people under the bridge, we got sent back, you're going to get deported."

You know, he is somebody who has been very outspoken as being against autocrats, autocracies, dictators, but what he essentially did was act as judge, jury, and executioner for these Customs and Border Patrol agents on horseback. How can they expect to have any kind of fair outcome to an investigation when the President of the United States has already declared their guilt and that they will be punished? And the bigger issue here that this points to, which is one that that we all need to be concerned about is that if we are no longer a country of laws, if we are no longer a country where we know we will be presumed innocent, unless proven guilty, then we don't have a democracy and that's the increasing feeling that a lot of us have is that we are losing our democracy, and moving closer and closer to what essentially is an autocracy."

We saw this kind of hoax, again, with Russia, when the Clinton campaign plants fake news about Trump and Russia. That lasted years, that was a hoax. This type of disinformation is so dangerous to the country, I feel like they got away with it so many times that's part of their playbook, and they are going to keep doing it over and over again. Until when? When are they ever going to stop?"

They are acting in their own selfish interest to preserve their power, their position, or money or whatever their selfish drive is. They are unwilling to sacrifice their interest for the interests of the country, and they have no business being in positions of leadership at any level in our society, because who suffers as a result of this? It's the American people. It's our democracy. And they don't care about the cost and the toll that that takes, and this is why leadership that puts service above self, that puts the interests of the American people in our country first is so critical and essential, especially now."

How bad is it now? JOHN WALSH, HOST OF \"IN PURSUIT WITH JOHN WALSH\": Well, Jesse, before I answer that question, I want to say one thing. The White House owes the Mountain Border Patrol an apology. I've ridden with that Border Patrol seven times. I live on a horse ranch. I raise and train polo horses. I play competitive polo all over the world. So, I know what I'm talking about. Those are reins, they're not whips. The photographer that took the pictures has come out in public and said they have -- I did not see them hitting one illegal alien, and the President is causing -- and you know, I'm a centrist guy. I'm a centrist guy. The President is humiliating the Border Patrol. It's to defuse the fact that there were 20,000 Haitians under that bridge, Jesse, and the Border Patrol I've ridden at night with those guys. They risk their lives. It's one of the worst jobs in law enforcement. The White House owes them an apology. Bit time."

      "utterance": "They're risking their lives. Well, I'll tell you what, on Wednesday night, my show \"In Pursuit with John Walsh\" you know, I have my own hotline. I have F.B.I. operators there and I have U.S. Marshals there because \"America's Most Wanted\" and this show works so well, because the public doesn't want to call the cops. So we got over 500 good tips that we turned over to the F.B.I., and you know, everybody has seen that photograph of him at the restaurant. I know that one of our viewers, you know called in and said it's the Carboni restaurant in Merida in Mexico in the Santa Lucia District. So we got terrific tips. People have been swamping our hotline, swamping our social media, texting us like crazy. We've got good tips of in Mexico from Mexico. My philosophy is that he had at least nine days of a head start while his world famous lawyer and the dirty Laundrie parents, you know, we're given fake red herrings. He was never in that swamp. So we got a lot of calls, I believe that wherever they took him in that camper and dropped him off, gave him a ton of money, probably burner phones that can't be traced, et cetera. I thought he was heading up the panhandle. He'd go across Alabama, Louisiana, get to Texas, with all that's going on, on the border, there is no border, so he could walk across into Mexico anywhere. So that picture makes some sense. We also got a ton of calls from the people that live along the Appalachian Trail, and we got a call from one of Gabby's best friends who said, yes, I don't know if the police know this, but Brian lived on the Appalachian Trail for three months out of -- with a tent in a backpack. So those tips we turned over, and that sounds very reasonable to me. But he got such a head start. And this family is so dirty and this lawyer, when he called the cops last week on that big red herring saying, oh, you know, the dirty Laundrie has called me up and said, you know, Brian went to the swamp and then we went out and found his car and we put a note in it because we're afraid and Brian would kill himself. And we said come home, Brian, and he didn't come home. So Thursday, we went and got the car. And so you know this -- their lawyer Bertolino calls the cops on Friday and say I'm going to do the right thing and tell you that they're so worried that he might be in the swamp. Another big red herring. So he left before Gabby's parents filed the missing person's report."

The Appalachian Trail thing is very interesting. That's rugged terrain. He has experience up there, but that's a risk because again that's still in the United States. I would bet -- I would bet he's out of the country by now, which makes it even harder for the Feds to track him. Thirty seconds left, anything you want to say to the audience that's still looking."

      "utterance": "Another week, another creepy Cuomo in the news, this time though, CNN's Chris Cuomo. Shelley Ross, a former executive producer at ABC and CBS accusing Chris of sexual harassment at a party back in 2005. So in a \"New York Times\" op-ed, Ross claims Cuomo greeted her with a strong bear hug while lowering one hand, grab and squeeze her on the butt, upon greeting her at a bar. She says Cuomo told her quote, \"I can do this now that you're no longer my boss.\" Ross says she said, 'No, you can't,\" while pushing him off of her with her husband sitting right there as her witness. Chris Cuomo later sent her an e-mail apologizing to both of them for his actions. With a subject line reading, \"Now that I think of it, I am ashamed.\" Unquote. The email began with quote, \"Though, my hearty greeting was a function of being glad to see you, I apologize to you as well for even putting you in such a situation.\" He closed out the e-mail, with \"Next time, I will remember the lesson no matter how happy I am to see you.\" Not sure if that was the lesson. Cuomo is not denying the allegations, telling \"The New York Times\" it happened 16 years ago, and was not sexual in nature. He said, I apologize to her then and I mean it. CNN pretty much has their hands full at this point. Cuomo's buddy, Don Lemon was accused in a lawsuit of assaulting a man at a bar in 2019. And this all while the network is suffering from an ugly losing streak. Ratings at CNN have been abysmal since Trump left office. They rarely crack a million viewers during a single hour day and night. Joining me now are \"Outnumbered\" cohost and author of the upcoming book \"For Such a Time as This,\" Kayleigh McEnany.

In fact, he kind of went on in this e-mail. So he apologizes to her in it, and then goes on to kind of cover his legal tail feathers by saying, \"Hey, Christian Slater did this, but he had negative intent.

      "utterance": "And we'll tell you why."
    },

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "More information later. It's a tease."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEHAR",
      "utterance": "We will tell you why in a couple of minutes. So, shall I introduce the Vice President?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEHAR",
      "utterance": "Okay. So Vice President --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "No."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEHAR",
      "utterance": "Okay. Shall we dance? Let's do a tap dance."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "What a mess. Joining us now is FOX News 24/7 Headlines reporter Carley Shimkus. That was nuts. CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: Yes, okay. Well, it ended up being an abbreviated interview. But the Vice President still had time to sneak in that lie. That Border Patrol is treating Haitian migrants like slaves. There's always time to falsely accuse someone of racism, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That's right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "As for COVID though, I think that Joy Behar responded to this situation accurately because she said that Ana Navarro and Sunny Hostin are going to be okay because they're vaccinated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "They are vaxxed, so they had breakthroughs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Yes. Exactly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "The day the VP was supposed to be on set."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Yes. So vaccinated people, if that's the perk of the vaccine, if you get a breakthrough infection, you are most likely going to be okay. You don't need to protect vaccinated people as the Vice President had previously said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "But Kamala can't catch a break. I mean, first, right, she goes to Central America, that blows up. Then she goes to Vietnam during the Afghan hostage crisis, and now this. She can't even skate through \"The View.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "No, well, I think it was missed opportunity by her because she is fully vaccinated as well. So she was supposed to be in studio. She should have said, you know what, I'm fully vaccinated, I trust the vaccine. I'm going to keep doing the interview in studio. They put her in like a closet or something to do the interview."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, she's going to come out of the closet, all right, and that's not a reference to anything."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Literally, if she was in a closet, she is walking out the door."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That's not a reference to anything. All right, Carley, I wanted to show you some video of Conor McGregor. I know you're a big UFC fan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Huge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Huge. You should even know who Conor McGregor is probably. Here he is throwing out the first pitch. Oh my god. No, so he's lefty, and he is Irish. Now, here's my opinion. This is no offense to the people of Ireland. They don't have baseband there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "They don't have baseball, nope."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "And they don't have football, so they don't throw things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Also, he is wearing the tightest suit I've ever seen in my life."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, and he's wearing like a million dollar watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "But, Jesse, by all means make fun of Conor McGregor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "You know what, I apologize, Conor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "It's really smart."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "You know, with all due respect, that was a great pitch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "I like Conor McGregor because he does the Tunnel 2 Tower commercials."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That's true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "So he's okay in my book."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So you're kissing his butt also."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, I just think, I appreciate --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Both of us kissing Connor's butt."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "I just appreciate the fact -- I think that I get a pass if I make fun of Conor McGregor because I'm a girl, but --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, I know, he is going to knock me out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Once again, Jesse takes the horns."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right, he is not going to throw a ball, he is going to throw a punch right here. Most punchable face in TV."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "You have him on a reach. You don't have that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Even you say that. Thank you, and we're paying you to say. All right, we have video of gorillas. Viewer warning if kids are here, be warned. This is at the Bronx Zoo, Carley. You've been investigating this video very thoroughly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "I have not, one hundred percent haven't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, well, so they got a little show. There was --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Oh my god."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "A show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Why are you doing this to me?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "At the Bronx Zoo. Children were there. And the funny thing is, I was just at the Bronx Zoo last weekend. I didn't see this, and I paid a lot of money. And these gorillas didn't do this when I was there. But the week I leave that I'm not there, they do this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, all of your viewers just saw it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "We gave them a warning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Of all the viral videos in the world, you put me on set and show that. I saw a viral video, Jesse this week of a puppy becoming best friends with a cow. We could have done that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Look, it is consensual."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "No, we don't need to look at it again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "This was consensual."

      "utterance": "Oh my god, can we talk about the infrastructure bill?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Can we talk about COVID?"

    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "I am walking off set."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

Love you guys so much. And I hope they didn't watch that last segment -- for everyone's sake. That's all for tonight.
