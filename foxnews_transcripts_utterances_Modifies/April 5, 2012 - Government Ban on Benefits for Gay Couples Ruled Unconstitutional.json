If it's a judge, as in Massachusetts, who was under a ruling of a 4-3 majority of the high court, I think that is truly illegitimate and undemocratic. So I don't want to see it undone in the state like California where it passed, where a ban on it was approved by referendum. Judges ought to stay out of this in the same way we learned lesson on abortion. We don't want the courts ruling for the whole country. Let each state decide according to its own societal norms and habits."

And the correct answer is that in Aspen this week, the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates said that he not only supports but almost invites, welcomes, demands a U.S. attack on the Iranian nuclear facilities because, he says, it is impossible to imagine living in deterrents or containments on Iran and even says without nukes it's still aggressive and cannot be contained. And I think he speaks for a lot of Arab states in saying that, and he said it openly and publicly."

I think the most underreported story is the fact that Jim Traficant cannot make a comeback and will not be on the ballot in November, a former Democratic House member who just got out of prison. Why? Because everybody cared about LeBron James moving to the Heat. So Cleveland, Ohio, lost two --"

Last night in Portland, Oregon, Vice President Joe Biden went to a fundraiser for freshman Democratic congressman named Kurt Schraeder who has been a bitter critic of the war of Afghanistan and voted to cut off funding to the troops. And Vice President Joe Biden serves under President Obama who committed troops to Afghanistan and made a big deal about winning the war there, said to Congressman Schraeder \"I encourage you, old buddy, to speak out.\" It's really wonderful that the vice president encouraging undermining of the president's war policy."

If you do the calculations, in the end, the moratorium will expire by the time the government has lost all of its appeal. So in other words the government will win because the moratorium will remain in place, and essentially no one will be drilling knowing that another hearing is coming up."

Obama administration general attitude towards contract and rules and regulations is there is an oil spill, we want to change everything, so we'll declare a moratorium. You really don't have the authority to do that unless there is a law that permits you to, and it turns out in this case a federal judge says there isn't."

It certainly was the biggest story in terms of public interest.
